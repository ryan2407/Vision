<introtext><![CDATA['But let endurance and steadfastness and patience have full play and do a thorough work...' James 1:4 AMP<br /><br /><p>Life is lived in seasons; if you don't understand that, you'll be constantly frustrated. Some seasons are for sowing, some for waiting and some for reaping. Sometimes you have a short, intense burst of growth followed by a longer period of stabilising and testing. 'But what about my problems?' you ask. Pray for a miracle, but don't be disappointed if your answer comes through gradual change. Over time, a steady stream of water will erode the hardest rock and turn giant boulders into pebbles.</p>
<p>You may feel frustrated with the pace of your progress, but God is never in a hurry. He took eighty years to prepare Moses, including forty in the wilderness. For 14,600 days Moses wondered, 'Is it time yet?' But God kept saying, 'No.' Contrary to popular psychologists, quick-success seminars, and the 'no-money-down' guy on TV who made a fortune in property sales, there are no easy steps to maturity. When God makes a mushroom He does it overnight; when He makes a giant oak He takes a hundred years. God sets the schedule, not us.</p>
<p>When you get discouraged about how far you still have to go, stop and look back at how far God has brought you. Weren't there times when you just wanted to quit? Yet He never stopped loving you, believing in you and developing you. 'If we are faithless, He remains faithful...' (2 Timothy 2:13 NKJV) Years ago people wore a popular button with the letters PBPGINFWMY ('Please be patient, God is not finished with me yet'). And He's not finished with you!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Tell the Israelites to designate the cities of refuge...' Joshua 20:2 NIV<br /><br /><p>In Old Testament times, if you killed someone by accident, their family had the right to take your life in return. So God arranged six 'cities of refuge', three on either side of the Jordan River so that, no matter where you were, you had access to God's mercy and protection. You just ran to one of those cities, told the town elders your story, and they were required to take you in. The only stipulation was that you stayed in that city until the high priest died. When that happened, you were free to return to your family and take back everything you'd lost.</p>
<p>Can you see a spiritual parallel here? Jesus Christ is called '...the High Priest of our confession.' (Hebrews 3:1 NAS) When you run to Him for refuge, you need only confess your sins. There, at the point of faith, you are forgiven, viewed as 'a new creation', and placed in God's protective custody. Just as 'the avenger of blood' couldn't enter the city of refuge, Satan cannot cross 'the blood line' and hurt you either. When Jesus cried from the cross, '...It is finished...' (John 19:30 NIV), all your sins from the womb to the tomb were paid for in full. And because Christ your great High Priest died and rose again, He will restore back to you everything you lost as the result of sin's power in your life.</p>
<p>Max Lucado puts it this way: 'If there were a thousand steps between us and God, He will take all but one. He will leave the final one to us. The choice is ours.' So come to God's city of refuge today.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Don't let anyone look down on you because...' 1 Timothy 4:12 NIV<br /><br /><p>Try as you may, you will never fulfil a dream that is not your own. Stop and think about your personal history. How have your plans, goals and desires been influenced by others? Is it possible your dreams are the result of who your parents think you are? Who think you are? Who you wish you were? Or are they the result of who you really are and what God meant you to be? You will live the life for which God created you, only after you figure this out. When a dream is right for you and you are right for a dream, the two cannot be separated from each other. TS Eliot said, 'Whatever you think, be sure it is what you think; whatever you want, be sure it is what you want.' Paul told Timothy, 'Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young.' Evidently certain people in the early church thought Timothy was too young and inexperienced to be in leadership. But Paul thought differently; and so did God. Cecil G. Osborne writes, 'The young child has no clear picture of himself. He sees himself only in the mirror of his parents' evaluation of himself... A child who's told repeatedly that he is a bad boy, or is lazy, or no good, or stupid, or shy, or clumsy will tend to act out this picture which the parent or some other authority figure has given him.' Let God, and God alone, tell you who you are and what you should do. Get His opinion, for in the end it's the only one that counts!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The Lord does not look at the things man looks at...' 1 Samuel 16:7 NIV<br /><br /><p>David's father didn't think he was qualified to be Israel's next king. So when Samuel came looking for a successor to King Saul, he presented his oldest son Eliab, who was a general in the army. Samuel was impressed. '...Samuel saw Eliab and thought, &quot;Surely the Lord's anointed stands here...&quot; But the Lord said to Samuel, &quot;Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. The Lord does not look at the things man looks at. Man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.&quot;' (1 Samuel 16:6-7 NIV) When it comes to your life's calling, only one opinion counts - God's! In order to fulfil his destiny, David had to overcome his family's opinion of him. John Maxwell writes, 'Any time you see people pursuing a midlife career change, you can be almost certain that they have been living someone else's dream and lost their way.' Nobel Prize winner for literature Joseph Brodsky observed, 'One's task consists first of all in mastering a life that is one's own, not imposed or prescribed from without, no matter how noble its appearance may be. For each of us is issued but one life, and we know full well how it all ends. It would be regrettable to squander this one chance on someone else's appearance, someone else's experience.' It's not too late to become what God wants you to be, and do what He wants you to do. If you've been living somebody else's dream, ask God for a dream of your own and He will give it to you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Blessed are those...who walk according to the law of the Lord.' Psalm 119:1 NIV<br /><br /><p>Psalm 119, the longest psalm in the Bible, with 176 verses, is a love song to God's law. But you'll never understand the Psalmist's enthusiasm about a moral code until you think about children playing near a cliff's edge. Without a fence, they're always in danger, never able to relax. Because of the fence, they can play freely and without fear. God's law is a safety fence that brings incredible freedom. Of course, it's only a matter of time until a child starts to wonder what's on the other side of the fence. If he or she doesn't know or trust the fence builder, they hop over the fence and fall off the cliff. And if they're fortunate enough to survive, they come back saying like the Psalmist, 'Before I was afflicted I went astray, but now I obey Your Word.' (Psalm 119:67 NIV)</p>
<p>But there's more to this story. God's law is not only a safety fence, it's also a mirror that shows us we can't live up to His standards without His help. Only when we realise that the fence builder loves us and wants the best for us, are we happy to stay on the right side of the fence. The Ten Commandments begin with the words, 'I am the Lord your God...' (Exodus 20:2 NIV), therefore don't kill, steal, etc. God speaks about the relationship first, then about the rules that govern it.</p>
<p>The Christian life is not a question of rules or relationship, but rules based on relationship. It's morality because of intimacy with God. When you understand that, you'll trust whatever God asks of you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Don't be hard on your children...' Ephesians 6:4 CEV<br /><br /><p>Parenting children between puberty and young adulthood draws on every bit of grace and wisdom you can muster. Your effort to train them - and their drive for independence - is a tug of war that frustrates you both. The outcome depends largely on which of three classic parenting styles you follow. Though parents want the best for their kids, some styles work well and some don't. Let's examine each.</p>
<p><em>The </em><em>authoritarian style:</em>in its extreme form these parents announce, 'I make the rules. You follow them! Don't question me, obey me.' Compliance at all times, respect for authority, traditional values and hard work are demanded. 'There's only one opinion here: mine. All other opinions are considered mutiny!' Authoritarians typically don't tolerate losing face, don't apologise or admit fault. They are blame-oriented, legalistic, judgmental, shaming and belittling; expecting, yet exposing the worst in their kids. By coming down hard they provoke confrontations; punishment can be harsh and unreasonable.</p>
<p>But there are also pluses with this style: the rules are clear; it establishes chain of command, speeds up the child's response, is effective with very young and insecure kids and can be useful in crisis times. However it may inhibit a child's healthy individuation process, retard mature communication, promote social dependence and incompetence, discourage decision-making and initiative-taking skills; it may also elevate social anxiety and depression, increase the likelihood of your child being intimidated and bullied. Authoritarians may maintain military-style discipline, but they seldom rear happy, healthy, creative kids!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...His father...had never disciplined him at any time...' 1 Kings 1:6 NLT<br /><br /><p><em>T</em><em>he </em><em>permissive style:</em> This parent typically has few rigid rules, and explains to the child their standards and decisions. The child's opinions and ideas are heard and included in decision-making. Reason is used rather than force. These parents talk and discuss perspectives rather than using threats. Often, few household responsibilities are demanded of the child, denying them the opportunity to contribute and learn to function co-operatively. The parent is a 'facilitator' and 'resource person'. In extreme cases children 'self-regulate' in areas such as bedtime, dating, the car, friends, dress, the internet, music and curfew.</p>
<p>What are the pluses of this parenting style? Kids usually adore permissive parents, feel close to and safe with them. These parents never belittle their kids, their ideas and perspectives, nor shame and embarrass or make them feel like failures. Rather, they encourage their thinking, innovation, initiative, social and communication skills. They model forgiveness, patience and flexibility. But let's look at the minuses of this style. Parental guidance is usually missing, and low demand for household responsibilities leaves kids unprepared for life in the real world. They lack the structure and boundaries needed for relationships and the workplace, and have difficulty in accepting the word, 'No!' The absence of a parental role model for leadership and decision-making leads to motivational deficit, requiring someone to 'jump-start' them to get them going.</p>
<p>This style provides many healthy, positive characteristics, producing kids who may be happy, but suffer losses productively and relationally.</p>

Proverbs 22:6 AMP<br /><br /><p><em>T</em><em>he </em><em>'coach/trainer' style:</em> These parents provide direction by teaching and example, modelling respect, responsibility, safety, trust and maturity in how they treat the child. They are 'in charge', yet always preparing the child for the 'in charge' role in due time, delegating authority to the child when they are ready. Respect, not intimidation, is used to train kids, understanding that a respectful child will follow the rules even in your absence. Responsibility is modelled by the parent's refusal to make (or accept) excuses. Independence is encouraged by how well children handle limits and controls.</p>
<p>The parent is solution-focused, not problem-focused; forgiving; acknowledging their own failures; and directing kids to the future, not the past. These parents choose their battles wisely, avoiding damaging arguments but holding the line in matters of faith, respect, trust, honesty, responsibility and consequences. Mistakes are used to teach, not shame. Such parents are transparent, admitting their own shortcomings and apologising when it's necessary. The rules are clear, consistent and fair. They don't issue repeated 'warnings', and consequences apply without exception. Administering discipline is done with nurture, respect and reassurance.</p>
<p>What are the pluses of the style? It provides kids with a safe, protective, loving environment for learning, while you, the parent, model respect, responsibility, trust and autonomy. Movement toward adulthood is a joint parent-child project. What are the minuses of this style? None!</p>

<title><![CDATA[Focus on Your Opportunities, Not Your Rights]]></title>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Whatever is right...think about [it]...' Philippians 4:8 NIV<br /><br /><p>People and circumstances don't determine your attitude, you do! To win in life you must learn to focus on your opportunities, not your rights. Paul wrote from a prison cell, 'Whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable - if anything is excellent or praiseworthy - think about such things.' Clearly, circumstances could lock Paul in, but they couldn't keep him down.</p>
<p>One of the biggest causes of discontent is our constant struggle to 'secure our rights'. Have you been wronged? Do you feel like you haven't received a fair shake? That's because you live in an imperfect world. And as long as you do, you won't see a time when everything you do is justly rewarded. So you're faced with a decision: Are you going to spend your time and energy on what should have been, or get over it and focus on what can be? Even when truth and justice are on your side, you may never be able to right all your wrongs. But ultimately God will, so leave it in His hands. Continually 'fighting for your rights' just makes you angry and resentful, because these destructive emotions sap your energy and make you negative. And besides, when you focus on your rights you're usually looking backward. You can't make progress when you're facing the wrong way!</p>
<p>Only when you focus in the right direction will you move in the right direction. Now this doesn't mean you won't experience pain; it just means you choose to forgive, and zero in on what you can control: your attitudes and your opportunities.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Do not be unbelieving, but believing.' John 20:27 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says: 'Now Thomas...one of the twelve, was not with them when Jesus came. The other disciples therefore said to him, &quot;We have seen the Lord.&quot; So he said to them, &quot;Unless I see in His hands...and put my finger into the print of the nails, and put my hand into His side, I will not believe.&quot; And after eight days His disciples were again inside, and Thomas with them. Jesus came, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, &quot;Peace to you!&quot; Then He said to Thomas, &quot;Reach your finger here, and look at My hands; and reach your hand here, and put it into My side. Do not be unbelieving, but believing.&quot; And Thomas answered and said to Him, &quot;My Lord and my God!&quot;' (John 20:24-28 NKJV)</p>
<p>The miracle in this story is not that Christ could walk through a closed door and suddenly materialise in their presence. That's impressive. What's even more impressive is that Christ would show up to talk to a doubter! The fact is, Jesus was not even in the room eight days earlier when Thomas expressed his doubts to the other disciples. But 'The Lord knows the thoughts of man...' (Psalm 94:11 NKJV) Some of us would have looked at Thomas and thought, 'Write him off, he's not qualified to be a disciple.' Not Jesus. He recognised an honest heart and a seeking soul, and He showed up to answer his questions.</p>
<p>Your doubts don't disqualify you! Just take them to the Lord in prayer, and when you leave His presence you'll be saying, 'My Lord and my God.'</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...This has been your manner from your youth...' Jeremiah 22:21 NKJV<br /><br /><p>You will discover that successful people like Peter and John are always creatures of habit. 'Peter and John went...to the temple at the hour of prayer...' (Acts 3:1 NKJV) And this day God used them to bring healing to a man who'd been crippled from birth. As a result, 3,000 people were won to Christ and joined the church. But it all began with a daily habit.</p>
<p>Your habits determine your future. Psychologists estimate that 90 per cent of your behaviour is habitual - 90 per cent! Habits can help you do things more quickly and remove mental clutter so that you can think about more important things. But they can also be detrimental and lead you in a direction that is out of line with your dream. Think about the person who dreams of winning an Olympic gold medal in the marathon, but smokes two packs of cigarettes a day. Or the person who dreams of being a fashion model, but eats 6,000 calories a day without exercising. Or the business person who dreams of leading a winning team, but habitually insults and belittles employees. Habits have a cumulative effect, and often the results don't show up until much later in life. If your habits are bad, by the time the damage is evident it's too late to alter your results.</p>
<p>That's why you need to take control of your habits, now. Unless you are willing to confront the habits you need to change, and institute new ones, you can stand on 101 different Scriptures, claiming God's promises, but you'll get nowhere.</p>

<alias><![CDATA[stop-condemning-yourself]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Who is he who condemns?...' Romans 8:34 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Stop being mad at yourself because you're still struggling in certain areas. When it comes to an area of your life that needs improvement, be concerned about it, but not consumed with it. You are always going to be working on something, so learn to separate your 'who' from your 'do'. Who you are in Christ is a settled issue. 'There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus...' (Romans 8:1 NKJV) Because God has chosen to see you 'in Christ', you are always acceptable to Him and you always have access to Him.</p>
<p>Your 'who' is not based on your 'do'. Your 'who' determines your salvation, your 'do' determines your future rewards in Heaven. God is not condemning you, you are condemning yourself! God will convict you, and when you repent of sin He will cleanse you, but He will never condemn you. Satan does that. You do that to yourself. But God never will. 'Who is he who condemns? It is Christ who died, and furthermore is also risen, who is even at the right hand of God, who makes intercession for us.' (Romans 8:34 NKJV) Every time you fail, Christ your advocate offers His atoning blood to cover your sin. As a result, God sees you as 'accepted'.</p>
<p>Stop comparing yourself with somebody else. You are you, and you will never be them. We are all equal in Christ! So when somebody condemns you, stand on this Scripture: 'Surely the Lord God will help me; who is he who will condemn me? Indeed they will all grow old like a garment; the moth will eat them up.' (Isaiah 50:9 NKJV)</p>

<alias><![CDATA[do-you-need-a-breakthrough]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...They called the name of that place Baal Perazim.' 1 Chronicles 14:11 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says: 'The Philistines...made a raid on the Valley of Rephaim. And David inquired of God saying, &quot;Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will You deliver them into my hand?&quot; The Lord said to him, &quot;Go up, for I will deliver them into your hand.&quot; So they went up to Baal Perazim, and David defeated them there. Then David said, &quot;God has broken through my enemies by my hand like a breakthrough of water.&quot; Therefore they called the name of that place Baal Perazim [which means breaking through].' (1 Chronicles 14:9-11 NKJV) To get a breakthrough in your life you must do what David did: (1) <em>He reminded himself that 'the Lord had made him king</em>' (1 Chronicles 14:2). You must remember Who called you, and Whose spirit lives within you. God called David, and He's called you too. When you know that, you won't let the enemy put you down or push you around. (2) <em>He enquired of the Lord</em>, 'Shall I go up against the Philistines?' (1 Chronicles 14:10 NKJV) Have you talked it over with the Lord? God doesn't respond to your need, He responds to your obedience. When you've obeyed Him, you'll win. (3) <em>He gave God the credit</em>: 'God has broken through my enemies.' (1 Chronicles 14:11 NKJV) Sometimes God will do it for you, other times He will do it through you. That's why you must hear from Him before you make a move. You can't do God's part, and He won't do yours. It's not just a matter of 'doing something', it's a matter of doing what God tells you! When you do, you'll get a breakthrough.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Benaiah...went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion.' 2 Samuel 23:20 NIV<br /><br /><p>Benaiah was one of King David's 'mighty men'. His résumé reads: 'Benaiah...was a valiant fighter... He...went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion.' That's what is called 'courage with cold feet'. The greatest courage of all is showing courage in the face of fear. Someone said, 'Courage is just fear that has said its prayers.' When you know you have heard clearly from God, you are filled with faith in that moment. It puts steel in your spine. But then, as you move out in faith, you encounter the lions of fear. 'What if this doesn't work? What if I fail? What will people say?' Suddenly you're having an attack of the 'what ifs'.</p>
<p>Mark Twain said, 'Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear, not absence of fear.' You have to decide whether you're going to become a warrior-or a worrier. There's no middle ground. When you're faced with a health crisis, a family crisis or a financial crisis, you either choose to stand on God's Word and fight, or give in to worry. This side of Heaven we will never fully understand why bad things happen to good people. But we know that God is good-all the time!</p>
<p>So when bad things happen, you will either give in to fear and allow it to destroy your peace and well-being, or you will become a warrior armed with God's Word and rise up against it. When fear threatens to engulf your mind, stand up with the Psalmist and say, 'Whenever I am afraid, I will trust in You.' (Psalm 56:3 NKJV)</p>

Don't stop until you have more than you think you need. Now quantify everything you can. Make it measurable. Don't worry about how you'll get there yet. Be bold. Be audacious. Dream big! The next step is to state your dream succinctly in writing... don't expect to be able to do the whole process in one sitting. For most people that's not possible. Instead, give it time. You may want to get away for a retreat to start the process. If you can separate yourself from your usual surroundings or routine for a couple of days, you may be able to get most of the work done. Otherwise, take a day to dream, and then come back to the process for a few hours at a time in subsequent weeks. Don't forget your goal: make your dream as clear and specific as possible. Then keep it in front of you so that you can see it every day.'</p>
<p>A God-given dream will always look bigger than you. Jericho looked big to Joshua. Goliath looked big to David. But no dream is bigger than God! Don't be impatient: 'The vision is...for an appointed time...wait for it.' (Habakkuk 2:3 NKJV) And don't get discouraged by circumstances. 'I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living.' (Psalm 27:13 KJV)</p>
<p>Trust God and you will see your dream fulfilled.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Don't worry about anything...' Philippians 4:6 NLT<br /><br /><p>Identify the source of your worries. Did you grow up in a fear-filled family, always feeling insecure, never measuring up, and never hearing words of affirmation and approval? Are you listening to the prophets of doom, hearing only about what's wrong, and how much worse it's going to get? What's the source of your anxiety? What feeds your worries? Until you can express your fears you can't expel them. Putting your worries into words disrobes them. They look weak and silly standing there naked.</p>
<p>In his novel <em>Life of Pi</em>, Yann Martel's main character, Pi, finds himself adrift at sea on a lifeboat with a 200 kg Bengal tiger as his companion. While on the lifeboat, Pi begins to analyse his fears, both of the sea and the tiger. He gives this counsel: 'You must fight hard to express your [fear]. You must fight hard to shine the light of words upon it. Because if you don't, if your fear becomes a wordless darkness that you avoid, perhaps even manage to forget, you open yourself to further attacks of fear because you never truly fought the opponent who defeated you.'</p>
<p>So pull back the curtain and expose your fears, each and every one. They're creatures of darkness and can't stand the sunlight. Financial fears, relationship fears, professional fears, safety fears - call them out in prayer. Drag them out and make them stand before God. How do you do that? 'Don't worry about anything; instead, pray about everything... Then you will experience God's peace, which exceeds anything we can understand...' (Philippians 4:6-7 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I tell you not to worry about everyday life...' Matthew 6:25 NLT<br /><br /><p>Jesus said, 'Therefore I tell you, stop being perpetually uneasy (anxious and worried) about your life...' (Matthew 6:25 AMP) Now, the Lord is not condemning you for having a legitimate concern about your responsibilities. No, what He's condemning is having a mindset that keeps leaving Him out of the equation, or turning to Him only as a last resort. Destructive anxiety subtracts God from the future, faces uncertainties with no faith, tallies up the challenges of today and tomorrow, and forgets to include God's promises and His faithfulness.</p>
<p>Jesus told His disciples, 'I tell you not to worry about everyday life - whether you have enough.' Note the words 'whether you have enough'. That's what we worry about, isn't it? Shortfalls, sickness, redundancies, economic downturns. Faced with the feeding of 5,000 people, the disciples had the same worry. Philip did an audit: '...Eight months' wages would not buy enough bread for each one to have a bite!' (John 6:7 NIV) How do you suppose Jesus felt in that moment? Standing next to them was the solution to their problems, but they didn't go to Him until their backs were to the wall and they had no answers. In their hands five loaves and two fishes looked like nothing. Yet in His hands it was more than enough to feed the multitude and solve their problem. As the bread kept multiplying, surely they must each have come to the point where they said, 'Lord, why did I ever doubt You?'</p>
<p>Let your problems drive you into the arms of Jesus. And when you get there, stay there!</p>

<title><![CDATA[The Barriers Are in Your Mind]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[the-barriers-are-in-your-mind]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...He has sent me to proclaim freedom...recovery...release...favour.' Luke 4:18-19 NIV<br /><br /><p>Jesus said that He came to bring freedom to those held captive by destructive habits, to give sight to those who are spiritually blind, to lift up those who've been put down, and to announce that the time of God's favour toward us has come.</p>
<p>If you look closely at ancient maritime maps you will see places which are marked with pictures of dragons. Sailors who explored the world wouldn't go there. Were the dragons real? No, but they were real in the minds of the sailors. Picture a barracuda in a big tank at Sea World in Florida. A glass barrier divides one half from the other. Each time the barracuda tries to swim from one end of the tank to the other, he bumps into it. And here's an interesting thing: even when the barrier's taken away, the barracuda still won't swim beyond that point. Why? Because the barrier is in his mind! Satan will place barriers in your mind and say you can't go beyond a certain point in life; you can't dream beyond it, or reach beyond it. Don't believe him! Jesus said Satan is a liar and the father of lies. But a lie is as effective as the truth if you believe it and act on it.</p>
<p>With God there are no limits, just unlimited power. The Bible is filled with stories of little people, limited people, lack-lustre people, and, in some cases, low-life people who penetrated the barriers beyond which they thought they couldn't go, and God used them to do amazing things. And He can do that for you too.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...What must I do to be saved?' Acts 16:30 NIV<br /><br /><p>After her first flight, someone asked an elderly lady what she thought of being on a plane. She said, 'It was ok, but I never did put my whole weight on it.' And we do the same when we refuse to place our trust on the finished work of Christ. Most major religions answer the question, 'What must I do to be saved?' by handing you a book of rules you must keep to get to Heaven. A lot of us try and give up in discouragement. Satan doesn't lead you away from God's grace - he tries to make you earn it instead.</p>
<p>When asked, 'What must I do to be saved?' Paul didn't say, 'Work harder, pray longer, give more, and be more moral.' No, he said, 'Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved...' (Acts 16:31 NIV) Believing is the root of the tree we call salvation; behaving is the fruit that grows on it. We don't do good works to be saved - our good works are just an expression of love and gratitude to the One who already saved us. The Bible says, '...We should be holy and without blame...' (Ephesians 1:4 NKJV) Without blame? That's an impossible standard! The only way that will happen is if God takes the righteousness of Christ and credits it to our account. And He does! 'God made Him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God.' (2 Corinthians 5:21 NIV)</p>
<p>The moment you place your trust in Christ, God sees you as 'righteous', and on that basis He accepts you 24/7. Aren't you glad?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Each of you must...speak truthfully to your neighbour...' Ephesians 4:25 NIV<br /><br /><p>Jesus said, 'You will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.' (John 8:32 NAS) But in the process, the truth can make you miserable!</p>
<p>One author says: 'Truth can be very uncomfortable. We have pivotal moments when we're asked to step up and say it or act on it. In those moments... character is forged and relationships solidified. For example...one summer day some of my Bible study sisters and I had our kids piled into our 4x4s and were headed to a friend's ranch for the night. Another buddy who wasn't invited called our lead driver for a get together. Panicking, and fearful of hurting the buddy's feelings, the driver mumbled something about being busy doing something else; a lie of omission...intended to guard feelings and preserve relationships. Soon...I called the same buddy to tell her a group of us were headed to the ranch and I'd see her tomorrow... Suddenly, on the phone, silence. She wasn't so much hurt that she wasn't invited...she was hurt that the driver lied to her. She'd have preferred the sting of the truth...to the isolation of deception. Paul says, &quot;Each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to his neighbour, for we are all members of one body...&quot; We've been socially conditioned to be pleasing and avoid making waves, so some of what we have to learn about truth is actually a process of unlearning... Later our Bible study discussed this incident. We all grew from the conversation and we learned an important lesson: however painful, friendship deepens in the fertile ground of honesty.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I find this law at work: When I want to do good, evil is right there with me.' Romans 7:21 NIV<br /><br /><p>Unless you make truthfulness a priority, there's an actual 'law at work' which dictates that even when you 'want to do good, evil is right there'. That means our natural 'default' setting (the one automatically selected by our internal computer unless we deliberately choose another option) is always set toward a lower standard.</p>
<p>One author writes: 'I lived in Atlanta...there's a vine there called <em>kudzu</em>...and once it creeps onto your tree or fence, if you don't kill it immediately, it'll overtake your entire property. Any deception... subtle omission... telling a tiny white lie...is like planting a <em>kudzu</em> seed in the garden of your heart... For me it's a slippery slope, like taking a side route on an unmarked path, thinking I've found a shortcut. I get sloppy...lazy...then I get lost. I let one infraction of integrity slide without correction. I feel the tug of the Holy Spirit, but I shrug it off and stay busy...and I've taken the first step into shadow-living... Tiny lies are like snowballs rolling downhill... they're sticky, and they get bigger fast! How do we stay in truth when the potential resides in us to compromise? First: we must recommit to our walk with God every morning before we do anything else. We do that through prayer and reading the Scriptures. By doing this we're choosing light over darkness while it's still too early to mess up. Second: we must align ourselves with the promptings of the Spirit. This is a highly personal thing which grows in direct proportion to our time and devotion to our walk with God.'</p>

At a party some women were discussing involvement in an organisation and I wanted to fit in, so I said I'd tried to get involved but could never break in... I knew I was a liar. I never had any desire to spend my time doing that...committees give me a rash! So, though my intent was good, my delivery was clumsy as I blurted out, &quot;Sorry, I just lied to you. I never volunteered there and I've no desire to.&quot; Everyone was silent, and I was trying to recall where I left my purse so I could hightail it out of there, when miraculously everyone burst out laughing... No matter how uncomfortable it is...the truth sets us free. Pursuit of truth is like a salmon's upstream journey; we're literally going against the current... the world says truth can change based on circumstances, comparisons, new data and levels of experience. But ultimate truth isn't relative. It can't be rationalised or customised to fit our moods and preferences. That's why the status of our heart is so important...when we're unable or unwilling to think our way into the truth, we must rely on the cultivation of our heart.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Have regard for good things in the sight of all men.' Romans 12:17 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Eventually lies are exposed. The truth will always surface. 'He who covers his sins will not prosper.' (Proverbs 28:13 NKJV) Anyone who does business with you wants to know the truth-the whole truth.</p>
<p>Jesus had the greatest product on earth: salvation. He offered the human race an opportunity to have a relationship with God. He even promised them a home in Heaven. But He never painted a distorted picture. After talking about the advantages of following Him, He spelled out the challenges. 'You will be hated by all nations for My name's sake.' (Matthew 24:9 NKJV) Jesus offered people more than a pie-in-the-sky philosophy. He believed in preparing people for every possible situation that could arise. In an age when bankers and businessmen twist the truth to enhance the bottom line, God calls on you to be honest, even to your own hurt. If you represent God, and if you want to experience His blessing, you must do business His way. An honest relationship is worth more than a hundred sales. Your integrity will be remembered longer than your product.</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson said, 'The whole art of government consists in the art of being honest.' In the Bible, God's people were largely an agricultural community. So God laid it on the line: 'Do not use dishonest standards when measuring length, weight or quantity.' (Leviticus 19:35 NIV) John Parnell wrote, 'It matters not what you do, make a nation or a shoe. For he who does an honest thing, in God's pure sight is ranked a king.'</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...In all things grow up into Him...that is, Christ.' Ephesians 4:15 NIV<br /><br /><p>Spiritual growth doesn't happen automatically. You must desire to grow, decide to grow, discipline yourself, and delight in spiritual growth. 'But my life is just too hard,' you say. A lot of people have had it worse than you and grown into spiritual maturity, and a lot of people have had it better and remained stuck in spiritual infancy. That's because they doubted their ability to grow, wherever the current took them, or delayed their growth, thinking, 'I'll get around to it when things change.' But it never happens.</p>
<p>Growth always begins with a decision. '...Follow Me and be My disciple... So Matthew got up and followed Him.' (Matthew 9:9 NLT) Matthew didn't understand all the implications of his decision; he simply decided to follow Jesus. That's all you need to get started: a decision. Nothing shapes your life like the decisions you make. If you want to know what you'll be twenty or thirty years from now, examine the commitments and priorities that rule your life. It's at the point of commitment that most of us miss God's best. Because we are afraid to commit to anything, we make half-hearted commitments to too many things and end up frustrated because we chose the wrong things. And when we commit to the wrong things we end up living with regrets.</p>
<p>Every choice has consequences, so choose wisely. Christlikeness is the result of making Christlike choices, then depending on Him to help you fulfil those choices. And He will: '...put on the new man which was created according to God...' (Ephesians 4:24 NKJV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I, the Lord, search the heart...' Jeremiah 17:10 NIV<br /><br /><p>How do you measure up when it comes to: () <i>Obedience</i>.'Obey those who rule over you, and be submissive, for they watch out for your souls, as those who must give account. Let them do so with joy and not with grief, for that would be unprofitable for you.' (Hebrews 13:17 NKJV) Do you consistently obey the things you know God wants you to do? Do you submit to the guidance of those God has placed over you? Do you pray for them and thank God for the deposits they make into your life? (2) <i>A pure heart</i>. 'If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.' (1 John 1:8-9 NKJV) Do you confess your sins specifically and by name? Do you purpose to forsake your sin the moment God reveals it to you? What about your unsurrendered areas? Are you willing to give up all sin for God? (3) <i>A clear conscience</i>. 'I...strive to have a conscience without offence toward God and men.' (Acts 24:16 NKJV) Do you seek forgiveness from those you've offended? Is your conscience clear with God and man? (4) <i>Confidence before God</i>. 'If our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence toward God. And whatever we ask we receive from Him, because we keep His commandments and do those things that are pleasing in His sight.' (1 John 3:21-22 NKJV) Have you moved beyond merely 'right or wrong', and asked yourself, 'How will this affect my confidence before God?'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Leaving you an example, that you should follow in His steps.' 1 Peter 2:21 NIV<br /><br /><p>If you're serious about becoming like Jesus, examine your heart and then examine His:</p>
<p>(1) <em>His heart was pure.</em> He was cared for by women, yet never accused of lustful thoughts (Luke 8:1-3). Peter, who travelled with Him for three and a half years, described Him as a lamb '...unblemished and spotless...' (1 Peter 1:19 NAS) John concluded, '...In Him is no sin.' (1 John 3:5 NIV)</p>
<p>(2) <em>His heart was peaceful.</em> His disciples shouted for fear in the storm, but not Jesus. He slept through it (Luke 8:22-25). Peter drew his sword to fight the soldiers; He lifted His hand to heal (Luke 22:47-51). When Peter denied Him, did Jesus lose His temper? When the soldiers spat in His face, did He breathe fire in theirs? No, He was at peace. He forgave them. He refused to be guided by vengeance.</p>
<p>(3) <em>His heart was purposeful.</em> He could summarise His life with one sentence: 'The Son of Man came to seek out and to save the lost.' (Luke 19:10 RSV) Jesus was so focused that He knew when to say, '...My time has not yet come' (John 2:4 ESV) and when to say, '...It is finished...' (John 19:30 NIV) But He was not so focused that He was unpleasant. Children couldn't resist Him. He could find beauty in lilies, joy in worship, and possibilities in problems. He could spend His days with multitudes of sick people and still feel sorry for them. He spent over three decades wading through the muck and mire of our sin, yet still saw enough beauty in us to die for our mistakes. And you are called to follow in His steps.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...There was a man who had two sons.' Luke 15:11 NIV<br /><br /><p>The real star in the Parable of the Prodigal Son is the father. He had two boys. One was rebellious, the other was religious. But he loved each of them. And because they were his family he refused to give up on them. While the younger brother was away wallowing in sin, the older brother was at home wallowing in self-righteousness. One was guilty of the sins of the flesh (the obvious ones); the other was guilty of the sins of the spirit (the not-so-obvious ones). Only when the younger brother lost everything did he discover that living in submission to his father's rule was the safest, most fulfilling place you could be. Only when the older brother discovered the difference between rule-keeping and relationship was he able to understand his father's words, '...Everything I have is yours.' (Luke 15:31 NIV) One was a miserable rule-keeper; the other was a miserable rule-breaker. <em>(Which are you?)</em> The problem was neither boy really knew the heart of their father because they were self-centred. But that changed when they discovered that he loved them in spite of their flaws, and planned to bless them.</p>
<p>Understand this: you can read the Bible, go to church, keep all the rules - and not really know God's faithfulness, His love and His plan for you. Until you really know God, you'll have no anchor in life; you'll be tossed to and fro by every circumstance, emotion and temptation. But when you know Whose you are, you'll begin to understand who you are, you're supposed to do, and where you're supposed to be.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He was lost and is found.' Luke 15:32 NIV<br /><br /><p>The Prodigal Son didn't really know who his father was or how his father felt about him until he left home. Looking back, he thought, 'I left the best thing I ever had.' After ending up in a hog pen he 'came to himself' (Luke 15:17). Looking around, he thought, 'This is not how I was meant to live.' At that point his life took a dramatic turn. Upon his return, his father threw a big party.</p>
<p>When the Prodigal Son got a revelation of who his father was, he discovered who was; then he could really celebrate. Until you discover who God is, and who you are, there's nothing to celebrate. You'll just keep trying to buy love, get people to like you, try to win their friendships, try to make connections, try to be with the right people at the right place at the right time in order to get to the right destination, etc. But once you know Who your Father is, and who you are, you get to go back home and take your rightful place at the table. No more loneliness. No more guilt. No more lacking.</p>
<p>Listen to the Father's words: 'We had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.' (Luke 15:32 NIV) When he left home the Prodigal Son was saying, '...Give me my share of the estate...' (Luke 15:12 NIV) But he discovered that you can have all the 'stuff' in the world, yet it means nothing without the assurance of your Father's love. Get the idea?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The works that I do [you] will do also...' John 14:12 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Jesus was the perfect mentor. He told His disciples, 'The works that I do [you] will do also.' If you want to reach the fullness of your God-given potential, ask God for the right mentors. You will always go further with a good mentor coaching and pushing you. Some mentors are given for a short season, others for a lifetime, so you must know the difference.</p>
<p><em>How do you recognise a mentor?</em> In eight ways. The credo of the true mentor is this: (1) I am willing to spend the time it takes to build a close relationship with the learner; (2) I commit myself to believing in the potential of the learner, to telling them the exciting future I see ahead for him or her; to visualising and verbalising the possibilities for their life; (3) I am willing to be vulnerable and transparent before the learner, I'm willing to share not only my strengths and successes, but also my weaknesses, failures, brokenness and sins; (4) I am willing to be honest yet affirming in confronting the learner's errors, faults and areas of immaturity; (5) I am committed to standing by the learner through trials - even trials that are self-inflicted as a result of ignorance or error; (6) I am committed to helping the learner set goals for his or her spiritual life, career or ministry and to helping the learner dream his or her dream; (7) I am willing to objectively evaluate the learner's progress toward his or her goal; (8) Above all, I am committed to faithfully living out everything I teach.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['He provided redemption for His people.' Psalm 111:9 NIV<br /><br /><p>Ever been to a pawnshop? The idea is simple; if you need money, you take a valuable item like jewellery or a musical instrument to the shop where the pawnbroker appraises it and gives you cash. But if you don't return within the specified time to redeem the item, you forfeit ownership. Although it was yours originally, you no longer have legal possession till you buy it back. And if you wait too long, it can be lost forever. Have you ever thought of yourself as somebody who needs to be redeemed, so you can be returned to your rightful owner? God created us to enjoy fellowship with Him. But sin caused us to fall into 'the snare of the devil...held captive...to do his will.' (2 Timothy 2:26 NAS) Restoration to God, your rightful owner, could only come through redemption. And that's exactly what God did! 'God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.' (John 3:16 NKJV) Christ's death was the price of your redemption; that's how much God values you!</p>
<p>But redemption only becomes a reality when you realise you're a sinner, and trust Christ as your Saviour. The moment you do, He reunites you with God - ransomed, redeemed, restored to your original owner. So the question is: have you taken up His offer of salvation, the one that makes you a member of His family? If you're able to read this, it's not too late. You can do it right now wherever you are. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Love never fails...' 1 Corinthians 13:8 NIV<br /><br /><p>Forming a negative opinion based on appearance takes less than seven seconds. As Thelma Wells says: 'It's easy to do when someone doesn't look, sound, shake hands, or think like you. However, John says, &quot;...Anyone who does not love his brother...cannot love God...&quot; (1 John 4:20 NIV) We cannot love God if we harbour bad feelings towards others. We're more than flesh - we're spiritual beings - and our God-given gifts, character, values, intellect, and passions are the foundation of who we are, not our height, weight, mannerisms, hair colour and age. When we realise God loves us even though He doesn't like some of our attitudes and actions, it becomes easier to love others. When we realise our negative feelings towards others get in the way of our love for God, it becomes easier to love. And when we're in communion with our Creator, asking Him to give us His eyes and heart ...it becomes easier to love. Jesus said, &quot;...If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even 'sinners' love those who love them...&quot; (Luke 6:31 NIV) It may never be easy to love certain people, but when you make the tough choice to love them anyway, the rewards are always worth it.' The Bible says, 'Love never fails,' and when you refuse to love you miss out on God's best. One Bible teacher says: 'Don't miss out on any of it... God is love, and when you release love, you release God, and He becomes responsible for the outcome. Release love every moment into every situation, every prayer and every thought... It will strengthen...and cast out fear... it's the one solution that always works.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['He came to his senses...' Luke 15:17 NIV<br /><br /><p>Sometimes you have to reach your lowest point to understand who God is and what He can do for you. When the younger son ended up in a hog pen, 'He came to his senses.' But his next decision was crucial: 'I will...go back to my father and say...&quot;I have sinned&quot;...' (Luke 15:18 NIV) And when he did, his father restored him to his rightful place. But the older brother needed his father's forgiveness too. What was his sin? Jealousy and judgmentalism: '...This son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!' (Luke 15:30 NIV) He built himself up by tearing his brother down. He tried to earn his father's love by making points. The trouble was, he already had his father's love; he just didn't know it, so he kept trying to 'prove himself'.</p>
<p>Are you doing that? As a redeemed child of God you are already accepted, justified and clothed in the righteousness of Christ. Today your Heavenly Father is saying, '...You are always with Me, and everything I have is yours.' (Luke 15:31 NIV) These two boys sinned in very different ways, but their solution was the same - being restored to fellowship with their father.</p>
<p>James writes, 'Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father...who does not change...' (James 1:17 NIV) Notice, God not only knows what's 'good' for you, but what's 'perfect'. And He will give it to you when you get into the right place spiritually and begin to relate to Him as you should.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['There are diversities of gifts...' 1 Corinthians 12:4 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Paul writes, 'There are diversities of gifts, but the same spirit.' Successful people invest their time, energy and resources into their core strengths. Why? Because that is where they get their highest return! They occasionally depart from that approach, as Colin Salmon did when he took time out from his successful acting career to take part in BBC's <em>Strictly Come Dancing</em>. Colin, a statuesque, confident actor proved to be less competent in the dancing arena, leaving the show after just five weeks, never receiving higher than 27 points from the panel of judges. He may have enjoyed the experience, but exiting the show so early is probably not what he'd like to be remembered for.</p>
<p>God gave you gifts that make you unique, gifts that hold great possibilities. But you have to discover them and develop them. A sign on a DIY shop says it all: 'We've got it, if you can find it.' Nobody was ever born without talent, including you, but you've got to find it. What keeps us from doing that? (1) <em>The company we keep.</em> The old saying goes, 'If you run around with turkeys, you'll never fly with eagles.' The Scripture says, 'He who walks with wise men, will be wise...' (Proverbs 13:20 NKJV) (2) <em>Failing to spend time in prayer and in God's Word.</em> God is not only the giver of your gift, He supplies the strength to function successfully in it.</p>
<p>Aristotle said, 'We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence then is not an act, but a habit.' So if you want to succeed, consult God, and operate in your God-given strength.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...His sheep follow him because they know his voice.' John 10:4 NIV<br /><br /><p>Here are seven occasions when knowing God's voice is all-important:</p>
<p>(1) <em>Hearing from God before you entertain the ideas of others</em>. Why? Because their ideas are not His commands. Don't make commitments and end up bound by promises you can't keep. You must love others, but be led only by God's Spirit. (2) <em>Hearing from God before you listen to the complaints of others.</em> Why? Because you are not responsible for their happiness. Your need to 'fix' others in order to feel good about yourself is called 'co-dependency'. Give them to God! (3) <em>Hearing from God before you consider the needs of others.</em> Why? Because their needs are driving them; only the plan of God should be leading you. (4) <em>Hearing from God before you respond to the requests of others.</em> Why? Because you must discern what's behind their requests. Check the soil before you sow your seed.</p>
<p>(5) <em>Hearing from God before you share your dream with others.</em><em> </em>Why? Because it's not enough to have a dream, you must have a team. You need people to help you, cheer you on and lift you to a higher level. The right people motivate you to grow stronger, think better, work harder and risk more. They compel you to continue! (6) <em>Hearing from God before you seek the approval of others.</em> Why? Because people with an agenda will flatter and manipulate you. Hearing God's voice will keep you from falling into their trap. (7) <em>Hearing from God before you make significant changes.</em><em> </em>Why? Because it's not your job to decide what God wants you to do, but to discover it and do it.</p>

<alias><![CDATA[stop-comparing-yourself-with-others]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...But they...comparing themselves...are not wise.' 2 Corinthians 10:12 KJV<br /><br /><p>Are you so busy analysing your vices that you don't have time to appreciate your virtues? Or so caught up in scrutinising others that you don't value what God has given you? God never intended you to compare yourself with anybody else. 'Since we are living by the Spirit, let us follow the Spirit's leading in every part of our lives. Let us not become conceited, or provoke one another, or be jealous of one another.' (Galatians 5:25-26 NLT)</p>
<p>By making comparisons, you're implying that God made a mistake in making you as you are. Furthermore, you're allowing others to define your worth, and giving them control over your self-esteem. That's too much power to give anybody! '...so it is with Christ's body. We are many parts of one body, and we all belong to each other. In His grace, God has given us different gifts for doing certain things well.' (Romans 12:5-6 NLT)</p>
<p>Build on your God-given talents and stop coveting what others have. God made you what He wanted you to be, redeemed you and called you to fulfil His plan for your life. Until you stop comparing yourself with others, you'll never be able to give birth to the gifts He's placed within you. So thank Him for making you who you are, and believe that He's transforming you day by day into the person He wants you to become.</p>

<alias><![CDATA[im-praying-for-you]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['I have prayed for you...' Luke 22:32 NKJV<br /><br /><p>When somebody says, 'I'm praying for you,' there is no greater expression of love! The tragedy of religion without power is that it leaves you ignorant of the incredible potential of prayer. Prayer moves God! And when God moves, people and situations change! Jesus told Peter, '...Satan has asked for you, that he may sift you as wheat. But I have prayed for you, that your faith should not fail; and when you have returned to Me, strengthen your brethren.' (Luke 22:31-32 NKJV) And God answered that prayer! In spite of his denial of Christ, Peter ended up leading one of the greatest spiritual awakenings in history, and two of the books in the Bible are named after him.</p>
<p>Only eternity will reveal the lives that have been salvaged and ministries restored through prayer. There is no distance in prayer. Through prayer you can project yourself into any situation, at any time, anywhere on earth, claiming the promise, '...Whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.' (Mark 11:24 NIV) When the Philistines were about to annihilate Israel, Samuel said, '...I will intercede with the Lord for you.' (1 Samuel 7:5 NIV) And the result? '...The Lord thundered...against the Philistines...' (1 Samuel 7:10 NIV) Perhaps this is what the old-timers meant when they talked about 'praying up a storm'!</p>
<p>God comes by invitation. Your prayers open the door to Him. Any time you pray in Jesus' name, the Holy Spirit is authorised to go to work accomplishing things on your behalf that cannot be accomplished any other way. Remember that the next time someone says, 'I'm praying for you.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that...you may grow...' 1 Peter 2:2 NIV<br /><br /><p>Henry J. Heinz, founder of the Heinz food company, introduced the marketing slogan '<em>57 Varieties</em>' in 1896, depicting the range of their products. Well, most of us have at least that many excuses for not reading our Bible every day. You say, 'But I have a very busy life.' Edgar G. Watts of California, aged 84, read the Bible from cover to cover 161 times. And here's something you probably don't know: he had the use of only one eye for 55 years. Can you imagine telling a physical trainer you'd really like to be fit, but you don't have the time to come to the gym? He'd say that you're not serious!</p>
<p>Jeremiah said, 'When your words came, I ate them; they were my joy and my heart's delight...' (Jeremiah 15:16 NIV) Developing a love for the Scriptures requires three things: (1) <em>Decision</em>. You must establish Bible reading as one of your daily priorities or it'll never happen. () <em>Duty</em>.You may not feel like going to work each day or caring for your family, but you know it's your duty so you do it. What about your soul? Don't you have a duty to feed yourself spiritually and stay strong? (3) <em>Delight</em>. When you reach this phase, the battle over Bible reading is won.</p>
<p>When business leaders are about to make an important decision, they say, 'It's time to pull the trigger.' Stop 'dabbling'! It's time to pull the trigger and give God's Word its rightful place in your life. 'Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I will give you every place where you set your foot, as I promised...' Joshua 1:3 NIV<br /><br /><p>Can you imagine how Joshua felt stepping into Moses' shoes? He needed assurance, so God told him: (1) '<em>I will give you every place where you set your foot</em>.' In other words, just step out in faith and claim it. It's yours, if you're willing to walk towards it and take possession. Would it be easy? Would they get there overnight? No, but their confidence came from the words, 'as I promised'. The song goes: 'Standing on the promises that cannot fail; when the howling winds of doubt and fear assail. Standing on the living Word I shall prevail; standing on the promises of God.' (2) '<em>No one will be able to stand up against you all the days of your life.</em>' (Joshua 1:5 NIV) Will you face criticism? Yes. Will you come under attack? Yes. There were 31 kings, seven nations, and giants the size of telephone poles waiting for them in the Promised Land. But every battle you fight is just an opportunity for God to show Himself strong on your behalf. (3) '<em>As I was with Moses, so I will be with you.</em>' (Joshua 1:5 NIV) If you're anxious about the future, recall God's faithfulness to you in the past. At the end of his life Joshua wrote: 'Now I am about to go the way of all the earth. You know with all your heart and soul that not one of all the good promises the Lord your God gave you has failed. Every promise has been fulfilled...' (Joshua 23:14 NIV) And the God who came through for Joshua, will come through for you.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['When I am afraid, I will put my trust in You.' Psalm 56:3 NLT<br /><br /><p>Is fear causing you to hide from somebody today? Your boss? Your husband or wife? Your strong-willed child? Your grouchy co-worker? When God asked Adam, '...&quot;Where are you?&quot;, he replied, &quot;I hid...I was afraid...&quot;' (Genesis 3:9-10 NLT) And we've all been hiding from things ever since. We hide behind forced smiles, agreeable words we don't mean and social rituals we detest. Or worse, we hide behind things we do believe but don't express because we are afraid of what people might think or say. We try to avoid the pain of confronting someone, and the emotional energy we're afraid we'll have to invest in cleaning up afterwards.</p>
<p>Short-term it may be easier to act as if things don't bother you, or pretend to agree when, in reality, you disagree. But long-term it doesn't work, because peace isn't the absence of discord. When we remain silent in order to avoid confrontation, we just end up avoiding something far more important: relationships. For example, when we don't speak up on the job because we fear making waves, we end up resentful, alienated from our fellow workers, and maybe losing an opportunity to make things better. When we're afraid to confront our marriage partner (and this should be done in love, not anger), we end up emotionally distant. When we refuse to share our faith because we're afraid of being ridiculed, we lose the opportunity to bring hope to someone who really needs it.</p>
<p>So rise up and say, 'When I am afraid, I will put my trust in You.' Confront your fears, come out of hiding and start living.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord.' Ephesians 6:4 NIV<br /><br /><p><em>I</em><em>nstrument rated for parenthood</em>. Parents today face unique problems that no other generation has. But God's Word is timeless, so:</p>
<p>(1) <em>Enforce discipline</em>. 'Whom the Lord loves He corrects...' (Proverbs 3:12 NKJV) Teach your child that every decision has consequences. And don't rescue them from their consequences, for life won't let them off the hook when they do wrong.</p>
<p>(2) <em>Teach them God's ways</em>. 'Train up a child in the way that he should go: and when he is old he will not depart from it.' (Proverbs 22:6 NKJV) Give your child a taste of the things of God when they are young, and when they're older the world won't be able to satisfy their taste.</p>
<p>(3) <em>Commit them to the Lord</em>. This isn't easy; it's like allowing them to take the family car out for the first time. But there comes a point where God, not you, must speak to them and guide them. They'll either learn the easy way or the hard way. And even if they do go astray, God promises that they'll come back again (Jeremiah 31:16-17).</p>
<p>So pray, 'Lord, they're Yours now. I've taught them and set an example, now I give them to You. Deal with them according to Your perfect will.' Does that mean everything will be ok from that point on? Maybe, and maybe not. But like a pilot who flies according to his instruments, you must stand on the Word of God for your children.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...[God]...will not...leave you without support...' Hebrews 13:5 AMP<br /><br /><p>Colleen Alden writes: 'I'm single...The kind of companionship I ache for...I don't have. This feeling drives me to seek God... Why am I single when I long to love and be loved?... Though it's pointless to use our limited understanding to critique God's plans, it's helpful to catch glimpses of what He's creating in me. <em>Courage</em>: to go home every night to someone who believes in me might make facing the scary parts of life easier... Singleness forces me to lean on God...to face an uncertain future without fear. Psalm 27:1 NIV says, &quot;...The Lord is the stronghold of my life - of whom shall I be afraid?&quot; He's my protector, provider and Saviour whether I've a husband or not. <em>Faith</em>:Paul says, Be satisfied with your present circumstances... God...will not...leave you without support. Do I believe He knows best even when it hurts and I don't understand? When we've tasted loneliness past what we think we can bear...cry out to Jesus. He's close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit. (Psalm 34:18 NIV) He knows what it is to long for something... He's longed for the affection of his loved ones for centuries. <em>Authenticity</em>: once in a while a man sparks my interest... Then a funny thing happens. The more interested I become, the more I become someone else... The old fears kick in. Am I pretty enough? Thin enough? Charming and talkative enough? God made me who I am, and years of being single have allowed me to learn who this woman is... I'd rather be single than be with someone who wants me to be someone else.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The Lord is the stronghold of my life - of whom shall I be afraid?' Psalm 27:1 NIV<br /><br /><p>If you've ever packed up and moved to another house, you may remember saying, 'This is the last time I'm moving!' Now you know how Joshua felt moving almost two million people into a new homeland. And they did it on foot. So God told Joshua two things: (1) '<em>Be strong and very courageous</em>...' (Joshua 1:7 NKJV) Why? Because his enemies were going to attack him, and his own people were going to make endless demands on him. Where do you find courage? In these words: 'The Lord is the stronghold of my life - of whom shall I be afraid?' That word 'stronghold' means you are held in the safety of God's strong arms. That means nothing can get to you, without first coming through Him. Victor Hugo wrote, 'Have courage for the great sorrows of life, and patience for the small ones. And when you have laboriously accomplished your daily task, go to sleep in peace. God is awake.' (2) '...<em>I will never leave you nor forsake you.</em>' (Joshua 1:5 NIV) Who but God could make and keep such a promise? Did He keep His Word to them? Yes! 'So the Lord gave Israel all the land He had sworn to give their forefathers, and they took possession of it and settled there. The Lord gave them rest on every side, just as He had sworn to their forefathers. Not one of their enemies withstood them; the Lord handed all their enemies over to them. Not one of all the Lord's good promises to the house of Israel failed; every one was fulfilled.' (Joshua 21:43-45 NIV) And their God - is your God!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Neither can you do good who are accustomed to doing evil.' Jeremiah 13:23 NIV<br /><br /><p>The founder of one of the world's most successful companies said, 'The individual who wants to reach the top must appreciate the might and force of habit. He must be quick to break those habits that can break him, and hasten to adopt those practices that will become the habits that help him achieve the success he desires.' This is true in all of life. A dream becomes a reality as the result of your actions, and your actions are controlled mainly by your habits.</p>
<p>Speaker and author Robert Ringer says, 'The world is saturated with intelligent, highly educated, extraordinarily skilled people who experience ongoing frustration because of their lack of success. Millions of others spend their lives working hard, long hours, only to die penniless.' What's the solution? Ringer says: 'Remember, life is nothing more than the sum total of many successful years; a successful year is nothing more than the sum total of many successful months; a successful month is nothing more than the sum total of many successful weeks; a successful week is nothing more than the sum total of many successful days. That's why practising successful habits, day in and day out, is the most certain way to win over the long term.'</p>
<p>You have to take a realistic look at yourself to know where your habits are taking you. If your habits don't line up with your dream, then you need to either change your habits or change your dream. If you want to hold on to your dream, then be prepared to change your habits, because a bad habit never goes away by itself.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Be clear minded and self-controlled...' 1 Peter 4:7 NIV<br /><br /><p>Going from childhood to adulthood is a transition that requires a lot of wisdom and love. Your teen will feel and behave child-like sometimes, and adult-like other times. Your job is to realise that whatever their status, they will become a man (or woman) and they will remain adult! Navigating through their child-adult struggles elevates your teen's stress levels, sometimes making them feel out of control.</p>
<p>To help them become a mature adult: (1) <em>Be rational, not reactive</em>. Your role requires you to be 'clear-minded and self-controlled'. Be the grown-up; you cannot help your child to become an adult if you're not one. (2) <em>Be their parent, not their mate</em>. They need someone 'in charge' to shepherd them toward maturity. If you abdicate your role because you're afraid of your child's anger, rejection or unhappiness, you abandon them to their own confused ways. You are the calm God put in their storm - the lighthouse to guide them. In the short term, they may consider your values, rules, lifestyle and morals outdated. Expect no less; that's par for the course in parenting. Hold this line! Forget becoming 'cool' by lowering your standards; that's a no-win alternative to good parenting. They'll challenge you if you're not cool and they'll challenge you if you are. (Nothing is as 'uncool' to a teen as a parent trying to be 'cool'!) Be yourself, maintain Biblical standards; they need you to have character. Yes, they'll fight you now, but if you remain resolute, loving and consistent, they'll follow in your footsteps.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The Lord searches every heart and understands every motive...' 1 Chronicles 28:9 NIV<br /><br /><p>The Psalmist prayed, 'Search me, O God, and know my heart; try me, and know my anxieties; and see if there is any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.' (Psalm 139:23-24 NKJV) If you're wise you'll visit your doctor and get regular physical checkups. You'll also go to God for regular spiritual checkups. In what areas? (1) <i>Your salvation</i>. 'If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.' (2 Corinthians 5:17 NKJV) Was there ever a time in your life when you repented of your sin and placed your trust in Jesus to save you? Have you surrendered to Him and made Him Lord of your life? (2) <i>Your devotional life</i>. 'I love Your law! It is my meditation all the day.' (Psalm 119:97 NKJV) 'Your Word is very pure; therefore Your servant loves it.' (Psalm 119:140 NKJV) Do you read and meditate on God's Word each day? Are your personal devotions consistent and meaningful? Do you try to apply the principles of Scripture to each circumstance you're in? (3) <i>Your humility</i>. God says: '...I dwell in the high and holy place, with him who has a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.' (Isaiah 57:15 NKJV) Are you quick to recognise and agree with God when you have sinned? Are you quick to admit to others when you are wrong? Can you rejoice at others' successes, even when yours goes unnoticed? Do you esteem others as better than yourself? (Romans 12:10) Do you live with a sense of dependence upon God?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The Father is seeking such to worship Him.' John 4:23 NKJV<br /><br /><p><em>I</em><em>nstrument rated for discouragement</em>. God has promised to give you '...beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness...' (Isaiah 61:3 KJV) Satan can't stand it when someone other than himself is receiving praise and honour, so the spirit of heaviness will lift when you begin to praise your God. It will fall off you like a garment. The weight will be gone. Your pity party will turn to a scene of gladness. Here's something remarkable: Jesus said, '...The Father is seeking such to worship Him... in spirit and truth...' (John 4:23-24 NKJV)</p>
<p>When you begin to worship God, instead of you seeking Him, He starts seeking you! And since He knows where to find you at all times, He blesses you, strengthens you and causes you to rise above your discouragement. You can literally praise your way through the storm! When an instructor is teaching a new student to fly, he constantly reminds the student to keep the nose of the plane up. New students are likely to keep the nose of the plane down so they can better see where they are going. Also, the plane has a natural tendency to fall - if you let it. When you keep your head up and your eyes on Jesus, your heart begins to rejoice even in the toughest test. It takes effort, but it's worth it.</p>
<p>Remember, you don't always win every fight in the first round. But if you hang in there and keep answering the bell with praise, you will be victorious. Why? Because the fight was fixed by Jesus a long time ago.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Lead me, O Lord...make straight Your way before me.' Psalm 5:8 NIV<br /><br /><p><em>I</em><em>nstrument rated for direction.</em> The compass has always been the pilot's best friend. Most planes are equipped with two.</p>
<p>How can you know the will of God? '...A man named Agabus, who also had the gift of prophecy, arrived from Judea. He came over, took Paul's belt, and bound his own feet and hands with it. Then he said, &quot;The Holy Spirit declares, 'So shall the owner of this belt be bound by the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem and turned over to the Gentiles.'&quot; When we heard this, we and the local believers all begged Paul not to go on to Jerusalem. But he said, &quot;Why all this weeping? You are breaking my heart! I am ready not only to be jailed at Jerusalem but even to die for the sake of the Lord Jesus.&quot; When it was clear that we couldn't persuade him, we gave up and said, &quot;The Lord's will be done.&quot;' (Acts 21:10-14 NLT) Notice, the confusion here was not over God's will; that was clear. It was over fear concerning Paul's life. Here we have a perfect example of letting our emotions get in the way of our spirit. It is by our spirit, not our mind, and certainly not our emotions, that we understand the ways and directions of the Lord. 'For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.' (Romans 8:14 KJV)</p>
<p>You must not be led by voices, dreams, and fleeces (see Judges 6:37-40). Sometimes these things support and confirm what you sense in your spirit to be God's will, but they are never to be the sole deciding factor. Your compass is God's Word!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Enjoy life with your wife, whom you love...' Ecclesiastes 9:9 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p><em>I</em><em>nstrument rated for marriage.</em> Today Christian marriages are falling apart at the same rate as non-Christian marriages. And those who go through it need our love, not our condemnation. But clearly, something's wrong that needs to be put right! Two of the leading causes of divorce are financial stress and pornography. When you become overextended by purchasing things you can't afford and don't need, you're heading into trouble. And when you open your mind to sexual fantasy, you entertain images your mate can't live up to, and your relationship begins to deteriorate.</p>
<p>Solomon writes, 'Catch us the foxes, the little foxes that spoil the vines, for our vines have tender grapes.' (Song of Solomon 2:15 NKJV) Notice the word 'tender'. When we fail to treat one another tenderly, graciously, lovingly, considerately and with respect, the plane we're flying in together takes a nosedive. A neglected partner is vulnerable to anyone who comes along. Resentment wells up and takes over. If God's Word doesn't work in your home and in your marriage, then it won't work anywhere else! An instrument rated Christian understands that the secret of having a good marriage is not just in finding the right person, but in becoming the right person. And that can only happen when you make a daily commitment to living by the principles of God's Word and demonstrating the fruits of the Spirit (see Galatians 5:22).</p>
<p>A comedian quipped that one spouse said to the other, 'I never knew what real happiness was until I married you - now it's too late.' Unless you want that to be your story, start tending the home fires.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus.' Philippians 2:5 NIV<br /><br /><p>Max Lucado writes: 'What would your life be like, even for one day, if you were to think and act like Jesus? If His priorities governed your actions, His passions drove your decisions and His love directed your behaviour? What would you be like? Would people notice the change in you? Would your family see something new? Would your co-workers sense a difference? What about the less fortunate; would you treat them like you normally do? How about your friends; would they detect more joy? How about your enemies; would they receive more grace and mercy? And how would it affect you personally? Your mood swings? Your temper? Would you sleep better? Would you view death differently? Would you pay your taxes differently? Any chance you'd need fewer aspirins or sedatives? How about your reaction to traffic delays? Or when the deal falls through, or people don't do what you want them to? Would you still dread what you are dreading? Better yet, would you still do what you are doing? Pause and think about your schedule, obligations, engagements, outings and appointments. With Jesus fully in control, would these all change? Keep working on this for a moment. Adjust the lens of your imagination until you have a clear picture of Jesus leading your life, then snap the shutter and frame the image. What you see is what God wants! Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus. If you committed to living this way for a lifetime, or a year, or even a month, you would be a transformed person. So just try it for one day: today!'</p>

If you think His love would be deeper if your thoughts and actions were better, you are wrong again. Don't confuse God's love with people's love. Their love increases with performance and decreases with mistakes. Not so with God's love. He loves you just the way you are, but He refuses to leave you that way.</p>
<p>Max Lucado writes: 'When my daughter, Jenna, was a toddler, I used to take her to a park... One day as she was playing in a sandbox, an ice-cream salesman approached us. I purchased her a treat, and when I turned to give it to her, I saw her mouth was full of sand... Did I love her with dirt in her mouth? Absolutely. Was she any less my daughter with dirt in her mouth? Of course not. Was I going to allow her to keep the dirt in her mouth? No way. I carried her over to the water fountain and washed out her mouth. Why? Because I love her. God does the same for us. He holds us over the fountain. Spit out the dirt, honey, our Father urges. I've got something better for you. And so He cleanses us of filth: immorality, dishonesty, prejudice, bitterness, greed. We don't enjoy the cleansing; sometimes we even opt for the dirt over the ice cream. I can eat dirt if I want to!... Which is true - we can. But if we do, the loss is ours. God has a better offer. He wants us to be just like Jesus.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['If I can just touch [Him], I will be healed.' Mark 5:28 NLT<br /><br /><p>Mark records the story of a woman who'd haemorrhaged for twelve years and spent every cent she had on doctors, but to no avail. What western culture discreetly refers to as 'a female condition' had devastated this Jewish lady's life. Sexually, she couldn't touch her husband. Maternally, she couldn't have children. Domestically, whatever she touched was considered 'unclean'. Spiritually, she couldn't enter the temple. So, physically exhausted, socially ostracised, and spiritually depleted, she thought, 'If I can just touch Jesus, I'll be made whole.'</p>
<p>Her miracle started when she thought about Jesus. But first she had to get through the crowd that stood between her and Him. And so will you! The crowd has its arguments and reasons, but not one of them is worth missing Jesus for. When this woman finally got to Him, two wonderful things happened: (1) <em>She discovered that our faith gets Jesus' attention every time.</em><em> </em>Many people in the crowd must have brushed up against Jesus that day, yet Mark records, '...Knowing in Himself that power had gone out of Him, [He] turned around in the crowd and said, &quot;Who touched My clothes?&quot;' (Mark 5:30 NKJV) Understand this: Jesus can tell the difference between a casual churchgoer and a truly hungry heart that pushes through pain, problems, and pressures, and touches Him by faith. (2) <em>She's the only woman Jesus ever called '...daughter...'</em> (Mark 5:34 NKJV) Imagine how she felt. She probably couldn't remember when she'd last heard a kind word. You're not just a face in the crowd, and your problem is not too big for Jesus.</p>
<p>Today reach out in faith, touch Him, and be made whole!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.' John 6:63 KJV<br /><br /><p>Did you know that the longest telegraphic message ever dispatched was in May, 1881? It carried 118,000 words. It was printed in full that day in the <em>Chicago Times</em>. One of the nation's leading newspapers gave space for four Gospels, the Acts of the Apostles and the Epistle to the Romans. 'A triumph of publicity' was the verdict of the nation's press. All this was done because the Revised Version of the New Testament in English was on sale that day. In New York City, 33,000 copies were sold within 24 hours, setting a new sales record for any book.</p>
<p>Why does the Bible remain the world's most widely read book? For one simple reason: you read every other book - the Bible reads you! You say, 'But I don't get a lot out of the Bible when I read it.' You are not alone; many people say the same thing. But it doesn't have to be that way. FB Meyer, one of history's great Bible teachers, writes, 'Read the Bible not as a newspaper, but as a love letter. If a cluster of heavenly fruit hangs within your reach, gather it. If a promise lies upon the page as a blank cheque, cash it. If a prayer is recorded, launch it as a feathered arrow from the bow of your desire.'</p>
<p>Why do we keep going back to the Bible? Because in a world where trust is in short supply, '...Not one word has failed of all the good promises He gave...' (1 Kings 8:56 NIV)</p>

<title><![CDATA[Solving the Biggest Marriage Problem]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[solving-the-biggest-marriage-problem]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...What...God has joined together...' Matthew 19:6 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The biggest problem in marriage is selfishness. When you've spent your life doing things your own way, it's hard to give up that right and defer to another person. Some days you will do it well, other days poorly, and other days not at all. Paul Tripp writes, 'When we live for the kingdom of self, our decisions, thoughts, plans, actions and words are directed by personal desire, [and] we seek to surround ourselves with people who will serve our kingdom purposes.'</p>
<p>The trouble is, as Lynn Roush points out: 'A marriage of two people serving their own kingdoms will eventually end in bloody battle. But when both people submit to God's Kingdom where Christ reigns and where joy and life are found, marriage becomes an opportunity to exit the small space of the kingdom of self and begin to enjoy the beauty and benefits of the Kingdom of God... Our greatest marital problem is ourselves. We will always rise to our own defence, and be tempted to blame others while believing the best about ourselves. Not surprisingly, God uses marriage to reveal the sin of self-righteousness. A marriage can be transformed when just one person sees this sin and humbly confesses ways they have damaged the relationship.' It's only when two people give up their own kingdom and join together as one in living out the principles of God's kingdom that peace, harmony, love and joy can be found.</p>
<p>You say, 'I didn't know marriage would be so hard.' God designed it that way for the purpose of aligning both your hearts with His Kingdom-and rescuing you from your own.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Let us love one another, for love comes from God...' 1 John 4:7 NIV<br /><br /><p>While the Bible clearly teaches self-worth, it also denounces self-interest. When Jesus was asked what the greatest commandment was, He said that we were to love God with all our hearts, and love others with the same concern that we show for ourselves (Mark 12:30-31). When we obsess over ourselves, we lose the meaning of life, which is to love and serve God, and love and serve our neighbours.</p>
<p>In a 2003 report <em>Hardwired to Connect</em>, 33 research scientists discovered that we are biologically primed to find meaning through relationships.</p>
<p>Chuck Colson said: 'After nearly eight decades of living, I can vouch for this. My single greatest joy is giving myself to others and seeing them grow in return. You cannot discover that without commitment. I first learned it by watching my parents care for my dying grandparents in our home... l later saw it in the Marine Corps. You cannot go into combat, commanding 45 men as I was trained to do, if you weren't committed to one another. You were going to die if the man next to you did not cover your back... By abandoning commitment, our narcissistic culture has lost the one thing it desperately seeks: <em>happiness</em>. Without commitment, our individual lives will be barren and sterile. Without commitment, our lives will lack meaning and purpose. After all, if nothing is worth dying for, then nothing is worth living for. Jesus taught that the only way to live abundantly is to die to self-interest and give yourself fully to God, and to those who need what God has given you.'</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['He who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit...' Romans 8:27 NIV<br /><br /><p>Doing a spiritual check-up means examining things like: (1) <i>Priorities.</i>'Seek first the Kingdom of God...and all these things shall be added to you.' (Matthew 6:33 NKJV) Do you submit your schedule to God for His approval? Does your cheque book show that He is first in your financial decisions? (2) <i>Values</i>. 'You died to this life, and your real life is hidden with Christ in God... Since God chose you to be the holy people He loves, you must clothe yourselves with tenderhearted mercy, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience.' (Colossians 3:3;12 NLT) Do you love what God loves and hate what God hates? Do you value highly the things that please Him? Are your desires and goals governed by God's Word? (3) <i>Sacrifice</i>. 'I consider everything a loss compared to the surpassing greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for Whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them rubbish, that I may gain Christ... I want to know Christ and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of sharing in His sufferings, becoming like Him...' (Philippians 3:8-10 NIV) Are you fully surrendered to God? Is there anything you value more than Him? If there is, pray: 'Father, forgive me for taking back control of my life. I come before You surrendering, repenting and asking You to cleanse me. Renew me and fill me with Your Spirit. I renounce my selfish ways and make You Lord of my life. You said that You would rather I was hot or cold, but not lukewarm. Light a fire in me today that will burn so brightly, others will be drawn to You.'</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Anxiety in a man's heart weighs it down...' Proverbs 12:25 NAS<br /><br /><p>Your stomach is in knots, you feel as though an elephant is sitting on your chest, you've got the jitters and your thoughts are running amok. Where can you find relief? Alcohol, drugs, relationships, work, money, sex...? The list goes on! If so, you've found relief that simply won't work long-term. The Bible says, 'Anxiety in a man's heart weighs it down,' causing hopelessness and depression.</p>
<p>What's the answer? Satan is sometimes the source of anxiety and depression. When King Saul became self-willed, 'The Spirit of the Lord...left Saul...the Lord had sent a tormenting spirit that filled him with depression and fear.' (1 Samuel 16:14 TLB) Our pride and disobedience also allow Satan to invade our thoughts and emotions. But by humbling ourselves and aligning our will with God's will, we invite Him to reverse Satan's assault, overcoming our anxiety and depression. '...Whoever humbles himself will be exalted (lifted up).' (Matthew 23:12 NKJV) You have authority over the devil, but it only kicks in when you're submitted to God.</p>
<p>Here are three steps to victory found in James 4:7: (1) <em>'Submit yourselves...to God.'</em> This step aligns you with God's Word and power, and gives you the right to exercise dominion over the devil. (2) <em>'Resist the devil.'</em> This is military language. 'Resist the devil' implies a courageous, forceful, persistent refusal to let him prevail against you. (3) <em>'[The devil]...will flee from you,'</em> forfeiting his hold on your life and his ability to pour on the anxiety and depression.</p>

When a couple faces something that affects them differently, how do you make it work? (1) <i>Tell your spouse what you need</i>. Sometimes emotions are so overwhelming you don't know what you need. Do you need space? Do you want to talk? Do you want to be around people or be alone? Listen to your mate's feelings. You may both have very different needs. (2) <i>Deal with the core issue</i>. My husband didn't want to visit his family...and as we talked we discovered the real issue was he didn't think they would be very supportive - plus he didn't have the energy for a road trip of 1100 kms! (3) <i>Be willing to compromise</i>. I wanted to do something fun even if it wasn't with his family. We were able to meet both our needs by getting together with family members closer to home. (4) <i>Get help</i>. Sometimes there's no way to compromise. One spouse wants to talk and the other can't bear to bring it up. Find a counsellor, or a Christian friend who can temporarily fill the gap. Having others pray with and  you makes a huge difference. But protect the intimacy in your marriage, and don't let anything or anyone come between you and your spouse.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The Lord...gives you the ability to produce wealth...' Deuteronomy 8:18 NIV<br /><br /><p>God holds back '...no good from those who do what is right.' (Psalms 84:11 NLT) But it's important to acknowledge Him as the source of all your blessings. And on this one, we all fall short! Let's face it, more isn't always better. In fact, your dependence on God lessens as your dependence on things increases. That's why Levitical Law discouraged empire-building. In the Old Testament, loans to the poor were to be interest-free (Exodus 22:25); outstanding debts cancelled every seven years (Deuteronomy 15:1-2); slaves freed and given the means to start over (Deuteronomy 15:12-14); repossessed land redeemed by family (Leviticus 25:25); and property that was sold, or lost and not redeemed, returned to its original owner (Leviticus 25:14-17). Why? Because God wanted His people to depend on Him, not possessions. So He cautioned them, 'When...all you have is multiplied...You may say...My power and...strength...have produced this...remember the Lord...gives you the ability to produce wealth...' (Deuteronomy 8:13-18 NIV) God's principles haven't changed. Andy Stanley points out that a list of do's and don'ts is like having a man give you directions. If he hands you a map, you focus on it, but when you're following the man you focus on him. The Bible doesn't say that God is a rewarder of those diligently seeking 'things'. No - it says, '...He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.'(Hebrews 11:6 NKJV) Bottom line: if you're depending on anything but God, you'll always struggle. 'Don't worry about these things...your heavenly Father already knows...and...will give you everything you need.' (Matthew 6:31-33 NLT)</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Jesus knew what they were thinking... [in their hearts].' Luke 11:17 GNT<br /><br /><p>For a spiritual check-up to be effective, you must examine the following three areas: (1) <i>Forgiveness</i>. 'Make allowance for each other's faults, and forgive anyone who offends you. Remember, the Lord forgave you, so you must forgive others. Above all, clothe yourselves with love, which binds us all together in perfect harmony. And let the peace that comes from Christ rule in your hearts. For as members of one body you are called to live in peace...' (Colossians 3:13-15 NLT) Are you quick to forgive those who have hurt you? Do you try to resolve conflicts as soon as possible? Are you harbouring resentment? (2) <i>Soul winning</i>. 'Go therefore and make disciples of all nations...teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you...' (Matthew 28:19-20 NKJV) Do you have a concern for lost souls? Do you seize every opportunity to share your faith? Does your life show what your lips say? (3) <i>Prayer</i>. 'Seek the Lord and His strength; seek His face evermore!' (1 Chronicles 16:11 NKJV) Do you have a consistent prayer life? Do you pray faithfully for the needs of others? Have you learned to pray in faith, standing on God's Word and believing Him for great things? Do you see the results of your prayer life? Has your prayer life led you to a deeper intimacy with the Lord? If you're serious about in-depth change, growth in your spiritual walk, and developing a Christ-like character, spend time with the Lord today and say, 'Search me, O God, and know my heart; try me, and know my [thoughts]... lead me in the way everlasting.' (Psalm 139:23-24 NKJV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['When I was a child...When I became a man...' 1 Corinthians 13:11 NIV<br /><br /><p>Do you sometimes wonder if your teenager is  going to reach maturity? Welcome to the toughest phase of parenting! A teenager can go from optimism to pessimism, excitement to boredom, self-confidence to self-doubt, happiness to despair, sociability to reclusiveness, tranquillity to volatility, cooperation to opposition - in a head-spinning second! And when you ask them, 'What's wrong?' they say, 'Nothing,' or 'I don't know.' And the truth is; they don't! Bombarded by changing biochemistry, your child is navigating between the worlds of childhood and adulthood, needing your understanding and patience. For them the odyssey of adolescence can feel freakish, embarrassing and perplexing. Children know the roles and rules of their world, adults know . Children are expected to act like children, and adults like adults. But teenagers have traits of both worlds, yet belong in neither. When they're in child-mode, they're forbidden to be childish. 'Will you ever grow up?' we ask. When they're in adult-mode, they're denied adult privileges. 'Of course you can't...You're just a child!' The worlds of adults and children are relatively distinct, stable, predictable places. But it's not so in the fuzzy realm of your teen. They alternate between two worlds, never certain whether they're fish or fowl, adult or child. So they gravitate toward peers who share but also don't understand their experiences. What do they need? Parents who understand and assure them, 'When I was a child, I spoke...understood...thought as a child, like you do. But when I became a man [or woman], I outgrew the confusion, and you will too.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['There is one...mediator between God and men...Jesus.' 1 Timothy 2:5 KJV<br /><br /><p>Michael Spencer writes: 'The truth that Jesus is the one mediator between God and human beings knocked me to the floor and suspended me over the truth that God had done all things necessary for my salvation. He had paid the debt and become the necessary sacrifice. He had loved me to the uttermost. He had given all this to me as a gift. I had nothing to do but simply stop ignoring His gift and receive it. I was a drowning man whose rescue depended on stopping all efforts to swim and trusting someone who was not going to make me a better swimmer, but who would drown in my place. This experience...demolished the idea that I could be anything other than what I was: a broken, sinful, wounded, failing, hurting human being... To try to make myself presentable or acceptable made me less capable of receiving the simple gift of Jesus' mediation on my behalf. Jesus was not clearing the road so that I could ride victoriously through life. He was becoming the road that would carry me through all the garbage, falls, failures and disasters that were the inevitable results of my existence. In trying to make myself lovable, I had been distancing myself from true love. In pretending to be a leading candidate for the religious life, I was abandoning the life of grace. In seeking to be a good Christian, I was deserting the truth that there is no Gospel for good Christians, because the Lamb of God was nailed to an altar for those who are not good, and who are no good at pretending to be good.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Take the yoke I give you. Put it on your shoulders and learn from Me...' Matthew 11:29 CEV<br /><br /><p>The relationship Jesus had with the Father is a prototype of the relationship He wants you to have with Him.</p>
<p>Jesus was so intimate with the Father that He could say, '...I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me...' (John 14:11 NIV) Jesus was also intimately acquainted with the Holy Spirit. His first recorded sermon begins with: 'The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me...' (Luke 4:18 NAS) He was '...led by the Spirit...' (Matthew 4:1 NIV) and '...full of the Holy Spirit...' (Luke 4:1 NIV) He returned from forty very tough days of being tempted by the devil in the wilderness '...in the power of the Spirit...' (Luke 4:14 NIV) He was submitted to the Father and empowered by the Spirit. It was His habit to go to worship (Luke 4:16). It was His practice to memorise Scripture (Luke 4:4). Luke says Jesus '...often slipped away to be alone so He could pray.' (Luke 5:16 NCV) His times of prayer guided Him. He once returned from prayer and announced that it was time to move to another city (Mark 1:38), and another time of prayer resulted in the selection of His disciples (Luke 6:12-13). Jesus was led by an unseen hand. '...The Son does whatever the Father does.' (John 5:19 NCV) In the same chapter He stated, 'I can do nothing alone. I judge [each situation] only the way I am told...' (John 5:30 NCV)</p>
<p>Today pray, 'Father, keep me sharp, sensitive and surrendered to You in all things; not as a last resort but a first response. Take over. Jesus within me, live Your life through me!'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my daily bread.' Job 23:12 NIV<br /><br /><p>Psychologists are agreed on this point: people only keep doing what rewards them! So when Bible reading becomes unrewarding, we quit. As a result we feel guilty, and become spiritually weak and discouraged. Your soul can no more thrive without God's Word than your body can thrive without a daily intake of food. The Bible says, 'He humbled you, causing you to hunger and then feeding you with manna, which neither you nor your ancestors had known, to teach you that man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord.' (Deuteronomy 8:3 NIV)</p>
<p>One of the dangers of our always-connected technological age is that you begin to live on 'hits' of information and short messages limited to 160 characters or less. This creates spiritual ADD (attention deficit disorder). God cannot be reduced to a limited word count or a few hurried moments in your day. To prosper, you must meditate day and night on the Scriptures (Psalm 1:1-3). You say, 'But I don't have time to read the Bible.' How much time do you spend each day watching television? Hours? If you find television to be rewarding, but not God's Word, your soul is in need of intensive care!</p>
<p>If you want to change your life, change your habits and start reading the Bible. Job, who had more trouble than any of us will ever see, said, 'I have not departed from the commands of His lips; I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my daily bread.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...His own received Him not.' John 1:11 KJV<br /><br /><p>Sometimes the word 'no' simply means 'not now, but ask again.' So don't let rejection stop you. Take a look at your past experiences. You encountered rejection in school and on the playground. Not everybody liked you, but you made it anyway, right? Jesus experienced more rejection than anybody who ever lived. 'He came unto His own, and His own received Him not.' Did He quit? No, He went on to others, to those who discerned His value. 'But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become the children of God.' (John 1:12 NKJV)</p>
<p>Someone needs what you have; it is absolutely necessary to their success. Most great salespeople know that 14 out of 15 people will say no. So they hurry and make their presentations to as many as possible, in order to reach that one who will say yes. Jesus said, 'Whoever will not receive you...shake off the dust from your feet.' (Matthew 10:14 NKJV) When you encounter rejection, shake it off and move on. Sooner or later you will succeed if you don't quit. Don't personalise it; because someone rejects what you have to offer doesn't mean they're rejecting you. Paul writes: 'For a great and effective door has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.' (1 Corinthians 16:9 NKJV)</p>
<p>Opportunity and opposition - they go together like macaroni and cheese. Life is not going to hand you success on a silver platter; you've got to overcome adversity and outlast the opposition in order to walk through the door. And only two things are required: your faith and God's favour.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures...' Matthew 22:29 NIV<br /><br /><p>Did you know that most small-plane crashes are not caused by mechanical failure, but pilot error? In most cases the pilot was not instrument rated, so he or she depended on two things which can fail you.</p>
<p>Let's look at each: (1) <em>Sight</em>. As long as the pilots can see roads, bridges and landmarks, they can fly safely. But when the storm comes or the fog locks them in, they're in trouble. (2) <em>Senses. </em>In aviation terms the problem is called 'vertigo'. If you blindfold a person, sit them in a revolving chair, spin it around for several moments, then stop the chair and ask them in which direction they're spinning, they couldn't tell you with certainty. There's a sensitive device in our head that's like a carpenter's level. The force of the spinning sends the 'bubble' as far as it can go to one side. When it can go no further it begins to return - even though the person's still spinning in the same direction. So they have the sensation of stopping and beginning to spin in the opposite direction, but it's only a sensation. If they were not blindfolded and could see, they could ignore those sensations and would have no difficulty knowing in which direction they are going. It takes many hours of training in simulated storm conditions to develop the ability to confidently fly by the direction of your instruments and ignore your sensations of vertigo.</p>
<p>Understand this: as a child of God you must not be led by your sight or by your senses; you must be led only by the Scriptures.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The precepts of the Lord are right...giving light to the eyes.' Psalm 19:8 NIV<br /><br /><p>In their effort to steer around one storm, many pilots end up in another that's even worse. But the instrument rated pilot can fly directly into it. He can be totally 'fogged in', yet watch his instruments and fly without fear. But in order to do this he must have many hours of training in simulated storm conditions. Trouble, to him, is normal. He has gone through it many times and knows what to do in an emergency. He knows how to use his radio and receive help from the radar centres. He knows how to stay on the radio beams that are criss-crossing the skies for his safety. The mountain that suddenly looms before him first shows up on the controller's radar scope, so the controller can guide the straying plane around it.</p>
<p>Actually, if a pilot is not instrument rated, it's illegal for him to be in a storm. Why? Because if he hasn't taken the time, or felt it important to do his homework and be prepared, the millions of dollars' worth of equipment is no use to him.</p>
<p>How do you prepare for the storms of life? By spending time in God's Word. In-depth knowledge of your Bible is necessary if you're to be 'certified' to navigate life's storms. If you wait until trouble comes to find a Scripture to help you, you have waited too long. One Bible teacher says, 'If your mouth will feed your heart faith when you don't need it, your heart will feed your mouth faith when you do.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The entrance of Your words gives light; it gives understanding to the simple.' Psalm 119:130 NKJV<br /><br /><p>In order for you to be instrument rated, an instructor will accompany you on your training missions. The instructor will place a long-billed cap on your head, so that all you can see is the instrument panel in front of you. That's because this is all you'll be able to see when you're flying in storm conditions. You must learn to work your instruments and radio, doing many turns and being able to bring the plane down within a few feet of the landing strip. And you must do all this without ever looking to see where you are, without the confirmation of your senses. This simulated blindness, causing confusion to the average person, is soon overcome by disciplined training. The flights 'under the hood', as the procedure's called, become merely routine flights.</p>
<p>What happens when unprepared Christians are plunged into darkness by the trials of life? They begin to question what's happening. Everything was going well; all they could see ahead was fair weather. But now they've lost their sense of direction because they have not spent time in God's Word. They have not been taught to trust God regardless of what they see or feel, so they get discouraged, sometimes backslide, and sometimes even blame God and get swallowed up in bitterness.</p>
<p>Paul writes to Timothy, 'Study and be eager and do your utmost to present yourself to God approved (tested by trial), a workman who has no cause to be ashamed, correctly analysing and accurately dividing [rightly handling and skillfully teaching] the Word of Truth.' (2 Timothy 2:15 AMP)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...In this world you will have trouble...' John 16:33 NIV<br /><br /><p><em>I</em><em>nstrument rated for trouble</em>. Pastors and counsellors constantly 'pick up the pieces' of the broken lives of those who thought trouble would never come their way, so they didn't prepare for it. Paul wrote, 'We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed...' (2 Corinthians 4:8 KJV) Believers live in the same world as non-believers, but they handle it differently. That's because they have a different source, a different strategy, and a different spirit. God's promise is: 'He shall call upon Me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.' (Psalm 91:15 NKJV)</p>
<p>Some people dwell only on troubles. Others dwell only on deliverance. The secret of victory is in accepting that trouble will come, but knowing you're instrument rated to get through it because you've taken the time and training required to handle it scripturally. People say, 'If only I'd known this was going to happen, I'd have been ready for it.' It's foolish to go looking for trouble, but it's even more foolish not to be prepared for it. A wife hears her husband say, 'I'm in love with someone else.' A call comes from the police telling you that your son has been caught in a drugs bust. Your tearful teenage daughter tells you she's pregnant.</p>
<p>Get ready for trouble, because trouble is getting ready for you! In such times the instrument rated believer turns to their unfailing source: God's Word. 'He shall deliver you in six troubles: yes, in seven no evil shall touch you. In famine (recession) He shall (deliver) you... You shall laugh at destruction...' (Job 5:19-22 NKJV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Do not be dismayed, for I am your God...' Isaiah 41:10 NIV<br /><br /><p><em>I</em><em>nstrument rated for depression</em>. Depression, if left unchecked, can cause you to do some crazy things, like walk away from a good job or a healthy marriage, or turn to alcohol and drugs. The dictionary defines depression as 'to be flattened vertically or dispirited'. Now you know why sometimes you don't want to get out of bed in the morning. The word 'depression' is not mentioned in Scripture. The closest definition to it is 'heavy weight'. 'Anxiety in a man's heart weighs him down, but a good word makes him glad.' (Proverbs 12:25 ESV)</p>
<p>The toughest battles you will ever fight will be those with your own mind. What's the answer? Start speaking God's Word - out loud! 'For He Himself has said, I will never leave you nor forsake you. So we may boldly say: &quot;...The Lord is my helper; I will not fear. What can man do to me?&quot;' (Hebrews 13:5-6 NKJV) Pastor Sarah Utterbach points out: 'People say, &quot;The Lord has promised never to leave me nor forsake me,&quot; then they go right back to discussing their problem. In so doing they invalidate the power of what God said. The Holy Spirit is authorised to act on God's Word when you begin to say what God has said.' When you dwell on your problem, it's like a pilot flying by sight and senses. But when you agree with God's Word and begin to stand on it, you're flying by your instrument panel.</p>
<p>So get into God's Word, get God's Word into you, and start speaking it over your situation. 'My Word...will not return to Me empty...but will...achieve the purpose for which I sent it.' (Isaiah 55:11 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...he who does wrong will be repaid for what he has done, and there is no partiality.' Colossians 3:25 NKJV<br /><br /><p>John Ortberg writes: 'My friend Andy Chan headed up the placement office for Stanford School of Business, helping graduates find work. He says that some day he wants to write a book called <em>The Myth of Passion</em>. This is the myth that somewhere out there is the perfect job, the idealised calling that fits my soul the way a key fits into a lock. And if I could just find that job, torrents of passion would cascade out of my heart like water going over Niagara Falls.'</p>
<p>We have this romanticised idea that we will find 'job-love at first sight.' But what if you are in a job that doesn't excite you? Ortberg writes: 'Passion for our work is not usually a subterranean volcano waiting to erupt... It is a muscle that gets strengthened a little each day as we show up - as we do what is expected of us, and then some.'</p>
<p>Paul wrote: '...obey... not... as men-pleasers, but in sincerity of heart, fearing God. And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not to men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance; for you serve the Lord Christ. But he who does wrong will be repaid for what he has done, and there is no partiality.' (Colossians 3:22-25 NKJV) Maybe it would help to put a sign up on your desk: 'For God's sake - do your best!' Why? For two reasons: (1) Because you represent Christ in the workplace. (2) When you are faithful in small things, He will promote you to greater things (Matthew 25:21).</p>

Romans 12:5 NIV<br /><br /><p>An American veteran who was part of the D-Day invasion described meeting Churchill prior to the launch of that bloody offensive against the forces of Nazism. He said D-Day was the most frightening experience of his life. 'In fact,' he said, 'I don't think some of us would have been able to do what we did if it weren't for a visit we got just before we crossed the English Channel.' That visit was from Winston Churchill. He rode up in a jeep, got out and mingled with the troops. 'He shook hands with us and even hugged some of us,' the veteran recalled. 'He spoke of his own wartime experience and identified with our emotions. Then, he stood up in his jeep and gave a five-minute speech. He spoke the whole time with tears in his eyes.'</p>
<p>Here's what Churchill said: 'Gentlemen - I know you are afraid. I remember being afraid when I was a soldier. I had the privilege of defending my country... through dark days when we didn't know whether we would accomplish what we had been given to do. But this is your moment. We are counting on you to rise to the occasion and achieve everything you have set out to do. The fate of the free world rests on your shoulders. May this be your finest hour.' The veteran said, 'Needless to say, our group of frightened soldiers turned into a band of men who were ready to take on anybody.'</p>
<p>Togetherness - it's a powerful thing when you put it into practice!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!' Psalm 133:1 AMP<br /><br /><p>The word 'synergy' pictures a group of people working together in a great cause, each functioning at their highest level and enjoying it. John Wooden, former coach of the championship UCLA basketball team, said: 'During my coaching years and ever since, I have made a point of refraining from referring to the UCLA Bruins as my team or the individuals on it as my players... When asked, &quot;How did you win the game, Coach?&quot; I would correct the reporter and say, &quot;I didn't win the game. The players did. Our team outscored the opponent.&quot; This may be a small issue, but it is important to me because it reflects my idea that a team is owned by its members. When every member of a team takes ownership, good things happen. In celebrating victory, a wise leader always takes the accolades and passes them on to others.'</p>
<p>Paul regularly paid tribute to those who worked with him, acknowledging their contribution: 'Greet Priscilla and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus, who risked their own necks for my life, to whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles.' (Romans 16:3-4 NKJV) There's no doubt that God could get the job done without you, but you can't get the job done without the help of others.</p>
<p>Musician George Adams said, 'We are made up of thousands of others. Everyone who has ever done a kind deed for us, or spoken one word of encouragement to us, has entered into the makeup of our character and of our thoughts, as well as our success.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...God led you through the wilderness...to prove your character...' Deuteronomy 8:2 NLT<br /><br /><p>God led the children of Israel through the wilderness: 'to prove [their] character, and... find out whether or not [they] would obey His commandments.' They could choose to perish there, or trust Him to bring them safely to the Promised Land. One author writes: 'How many times have you changed courses in life, rather than pass the test and get through the tough stuff to the promises of God? He wants to know if you are worthy of the blessing that awaits you on the other side of the Jordan. Do you have the courage to face the challenges, or will you go back and settle for second best? If you're facing a challenge that stands between you and your promise...look at Joshua 1:9 and Daniel 10:19 for courage. Ask God to give you the courage to face whatever hurdles stand in the way of your claiming what God has prepared for you.'</p>
<p>The landscape along the USA's Florida's Everglades is dotted with wiry, primitive-looking trees known as Caribbean Pines. They thrive in a rugged environment, can withstand fire, prolonged periods of drought, and hold their own against the fiercest hurricanes. In fact, if you plant them in a cultivated setting they usually shrivel and die. Joni Eareckson Tada says: 'Like Caribbean Pines, our souls usually don't thrive during good times. Our hearts grow complacent, our need of God becomes less urgent, our hope of Heaven dims, and our prayer life dries up...in a beautiful setting with our needs met and every resource at our fingertips...our soul shrivels... We need an occasional blast of storm or fiery trial if our faith is to mature.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Is your life full of difficulties and temptations? Then be happy.' James 1:2 TLB<br /><br /><p>Lori Schneider is one of very few women to climb Mt. Everest - yet another step on a climb she started ten years earlier when she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS). Terrified, but determined to achieve her goal, she quit her job and devoted herself to climbing.</p>
<p>Nine years later she'd conquered the highest peaks on six of the earth's continents! 'Lori sees MS not as a negative, but a positive,' her father said. 'She accepted it as a challenge.' Unfurling a banner in honour of the first <em>World MS Day</em>, she called her dad on a satellite phone: 'I'm here Dad, I'm on the summit, I made it!'</p>
<p>A dream sixteen years in the making realised! Now her goal is to show others who face challenges that even the highest mountain can be climbed one step at a time.</p>
<p>In <em>Let It Go</em>, Mark Atteberry writes: 'The Christian life is about progress, not perfection. For that reason, you should never measure the distance between you and perfection (which is what all perfectionists insist on doing). That distance is completely irrelevant. If you want to measure something, measure the distance between where you are today and where you were yesterday. If you made a little progress in the right direction, even if it was just a centimetre, celebrate!'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['My anxious thoughts multiply within me...' Psalm 94:19 NAS<br /><br /><p>Your thought-life can be the incubator for anxiety and depression, so understand this:</p>
<p>(1) <em>Your thoughts are </em><em>yours! </em>'My anxious thoughts multiply within me.' You conceive, interpret, assign meaning to, accept or reject them. So be decisive about which thoughts are, or aren't, helpful. (2) <em>You </em><em>become</em><em> what your thought-life makes you</em> (Proverbs 23:7). It's not your circumstances, it's your thoughts about your circumstances that produce your emotions. Your thoughts trigger biochemistry that determines your feelings, their duration and their intensity. When you begin to think differently you'll feel differently. (3) <em>Your thoughts are </em><em>prolific</em><em>.</em> The Psalmist said they 'multiply' within you. Random thoughts may be temporarily upsetting, but they don't produce lasting anxiety or depression. That is the work of persistent thought patterns - negative thoughts that multiply, repeating themselves within you. You must 'take them captive' and 'bring [them] into obedience' to Christ-like thinking in order to control your feelings (2 Corinthians 10:4-5).</p>
<p>(4) <em>You </em><em>must</em><em> 'Let the Spirit renew your (individual) thoughts and attitudes (habitual mind-set).'</em> (Ephesians 4:23 NLT) Submit your thoughts to God's Spirit, allowing Him to approve or renew (replace) them with His thoughts. Anxiety and depression cannot continue to control you when you give God control of your mind. (5) <em>People</em><em> can contribute to your anxiety and depression.</em> They can make you want to live - or die! (Proverbs 18:21) They can reduce or increase your anxiety and depression. Avoid those who speak discouraging words, and spend time with those who speak '...a good word [that] makes [your heart] glad.' (Proverbs 12:25 NAS)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I am doing a great work...' Nehemiah 6:3 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Nehemiah was passionate about rebuilding Jerusalem's walls. So when his enemies tried to sidetrack and discourage him, he answered, '...I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down...' Passion is the starting point for all achievement. There has never been anyone who achieved anything of value, who wasn't passionate about it. It's the energy that fuels your dream. The road to success is cluttered with detours, problems and disappointments. And if you don't have the right mindset, your dreams can die there. Indeed, there are days when the needle on your passion meter will be on empty. On those days you need to remember that God gave you your dream to begin with; go back to Him and ask for the strength to keep moving toward it. The Psalmist wrote, 'For You will light my lamp; the Lord my God will enlighten my darkness. For by You I can run against a troop, by my God I can leap over a wall.' (Psalm 18:28-29 NKJV) Who gives you the power to run and leap? God! But you can't sit back, fold your arms and think that He will do it all for you. Between your dream's inspiration and its manifestation, there's going to be a lot of perspiration. As every new parent finds out - it's much harder having and raising a baby than conceiving one. But if you have the passion for your dream, the price tag won't stop you. You'll get up every morning, draw on God's grace and take one more step in the direction of the thing you know God put you on this earth to do.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...What does my Lord say to His servant?' Joshua 5:14 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Some issues are so crucial that, until you have resolved them, you cannot move forward or enjoy God's blessing in your life. Joshua faced such an issue when he stood before the towering walls of Jericho, the strongest city in the Promised Land and the first that had to be conquered. We read: 'And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted his eyes... and behold, a Man stood opposite him with His sword drawn... And Joshua...said to Him, &quot;Are You for us or for our adversaries?&quot; So He said, &quot;No, but as Commander of the army of the Lord I have now come.&quot; And Joshua...worshipped, and said to Him, &quot;What does my Lord say to His servant?&quot; Then the Commander of the Lord's army said to Joshua, &quot;Take your sandal off your foot, for the place where you stand is holy.&quot; And Joshua did so.' (Joshua 5:13-15 NKJV) So, what is your Jericho? What's the one big battle you must win in order to fulfil what God has planned for your life? Some battles can only be won on your knees. Before His victory at the cross, Christ, Who is our example, spent His hardest night in Gethsemane praying, '...Not My will, but Thine, be done.' (Luke 22:42 KJV) Are you intimidated by the size of the challenge? Do you think you don't have what it takes? Does it feel like you have been going round in circles and getting nowhere? Take time out. Get alone with God, and stay in His presence until He gives you His plan. Then say yes to it, and He will empower you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Thus far the Lord has helped us.' 1 Samuel 7:12 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says, 'Then Samuel took a stone...and called its name Ebenezer, saying, &quot;Thus far the Lord has helped us.&quot;' As you end this year and look back, what do you see? Monuments to failure? Wasted opportunities? When it comes to your failures, God says, 'I, even I, am He who blots out your transgressions for My own sake, and I will not remember your sins.' (Isaiah 43:25 NKJV) When it comes to your wasted opportunities, God says, 'I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten...' (Joel 2:25 NKJV) A wise man said, 'If we do not learn from the past we are doomed to repeat it.' It's ok to look back and learn, but if you drive looking in the rearview mirror, you'll end up in a ditch. Whether good or bad, don't get stuck in the past. 'Do not say, &quot;Why were the former days better than these? For you do not inquire wisely concerning this.&quot;' (Ecclesiastes 7:10 NKJV) One of the dangers of growing old is that you become more excited about the past than you are about the future. A lady wrote to a newspaper editor and said, 'Your newspaper is not as good as it used to be.' He wrote back and quipped, 'It never has been.' God says, 'I know the plans I have for you...they are plans for good...' (Jeremiah 29:11 TLB) God has a plan for you this coming year. So, 'hats off to the past and coats off to the future!' Roll up your sleeves, go to work, and expect great things from God.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...from that time waiting till His enemies are made His footstool.' Hebrews 10:13 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Yesterday we read the Scripture, 'Thus far the Lord has helped us.' (1 Samuel 7:12 NKJV) Today read this Scripture: '...from that time waiting till His enemies are made His footstool.' Note the words 'thus far' and 'from that time till'. The first refers to the past; the second refers to the future. If you're anxious about the future, recall God's faithfulness to you during the past. In the fullness of time, you'll be able to say, 'Not a single one of all the good promises the Lord had given...was left unfulfilled; everything He [has] spoken came true.' (Joshua 21:45 NLT) Who but God has a CV and a track record like that? Looking back, Paul recalled times when there wasn't enough money in the kitty and he had to go to work as a tentmaker in order to support his ministry. He could remember the whippings, the stonings and the betrayal at the hands of those he trusted. But listen to what he says about it: 'Therefore, having obtained help from God, to this day I stand...' (Acts 26:22 NKJV) Jeremiah felt the same way: 'Because of the Lord's great love we are not consumed, for His compassions never fail. They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness.' (Lamentations 3:22-23 NIV) So trust Him. AB Simpson wrote: 'It is strange we trust each other, and only doubt our Lord. We take the words of mortals, yet distrust His Word; But, oh, what light and glory, would shine for all our days; if we always would remember, God means just what He says.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Your Word is truth.' John 17:17 NIV<br /><br /><p>When your 'back is against the wall', where can you turn to find strength? Awash in a sea of moral and ethical questions, where can you go to find a reliable compass? Chuck Swindoll says: 'There can be no more reliable authority than God's Word. This timeless, trustworthy source holds the key that unlocks life's mysteries. It alone provides us with the shelter we need in times of storm.' Why does it qualify as our final authority? (1) <em>God's Word is Truth</em>. Jesus said as He prayed to the Father, 'Your word is truth.' Real truth you can rely on...that'll never shrivel up...turn sour...backfire or mislead...That's what the Bible's about... it provides us with the constant and needed support. (2) <em>'s Book is God's voice</em>. Paul writes, 'You received the Word of God...not as the word of men, but as...the Word of God, which...effectively works in you who believe.' (1 Thessalonians 2:13 NKJV) Consider it this way: if the Lord were to return to earth and speak, His message would tie in exactly with what you see in Scripture - His opinion, counsel, commands, desires, and warnings. When you rely on God's voice you have a sure foundation...truth that can be trusted...power that imparts new life and releases grace by which you can grow in faith and commitment. (3) <em>God's Word endures</em>. There are only two eternal things on earth today: people and God's Word. Everything else will ultimately be burned up...stuff we place on the shelf, things we put frames around, trophies and whatnots we shine and love to show off...all headed for the final bonfire (2 Peter 3:7-12). God's Book 'stands forever.' (1 Peter 1:25 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Do not be afraid of their faces, for I am with you...' Jeremiah 1:8 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Jeremiah writes: 'Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying: &quot;Before I formed you in the womb I knew you; before you were born I sanctified you [set you apart]; I ordained you a prophet to the nations.&quot; Then said I: &quot;Ah, Lord God! Behold, I cannot speak, for I am a youth.&quot; But the Lord said to me: &quot;Do not say, 'I am a youth,' for you shall go to all to whom I send you, and whatever I command you, you shall speak. Do not be afraid of their faces, for I am with you to deliver you,&quot; says the Lord. Then the Lord put forth His hand and touched my mouth, and...said: &quot;Behold, I have put My words in your mouth. See, I have this day set you over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out and to pull down, to destroy and to throw down, to build and to plant...I am ready to perform My word.&quot;' (Jeremiah 1:4-12 NKJV) Does the job you've been called to do seem too big for you? On your own, it is, but not when you include God! You're not working alone; God is with you. Whether it's to pull down or build up, the One who called you will equip you, empower you and give you success. He didn't make a mistake when He picked you. You say, 'If only I had the education, talent and experience of so-and-so.' If God wanted them, He'd have chosen them, but He chose you. Just be yourself, trust God, get on with it.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Life is not measured by how much you own.' Luke 12:15 NLT<br /><br /><p>What does 'the good life' mean to you? Driving the fastest car? Owning the biggest house? Wearing the latest clothes and having the most prestigious job? God's concept is very different. Jesus said, 'Guard against...greed. Life is not measured by how much you own.' GK Chesterton said, 'There are two ways to get enough. One is to continue to accumulate more and more. The other is to desire less and less.' Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn discovered this truth in a Soviet prison when his freedom, his friends, his home and his books were taken away. After months of solitude in Antarctica, Admiral Richard Byrd wrote, 'I'm learning...a man can live profoundly without masses of things.' What a great place to arrive at! Harold Sala writes, 'People today are possessed by possessions as no other generation...The more complex life becomes, the more convinced we are that we need more to be happy. Having obtained what we think we need, we soon become unhappy because a model with more bells and whistles comes out... It takes far less than we think to discover happiness if [it] comes from within and we break the stranglehold things have on our lives.' So, how much is enough? Jesus told the rich young ruler who wrestled with that question, '...Sell your possessions...give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow Me.' (Matthew 19:21 NIV) Not the answer he expected! Does that mean God is opposed to you having money? No, He's just against anything taking His place in your life! He knows that 'Your heart will be where your treasure is.' (Matthew 6:21 NCV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Daniel purposed in his heart...' Daniel 1:8 KJV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says, 'Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with...the king's meat.' Daniel had settled the issue, before the challenge arose. Joseph had also decided his values; therefore he was able to say 'no' to Potiphar's wife. The three Hebrew children already knew what they were going to do, fiery furnace or not: '...Our God...is able to deliver us...and He will... But if not...we do not serve your gods...' (Daniel 3:17-18 NKJV) What do you believe about God? If you think He might fail you, you'll never totally commit yourself to Him. Commitment grows! You can't make big commitments until you've first made small ones. The three Hebrew children first said 'no' to the king's food; later they were able to say 'no' to worshipping his idols. You don't get that kind of faith suddenly. Most of us can look back over the years and identify a point at which our lives changed significantly. Because of a readiness within us, we made a choice that would affect us from that point forward. But before you can make a real commitment to anything you must overcome three problems: (1) <i>The security problem</i>. Insecure people fear taking risks. They have a 'Plan B' in case God doesn't come through for them; they depend on themselves rather than on Him. (2) <i>The success problem</i>. When you've had some success you want to guard it. You want people to continue thinking well of you, so you start living defensively. (3) <i>The satisfaction problem</i>. The lukewarm Laodicean church said, 'I [have]...increased with goods, and have need of nothing.' (Revelation 3:17 KJV) So ask yourself, 'Am I complacent or committed?'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Seek His kingdom, and these things will be given to you as well.' Luke 12:31 NIV<br /><br /><p>At what point does  become greed? One author writes: 'Rarely does a person wake up and say, I've been living for an ego trip...I'm going to get rid of the big car and the fancy yacht and go and live in the slums...working with the poor. God deals with us individually. What may be ok for some, isn't necessarily ok for others...When Pastor Renny Scott began wrestling with this issue...he said, I just couldn't resolve the tension of living in a peaceful bedroom community while hell on earth was all around me in the form of hunger and poverty. He went to Africa with World Vision, which was the beginning of involvement with the needs of others. Next he moved into the inner city...That was the second step. Then he took a church of 50 which met in a school cafeteria. When a deacon suggested they give the entire Sunday morning offering to missions, Scott swallowed hard - because his salary was included! Eventually he and his wife came to grips with their lifestyle and did something I've challenged many to do...cap your lifestyle and say, This much and no more; and everything above that was given away...The little church grew into a body of 1,800 people who matched dollars for buildings with dollars for missions. Today they've taken on the challenge of helping homeless people find affordable housing. Scott said, I had to pause and ask myself what I'd want to be doing if Christ returned today. And I found myself answering from Matthew chapter 24 and 25 ...to take my talents and invest them [where the need was].'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['As an eagle stirs up its nest...so the Lord...led him...' Deuteronomy 32:11-12 NKJV<br /><br /><p>A mother eagle knows that if she waits for her young to get out of the nest and fly on their own initiative, it'll never happen. So she pushes them out! That's radical, but they learn to fly and fulfil their destiny. John Maxwell says: 'To succeed in life we must stay within our strength zone, but continually move outside our comfort zone. Have you ever accomplished anything of significance while you were in your comfort zone?' ...the answer is 'no', isn't it? We don't like moving outside our comfort zone. We resist it. We like to feel safe and secure. We don't want to look foolish or fall flat on our faces. And as we get older we tend naturally to become more and more complacent. That's a problem, because complacency kills passion. It reduces us to average. It clips our wings and keeps us from soaring, no matter how much we want to. It takes initiative to succeed at anything in life. It requires us to take risks. Playwright George Bernard Shaw asserted, 'I'm sick of all the reasonable people: they see all the reasons for doing nothing.' Passion prompts us to leave our comfort zone and cross the threshold of our doubt. It pushes us out the door, so that we can get going on the journey in life that God designed for us. It's said that when you get to the door of opportunity you're not supposed to knock - you're supposed to push!' So step out in faith, take the initiative, and believe that God is with you (Deuteronomy 31:6).</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Press toward the goal for the prize...' Philippians 3:14 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Albert Schweitzer said, 'Success is not the key to happiness, happiness is the key to success. If you love what you are doing, you will be successful.' When you feel passionate about something and allow yourself to pursue it, you position yourself to succeed in life. The majority of people in the world don't follow their passion; as a result, they're frustrated and unhappy. And you can see it in how they live their lives. Publisher Malcolm Forbes said, 'The biggest mistake people make in life is not trying to make a living at doing what they most enjoy.' As a result, they simply endure their working lives instead of making the most of them. They live for the weekends. They try to hang on until retirement. That's a shame, because your chance of success is directly proportional to the degree of pleasure you derive from what you do. Tommy Lasorda, manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team, said, 'The best day of my life is when I manage in a winning game. And the second best day of my life is when I manage in a losing game.' In other words, every day he was involved in the game was a day he was living his dream. Are you? Dreams come true when gifts are set on fire with passion. The best career advice you will ever receive is to discover your God-given passion and follow it. Logan Pearsall Smith said, 'There are two things to aim at in life; first, to get what you want; and after that, to enjoy it. Only the wisest of mankind achieve the second.' So 'press toward the goal for the prize.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...[The] curse does not come to rest.' Proverbs 26:2 NIV<br /><br /><p>Author Stormie Omartian grew up with a mother who told her she was worthless. She locked Stormie in a closet because she couldn't 'stand to see her daughter's face'! Stormie writes: 'I was raised by a mentally ill mother...and...her behaviour left me with guilt, hopelessness, helplessness and deep emotional pain. By the time I was a young woman I was still locked in - only the boundaries were emotional not physical - a deep, ever-present pain which expressed itself through self-destruction and paralysing fear. Years later [with help from a Christian counsellor] I learned that unforgiveness as deeply rooted as mine...must be unravelled one layer at a time. One day I felt led to pray, Lord, give me a heart like Yours for my mother. Immediately I had a vision of her as a beautiful, fun-loving, gifted woman with no resemblance to the person I knew... I was seeing her the way God made her to be, not the way she'd become. What an amazing revelation! In an instant I put together the pieces of her past - her mother's tragic death...the suicide of her beloved uncle and foster father,  feelings of abandonment, guilt, bitterness and unforgiveness...Touching the heart of God brought such forgiveness that when she died...I had no bad feelings. In fact, the more I forgave her the more God brought to mind good memories... People are often the way they are because of how life shaped them, and only God knows their history. To enjoy everything God has for you, pray a prayer of release and let go of the past.' Only then can you move on. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Get yourself ready! Stand up and say to them whatever I command you...' Jeremiah 1:17 NIV<br /><br /><p>Are you embarrassed about your beginnings? Jeremiah was. He begins his book by listing the good people and the bad people in his background. Well, guess what? We all came from a less-than-perfect gene pool! We're all a mixed bag. So what should you do? Learn from those who did it the wrong way, and follow those who did it the right way. Discover the purpose God put you on earth for, and fulfil it. Keep the torch burning brightly, then hand it over to the next runner. Endeavour to finish strong and hear your 'Well done, good and faithful servant.' And watch what you say! The words you speak not only influence others, they influence you too. When Jeremiah told God that he wasn't the right age, God said, 'Don't say that!' When he complained that he was not a gifted speaker, God said, 'Don't say that either!' When he saw the size of the opposition his knees buckled, but God said, 'Get yourself ready! Stand up and say to them whatever I command you. Do not be terrified by them, or I will terrify you before them. Today I have made you a fortified city, an iron pillar and a bronze wall to stand against the whole land - against the kings of Judah, its officials, its priests and the people of the land. They will fight against you but will not overcome you, for I am with you and will rescue you, declares the Lord.' (Jeremiah 1:17-19 NIV) And God didn't promise just to be with Jeremiah; He's promised to be with you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The Word of God which...effectively works in you...' 1 Thessalonians 2:13 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Observe two things: () <i>God's Word is inspired</i>. Chuck Swindoll writes: 'We've no problem with the Giver of truth...but wasn't the truth corrupted when He relayed it through sinful men? This is the perfect moment to get acquainted with revelation, inspiration and illumination. Revelation occurred when God gave His truth, inspiration when writers received and recorded it, and illumination when we understand and apply it. Your confidence in the Bible is directly related to your confidence in its inspiration. How can we be sure it's error-free and trustworthy? Paul provides help answering this question: All Scripture is inspired by God...for teaching...showing people what is wrong in their lives... correcting faults, and for teaching how to live right. (2 Timothy 3:16 NCV) When God revealed His truth to human writers He breathed out His Word. When we dictate a letter we breathe out a message and someone else types it. So did the writers simply take dictation? If you know much about the Bible you realise... Peter doesn't sound like John. John doesn't sound like David. Somehow each writer's personality was preserved without corrupting the text...That rules out the idea of dictation. Peter says, ...No...Scripture ever came from the prophet's own understanding, or...human initiative... [They] were moved by the Holy Spirit, and...spoke from God. (2 Peter 1:20-21 NLT) That answers that question! (2) <i>It'll hold you up</i>. When you go through chaotic experiences, God's Word gives you stability. No other counsel will get you through the long haul. No other truth will help you stand firm in storms of doubt and uncertainty. No other reality will give you the strength you need each day.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'My times are in Your hand...' Psalm 31:15 NKJV<br /><br /></p>
<p>The Psalmist writes, '...I trust in You, O Lord; I say, You are my God. My times are in Your hand...' (Psalm 31:14-15 NKJV) As you walk with God, you'll find you spend more time waiting than you do receiving. And when you receive what you're waiting for, then you'll begin waiting for something else! So if you don't learn to wait with joy, you'll live in frustration. Paul writes, 'Let us not grow weary while doing good: for in due season we shall reap, if we do not lose heart.' (Galatians 6:9 NKJV) 'Due season' is when God knows the time is right, not when you think it is. God has a set time for accomplishing things in your life, so you might as well settle down and wait because that's when it will happen, and not before. God knows what you need, you need it, and how to get it to you. You ask, 'And what am I supposed to do while I'm waiting?' Trust Him! One Bible teacher writes: 'God has taught me to keep living the life I now have while I'm waiting for the things that are in my heart to come to pass. We become so intent on trying to give birth to the next thing, that we neither enjoy nor take care of the things at hand. I had a vision from God ten years before I began to see it fulfilled. During those years I believe I missed a lot of joy by trying to give birth outside of God's timing. Learn to enjoy where you are, while you are waiting to get to where you want to be.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['That they should seek the Lord, in the hope that they might...find Him, though He is not far from each one of us.' Acts 17:27 NKJV<br /><br /><p>When Jesus was born, the biggest issue of the day was wanting lower taxes and a different government. Sound familiar? In Jerusalem, the capital, we read, 'When Herod the King heard [about Jesus], he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.' (Matthew 2:3 NKJV) As a result, he committed one of history's greatest atrocities by killing every Jewish baby boy under the age of two, in order to get at Jesus. And today Jesus still forces a reaction in the hearts of men and women! That's why some people want to take Him out of the classroom, the courtroom and government. The forces of darkness are set on a course of trying to remove His name, His influence and His authority from all public life. Why? Because when you do away with God, there's no higher power than yourself, so you get to play God! Lenin, the father of Russian Communism, reputedly said of Christ, 'His kingdom is invisible, His rule is in the hearts of men, so He can't be tolerated.' As a result, over 20 million people died during the Russian revolution in an attempt to build an atheistic state. But fighting God is futile; it's a battle you can't win, because ultimately '...every knee shall bow... and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.' (Philippians 2:10-11 NIV) Every prophecy concerning Christ's first coming was fulfilled to the letter, and every prophecy concerning His second coming will be too. So if you want to meet Him in peace, surrender your life to Him today and accept Him as your Saviour.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Search the Scriptures, for...these are they which testify of Me.' John 5:39 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The birth of Jesus divides history into two parts: B.C. (before Christ) and A.D. (after Christ). History is - <em>His</em> story! Let's observe where else the wise men didn't find Christ: <em>the church</em>. Amazing, isn't it? Teachers and theologians pored over their dusty parchments as they had done for generations. They taught their congregations the Messiah was coming, but they failed to recognise or acknowledge Him when He arrived. Yet the Old Testament Scriptures they read were filled with it. They described His ancestry: God told Abraham, '...All peoples on earth will be blessed through you and your offspring.' (Genesis 28:14 NIV) They identified the tribe from which He would be born: 'The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh [the Prince of Peace] come; and to Him shall be the obedience of the people.' (Genesis 49:10 NKJV) They described His family of origin: 'A shoot will come up from the stump of Jesse [father of David]; from his roots a Branch will bear fruit. The Spirit of the Lord will rest on Him...' (Isaiah 11:1-2 NIV) They foretold His virgin birth: '...The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call Him Immanuel [which means <em>God with us</em>].' (Isaiah 7:14 NIV) The prophet Daniel actually declared the time of His birth (Daniel 9:25). And this God of precision and forethought has a plan for your life too - the only plan that can satisfy and bring you happiness. And the good news is: He comes by invitation. So invite Him into your life today.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['He...ran out of the house.' Genesis 39:12 NIV<br /><br /><p>Observe how some of God's champions dealt with Satan's attack, so you'll know how to handle it when it comes. Joseph ran. '...Now Joseph was well-built and handsome, and after a while his master's wife took notice of Joseph and said, &quot;Come to bed with me!&quot; But he refused...&quot;How then could I do such a wicked thing and sin against God?&quot; And though she spoke to Joseph day after day, he refused to go to bed with her or even be with her. One day he went into the house to attend to his duties, and none of the household servants was inside. She caught him by his cloak and said, &quot;Come to bed with me!&quot; But he left his cloak in her hand and ran out of the house.' (Genesis 39:6-12 NIV) Notice the setting for this attack: Joseph was young, single, lonely, and far from home. And Potiphar's wife tried to seduce him 'day after day'. Giving in to her may actually have helped his career, but Joseph had a very different value system. His character meant more to him than his career. God's approval meant more to him than the boss' favour. After his affair with Bathsheba David wrote, 'I will set nothing wicked before my eyes...' (Psalm 101:3 NKJV) Whether it's an affair or an online fantasy, pull your eyes away! Lust is like a tiger; once uncaged, it will prowl through your mind and prey on your thoughts. What it won't do, is willingly go back into its cage. So if you haven't looked, don't! If you have, pray for victory and get it out of your life.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...A brother is born for adversity.' Proverbs 17:17 NIV<br /><br /><p>Nehemiah discovered that not everybody will be happy about your success. 'Sanballat ...sent to me, saying, &quot;Come, let us meet together...&quot; But they thought to do me harm. So I sent messengers to them, saying, &quot;I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down. Why should the work cease while I leave it and go down to you?&quot; But they sent me this message four times, and I answered them in the same manner.' (Nehemiah 6:2-4 NKJV) Note the words, 'I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down.' That could be classified as an Academy Award-winning response to attack! Any time you stop the work God has given you to do and step down to the level of your critics, you've sent the devil a signal that his strategy is working. So you can expect more of the same. Think: if God can deliver you in times of trouble, surely He can defend you in times of misunderstanding! So get back up on the wall He has called you to build and keep working. Don't get distracted. There are three kinds of people you will meet in life: (1) <em>The critic</em>. They're the first to point an accusing finger and the last to extend a helping hand. (2) <em>The cautious</em>. When you're in trouble they'll distance you lest they become tainted by your perceived liabilities. These people are not bad, they're just self-serving. Don't put your trust in them. (3) <em>The committed</em>. 'A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.' Recognise such people and build your life around them because they are a gift from God.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['But Paul shook the snake off...' Acts 28:5 NIV<br /><br /><p>Luke writes: 'The islanders showed us unusual kindness. They built a fire and welcomed us all because it was raining and cold. Paul gathered a pile of brushwood and, as he put it on the fire, a viper...fastened itself on his hand. When the islanders saw the snake hanging from his hand, they said to each other, &quot;This man must be a murderer; though he escaped from the sea, Justice has not allowed him to live.&quot; But Paul shook the snake off into the fire and suffered no ill effects. The people expected him to swell up or suddenly fall dead, but after waiting a long time and seeing nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and said he was a god.' (Acts 28:2-6 NIV) People's opinions are often fickle, so here's a response you need to adopt: 'Shake it off!' These people started out thinking Paul was an escaped criminal, and ended up thinking he was a god. Incredible! There is an important lesson here. Beware of those who change their mind about you when your circumstances change. Build your life on those who believe the best about you, and want to bring it out. Behind Paul's spectacular success in ministry you will find people who never stopped believing in him. He writes, 'Priscilla and Aquila...risked their lives for me...' (Romans 16:3-4 NIV) He called Epaphroditus '...my brother, fellow worker, and fellow soldier...who ministered to my need.' (Philippians 2:25 NKJV) He says that Onesiphorus '...often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains.' (2 Timothy 1:16 NIV) Look for such people; they'll bless you. And they're out there!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Lord...said to me, Now, I have put my words in your mouth.' Jeremiah 1:9 NIV<br /><br /><p>The people God calls usually start out feeling ill-equipped and insecure. Indeed, if you jumped up and said, 'No problem, Lord, I can handle that,' He wouldn't call you at all. You say, 'But I've made so many mistakes.' Everybody falls; the winners are just the ones who get back up again. 'The Lord delights in a man's way, He makes his steps firm; though he may stumble, he will not fall, for the Lord upholds him with his hand.' (Psalm 37:23-24 NIV) When Jeremiah told God that he had neither the competence nor confidence needed to do the job, God said to him what He says to us: (1) <em>You are not going in your own authority</em>. '...You must go to everyone I send you to...' (Jeremiah 1:7 NIV) Who's sending you, sponsoring you and sustaining you? God! What more do you need? (2) <em>The message is not yours</em>. 'You must...say whatever I command you.' (Jeremiah 1:7 NIV) Don't agonise, compromise, rationalise or apologise. Just say what God told you to say and He will do the rest: '...For I am watching to see that My word is fulfilled!' (Jeremiah 1:12 NIV) (3) <em>When God touches you, you're qualified</em>. 'Then the Lord reached out His hand and touched my mouth and said to me, &quot;Now, I have put My words in your mouth.&quot;' (Jeremiah 1:9 NIV) Be yourself; you can't be anybody else! You're not who others say you are; you're who God says you are! So you can do what God says you can do. Just get in agreement with Him.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'You will seek Me and find Me, when you search for Me with all your heart.' Jeremiah 29:13 NKJV<br /><br /></p>
<p>Notice where the wise men can't find Christ: <i>in the business world</i>. Every motel in Bethlehem was sold out with a 'No vacancy' sign. Not much has changed, eh? Thirty percent of all retail sales in department stores take place over the Christmas-time holidays. Fifty percent of all parties are held during Christmas and New Year. One out of every ten litres of alcohol is sold then too. Clearly, Jesus is good for business. The trouble is, we prefer the myth to the Master. We want a Santa but not a Saviour. We want the fairy tale but not the fact. What fact? That Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners (1 Timothy 1:15). The story's told of a child who was chosen to play the innkeeper in the Christmas nativity, telling Mary and Joseph that there was no room for them at the inn. But on the night of the big event, he stood onstage, looked into the faces of the audience, froze in fear, then smiled and announced, 'I'm not supposed to do this, but come on in anyway!' The hymnist wrote, 'Room for pleasure, room for business, but for Christ the crucified; not a place that He can enter, in the heart for which He died.' Instead of ending this Christmas exhausted, disappointed, and in debt, invite Jesus into your life. You may be looking back with regret on some bad decisions you've made this year, but making Jesus your Lord and Saviour this Christmas is the best decision you'll ever make.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Not one of them falls to the ground apart from your Father's will.' Matthew 10:29 NKJV<br /><br /><p><i>A</i><i> fallen sparrow</i>. Jesus said, 'Are not two sparrows sold for a copper coin? And not one of them falls to the ground apart from your Father's will.' Great news: God knows when you fall, and His will is to lift you up again. Perhaps you were flying high, then you made a mistake. You were sabotaged by a secret struggle you couldn't share with anyone. Or your trust was devastated by someone you loved. As a result you are afraid to begin again; afraid you can't overcome your past and rise again to fulfil your destiny. Regardless of how many times you've failed, God still loves you. Have you been attacked in a specific area of your life and it's become an area of repeated failure? Have you asked yourself, 'What is this battle about?' Hear this: the battle is not over your past, it's over your future! That's why you are a target. And the God Who gave Peter and Jonah a second chance, will lift you from the ashes of failure and remake your life into something beautiful. God saw you when you fell, so there's no reason to try and hide from Him. Like the shepherd who went looking for his one lost sheep, God is looking for you today. Not to condemn you but to restore you. Self-exaltation leads to pride, which God hates. But self-loathing leads to paralysis. There's only one unpardonable sin (Mark 3:22-30, Matthew 12:31-32), so you can go to God with confidence knowing He will give you a fresh start. And this time He will empower you to be strong and succeed. </p>

They don't plant or harvest or store food in barns, for your heavenly Father feeds them. And aren't you far more valuable to Him than they are? Can all your worries add a single moment to your life? And why worry about your clothing? Look at the lilies of the field and how they grow. They don't work or make their clothing, yet Solomon in all his glory was not dressed as beautifully as they are. And if God cares so wonderfully for wildflowers that are here today and thrown into the fire tomorrow, He will certainly care for you. Why do you have so little faith?...These things dominate the thoughts of unbelievers, but your heavenly Father already knows all your needs. Seek the Kingdom of God above all else, and live righteously, and He will give you everything you need.' (Matthew 6:26-33 NLT) If you need some more Scriptural promises to stand on, here they are: 'Fear the Lord, you His godly people, for those who fear Him will have all they need.' (Psalm 34:9 NLT) 'Blessed is the man who fears the Lord, who delights greatly in His commandments. His descendants will be mighty on the earth; the generation of the upright will be blessed. Wealth and riches will be in his house...He will not be afraid of evil tidings; his heart is steadfast, trusting in the Lord.' (Psalm 112:1-7 NKJV) God recorded these promises in His Word so that you could read them over and over, and in reading them, rise above worry and live your life with joy and confidence.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Hold fast what is good.' 1 Thessalonians 5:21 NKJV <br /><br /><p>Someone wrote: 'Today we mourn the passing of an old friend - common sense. He devoted his service to schools, hospitals and churches; he got jobs done without fanfare and foolishness. For decades, silly rules and frivolous lawsuits didn't affect him. He cultivated practices like sharing with others, teaching kids spiritual values and living within your means. He survived the Industrial Revolution and the Great Depression. But he couldn't withstand the ravages of declining moral and spiritual values. He watched as leaders became corrupt and good people became apathetic. He saw the Ten Commandments outlawed in public buildings, prayer banned from the classroom and criminals enjoying more rights than their victims. He watched in despair as teachers who needed parental consent to administer an aspirin, couldn't tell a parent their child wanted an abortion. Common sense was predeceased by truth, trust and responsibility. His funeral wasn't well attended; few realised he had gone!' In a recent Gallup Poll, 50% of those interviewed said they believe there are 'no absolutes' when it comes to good and evil. Look around you and you'll see the results of that kind of thinking! But God doesn't share their opinion. His Word says, 'Test all things; hold fast what is good. Abstain from every form of evil.' (1 Thessalonians 5:21-22 NKJV) God told Israel not to remove the ancient boundary markers. God establishes boundaries for our protection, blessing and guidance (Proverbs 22:28). So stand up for what's right and don't fear criticism. Darkness has never been a friend of light, or wrong a companion of right. Nevertheless, walk in the light and always do what's right.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...Wise men...came to Jerusalem, saying, Where is He who has been born King of the Jews?' Matthew 2:1-2 NKJV<br /><br /></p>
<p>Why would someone leave the comfort of their home, travel thousands of kilometres by camel, brave blistering deserts fraught with robbers and hazards to follow a star to an unfamiliar destination? There’s only one answer: wise men and women have always hungered for God. It’s said that the three most sought-out words on the internet today are ‘work’, ‘sex’ and ‘God’. Work addresses our need for security; sex addresses our need for companionship and intimacy; God addresses our need to be forgiven, to experience peace and joy, and understand our life’s purpose on earth. It’s why primitive tribes who don’t know God make gods out of mountains, trees and rocks. Deep down we all have a need to experience something bigger than ourselves; someone capable of loving us, protecting and directing us. When his life fell apart Job cried, ‘Oh, that I knew where I might find Him, that I might come to His seat!’ (Job 23:3 NKJV) The ancient Greeks had an altar on Mars Hill with the inscription, ‘To the unknown God’. Then Paul told them, ‘…What you worship as something unknown I am going to proclaim to you.’ (Acts 17:23 NIV) The good news of Christmas is, you can seek God and find Him, by coming to know Jesus as your own personal Saviour. Hosea called Israel back to God with these words: ‘Oh, that we might know the Lord! Let us press on to know Him. He will respond to us as surely as the arrival of dawn…’ (Hosea 6:3 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Let me not be ashamed of my hope.' Psalm 119:116 KJV<br /><br /><p>The Psalmist wrote, 'Uphold me according to Your Word, that I may live; and do not let me be ashamed of my hope.' What is our hope? It's found in the second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Paul spells it out: 'We believe that Jesus died and rose again and so we believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in Him...For the Lord Himself will come down from Heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air...' (1 Thessalonians 4:14-17 NIV) Jesus said, '...For a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear His voice and come out - those who have done good will rise to live, and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned.' (John 5:28-29 NIV) In that day the Lord's Prayer will finally be answered: 'Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in Heaven.' (Matthew 6:10 KJV) The hymnist Horatio Spafford wrote, 'O Lord, 'tis for Thee, for Thy coming we wait. The sky, not the grave, is our goal. O trump of the angel! O voice of the Lord! Blessed rest, blessed hope of my soul.' Jesus has not changed His mind; He's coming again. Coming for whom? For a prepared people, to take them to a prepared place, where they will dwell with Him forever. Are you planning to be there?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Ezra...brought the Law before...all who could hear with understanding...' Nehemiah 8:2 NKJV<br /><br /><p>You will accomplish more through others than you will ever accomplish alone. But you'll only do it if you're able to give clear direction. The story's told of a coach who always communicated his goal to his runners before the race. Just before the starter's gun sounded he would say, 'Stay to your left, and get back here as soon as you can.' It doesn't get any clearer than that! Ed Rowell says, 'A dream is a better future in need of an architect who will show others how to make it a reality.' So you must be an architect. You must identify the dream and be able to draw it, not only for your benefit but also for the benefit of others. If you create a fuzzy picture, people will follow you in a fuzzy way. Lack of clarity hinders initiative, inhibits persistence, and undermines follow-through. People don't give their best to something they don't understand. They don't stay on course for something they cannot see. Nobody becomes motivated by something they kinda, sorta, believe in. The Bible says, 'Let all things be done decently and in order.' (1 Corinthians 14:40 NKJV) God is a God of order, and He honours our efforts when they are carried out in a clear and orderly way. God instructed the prophet Habakkuk, 'Write the vision and make it plain on tablets, that he may run who reads it.' (Habakkuk 2:2 NKJV) If you are not clear as to your vision, seek God's guidance, write down what He tells you, and communicate it to those you need to tell in a clear, step-by-step, orderly way.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...How can they hear, unless someone tells them?' Romans 10:14 CEV<br /><br /><p>One author writes: 'While visiting my parents I needed a haircut, so I went to where my mum goes. As the owner Jim trimmed my hair, we started talking about spiritual things. The more we talked...the more he cut. I ended up with very short hair, but our conversation about Jesus was worth it. Later, when I suggested to my mum that she invite Jim and his wife to church, she said, No way they'd be interested...they lead a pretty wild life. I don't know two people further from God. Nevertheless...the next time she went to the salon, she shot up a silent prayer: God, I don't think these people are interested in You. So if You want me to say anything...make something happen. Just then Jim's wife said, I understand you're in a group that discusses spiritual things. We'd like to come. Pam and Jim...eventually prayed with my folks and gave their lives to Christ - all because of a conversation that developed over a series of haircuts. This kind of reaction rarely happens. Most Christians spend virtually all their time with other Christians...But when it comes to important matters...people listen to people they trust...especially about spiritual matters. Paul says, How can people have faith in the Lord...if they have never heard about Him? And...unless someone tells them? If people are going be reached for Christ, for the most part, it'll happen through friends, not . So, cultivate a relationship with somebody who works at a restaurant you frequent, or the people at your gym. Invite the neighbours over for dinner...follow Christ's example and befriend people who don't know God.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...How can they hear, unless someone tells them?' Romans 10:14 CEV<br /><br /><p>John Ortberg says: () '<i>Never rule anybody out</i>. Jesus reached out to tax collectors, lepers, sinners and Gentiles, and they shocked the religious establishment by saying yes...Maybe there's somebody in your world who's so far from God you've written them off...a relative who ridicules your faith...an acquaintance who's resisted for years...somebody so steeped in sin you think there's no hope? Never say no for another person...you don't know when their heart will soften or how God's Spirit will work.' (2) <i>Put yourself in the other person's shoes</i>. Ortberg continues: 'Blocks from my parents' home...is the largest Buddhist temple in America. I checked it out and received amazing insight into how intimidating it is to go into a place of worship as a stranger not knowing the customs. When you invite someone to church, they're much more likely to go if you go together. Then have a coffee together and talk about what took place.' (3) <i>Be the hands and feet of Jesus</i>. Jewish law prohibited lepers from having contact with non-lepers. But when a leper approached Jesus, He reached out and touched the man who hadn't been touched in years (Mark 1:40-45). Was Jesus infected by his leprosy? No, He infected the leper with the Gospel, because Jesus was more contagious with God's power than the leper was with his disease. Be a contagious Christian who infects others with God's love. Look at your hands. How often do you extend them to someone far from God? His Kingdom has been spread the same way for two thousand years: by believers who reach out and bring people to Christ!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['On behalf of a man he pleads with God...' Job 16:21 NIV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says: 'So Joshua fought the Amalekites...and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went to the top of the hill. As long as Moses held up his hands, the Israelites were winning, but whenever he lowered his hands, the Amalekites were winning. When Moses' hands grew tired...Aaron and Hur held his hands up...So Joshua overcame the Amalekite army...' (Exodus 17:10-13 NIV) This story illustrates the power of intercessory prayer. Far from the crowd, but seen by the eye of God, are men and women who 'hold up the hands' of ministries in prayer. And God is looking for more of them. Charles Finney had an intercessor called Abel Clary who travelled with him wherever he went. Finney wrote, 'Mr. Clary continued as long as I did, and he did not leave until after I had left. He never appeared in public, but he gave himself wholly to prayer.' Finney may have impacted nations, but he didn't do it alone. Job writes, 'My intercessor is my friend...on behalf of a man he pleads with God as a man pleads for his friend.' (Job 16:20-21 NIV) The ministry of intercessory prayer is: (1) <i>A ministry of </i><i>identification</i><i>in which you stand with others</i>. (2) <i>A ministry of </i><i> which calls you away from the pleasures and comforts of life</i>. (3) <i>A ministry of </i><i>authority,</i><i>for your prayers move the hand of God on behalf of others</i>. Today the God Who said, 'I sought for a man among them, who would...stand in the gap before Me on behalf of the land...' (Ezekiel 22:30 NKJV), is looking for intercessors. You can be one of them!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I will restore to you...' Joel 2:25 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Whatever life has taken from you, God can restore. He may not give you exactly what you want, but He will give you what's best. And even when you fall under His corrective hand through disobedience, if you repent, He will reinstate you to a place of blessing. You say, 'But what about the time I've wasted, the opportunities I've squandered, and the mess I've made of my life? Sometimes I wonder if I've fallen so low that even God cannot reach me.' No, there's hope for you. The Bible says, 'Behold, the Lord's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; nor His ear heavy, that it cannot hear.' (Isaiah 59:1 NKJV) After wasting all that he'd inherited from his father, the Prodigal Son returned home, penniless and embarrassed. All he wanted was three square meals and a job in the servants' quarters. But the moment he confessed his sin, his father called for the best robe, the fattest cow, the newest shoes, and a ring of sonship restoring him to his rightful place as a member of the family. Even under the crushing weight of the Old Testament Law, with demands that no one could live up to, God said, 'If a man steals an ox or a sheep...he shall restore five oxen for an ox and four sheep for a sheep.' (Exodus 22:1 NKJV) Now if God would do that for those who lived under the Law and on the wrong side of the cross, how much more will He do for those He has redeemed? So you can go to Him today with confidence, knowing He's a God of restoration.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...You shall surely...recover all.' 1 Samuel 30:8 NKJV<br /><br /><p>One day the Amalekites swept down on King David's home town, burning it to the ground and taking its families captive. In this scene of devastation, David and his men '...lifted up their voices and wept, until they had no more power to weep.' (1 Samuel 30:4 NKJV) Now, God will let you grieve your losses because that's healthy, but He won't allow you to stay there too long. So God said to David, 'Pursue, for you shall surely overtake them and without fail recover all.' (1 Samuel 30:8 NKJV) Did David and his men get back everything they had lost? Yes, and much more besides, for our God is not only a God of restoration but a God of abundance. You say, 'I feel so ashamed of the years I have wasted.' The God Who created time can give you more of it. 'I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten... the consuming locust...You shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, and praise the Name of the Lord your God, who has dealt wondrously with you; and My people shall never be put to shame.' (Joel 2:25-26 NKJV) Notice the word, 'plenty'. When God blesses you, it will not come from an eyedropper or from a rationed supply. No, you'll be able to sing, 'His love hath no limit; His grace hath no measure, His power no boundary known unto men. For out of His infinite riches in Jesus, He giveth, and giveth, and giveth again.' Ever since Adam and Eve 'blew it' in Eden, God's desire and plan has been to restore to us all that we have lost. So come to Him today and let the restoration begin. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...That you through His poverty might become rich.' 2 Corinthians 8:9 NIV<br /><br /><p>Are you saying, 'If only I hadn't said, or done...'? You're not unique; we all have our regrets. But God wants us to learn from them, not  in them. 'For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that you through His poverty might become rich.' Jesus wore the crown of thorns so you could wear the crown of righteousness, and be in right standing with God. 'Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.' (Romans 5:1 KJV) Being justified gives you the right to stand before God and claim His best. Is your business struggling or failing? Peter the fisherman experienced that too. So Jesus, the Restorer, said to him: '...Launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch. But Simon answered and said to Him, Master, we have toiled all night and caught nothing; nevertheless at Your word I will let down the net. And when they had done this, they caught a great number of fish, and their net was breaking. So they signalled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink.' (Luke 5:4-7 NKJV) Just one word from Jesus, and you can go from the threshold of bankruptcy to adding a second boat. Jesus actually gave Peter back more than he lost. So the word for you today is, 'Believe for more than you expected, because our God is a God of restoration.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Your God will come with...recompense [restoration].' Isaiah 35:4 NKJV<br /><br /><p>What you give up in order to serve God is nothing compared to what you will get back. 'Peter answered and said to Him, See, we have left all and followed You...So Jesus said to them, Assuredly I say to you...you who have followed Me...and...left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands, for My name's sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and inherit eternal life.' (Matthew 19:27-29 NKJV) That means God can give you back a hundred times more than what you've sacrificed in order to serve Him. Are you feeling weak and ineffective today? Read these words and stand on them: 'Strengthen the weak hands, and make firm the feeble knees. Say to those who are fearful-hearted, Be strong, do not fear! Behold, your God will come with vengeance, with the recompense [restoration]...He will come and save you.' (Isaiah 35:3-4 NKJV) You say, 'But I have lost my joy.' God can give it back to you in overflowing measure: 'And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with singing, with everlasting joy on their heads. They shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.' (Isaiah 35:10 NKJV) You say, 'But I have so little to show for my efforts.' Then stand on this promise: '...And the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose; it shall blossom abundantly...' (Isaiah 35:1-2 NKJV) Rejoice; your God is a God of restoration, so your best days are ahead of you!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Your face, Lord, I will seek.' Psalm 27:8 NKJV<br /><br /><p>At the end of a play, a leading actor held his audience spellbound as he recited the Twenty-Third Psalm. He did it as an encore, and it brought the house down with applause. Looking across the room, he spotted his old vicar and called him to say something. To their surprise, he too recited the Twenty-Third Psalm. When he had finished, there was silence. The audience dried tears from their eyes. At this point the actor stood beside his old vicar and said, 'Ladies and gentlemen, the difference is, I know the Twenty-Third Psalm, but he knows the Shepherd!' Dr. Alexander Maclaren, the great Scottish preacher, attributed everything he knew to one habit: spending an hour each day alone with God. Sometimes he allowed others into his study, but they were never allowed to speak. Maclaren would sit in a well-worn armchair with his Bible lying across his knees. Sometimes he'd read its pages, but mostly he'd just sit with his hand over his face. During that hour he wouldn't read the Bible as a student, or study it for sermons. One of his assistants noted, 'He read it as a child would read a letter from an absent father, or your heart would drink in the words of a loved one from far away.' How well do you know the Lord? How well do you want to know Him? The answer is not in what you say, but in what you . What you truly desire, you pursue. The Psalmist said, 'When You said, Seek My face, my heart said to You, Your face, Lord, I will seek.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I will pour out water to quench your thirst...' Isaiah 44:3 NLT<br /><br /><p>Julie Coleman writes: 'I was heading to a writer's conference in Philadelphia when I realised I'd better think about stopping for petrol... Normally I'm fussy about where I stop...but as I drove the lonely stretch of road, I began to feel desperate... any minute...I'd be stranded in 40-plus degrees and I didn't even have a water bottle...I drove several long [kilometres] until I came to a tiny crossroads. Four houses....and a petrol station! It looked like it could be called 'Joe's Petrol Station and Storm Door Company'...I'd probably have turned up my nose at it in another circumstance. But at that moment [it] was the best thing I'd ever seen! Funny how our circumstances can dictate how we feel!' Running from his enemies, David prayed, '...My soul thirsts for you...in a dry, parched land where there is no water... I look for You in the holy place to see Your power and glory...' (Psalm 63:1-2 GWT) Would his prayer have been different if David had been living in luxury surrounded by servants? Not knowing where his next meal was coming from and sleeping outside every night changed his perspective. When life goes well, we become self-sufficient and forget God. Spiritually speaking, we run on empty until a spark ignites an outburst. If your car's tank is empty, whose fault is it? The petrol station hasn't moved! You chose to drive by without stopping! When you're running on empty, you end up hurting those closest to you, then dealing with the guilt that comes after a flare-up. God said, 'I will pour out water to quench your thirst.' So today pick up your Bible and refuel your soul!</p>

And it's not that complicated, because your gift usually relates to something that excites you. Think about it: God made you; He hardwired the desires of your heart. Knowing that helps you to understand why the things you find rewarding involve your innate talents and abilities. One author says: 'It's natural for a hunting dog to hunt. Coop him up and he'll lie around with no enthusiasm. But when he realises he's going hunting, he comes alive. That's because God designed hunting dogs that way. They have that passion inside them...They don't have to get themselves worked up...or say, Let me go listen to a sermon or motivational message so I can work up some zest and zeal. No, when those dogs know they're going hunting they're naturally excited... And when we're doing what we know we're called to do, enthusiasm and excitement exude from us naturally. We may not jump up and down...but deep within, we know, This is what I was called to do. This is why I was born. On the other hand, if you're doing something that's not natural, it's a struggle. If you try, train, practice and push and you still can't master a skill; recognise that it may not be in your nature. Of course we must persevere...push through and learn hard things... but in general, life shouldn't be a constant struggle.' When you're fulfilling your purpose, one of the most noticeable results is how rewarding it feels to 'stir up the gift of God...in you' by utilising your natural abilities.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['A [gift] is a precious stone in the eyes of its possessor: wherever he turns, he prospers.' Proverbs 17:8 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Paul speaks of 'the gift of God' in you (2 Timothy 1:6 NIV). It isn't something you learn; it's something He  you, and nobody else can activate it for you. You 'stir' it up by developing and using it. Solomon said, 'A [gift] is a precious stone in the eyes of its possessor: wherever he turns, he prospers.' Your gift will enrich many different areas in your life, not all of which are financial. While money is the wrong reason to devote your life to something, developing your God-given gift is rewarding on multiple levels. Unfortunately, many people are jealous of other people's gifts. Don't waste time on jealousy; it's a gift-robber, an energy-drain, and besides, you should be so busy stirring up your own gift that you've no time for envy. When Louis Armstrong auditioned for music school, he was asked to sing scales. But he could only sing two notes properly, so they wrote him off. Armstrong cried when he was rejected, but later told his friends, 'There's music in me and they can't keep it out.' Consequently, he went on to become one of the world's most successful, beloved musicians, selling more records than others who were more talented. We're all born originals, but many of us settle for becoming carbon copies. Think: if you become like everybody else and join the rat race, even if you do win, that just makes you the fastest rat! Your gift will make room for you (Proverbs 18:16). So go ahead and fill the slot God designed for you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...What is your name?' Genesis 32:27 NIV<br /><br /><p> 'As they wrestled together, the angel of the Lord asked Jacob, What is your name? He answered, Jacob. Then the angel said, Your name will no longer be Jacob, which means deceiver, but Israel, which means 'a prince with God', because you have struggled ...and have overcome.' (Genesis 32:26-28) God forced Jacob to look at his true identity. He wrestled him into a revelation of who he was - not who others said he was. His parents gave him his name and others called him by it, so he believed that's who he'd always be. But God had a different plan for him. Hear this: you are not who others say you are. Why should they label you? Determine who you are before God. Let Him determine the level of your success. Why should others be allowed to live at their highest potential, but not you? You are more than your past, more than your education or CV, more than the colour of your skin, more than your bank account, and more than your circumstances. Tell those who talk down to you and devalue you, 'You're confusing me with somebody else. God says I am a prince. And if I'm a prince, then I have the right to be treated like one!' You ask, 'But is that true?' Yes, the Bible says that when you walk with God, you are part of a royal priesthood (1 Peter 2:9). You are an overcomer (1 John 2:13-14). You are the head and not the tail, above and not beneath (Deuteronomy 28:13-14). So dry your tears, lift your head, square your shoulders and begin walking in your God-given identity.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Do not fear therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows.' Luke 12:7 NKJV<br /><br /><p>In teaching us how to live, Jesus used sparrows to illustrate His point. For the next few days let's look at them: <i>A worthless sparrow</i>. 'Are not five sparrows sold for two copper coins? And not one of them is forgotten before God...Do not fear therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows.' (Luke 12:6-7 NKJV) In Christ's day they didn't sell hamburgers, they sold sparrows on a stick that had been roasted over a fire. You could buy two of them for one copper coin. But you could get five for two copper coins; the vendor threw in the fifth one free. That meant it was worthless. What was Christ's point? You are valuable in God's eyes! Do you feel like if you weren't around nobody would miss you; like your life means nothing? You'd be surprised how many people, even high-profile ones, struggle with a sense of inferiority and inadequacy. When God called Jeremiah to be a prophet, he explained to God that he was afraid of people. So God said, 'Do not be afraid of their faces, for I am with you to deliver you.' (Jeremiah 1:8 NKJV) When you feel worthless you conclude that others feel the same way too, so you begin to approach them fearfully, or aggressively, or even resentfully. What's the answer? Remembering your worth in God's eyes! There is no rejection in His love, only complete acceptance. You're connected! You have a friend in high places. Jesus said, '...I have called you friends...' (John 15:15 KJV) Will everybody accept you? No, but when you base your worth on God's love and acceptance, you're free to enjoy life.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I am like...a sparrow alone on the housetop.' Psalm 102:6-7 NKJV<br /><br /><p><i>A</i><i> </i><i>sparrow</i>. The Psalmist wrote, 'I am like...a sparrow alone on the housetop.' Has your nest been torn apart by a storm? Have you lost your mate? Jesus can relate. His disciples didn't 'get Him'. They argued over who would be the greatest. They failed to pray with Him in His most difficult moments. On the cross He cried out, 'My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?' (Matthew 27:46 NKJV) We smile at the story of the single lady who hung a pair of trousers on her bedpost, then sent God a letter: 'Father in Heaven, help me if you can. I've hung a pair of trousers here, please fill them with a man.' Seriously, loneliness can be devastating to your self-worth. Young people wonder if they will ever find the right person to marry. Older people fear ending life all alone. The God Who knew that Adam was incomplete not only created Eve for him, but actually introduced them and brought them together. And He can do the same for you. If you are widowed, divorced, or never married and want to find a mate, don't be anxious. God says, 'I know...where you dwell...' (Revelation 2:13 NKJV) God knows your name, your address, and every detail about you. And better yet, He cares! And one more thought: sometimes loneliness is not the absence of affection but the absence of direction; not the absence of people but the absence of purpose. So begin to reach out to others. Find a need no one is meeting, pour your life into it and watch how things begin to improve for you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'The sparrow has found a home...a place near your altar...' Psalm 84:3 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p><i>A</i><i> lost sparrow</i>. The hit TV series <i>Lost</i>was about a plane crashing on a remote island and the survivors rebuilding their lives amidst the wreckage. The secret of the show's success was that we could all relate to it. We've lost marriages, businesses, homes, self-worth, security and a lot of other things. But Jesus came to '...seek and to save that which was lost.' (Luke 19:10 AMP) Unlike us, Jesus didn't see people as 'good' or 'bad', but as 'lost'. He knew they'd lost their way, lost their values, lost their relationships, lost their ability to cope, lost their faith, and in some cases lost their reason to live. And He sought them out: like the woman at the well with five divorces and a live-in boyfriend; like the man who lay at the Pool of Bethesda for 38 years, chronically ill, noticed by no one; like Mary who wept at the tomb of the One she loved most. If you're lost today, you can have a personal audience with the Lord. 'The sparrow has found a home...where she may lay her young - even Your altars, O Lord of Hosts... Blessed are those who dwell in Your house; they will still be praising You.' (Psalm 84:3-4 NKJV) Today you can 'come home' to God! You can build your nest and raise your family in the shelter of His protection. You can feel safe with Him. As you bow in worship, He will lift you up and make you feel valuable again. He will deliver you from the fear of rejection and loneliness. You can't hide from God, but you can hide in Him.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['We love because He first loved us.' 1 John 4:19 NIV<br /><br /><p>One author writes: 'Think of an area of unforgiveness and see if any of these reasons to hold a grudge resonate with you. (a) Anger keeps more potent emotions at bay; once it's gone you fear the emotional flood that may follow. (b) A grudge takes time and energy, and you're not sure who you'd be without it. (c) You've replayed your 'personal-betrayal-and-hurt movie' so often you know it by heart. (d) The idea of moving on is terrifying, whereas misery is familiar. (e) The offender has done nothing to deserve forgiveness. (f) Harbouring resentment stops you from getting hurt again because nobody can get close.' Jesus said, 'Why...look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own?' (Matthew 7:3 NIV) This author says, 'I've banged my plank into walls and around corners so often I'm certain I have retina damage!' Now consider these reasons for releasing a grudge. (a) Relinquishing past hurts frees you to embrace the present and future. (b) When you're not spending time and energy feeding a grudge, you can nourish new, healthy ideas. (c) The offender can't keep hurting you when you shake off the shackles and move on. (d) Holding a grudge feels like a form of control, but actually you're the one being controlled. (e) Once you lower your defences you can start to heal, love, and be loved. (f) Feeling angry feels good temporarily, but being healed feels so much better. (g) God mandates us to love 'because He first loved us.</p>
<p>You've held onto it long enough; it's time to let it go and enjoy the freedom that comes from forgiveness.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['When you come, bring...my scrolls...' 2 Timothy 4:13 NIV<br /><br /><p>In prison with no possibility of release, and facing the certainty of death on the chopping block, Paul asked Timothy to bring his books. Why? Because he wanted to keep growing. The truth is: (1) <i>When you finish growing, you</i><i>'</i><i>re finished</i>. When the poet Longfellow was old an admirer asked him how he was able to keep writing so beautifully. Pointing to a nearby apple tree he replied, 'That tree is very old, but I never saw prettier blossoms... The tree grows a little new wood every year, and...out of that new wood those blossoms come. So I try to grow a little...each year.' (2) <i>Growth doesn</i><i>'</i><i>t come easy</i>. It will stretch you. It will challenge you to rethink assumptions you've always believed to be right. Indeed, it can cost you friends and money. But when you're committed to growth you cannot settle for ignorance. (3) <i>Growth is your responsibility</i>. When you were a child, your parents were responsible for your growth, but now you are. The poet Robert Browning wrote, 'Why stay we on the earth except to grow?' Yet few dedicate themselves to the process. That's because growth requires change, and we're uncomfortable with the things change brings. Gail Sheehy said, 'If we don't change we won't grow, and if we don't grow we're not really living. Growth demands a temporary surrender of security. It means giving up familiar but limiting patterns, safe but unrewarding work, values no longer believed in, relationships that have lost their meaning... Taking a new step is what we fear most, yet our real fear should be the opposite.' Can you think of anything worse than a life devoid of growth? </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let the wise listen and add to their learning...' Proverbs 1:5 NIV <br /><br /><p>When it comes to growth, Christ is our example. The Bible says that He '...grew in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and men.' (Luke 2:52 NIV) To enjoy favour with God and others you must keep growing spiritually, mentally and emotionally. That requires you to do two things: (1) <i>Never stop learning</i>. Every experience in life, including the ones you don't enjoy, yields knowledge that can make your future better than your present. But you have to look for it. The downside to the internet and smartphones is that you get endless 'hits' of information you don't process or glean anything from. Instead of letting life just 'happen' to you, you need to stop and ask yourself, 'What's really happening here? I'm hearing it, but what does it mean?' You are body, soul, and spirit, so you need to ask, 'Am I healthy physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually?' No one can answer that question but you. (2) <i>Never stop developing your talents</i>. When asked as an old man why he still practiced six to eight hours every day, one of the world's best violinists replied, 'Because I think I'm getting better.' What a great attitude! It's not enough just to live longer; you're supposed to get better! Paul told Timothy, '...Stir up the gift...which is in you...' (2 Timothy 1:6 NKJV) Wesley Tracy said, 'Some people have the notion that following your spiritual gift is spending the days and years of your life doing only those things which come naturally, easily, with no effort, discipline or practice. No, your gift can either be mediocre or excellent; it's up to you.' </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The more you grow like this, the more productive and useful you will be...' 2 Peter 1:8 NLT<br /><br /><p>Let's look at two more things you need to grow: (1) <i>Don</i><i>'</i><i>t just grow in knowledge, grow in character</i>. The truth is, God is more interested in your character than He is in your career. Why? Because success without character has the potential to hurt you, and those around you. The Bible says: '...make every effort to respond to God's promises. Supplement your faith with a generous provision of moral excellence, and moral excellence with knowledge, and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with patient endurance, and patient endurance with godliness, and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love for everyone. The more you grow like this, the more productive and useful you will be...' (2 Peter 1:5-8 NLT) Note the words 'make every effort.' You've got to work at it! (2) <i>Always stay fresh</i>. Did you hear about the country pastor who was preaching when his notes flew out the church window and a cow grazing nearby ate them? Three days of ruminating on that same sermon and the cow went dry. Hello! Stay thirsty. Stay hungry. Jesus said, 'Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.' (Matthew 5:6 NIV) Ultimately it's not your talents, but your desire that determines your destiny. One of Paul's highest compliments was given to the believers in the Thessalonian church: 'We ought always to thank God for you, brothers, and rightly so, because your faith is growing more and more, and the love every one of you has for each other is increasing.' (2 Thessalonians 1:3 NIV) Let that be said of you.</p>

<title><![CDATA[The Way Out]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[the-way-out]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...He will show you a way out...' 1 Corinthians 10:13 NLT<br /><br /><p>The Bible says, 'When you are tempted, He will show you a way out so that you can endure.' Maybe you are in a situation - a relationship or a financial condition - that's not what you wanted. You feel like you could lie down and die. But when you don't - when you show up, when you offer the best you have - something good is happening inside you that far outweighs whatever is happening outside you. Jesus was facing adversity when He told His followers that, if they had faith, they could command a mountain and it would be cast into the sea. Now, when your focus is on the mountain, you are driven by your fear. But when your focus is on God, you are made alive by faith. But if you didn't have the mountain you'd never know that faith was in you, or to what extent. Adversity has a way of changing your values and priorities for the better. When you're on the treadmill of money, security or success, and adversity knocks you off, you start seeing the folly of chasing temporal things. And if you're wise you resolve not to return to your old way of life when things normalise. But the key to accomplishing this is taking action before normal life takes over again. You have a finite window of time to make changes; otherwise you'll drift back into your old patterns. While the memory of your adversity is still fresh, pray and ask God what changes He wants to make in your attitudes, your relationships, your habits and your lifestyle, and 'He will show you a way out.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Let your light shine...' Matthew 5:16 NIV<br /><br /><p>Every child, including yours, is born 'lost' into a world of moral and spiritual darkness. So parent, your most urgent responsibility is to be their guiding light. </p>
<p>Paul Harvey told of a hard-drinking father who left his adolescent son in a pick-up truck and went into a bar for a drink. Two hours later, Dad lumbered back to the truck to find his boy missing. Later, in the bar, he found his son in the company of a couple of inebriated young guys who'd got him drunk. In the ensuing fight with them, Dad ended up bleeding on the floor, his distressed son kneeling over him, pleading; 'Please don't be mad at me, Dad. I just followed you!' We all follow someone, hoping they know the way. The Bible says, 'Ahaziah son of Ahab...did evil in the eyes of the Lord, because he walked in the ways of his father and mother...' (1 Kings 22:51-52 NIV) Our children may not follow our advice, but they will follow our example, whether good or bad. We are called to be signposts at their crossroads; road maps in their confusion. Paul encouraged his spiritual children, saying, 'Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ.' (1 Corinthians 11:1 NIV) You don't need a college degree in parenting to shine at home. Embracing and living out Christ's teaching each day qualifies you to be the best parent you can be! 'A righteous man who walks in his integrity - how blessed are his sons [and daughters] after him.' (Proverbs 20:7 NAS)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Then Moses said to the Lord...' Exodus 33:12 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Throughout the book of Exodus we read these two statements: 'The Lord said to Moses,' and 'Moses said to the people.' There's an important lesson here. Until you have heard from God, what do you have to say to anybody else that's worth consideration? Does that mean God won't use your brain? No, when your thoughts and desires are submitted to Him He will actually think and speak through you. What a privilege. The trouble is, sometimes we want to speak without first consulting God and hearing from Him. The people Moses had been called to lead hadn't heard from God for four hundred years. After ten generations of living without God's Word, can you imagine the shape they were in spiritually? If you want to know how such a mindset will act, look at their responses every time they had a problem in the wilderness. They wanted to go back to the security of Egypt! This is one of the dangers you will face as a leader. You must love people and listen to them, but you must be led only by God. And unless you know God intimately, when times get tough, people will take you back to what's familiar and comfortable to them. When people want to go back to their old way of doing things, it's usually because they don't know God well enough. The litmus test of spiritual leadership is found in the ability to hear from God, and then to teach people to love God, to discern His will and begin to walk according to it!</p>

<alias><![CDATA[post-traumatic-growth-1]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Despite all these things, overwhelming victory is ours through Christ...' Romans 8:37 NLT <br /><br /><p>Just as there is a condition known as 'post-traumatic stress', researchers are now talking about 'post-traumatic growth'. One line of thinking is that adversity can lead to growth. Another is that the highest levels of growth cannot be achieved without adversity. But adversity doesn't automatically bring growth. Much of the outcome depends on how you respond to adversity. Ernest Hemingway wrote, 'Sooner or later, the world breaks everyone, and afterward many are strong at the broken places.' Sometimes that's true. But sometimes people write beautiful things and believe them to be true - or hope they're true - and yet they don't help. Hemingway himself had a brokenness that ended his life because the pain was too great. On the other hand Joseph, who was betrayed by his family, falsely accused of rape and unjustly imprisoned, looked back and said, '...God intended it all for good...' (Genesis 50:20 NLT) The key to post-traumatic growth is in seeing God in all things, drawing close to Him, trusting Him when you can't understand the situation, and knowing He only has your best interests at heart. When it comes to serving God there are two sides to the coin: success and suffering. We like the first, and try to avoid the second. But they're both part of God's plan. God called Paul into the ministry, saying, 'I will show him how much he must suffer for My name's sake.' (Acts 9:16 NLT) But hard times didn't make Paul doubt his faith, or the God he served: 'No, despite all these things, overwhelming victory is ours through Christ, who loved us.'</p>

<alias><![CDATA[suffering-with-grace]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['For to you it has been granted on behalf of Christ...to suffer...' Philippians 1:29 NKJV<br /><br /><p>You need the kind of faith that not only believes God for good things, but also sustains you through bad things. The Bible says, '...if you suffer for doing what is right, God will reward you for it. So don't worry or be afraid...instead...worship Christ as Lord of your life...' (1 Peter 3:14-15 NLT) God has foresight but we have only hindsight. So whether the path you've been called to walk is rough or smooth, your attitude should be one of 'worship', acknowledging 'Christ as Lord of your life'. Joseph's slavery led to the saving of his family. The lions' den led Daniel to a cabinet position. Christ entered the world by a surprise pregnancy and redeemed it through an unjust murder. Do you believe what the Bible teaches - that no disaster is ultimately fatal? John Chrysostom did. He was the archbishop of Constantinople from AD 398 to 404. He gained a following by his eloquent denunciations of corruption in the church. Twice banished by the authorities, he asked: 'What can I fear? Will it be death? But you know that Christ is my life, and that I shall gain by death. Will it be exile? But the earth is the Lord's and its fullness is the Lord's. Will it be by loss of wealth? But we have brought nothing into the world, and we can carry nothing out. Thus all the terrors of the world are contemptible in my eyes; and I smile at all its good things. Poverty I do not fear; riches I do not sigh for. Death I do not shrink from.' That's suffering with grace!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...God intended it all for good...' Genesis 50:20 NLT<br /><br /><p>Rising to a challenge reveals hidden abilities within you that otherwise would have remained dormant. Just as you find out what's inside a tube of toothpaste when it gets squeezed, adversity reveals what you're made of. Sometimes we say, 'I could never go through what that person went through. I would die.' Then you go through it, and guess what? Your heart keeps beating. Your world goes on. You don't know what you're capable of until you have to cope. Wise people have always understood the connection between suffering and growth. Meng Tzu, the Chinese sage, said, 'When heaven is about to confer a great responsibility on any man it will...place obstacles in the path of his deeds so as to stimulate his mind, harden his nature, and improve wherever he is incompetent.' God could have let Abraham stay in the comfort of Ur, and Moses in the splendour of Pharaoh's courts. He could have kept Daniel out of the lions' den, Nehemiah out of captivity, Jonah out of the whale, John the Baptist away from Herod, Esther from being threatened, Jeremiah from being rejected and Paul from being shipwrecked. But He didn't. In fact, God used each of these trials to bring them closer to Himself - to produce perseverance, character and hope. It's said, 'The school of hard knocks produces the greatest scholars.' And guess who the teacher is? Adversity! You either face it with God, or without Him. And those without God are watching you. When they see your faith sustain you and God bring you through, they'll get interested in what you have to say. And not before!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...My grace is sufficient for you...' 2 Corinthians 12:9 NKJV <br /><br /><p>One of the classic stories of adversity in the Bible is about Joseph. At the beginning of his life he is the favourite son, envied by his brothers, with dreams of having everybody bow down to him. Then he's sold by his brothers and ends up serving as a slave in Potiphar's house. He loses his home, his culture, his security and his status as favourite son. What does Joseph have left? He is in a strange bed, in a strange house, in a strange land, with no friends, no prospects and no explanation. But he has one gift - one that makes all the difference. 'The Lord was with Joseph...' (Genesis 39:2 NIV) What happens when you lose everything but God, then find out that God is enough? You experience His presence in a way you never did before! Paul writes: '...Does it mean He no longer loves us if we have trouble or calamity, or are persecuted, or hungry, or destitute, or in danger, or threatened with death? ...No, despite all these things, overwhelming victory is ours through Christ, who loved us.' (Romans 8:35-37 NLT) God wasn't at work producing the circumstances Joseph wanted; He was at work in bad circumstances producing the Joseph that God wanted. Just as a diamond is formed from common carbon placed under pressure of over a million tonnes per square metre - so the character of Christ is formed in you by adverse circumstances. So: Will you hold up or fold up? When Paul thought he couldn't stand any more, God told him, '...My grace is sufficient for you...' And do you know what? His grace is sufficient for you too. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['They nominated...Barsabbas...and Matthias.' Acts 1:23 NLT<br /><br /><p>When Judas committed suicide, the team of apostles was one man short. So what did they do? 'They nominated two men...Barsabbas...and Matthias.' To decide which one was called to take the place of Judas, they used a method known as 'casting lots'. It was a system used in Biblical times when only a few select people could actually speak with God or hear from Him personally. As a result, Matthias was chosen. You say, 'But I've never heard of Matthias.' And nobody else has either! He is not mentioned again in Scripture. But Barsabbas, the man who didn't get the vote, is referred to as one of the leaders who steered the church through some treacherous waters of doctrinal error (Acts 15:22-23). There are two important lessons for us in this story:</p>
<p>(1) You can know God but you will never be able to figure Him out. So stop trying. You can't reduce Him to a formula and say, 'This is the way He always does it.' Casting lots was a system God may have honoured in the past, but when the apostles tried it they didn't necessarily get the results they hoped for. (2) God will speak to you if you are willing to listen. Before leaving them, Jesus had told His disciples that the indwelling Holy Spirit would guide them. 'All that belongs to the Father is Mine; this is why I said, &quot;The Spirit will tell you whatever He receives from Me.&quot;' (John 16:15 NLT) You say, 'But how will I know the Holy Spirit has spoken to me?' Because He will produce the results that God wants in you!</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Blessed (happy, to be envied...) are the poor in spirit (the humble, who rate themselves insignificant)...' Matthew 5:3 AMP<br /><br /><p>When the rosy glow diminishes and reality sets in, what makes some marriages happy while others slide into misery? Luck? Good genes? Hanging tough? Hardly! Marital happiness that transcends changing circumstances is built on the qualities Jesus taught. Let's look at them: (1) <i>Happy are the humble</i>. 'Blessed (happy...) are the poor in spirit (the humble, who rate themselves insignificant).' Pride that's self-promoting and always demanding its rights brings misery, while humility, self-denial and considering your mate's needs brings happiness. (2) <i>Happy are the meek</i>: the gentle, patient and kind. Handling your spouse's struggles with kindness, sensitivity and long-suffering is an expression of love that brings healing into the painful chapters of life and marriage. (3) <i>Happy are the merciful</i>. Sooner or later we'll inflict injury on one another. Hurt, disappointment and anger will rise up, followed by a desire to make them pay. But just as revenge begets revenge, mercy begets mercy. Mercy isn't 'letting them get away with it.' Treating your spouse mercifully is reciprocal. It creates an atmosphere, where, when you fail, you 'shall obtain mercy.' Mercy ends disputes when nothing else works! (4) <i>Happy are the peacemakers</i>. The need to be 'right' and 'win' only intensifies conflict. In marriage, when one 'wins', both lose! Giving up personal victory to be a peacemaker is ultimate victory. You'd be eternally lost if Jesus hadn't willingly surrendered His rights for your wrongs. The ring is not the sole symbol of Christian marriage, but the cross superimposed on the ring. Christ-like surrender of our uncrucified self promotes marital happiness! </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I know that my Redeemer lives...' Job 19:25 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The patriarch Job survived boils, bankruptcy and bereavement and came out with his faith intact. Let's look at the creed he lived by: (1) '<i>I know</i>.' When you can say, 'I know,' you're an exclamation point in a world of question marks. Job didn't say, 'I have been told.' What he knew about God, he knew through experience and personal revelation. Is such a life possible? Yes, 'You have an anointing from the Holy One, and you know all things.' (1 John 2:20 NKJV) You can 'know' things about God in your heart that you can't fully understand or explain. Why? Because they're spiritually discerned. (2) '<i>That my Redeemer lives</i>.' Though Christ was not yet born, Job caught a glimpse of our pre-existent Redeemer whom Scripture describes as '...the Ancient of Days...' (Daniel 7:22 NKJV); the One Micah referred to '...whose goings forth are from of old, from everlasting.' (Micah 5:2 NKJV) He existed before He was born, and He outlived His pallbearers. Paul says, '...He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that you through His poverty might become rich.' (2 Corinthians 8:9 NKJV) (3) '<i>And that He shall stand at last on the earth</i>.' Job saw what Zechariah the prophet saw: 'In that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives...' (Zechariah 14:4 NKJV) The truth is, the first time Jesus came, He came to save. The next time He comes, He comes to reign. His first coming was to be our Redeemer; His second coming is to usher in His rule as King of Kings. 'Looking for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ.' (Titus 2:13 NKJV) </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...This I know...I shall see God.' Job 19:26 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Job ends his creed by saying, 'After my skin is destroyed, this I know, that in my flesh I shall see God.' When Christ returns, your body which sleeps in the grave will be replaced with a glorious Christ-like body. And then the promise of God's Word will be fulfilled: 'Your dead shall live; together with my dead body they shall arise. Awake and sing, you who dwell in dust...' (Isaiah 26:19 NKJV) Of all the religions on earth, Christianity is the only one that guarantees the resurrection of your body. And that's because Christ, our leader, was the only one capable of promising to rise from the dead bodily, and keeping that promise. Rejoice, when they lay you in your grave it will not be the last of you. Paul writes: '...I tell you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed - in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality...then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written: &quot;Death is swallowed up in victory.&quot;' (1 Corinthians 15:51-54 NKJV) In that day faith will give way to sight. When a little boy's kite flew so high it went out of sight, a man standing nearby asked him, 'How do you know it's still up there, son?' Tightening his grip on the string, he replied, 'Because I feel the tug!' Do you feel something tugging you heavenward?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Well informed, quick to understand...qualified to serve...' Daniel 1:4 NIV<br /><br /><p>When Nebuchadnezzar captured the Jews, he told his Chief of Staff to look for the brightest and best, and bring them to his palace. He wanted the following qualities: 'Showing aptitude for every kind of learning, well informed, quick to understand, and qualified to serve in the king's palace.' Daniel seized the opportunity. Yes, God gave him favour, but he also had to work at it! The CEO of one of the world's largest companies put it this way: 'The only way you're going to stand out, is to grasp this simple principle: When your boss asks you a question, assigns you a project or sends you to gather data, he already knows the answer he's looking for. He just wants you to confirm that what he believes is true. Most people do just that. But there's a difference. You must understand that the question is only the beginning. To elevate yourself, you must sink your thoughts into not only answering the question, but going above and beyond it. That means presenting him with three or four other ideas that he'd probably not considered. Your goal should be to add value to the idea by exceeding expectations. This is true not only with questions, but assignments, initiatives and anything else ever given to you to do. If you understand that the question is only the beginning, you'll get out of the pile fast, because 99 percent of all employees stay in the pile because they don't think. If you understand this principle, you'll be given even more critical questions to answer, and in time, you will be the one giving the questions to others.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Forgiving each other, just as...God forgave you.' Ephesians 4:32 NIV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says, 'Be kind...forgiving each other...as...God forgave you.' Kristin Armstrong says: 'After you forgive...you get to walk out the process...it's a collaborative effort of God's power and your hard work. Letting go isn't always as simple as opening your tightly-clenched fist, although deliverance sometimes is immediate. For example, some people quit smoking cold-turkey, while others chew nicotine gum for years! Old habits die hard, and letting go of resentment means: (a) Recommitting to your decision as many times as old thoughts of unforgiveness pop into your head. (b) Making peace with the space formerly occupied by bitterness, regret and thoughts of revenge until the Holy Spirit takes up full-time occupancy in the new digs! (c) Releasing old, toxic relationships and people whose only purpose is keeping your old wounds fresh. When people change around unchanging people, it makes them aware of their own need for change, and it scares them. (d) Just as your salvation was immediate yet you have to walk out your sanctification, the release of your forgiveness is immediate but you have to walk out your healing. (e) Living a life free from the burden of resentment and the toxicity of unforgiveness is a choice followed by a series of choices. Each one becomes easier...as we move farther from our old ways and into the light...Paul said, &quot;It is for freedom that Christ has set us free...&quot; (Galatians 5:1 NIV) and every time we let something or someone go free, we receive freedom for ourselves in overflowing proportion. It's a time-tested, guaranteed spiritual principle backed by the promise of Scripture.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will serve before kings...' Proverbs 22:29 NIV<br /><br /><p>Journalist William Zinsser's first job was writing for <i>The New York Herald Tribune</i>. Traditionally 'cub' reporters often start by writing obituaries, but Zinsser was frustrated with his assignment. 'I could be doing Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporting,' he thought to himself, 'and I'm stuck writing obituaries.' Finally he worked up enough courage to ask his editor, 'When am I going to get some decent story assignments?' His crusty old editor growled at him and said, 'Listen, kid, nothing you write will ever get read as carefully as what you are writing right now. You misspell a name, you mess up a date, and a family will be hurt. But you do justice to somebody's grandmother or somebody's mum, you make a life sing, and they will be grateful forever. They will put your words in laminate.' 'Things changed. I pledged I would make the extra calls,' Zinsser said. 'I would ask the extra questions. I would go the extra mile.' That is essentially from the Sermon on the Mount - write obituaries for others as you would want others to write an obituary for you - obituaries that deserve to be laminated - because someday, somebody will. Zinsser eventually moved on to other kinds of writing, including a book on writing itself that has sold more than a million copies. But none of it would have happened if he had not devoted himself to obituaries. Understand this: If you cannot experience the Spirit in the work you are doing today, then you cannot experience the Spirit today at all (as He is ever present). </p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...He rewards those who earnestly seek Him.' Hebrews 11:6 NIV <br /><br /><p>Icy winters tend to bring multiple pile-ups with cars in snow-filled ditches waiting for tow trucks to rescue them. The drivers have different reactions. Some surrender to feelings of being powerless, others get frustrated and deepen the rut they're in. But the wise think rationally of steps they can take. In life, getting stuck isn't always an option; but staying stuck is! Good news: no matter how long you've been stuck, the right attitude can get you moving again. So here are some attitude changers: (1) <i>Forgiveness</i>. The guilt that follows failure can immobilise you long-term, but forgiveness liberates you - freeing up your energy and creativity. Forgiveness is two-dimensional: <i>First, you must receive God</i><i>'</i><i>s forgiveness for your failures</i>. Things you've done: betrayal, angry words, dishonesty, broken promises etc. Things you haven't done: love unexpressed, responsibility avoided, a child, parent or spouse neglected, the truth withheld. Heartfelt confession always brings God's forgiveness! (1 John 1:9) <i>Second, you must forgive those who</i><i>'</i><i>ve failed you</i> - parents, siblings, children, bosses, spouses, friends, enemies etc. Severing the chains to your past restores your options for the future. (2) <i>Faith</i>. When you've been stuck for a long time, forward momentum can seem impossible. You lack direction, energy and confidence. What to do? Getting traction requires a willingness to act in spite of your feelings. God calls this 'faith' and He always responds to it! 'He rewards those who earnestly seek Him.' When you act like you believe, God will reward your faith - and the feeling of faith will follow your action!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I run straight toward the goal.' Philippians 3:14 GWT<br /><br /><p>Though you've settled the issues of forgiveness and faith, getting unstuck involves two more challenges. You will need to learn: (1) <i>Flexibility</i>. When your faith runs into obstacles, your flexibility keeps you in the race. You need the ability to 'roll with the punches', to bend without breaking. Don't marry your methods! Be willing to make a mid-course correction when it's needed. Flexibility, however, isn't ambivalence or wishy-washiness. Flexibility is: (a) <i>An attitude of determination to adjust to life</i><i>'</i><i>s challenges and stay on course</i>; to trust God for wisdom; to fine-tune your responses to changing circumstances. (b) <i>A commitment to take action</i>. A positive mind-set alone won't get you unstuck. You'll have to 'do something'! Remember, big doors swing on little hinges; taking small steps of faith will move you forward! (2) <i>Firmness</i>: resolve not to quit. You'll encounter problems that leave you no option but to stand still, like the Israelites between the Red Sea and the Egyptian army. In the tightest of spots, they received this five-fold counsel: (a) <i>Don</i><i>'</i><i>t give in to fear</i>. Don't let it decide your response. (b) <i>Stand still</i>. Stop your irrational, emotion-driven behaviours. (c) <i>Quit talking</i>. Don't talk yourself into defeat. (d) <i>Look for God</i><i>'</i><i>s way forward</i>. Expect Him to take action that will get you unstuck. (e) <i>Be ready to move forward when He opens the way</i>. These are simple but powerful steps you can take when you don't know what to do. And what about when you blow it? Acknowledge it. Re-label it as 'Valuable Lessons Learned' and put it in your 'What-Not-To-Do-Next-Time' file!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I have given special skill to all the gifted craftsmen...' Exodus 31:6 NLT<br /><br /><p>Just as a river can't rise higher than its source, no enterprise can rise higher than its leadership. When it was time to build the tabernacle God told Moses: '...I have specifically chosen Bezalel...I have filled him with the Spirit of God, giving him great wisdom, ability, and expertise...He is a master craftsman...He is skilled in engraving and mounting gemstones and in carving wood...And I have personally appointed Oholiab...to be his assistant. Moreover, I have given special skill to all the gifted craftsmen so they can make all the things I have commanded you to make.' (Exodus 31:1-6 NLT) Whether you are in ministry or in business, here's a plan that will bring you success: (1) <i>Be sure that the people you choose are the people God has chosen for you</i>. This calls for a prayerful and careful approach to hiring. Hiring isn't fun, and firing is agony. But so is trying to undo other people's mistakes! (2) <i>Look for those to whom God </i><i>has given </i><i>'</i><i>wisdom, ability, and expertise</i>.' Not only must they have the right skill set, they must have the same spirit you have; otherwise you are headed for conflict. (3) <i>Don</i><i>'</i><i>t stake your future on any one person, however gifted</i>. 'I have given special skill to all the gifted craftsmen.' If Oholiab goes rogue or messes up, you need to have other 'craftsmen' in place to carry the vision forward. (4) <i>Make sure the goals you have set line up with God</i><i>'</i><i>s will</i>. 'Make all the things I have commanded.' Ideas are important; God's plan is all-important!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom...' Matthew 27:51 NIV<br /><br /><p>One day a year, on the Day of Atonement (at-one-ment), the high priest could go beyond the thick curtain in the tabernacle into the 'Holy of Holies' and into God's presence. What qualified him to go there was the fact that the blood of a sacrificial lamb was covering the mercy seat, under which rested the Ark of the Covenant. God arranged it like that. You ask, 'What was in the Ark?' The Ten Commandments - which all of us have broken. The only way God could look at the evidence of His people's guilt was through the blood of the lamb. Now, fast forward to the cross. Jesus 'gave up His spirit. At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.' Everything changed for the better that day! In spite of your failures, you can now come into God's presence, knowing your sins are covered by the blood of Jesus, and confidently ask for whatever you need. 'Let us come boldly to the throne of our gracious God. There we will receive His mercy, and we will find grace to help us when we need it most.' (Hebrews 4:16 NLT) Your acceptance with God is guaranteed when you approach Him saying, 'I come in the name of Jesus and on the merits of His shed blood.' It works like a credit system. 'You are in Christ,' so you have a perfect credit score! So even when you feel inadequate and undeserving, if you ask in faith believing, God will give it to you '...for Christ's sake...' (Ephesians 4:32 KJV) </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['And at midnight a cry was heard...' Matthew 25:6 NKJV<br /><br /><p>You've probably heard the story of the five wise virgins and the five foolish ones. Jesus told it. In those days a requirement for being allowed to participate in a wedding was that your lamp had to be burning. But when the bridegroom showed up five of these virgins were out of oil. So they said to the other five, '...Give us some of your oil...' (Matthew 25:8 NKJV) But they said, 'No...there may not be enough for both us and you...' (Matthew 25:9 NIV) So while they went to town to buy oil the wedding started and they were locked out. Christ's parable teaches us four important lessons: (1) <i>The foolishness of depending on somebody else</i>. Your mother and father may have been Christians, but that won't get you into Heaven. You must accept Christ as your own personal Saviour. (2) <i>The futility of last</i><i>-</i><i>minute</i><i> preparations</i>. '...while they went to buy, the bridegroom came...' (Matthew 25:10 NKJV) Remember, Jesus is teaching about the kind of people who will be living when He returns. So here's the question: Are you putting salvation off until you're old? What if you don't live that long? (3) <i>The finality of judgment</i>. '...And the door was shut. Afterward the other virgins came also, saying, &quot;Lord, Lord, open to us!&quot; But he answered and said, &quot;Assuredly, I say to you, I do not know you.&quot;' (Matthew 25:10-12 NKJV) (4) <i>The </i><i>fallacy of morality</i>. They were 'virgins', yet they were shut out. Your character and good works won't get you into Heaven. 'By grace you have been saved through faith...' (Ephesians 2:8 NKJV) Are you ready to meet the Lord? If not, put your faith in Him today and get ready. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['While the bridegroom was delayed, they all slumbered...' Matthew 25:5 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Let's look at these ten virgins and see what else we can learn from them. Observe three things: (1) <i>The midnight crowd</i>. 'While the bridegroom was delayed, they all slumbered and slept.' Who slept? The wise as well as the foolish; the world as well as the church. Paul warns, '...It is high time to awake out of sleep; for now our salvation is nearer than when we first believed.' (Romans 13:11 NKJV) We're in mortal combat with an enemy who observes no truce, no armistice and no peace treaties. The <i>Titanic</i> disregarded five warnings before it hit the iceberg. The naval yard at Pearl Harbour disregarded six warnings before it was attacked. Christ is not coming back for the religious but the redeemed; not for the refined but the regenerated; not the respectable but the righteous. (2) <i>The midnight cry</i>. 'At midnight a cry was heard: Behold, the bridegroom is coming; go out to meet him!' (Matthew 25:6 NKJV) All around us the voices of fear sound. Where can we look for hope? To government? To bankers? To industry? To academics? No, our hope can be found in these words: 'Looking for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ.' (Titus 2:13 NKJV) (3) <i>The midnight crisis</i>. The urgent message of this parable is: Some will have enough to get them into the wedding, others will not. So what should you do? 'Watch therefore, and pray always, that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things that will come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man.' (Luke 21:36 NKJV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Who has believed our report?...' Isaiah 53:1 NKJV<br /><br /><p>An oil spill pollutes the Gulf of Mexico, devastating marine life and the livelihood of millions of people. Day after day we watch it on TV, in real time. An earthquake hits Haiti, 200,000 die, and the world's poorest people are left hungry and homeless. An American-born terrorist flies home from an Al Qaeda training camp with a bomb in his underwear and tries to destroy not only the plane, but much of Detroit. Bankers, car makers and oil executives we trusted who are questioned by Parliamentary committees say they have no idea how we got into this mess. The reports keep coming 24/7. Talking heads in the media milk each moment and sensationalise each event because it increases their ratings, sells advertising and makes money. Indeed, some of the news reporters have become celebrities. Fear sells! It's a major industry. Paradoxically, we are both the most prosperous generation in history, and the most fearful one too. In the past you had to get your daily dose of anxiety from the evening news; today you get it around the clock on your smartphone or iPad. Now you can't bury your head in the sand. But if you're not selective in what you listen to, you can lose your peace of mind. God knows this, so His Word asks, 'Who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?' In Scripture, the 'arm of the Lord' speaks of His power to deliver and His providential care over every event in our lives. So whose report are you going to listen to, internalise, and respond to?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['These things happened to them as examples...for us...' 1 Corinthians 10:11 NIV<br /><br /><p>Samson was a loser, Joseph was a winner. Samson had everything going for him. He was the product of a miracle birth, raised by godly parents, and given supernatural strength. Yet he failed miserably. Why? (1) <i>He did not pray</i>. The only time we read of Samson praying is when he was in trouble. Sound familiar? If you conduct a post-mortem on your biggest failures, somewhere in the wreckage you'll find that you've forsaken the place of prayer. You can't run your car on an empty tank, work on an empty stomach, or pay bills with an empty bank account. And you can't live a victorious Christian life without daily prayer. (2) <i>He refused to live by God</i><i>'</i><i>s Word</i>. When confronted by his parents over marrying the wrong woman, Samson told them, '...she pleases me well.' (Judges 14:3 NKJV) When you're led by sentiment rather than Scripture, you're heading for trouble. One of the best definitions of 'disobedience' is 'incomplete obedience'. You can't pick which Scriptures you want to live by and turn a blind eye to the rest! (3) <i>He had the wrong spirit</i>. While Joseph extended forgiveness to those who'd harmed him, Samson prayed for revenge. Any time you give in to resentment you're allowing someone other than God to dictate your actions, and you end up suffering even more. (4) <i>He w</i><i>as motivated by greed</i>. Consorting with the Philistines, he placed a bet with thirty of them, saying, 'If you can't tell me the answer, you must give me...thirty sets of clothes.' (Judges 14:13 NIV) You say, 'What's the point?' If it could happen to Samson, it could happen to you!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['These things happened to them as examples...for us...' 1 Corinthians 10:11 NIV<br /><br /><p>While Samson had everything going for him, Joseph had everything going against him. Notice: (1) <i>He was badly treated by the people of God</i>. Joseph's brothers resented the vision God gave him and the favour that was upon his life, so they sold him into slavery. Who told you everybody would appreciate you? Not God! Jesus said, 'If the world hates you, remember that it hated Me first.' (John 15:18 NLT) But Joseph maintained a forgiving spirit and not only ended up being reconciled with his family, but he fed them during the famine. (2) <i>He was alone in a land where no one had knowledge of God</i>. But like a lily in a mud marsh, he stayed clean and grew in faith. It's not the circumstances that surround you, but what's within you that determines your success. (3) <i>He was exposed to temptation</i>. Joseph was lonely, far from home, and subject to every impulse a red-blooded male can have. Potiphar's wife tried repeatedly to seduce him, but he said no. In his case, there's a good chance that he might have got away with it. But his reason for saying 'no' was, '...How then could I do such a wicked thing and sin against God?' (Genesis 39:9 NIV) Nothing meant more to Joseph than his relationship with the Lord. (4) <i>His integrity came at a price</i>. Based on false accusations by Potiphar's wife, Joseph went to prison for a crime he didn't commit. Did God fail him? No, the contacts needed to get him to the throne were waiting for him in prison. So be true to God and He will bless you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Father...take this cup away from Me...' Mark 14:36 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The next time you drink from the communion cup in church, stop and recall what was in the cup Jesus drank from in Gethsemane on the night before He was crucified. You can drink from the cup with assurance because He first drank from the cup in agony. On the eve of His death He prayed: 'My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death...Father, all things are possible for You. Take this cup away from Me; nevertheless, not what I will, but what You will.' (Mark 14:34-36 NKJV) Note the words: 'exceedingly sorrowful.' (If you think your sin is no big deal, perhaps those words will help to change your mind.) Christ drank from the cup of God's wrath so that you could drink from the cup of God's grace. Although He was sinless, He tasted the sins of both the most refined sinner and the most repulsive one. He had never felt God's fury; He didn't deserve to. He had never experienced isolation from His Father; the two had been one from before time began. He had never known physical death; He was an immortal being. Yet within a few hours God would unleash His sin-hating wrath on His sinless perfect Son. And as a man, Jesus was afraid. Deathly afraid. And what He did with His fear shows us what to do with ours. He prayed earnestly and persistently. He told His followers, '...Sit here while I go and pray over there.' (Matthew 26:36 NKJV) Jesus faced His ultimate fear with honest prayer, and overcame it. And through prayer, you can overcome your fears too. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The clay doesn't ask, &quot;Why did you make me this way?&quot;...' Isaiah 45:9 CEV<br /><br /><p>A lot of us are unhappy with what we see in the mirror. Indeed, some of us are so unhappy that we spend a fortune to change it. And while it's good to look your best, God never intended our looks as a statement of our value to Him, or to others. Whatever physical features you may have inherited, here are some Scriptural truths worth considering: (1) <i>Resenting your looks just puts you at odds with God</i>. The Bible says, 'You have no right to argue with your Creator. You are...a clay pot shaped by a potter. The clay doesn't ask, &quot;Why did you make me this way?&quot;' (Isaiah 45:9 CEV) God intends you to be His clay container; a practical, usable vessel; not a fancy ornament for display. 'Our bodies are made of clay, yet we have the treasure of the Good News in them. This shows that the superior power of this treasure belongs to God and doesn't come from us.' (2 Corinthians 4:7 GWT) Your value isn't in how you look, but in what you contain - the life-changing message of God's grace! (2) <i>Resenting your looks results from false comparison</i><i>s</i>. Today we're driven to become reflections of some unattainable ideal. Airbrushed models on TV sell us everything from cornflakes to cars. Let's get real! '...They are only comparing themselves with each other, using themselves as the standard of measurement. How ignorant!' (2 Corinthians 10:12 NLT) Unhappiness over your appearance results from ignorance of God's marvellous and creative purpose for you. And that'll become clear to you when you '...look only to Jesus, the One who began our faith and who makes it perfect...' (Hebrews 12:2 NCV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Thank you for making me so wonderfully complex! Your workmanship is marvellous...' Psalm 139:14 NLT<br /><br /><p>So, how should you view the role of your physical appearance? (1) <i>With gratitude</i>. Thank God for the unique person He created you to be. You're not the result of random genetics. You're a genuine 'one-off', designed by God to fill a slot no one else can fill. He is what makes you who you are! 'You made all the delicate, inner parts of my body and knit me together in my mother's womb.' (Psalm 139:13 NLT) 'Thank you for making me so wonderfully complex! Your workmanship is marvellous.' You didn't come from an assembly line like some product designed to fulfil a quota. No, you received the detailed, individualised focus of the Divine Architect. The Psalmist said, 'You watched me as I was being formed... as I was woven together in...the womb.' (Psalms 139:15 NLT) Now, that's attention at the highest level, right? So give God thanks: you were created, inspected and approved in Heaven before you moved a muscle on earth. (2) <i>With understanding</i>. Discover God's purpose for your life. You weren't designed to impress others or to seek their approval. In God's eyes, your looks are not the measure of your worth. '...The Lord doesn't see things the way you see them. People judge by outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.' (1 Samuel 16:7 NLT) Start seeing yourself as God sees you. Ultimately, His opinion is the only one that matters. Indeed, '...He decided in advance that [His people] would be conformed to the image of His Son...' (Romans 8:29 CEB) Rejoice! God won't be finished working on you until He's made you just like Jesus.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Make every minute count.' Ephesians 5:16 CEV<br /><br /><p>Do you remember wishing your children were grown up? Suddenly you're amazed at how quickly it's happening. The truth is, they'll soon be gone, leaving the place feeling deserted and quiet. Bob Benson puts it poignantly: 'I pass a lot of houses on my way home; some pretty, some inviting. But my heart skips a beat when I see my house nestled against the hill. I'm especially proud of the way it looks because I drew the plans myself. It started out large enough for us. I even had a study, in which two teenage boys now reside! It had a guest room, but my girl and nine dolls are permanent guests there now. It had a room for Peg, who hoped to turn it into her sewing room. But two boys swinging on the Dutch door have claimed that room. Right now it appears I'm not much of an architect. But it'll get larger again. One by one they'll go away to college, work, the service, their own homes. Then there'll be room: a guest room, a sewing room, a study, just for the two of us. But it won't be empty. Every corner, room, nick in the coffee table will be full of memories. Memories of picnics, Christmases, birthdays, bedside vigils...going barefoot, holidays, cats, dogs, black eyes...graduations, first dates, arguments, ball games...and a thousand other things that fill the lives of those who bring up five kids. And Peg and I will sit quietly by the fire and listen to the laughter in the walls.' Childhood and youth evaporate swiftly. So fill them with loving, wonderful, sustaining memories. 'Make every minute count.' </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Gentle words cause life and health...' Proverbs 15:4 TLB<br /><br /><p>James writes, 'If anyone considers himself religious and yet does not keep a tight rein on his tongue, he deceives himself and his religion is worthless.' (James 1:26 NIV) The poet wrote, 'Oh I say the things that I never should, just want to be heard or I never would. Talk on and on and know it's wrong; the trouble is, my tongue's too long.' So how can you control your tongue's negative propensity? Engage it positively. How? (1) <i>Be an encourager!</i> 'Gentle words cause life and health.' Your words can help a hopeless person keep on living and motivate a sick loved one to fight illness and become whole. Encouragers are God's frontline against defeat, despair and depression! (2) <i>Speak the truth in love</i>. Saying what needs to be heard is often hard, but being a friend requires saying difficult things. 'Wounds from a sincere friend are better than many kisses from an enemy.' (Proverbs 27:6 NLT) Truth spoken in love can release people from their delusions, misperceptions and inflexibility to live free, productive lives. (John 8:32) (3) <i>Ask God for the right words</i>. 'The lips of the righteous bring forth what is acceptable...' (Proverbs 10:32 NAS) How do you know what words the hearer will accept? Let God be your guide. (4) <i>Make your words life</i><i>-</i><i>giving</i>. 'The teaching of the wise is a fountain of life, turning a man from the snares of death.' (Proverbs 13:14 NIV) The people you meet need words that turn them from spiritual death to eternal life. So today, speak words of life and health.</p>

<alias><![CDATA[grace-at-home-1]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...But where sin increased, grace increased all the more.' Romans 5:20 NIV<br /><br /><p>You need a lot of grace in marriage. Even in the best of relationships, things happen that cause misunderstanding and hurt. Speaking about his marriage, therapist Michael Sytsma says: 'Before I was married, God said, &quot;Mike, you have some rough edges. To help you become more Christ-like, I'm giving you Karen. That should do the trick.&quot; So he brought Karen...into my life to identify all my shortcomings. My first response when she points out my flaws? Not gratitude! Instead, I strike back: &quot;How dare you point out those things? What's your problem?&quot; Then I have the opportunity of either denying my feelings, or owning them and maturing. And Karen can either harbour anger and resentment, or offer grace and forgiveness. Imagine a marriage filled with grace: a spouse who extends joy, pleasure, sweetness, kind speech and unmerited favour. My wife does that. I'm still working at it.' Here is the first of four ways you can show grace to your spouse: (1) <i>Try to look a</i><i>t it differently.</i><i> Focus on the positive</i>. If you think your spouse is stubborn, feeling loving toward them is hard. But if you exercise grace and choose to see them as persistent and tenacious, loving them becomes much easier. If they're disorganised, by grace you can choose to see that as a sign they are spontaneous, or creative, or the flexible type, or even over-extended. '...whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable - if anything is excellent or praiseworthy - think about such things.' (Philippians 4:8 NIV) People usually try to live up to the image you hold of them! </p>

<alias><![CDATA[grace-at-home-2]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation...' 2 Corinthians 5:17 NKJV <br /><br /><p>Here are three more steps to treating your spouse with grace: (1) <i>See them as God created them to be</i>. Focusing on your partner's flaws doesn't help either of you. The Pharisees saw only the worst in the woman caught in adultery. Jesus didn't minimise her sin, but chose to see what she could become through grace. He basically said, 'I don't condemn you. Go, and stop what you're doing.' (John 8:11) Grace enables you to see beyond your spouse's upsetting ways and work with God in helping them become the 'new creature' He's called them to be. (2) <i>Celebrate them</i>. Too often we try to impose on our spouse our desired image of them. We resent them and insist they change, see it our way, and do things to our required standard. If they don't, we think they're inconsiderate, unloving, and even un-Christian. Grace doesn't operate that way! It understands, accepts, forgives and leaves changing others up to God. Try telling yourself, 'Yes, that annoys me, but I wonder what God's trying to work out in my spouse.' Then step back, love and accept them and let God work on them. (3) <i>Forgive them</i>. Your spouse will irritate you at times because of what they are. We're all different. She thinks she's detailed; he thinks she's nit-picking. He thinks he's laid-back; she thinks he's lazy. We act out the image we hold of ourselves, and that'll change only when God changes it! Acknowledge your intolerance and forgive your partner's irritating behaviour - even before they do it again. That's 'pre-emptive forgiveness', the kind that denies resentment a toehold on your marriage.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...He sought his God...and so he prospered.' 2 Chronicles 31:21 NIV <br /><br /><p>The conditions in our country today are similar to those in ancient Israel. In spite of all God's blessings, the people had turned their back on Him. So when Hezekiah, a man of integrity, came to the throne, he set his heart on restoring God to His rightful position of leadership in the land. Notice four things he did: (1) He re-opened the doors of God's house and called the people to repent and return to the Lord. (2) He challenged the corruption and carnality which had become a way of life even among leaders and ministers of the Lord. His words were strong: '...Sanctify the house of the Lord God of your fathers, and carry out the rubbish from the holy place.' (2 Chronicles 29:5 NKJV) Can you see a parallel to the day in which we live? (3) He re-established the supremacy of God's Word. '...they went in to purify the temple of the Lord...following the Word of the Lord.' (2 Chronicles 29:15 NIV) Pastor, a Sunday morning sermon alone won't cut it; you need to get your people into God's Word every day. (4) He called the people to worship God. It was an amazing scene. 'The whole assembly bowed in worship, while the singers sang and the trumpeters played. All this continued until the sacrifice of the burnt offering was completed.' (2 Chronicles 29:28 NIV) Scholars estimate that for over three hours the entire nation stood in God's presence and worshipped Him. Did God bless Hezekiah's efforts? 'In everything that he undertook...he sought his God and worked wholeheartedly. And so he prospered.' And that's God's plan for spiritual renewal!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...A great...door has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.' 1 Corinthians 16:9 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Paul writes, 'For a great and effective door has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.' So, what are you focusing on? The open door or the adversaries -  the opportunities or the obstacles? In 1866, an amateur geologist noticed some South African children playing with a glistening rock. He asked the children's mother if he could purchase it. Thinking it was worth nothing, she gave it to him. Later, when he examined it, he discovered that it was a premium 21 carat diamond. When word got out, a Scottish mineralogist named James Gregory was sent to investigate. He reported back that South Africa wasn't suitable for finding diamonds. He speculated that the previous discoveries had resulted from ostriches, of all things, eating the gems in distant lands and depositing them in South Africa via their dung. A few days after Gregory's report was made public, an 83 carat diamond was found in the area he had visited. It is now known as <i>The Star of South Africa</i>, and it launched the region's first mining operation in what is today the world's largest producer of diamonds. And what about Gregory? His name lives on, but not as he might have wished. In the diamond industry, when someone exhibits bad judgment, it's called 'pulling a Gregory'. If you ask God, He will help you find the 'treasure' in your field (Matthew 13:44-45). If Jesus could turn water into wine and feed five thousand people with a boy's lunch, think what He can do through you. The question is: what do you see? The open door or the obstacles?</p>

<title><![CDATA[Use Your 'Measure of Faith']]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[use-your-measure-of-faith]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...God has dealt to each one a measure of faith.' Romans 12:3 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The amount of faith God has given you is equal to the assignment He's given you. So whatever you're facing, tell yourself, 'God has given me the faith to handle this.' Nothing's more important than your faith. Jesus told Peter, '...Satan has asked for you, that he may sift you as wheat. But I have prayed for you, that your faith should not fail...' (Luke 22:31-32 NKJV) Faith is more important than money, or career success, or reputation. Everything can be taken from you but, if you have faith, you'll bounce back. Faith is like having a direct line to God. As the prayer of faith goes up, His power flows down. As a result, you are more than adequate for the challenge. Failure is never final, as long as your faith doesn't fail. That's why Satan will do everything he can to keep you from spending time each day in the Scriptures. 'Faith comes by hearing...the word of God.' (Romans 10:17 NKJV) Jesus said, '...If you have faith as a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, Move from here to there, and it will move...' (Matthew 17:20 NKJV) There are obstacles in your life that will only be removed by faith. And you don't need a truckload of it, just a mustard seed. Think: a tiny seed has the power to grow, overcome obstacles and become a mighty tree. It will press up through the ground, around rocks, braving storms, withstanding animals and other threats to its life. It's not so much the size of your faith, but the quality of it that determines your success. So today, use your 'measure of faith'.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...You do not know what manner of spirit you are of.' Luke 9:55 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The disciples had a problem with their attitude, and Jesus 'called them on it' six different times in two chapters. Let's look at each and see what we can learn: <i>A callous spirit</i>. Instead of believing Christ to feed the crowd with five loaves and two fishes, they said to Jesus, 'Send the multitude away...' (Luke 9:12 NKJV) One of the dangers of succeeding in ministry is that you can end up loving crowds but not really caring for individuals. Or wanting contributors, but not wanting to spend time meeting people's individual needs. Years ago a man decided to visit the churches of two well-known television ministers he liked. After hearing the first, he asked if he could say hello to him. But the minister's 'handlers' said no, suggesting he phone to arrange an appointment. Disappointed, he went to hear the other minister, and was invited to lunch with him following the service. Feeling valued, he handed the minister a cheque for four million dollars. (This is said to be a true story.) You must always be approachable, available, and affirming. You must keep the personal touch. True, you can't personally minister to all who are sick and counsel all who are hurting. As a pastor, having quality time to prepare sermons and Bible studies must be a top priority. But Jesus was able to '...sympathise with our weaknesses...' (Hebrews 4:15 NKJV) because He mixed and mingled with us. Only as you stay in touch with people's needs, can God use you to meet those needs in real time. The saying goes, 'People don't care how much you know until they know how much you care.' So, do you care?</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['They came to Him...saying, Master, Master, we are perishing!...' Luke 8:24 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says: '...He got into a boat with His disciples. And He said to them, Let us cross over to the other side of the lake. And they launched out. But as they sailed, He fell asleep. And a storm came down...and they...were in jeopardy. And they...awoke Him, saying, Master, Master, we are perishing! Then He arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water... But He said to them, Where is your faith? And they were afraid, and marvelled, saying to one another, Who can this be? For He commands even the winds and water, and they obey Him!' (Luke 8:22-25 NKJV) Notice what is at work in this story: <i>a fearful spirit</i>. No matter how often God blesses us and answers our prayers, we still give in to fear the next time we face a crisis, especially when it's one we haven't faced before. Who told the disciples to get into the boat in the first place? Jesus. Understand this: faith doesn't exempt you from life's storms; it equips you to go through them. And when you are in the will of God; no storm, however severe, can take you under. Jesus knew the storm was coming before the disciples ever stepped into the boat. So why did He expose them to it? Because He was equipping them for the future, for the day when He'd no longer be around and they would face persecution, imprisonment and even death. So the word for you today is: 'Don't be afraid. The Lord is with you; you are going to make it to the other side.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Peter...not knowing what he said.' Luke 9:33 NKJV<br /><br /><p>On the Mount of Transfiguration, '...Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tabernacles: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah - not knowing what he said...And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is My beloved Son. Hear Him!' (Luke 9:33-35 NKJV) Another spirit Jesus identified among His disciples was: <i>an impulsive spirit</i>. Note the words, 'not knowing what he said.' Peter's penchant for saying whatever came into his mind drew a strong rebuke from Heaven: 'This is My beloved Son - hear Him!' There's an important lesson here. Your need to appear wise and have all the answers can get you into trouble with people - and God! Generally speaking, you're not learning while you're talking. So learn to be quiet, observe what's going on, and listen for what God may want to say. When you don't know, don't speak. People respect you when you have the wisdom and humility to say, 'I'm not sure, but if you give me time I'll pray about it, consider it more fully and get back to you.' Experts say the average person is now bombarded with 3500 messages a day: emails, text messages, billboards, television, radio, Twitter, Facebook, blogs, etc. It's 'information overload'. People don't need more information; they need answers that work! And God has those answers. So talk to Him first, then you'll have something to say to others that's worth listening to. 'Everyone enjoys a fitting reply; it is wonderful to say the right thing at the right time!' (Proverbs15:23 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...and You say, Who touched Me?' Luke 8:45 NKJV<br /><br /><p>One day a chronically ill woman who had haemorrhaged for 12 years pushed her way through the crowd and touched the hem of Jesus' garment. And immediately she was healed. '...Jesus said, Who touched Me? When all denied it, Peter and those with him said, Master, the multitudes throng and press You, and You say, 'Who touched Me?' But Jesus said, Somebody touched Me, for I perceived power going out from Me. Now when the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling; and falling down before Him, she declared to Him in the presence of all...how she was healed immediately. And He said to her, Daughter, be of good cheer; your faith has made you well. Go in peace.' (Luke 8:45-48 NKJV)</p>
<p>What's at work in this story? <i>An undiscerning spirit</i>. Observe Peter's words, 'Master, the multitudes throng and press You, and You say, Who touched Me?' Understand this: Jesus can tell the difference between the indiscriminate touch of the crowd, and a touch of faith. Faith draws on His power and brings results! Notice, this woman touched the 'hem' of Jesus' garment. The last thing a dressmaker does when she makes a garment is to sew up the hem. So the hem represents 'the finished work'. The same back that bore the cross which takes away your sins, also bore the stripes which take away your sickness. '...And by His stripes we are healed.' (Isaiah 53:5 NKJV) What do you need today? Forgiveness of sins? Healing? Reach out in faith and touch Jesus, and you too will be made whole.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['A dispute arose among them as to which of them would be greatest.' Luke 9:46 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says: 'Then a dispute arose among them as to which of them would be greatest. And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a little child and set him by Him, and said to them, Whoever receives this little child in My name receives Me; and whoever receives Me receives Him who sent Me. For he who is least among you all will be great.' (Luke 9:46-48 NKJV) What's at work in this story? <i>A self-seeking spirit</i>. As long as your motive for serving is to make yourself look good, you'll never enjoy God's approval. And His 'well done' is the only thing that counts. The ability to serve behind the scenes, and do it with joy, comes from the knowledge that ultimately your service will be recognised and rewarded by the only One whose opinion counts. Why did Jesus feature a child that day? For three reasons: (1) <i>A child is teachable</i>. When you're finished learning, you're finished! When you can't be told, God will have nothing more to tell you. 'The heart of the discerning acquires knowledge; the ears of the wise seek it out.' (Proverbs 18:15 NIV) (2) <i>A child is trusting</i>. When you promise a child something; they believe you, act on it, and expect it to be so. 'It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man.' (Psalm 118:8 NKJV) (3) <i>A child is tender-hearted</i>. 'Finally, all of you...be tender-hearted...' (1 Peter 3:8 NKJV) The Holy Spirit is symbolised in Scripture as a gentle dove, so keep your heart tender and receptive to His dealings.</p>

<title><![CDATA[A Judgmental Spirit (6)]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[a-judgmental-spirit-6]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...You do not know what manner of spirit you are of.' Luke 9:55 NKJV<br /><br /><p>One day Jesus went into a Samaritan village and was not well received. So the disciples said, 'Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them, just as Elijah did?' But He turned and rebuked them, and said, You do not know what manner of spirit you are of. For the Son of Man did not come to destroy men's lives but to save them...' (Luke 9:54-56 NKJV)</p>
<p>What's at work in this story? <i>A judgmental spirit</i>. A poll taken by the Barna Research Group reveals that today most non-believers view Christians as too judgmental. So you can be sincere, but too severe. When you mix and mingle only with those who share your views and values, you can communicate with others in ways that attack, rather than attract. Let's be clear: never has it been more important to know the truth of God's Word and stand for it. But if you have the right doctrine and the wrong spirit, you'll drive more people away from Christ than you'll draw to Him. If Satan has his way, he will drive holiness out of our hearts and into our fists. Imagine - Christ's disciples wanting to incinerate those who didn't agree with them! They weren't even aware of the spirit that was at work within their own hearts. 'Jesus said... You shall love your neighbour as yourself.' (Matthew 19:18-19 NKJV) That includes your non-Christian neighbour. You don't have to defend Jesus, or 'sell' Him. All you have to do is introduce Him. The Psalmist says, 'Taste and see that the Lord is good...' (Psalm 34:8 NKJV)</p>

(2 Kings 4:8-10 NKJV) Observe: (1) Whatever you need more of; make room for it.You don't get what you 'want' in life; you get what you 'prepare for'. This woman's generosity toward Elisha resulted in her having a child when she wasn't able to, and her child later being raised from the dead when sickness claimed him. When you make room for God in your life; you make room for the blessings that come with Him. (2) Notice the four things she put in the prophet's room:(a) <i>A bed</i>. There are times when you must run, and there are times when you must rest. Indeed, if you don't learn to slow down, you'll break down. (b) <i>A table</i>. You need spiritual food to nourish your soul. If you plan to keep giving out, you must keep taking in. (c) <i>A chair</i>. This speaks of study. 'Study to...present yourself to God... a workman who has no cause to be ashamed...accurately dividing...the Word of Truth.' (2 Timothy 2:15 AMP) (d) <i>A lamp</i>. A place of illumination. Even after you've studied long and hard, you need the Holy Spirit to reveal the truth to your heart. And that's how to become a notable woman (or man).</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Keep your heart with all diligence...' Proverbs 4:23 NKJV<br /><br /><p>We all have our battlegrounds; in some cases they're things we surrendered to years ago that now lurk in our innermost thoughts. That's why the Scriptures warn, 'Keep your heart with all diligence, for out of it spring the issues of life.' Max Lucado writes: 'I'm at a desk in a hotel room far from home. The voices that encourage are distant; the voices that entice are near. A placard on my nightstand invites me to the lounge to make new friends in a relaxing atmosphere. Another on top of the TV promises late-night movies that will make all my fantasies come true. In the phone book several columns of escort services offer Love away from home. Voices! Some for pleasure, some for power. The world hammers at your door; Jesus taps. The world promises fleshly pleasure; Jesus promises us a quiet dinner...with Him: '...I will come in and eat with him, and he with Me.' (Revelation 3:20 NIV) Which voice will you obey?' You ask, 'How should I handle tempting situations?' In two ways: First, <i>by filling your mind with Scripture</i> so that your first response is always, 'It is written.' Second, <i>by keeping your eyes on Jesus</i>. Lesley Durkin writes, 'My father used to put a bit of meat on the floor near his dog and say, No! The dog never touched it. But he never looked at it either, because if he did the temptation to disobey would have been too great. He just kept looking at my father's face.' Keep your eyes on Jesus. 'Those who look to Him are radiant; their faces are never covered with shame.' (Psalm 34:5 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Problems and trials...are good for us...' Romans 5:3 TLB<br /><br /><p>We all want '...the crown of life...' the Lord promised (James 1:12 NKJV) - but we don't want the 'problems and trials' that develop 'strength of character in us.' (Romans 5:4 NLT) But it can't be done. Here's what you learn in tough times: (1) <i>Enjoyment</i>. 'Count it all joy when you fall into...trials.' (James 1:2 NKJV) It's when you pass God's test that He fills you with His joy. So pull some of the groans out of your prayers and throw in a few hallelujahs. Remember, pain is inevitable - misery is optional! (2) <i>Enlargement</i>. The Psalmist wrote, '...You gave me room when I was in distress...' (Psalm 4:1 NRS) Most of the things we know best, we learned the hard way. Our greatest progress comes from our greatest pain; hence God doesn't save us from it, but strengthens us in it. (3) <i>Enlightenment</i>. The Bible says, 'Unto the upright there arises light in the darkness...' (Psalm 112:4 NKJV) We don't realise how little we know until we walk through life's dark places and God turns on the light. (4) <i>Endurance</i>. James writes, '...See how the farmer waits for the land to yield its valuable crop and how patient he is for the autumn and spring rains. You too, be patient and stand firm...' (James 5:7-8 NIV) You can't shorten the seasons or hurry the harvest, so be patient. And pay attention. While you're waiting, God is working. Bruce Wilkinson says, 'Tests of faith are trials and hardships that invite you to surrender something of great value to God... [and look forward to] the refining experience... and the priceless result.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...What does the Lord require of you...to love kindness...' Micah 6:8 NAS<br /><br /><p>Every day we miss opportunities to be kind in order to save a few seconds. Chuck Swindoll wrote, 'When I treat people as obstacles in my path, or use them merely as a means to getting things done, I become a smaller man. With each brusque comment...dismissive glance...curt reply I lose a little more of myself...my relationship with God suffers.' Paul says, 'The fruit of the Spirit is...kindness...' (Galatians 5:22 NKJV), and you can't love God without being kind to those He loves. Consider Ruth and Naomi. When circumstances left them widowed, Ruth told her ageing mother-in-law, '...Don't ask me to leave you...May the Lord punish me...if I allow anything but death to separate us!' (Ruth 1:16-17 NLT) Consider Jonathan and David. When Saul tried to kill David, Jonathan stuck by him and '...loved him as himself' (1 Samuel 18:3 NIV) although it meant sacrificing his chance to become king. Consider David and Mephibosheth. In an era when newly-appointed monarchs routinely banished those associated with former dynasties, David sought out Jonathan's son and said, '...I will...show kindness to you for the sake of your father...and...restore to you...the land of your grandfather...you shall eat at my table regularly.' (2 Samuel 9:7 NAS). Consider the Shunammite woman who noticed Elisha was always passing her house, so she built a little room so he could '...turn in...' when he was tired (2 Kings 4:9-10 NAS). You never regret kindness. Og Mandino says, 'Treat everyone you meet as if they were going to be dead by midnight. Extend all the care, kindness and understanding you can, with no thought of reward, and your life will never be the same.' </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The weapons we fight with...demolish strongholds.' 2 Corinthians 10:4 NIV<br /><br /><p>In Bible times when an attack was launched against a city, a first strategy was to bring in a battering ram, demolish the gates and defeat the inhabitants. Today you are at war with Satan! Only when you recognise that, is victory possible. And the good news is: 'The weapons we fight with...have...power to demolish strongholds.' But you must 'Put on the whole armour of God...' (Ephesians 6:11 NKJV) It's not something you pick up and wear when you feel like it. And you've got to keep it on, because the enemy never lets up. He wants you to think he's equal with God. He's not! God is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent; He can do anything, anywhere, anytime. No question, Satan is a formidable foe, but there are limits on what he's permitted to do (Job 1:12). Your mind is Command Central; it's where victory or defeat is decided. Paul told the Corinthians, 'I fear, lest...your minds...be corrupted...' (2 Corinthians 11:3 NKJV) Satan knows Christ's return is imminent and he's ratcheting up the opposition (Revelation 12:12). The way you win the battle is through: (1) <i>Praise</i>, the garment that protects you (Isaiah 61:3). () <i>Abiding in Christ</i>, your source of spiritual growth and fruitfulness (John 15:8-10). () <i>God's Word</i>, it's '...living...active...sharper than any two-edged sword...' (Hebrews 4:12 NAS), and it's designed to defeat the enemy. When Satan comes against you, combat his lies with what God says. () <i>Walking in love toward others</i>. It's impossible to be victorious when you're wrapped up in yourself.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Our struggle is...against...spiritual forces...' Ephesians 6:12 NAS<br /><br /><p>When the first plane hit the World Trade Center in September 2001, we thought it was accidental. When another plane hit it, we knew New York was under attack. Dr. Robert Jeffress says: 'Knowing the source of the problem is crucial...a navigational accident demands one response. A hostile strike requires a completely different strategy. Every day our world is invaded by what we consider random events. Couples divorce, so we develop marriage guidance; drug use increases, so we educate our children to just say no; pornography among Christians rises, so we organise accountability groups; churches threaten to split, so we employ arbitrators to help with conflict resolution; Christians battle depression and suicidal thoughts, so we medicate them with the latest drugs. Please understand, I'm all for [such programmes], but what if the source is more than random events and we're under enemy attack? Would we change our strategy? Through Scripture we discover there's an unseen world and it's at war. Paul writes: Our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against...spiritual forces of wickedness. You can't just shrug your shoulders and say, I don't have a horse in that race. You're living in the crossfire of this spiritual war...the enemy's determined to destroy everything and everyone important to you. And those who dismiss such words as being over the top - do so to their own detriment.' Martin Lloyd-Jones said, 'Not to realise you're in a conflict...means you are so hopelessly defeated...that you do not even know it.' We're in a very real war, the stakes are high, the enemy skilled, armed, and determined. The possibility of losing...is real. You must be aware of what's happening and be prepared to fight.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Lord disciplines those he loves...' Hebrews 12:6 NLT<br /><br /><p>It's important to know when you're under attack - and when you're not. Henry and Richard Blackaby said: 'There's a tendency among Christians to view anything unpleasant... as spiritual warfare...rather than admitting that we're merely reaping what we've sown... If you've neglected your role as spiritual teacher to your children, what will stop them falling into sin? If you've been dishonest, God may let you face the consequences. It would be foolish to ask Him to ease your discomfort when He's disciplining you to get your attention. How tragic never to make the connection... God's discipline won't help you if you dismiss it as Satan's doing. If you misunderstand... you may blame Him for not answering your prayers or failing to protect you; meanwhile, God's warning you of danger.' '...For a little while you may have had to suffer...that your faith...may be proved genuine...' (1 Peter 1:6-7 NIV) A blacksmith with a chunk of metal on the anvil envisions what he wants. But it means melting down the old, recasting it, removing scars, repairing cracks, filling voids, and purging impurities until what was useless becomes valuable. Finally he plunges it into cold water until it hardens into an unbending, useful tool. Max Lucado says, 'An instrument is useful only if it's in the right shape...A good blacksmith keeps his tools in shape... And so does God. Should He place you on His anvil, be thankful. It means He thinks you're still worth reshaping.'</p>

(Psalm 66:18 NAS) Anything that adversely affects your relationship with God also affects your prayers. Friendship gives you favour; intimacy gives you access. Jesus said, 'If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you.' (John 15:7 NKJV) (2) <i>How strong is my faith?</i> 'Without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is...a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.' (Hebrews 11:6 NKJV) Notice three words: (a) '<i>Believe</i>.' God's deepest longing is to be believed, regardless of emotion or circumstance. (b) '<i>Diligently</i>.' When you pray, put your heart and soul into it. Paul speaks of 'labouring...in prayer.' (Colossians 4:12 KJV) (c) '<i>Him</i>.' God is not some 'force out there', He's your heavenly Father Who '...knows that you need all these things.' (Matthew 6:32 NKJV) Your highest priority should not be getting your needs met, but building your relationship with God. (3) <i>Am I showing patience?</i> 'Until God's time finally came - how God tested his patience!' (Psalm 105:19 TLB) Joseph was tested by the very promise God gave him. Can't you hear Satan whisper, 'I thought the dream said you were supposed to be Prime Minister; what are you doing in prison?' But it only looks like a prison; in reality, it's the birthplace of destiny. Joseph saw God's promise fulfilled - in God's time. And you will too!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...You...harvest what you plant.' Galatians 6:7 CEV<br /><br /><p>George Bernard Shaw said, 'People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people who get ahead are those who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and if they can't find them, they make them.' A farmer can plant anything he wants; the land doesn't care one way or the other. Suppose he plants both wheat and poisonous hemlock. The land will return poisonous hemlock as plentifully as it does wheat. Your mind is far more fertile, but the same principle applies. It doesn't care what kind of seeds you plant; success or failure, good or evil, anxiety or peace - what you sow returns to you. The Bible says, 'If you follow your selfish desires, you will harvest destruction...if you follow the Spirit, you will harvest eternal life.' (Galatians 6:8 CEV) Success lies in your daily routine. So, get to know God better through His Word and prayer. Make up your mind to be of service to somebody every day. Tackle a problem bigger than you. Encourage everyone you meet. Take the first step toward overcoming a bad habit. Do something for somebody who can't repay you. Instead of spending your working week looking forward to Friday, each day look forward to today! Do three things that will take you outside your comfort zone. Be thankful for what you have. Ask for help when you need it. Give God the best part of your day. The Psalmist said, 'This is the day the Lord has made...rejoice and be glad in it.' (Psalm 118: 24 NLT) The time to be happy is now, and the place to be happy is .</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.' James 1:8 KJV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says, '...he who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven and tossed by the wind. For let not that man suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord. He is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.' (James 1:6-8 NKJV) Peter Marshall, former chaplain to the U.S. Senate, prayed, 'Give us clear vision that we may know where to stand, and what to stand for.' A dream that isn't clear won't help you get anywhere. What do you want to accomplish? What do you want to contribute? Who do you want to become? In other words, what does success look like for you? If you don't define it, you won't be able to achieve it. Most people don't get what they want because they don't know what they want. They haven't defined their dream in clear and compelling detail. Ben Stein writes: 'The indispensable first step to getting the things you want out of life is this: Decide what you want!' John Maxwell adds: 'Instead of saying, I want to lose weight, say, I will weigh [80 kg] by June 1. Instead of saying, I want to get out of debt, say, I will pay off all credit card balances by December 31. Instead of saying, I need to improve my leadership, say, I will read one leadership book every month. Being specific doesn't necessarily mean having every little detail thought out before you move forward. But your main goal should be clear. The rest will unfold as you move forward, making adjustments as you go.' The question you need to answer is, 'Am I single minded?'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Fix your gaze directly before you.' Proverbs 4:25 NIV<br /><br /><p>It doesn't take much effort to let your mind drift and dream. But it takes great effort to set your mind to the task of developing a clear goal, of having a clear and compelling dream. John Maxwell says: 'For me the whole process begins with questions I must ask myself. The dream is always rooted in the dreamer, in his or her experiences, circumstances, talents, and opportunities. I ask: What am I feeling - what are my emotions telling me? What am I sensing? - what is my intuition telling me? What am I seeing? - what is happening around me? What am I hearing? - what are others saying? What am I thinking? - what do my intellect and common sense say? ...A clear picture may come to you all at once, in lightning-bolt fashion, but for most people it doesn't work that way. Most people need to keep working at it, clarifying it, redrawing it. If the process is difficult, that's no reason to give up. In fact, if it's too easy, maybe you're not dreaming big enough. Just keep working on it because a clear dream is worth fighting for.' If you can get a clear sense of where you are, what you know, and what you want, you're well on your way to understanding and embracing the thing God put you on earth to do. Moses spent the first two-thirds of his life working out what God wanted him to do, trying to do things his own way, only to fail. But he had a heart for God, and a vision from God, and eventually he succeeded. And you will too!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...At just the right time we will reap...' Galatians 6:9 NLT<br /><br /><p>Susan was the only member of her family motivated to work for change. Her husband, a military pilot, was gone months on end while she brought up the children alone. Her repeated efforts to reform him and the children had failed miserably. Pointing out that doing more of what hadn't worked wouldn't make it work, the counsellor suggested she work on what she could change: she responded! He taught her to 'defect in place': relinquishing some of her 'overload'. Everyone became responsible for their own dirty dishes, laundry, untidy room etc. And Susan used the time she saved to do something she'd always wanted to do - take voice lessons. Yes, she found it difficult to avoid picking up after everybody and carrying their responsibilities. At first, when nobody assumed the unfinished workload and the 'mess seemed unbearable', she was tempted to give in and return to 'her old job'. Then, with perfect timing, she read a book about breaking the sound barrier. Pilots who attempted it had always given up when the plane vibrated violently, until astronaut Chuck Yeager said to himself, 'Maybe once you get through the vibrating everything calms down.' Yeager sped up where the others slowed down, and flew through the barrier into the calm beyond. After a weekend of unrelenting family criticism, Susan 'revved up', persisting against her old instincts. It took time. But after their complaints, the children took on more responsibilities, and her husband accepted fewer distant assignments. 'So let's not get tired of doing what is good. At just the right time we will reap a harvest of blessing if we don't give up.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Be patient in trouble, and prayerful always.' Romans 12:12 TLB<br /><br /><p>We've been dubbed 'the microwave generation' for good reason - we charge through life like we're on fire! But God has His own timetable and it can't be rushed. So when He puts you on hold: <i>Watch your words</i>. Like a small rudder on a big ship, what you say determines your direction and helps stop the wrong thoughts from infiltrating your mind. Mel Weldon said, 'My mind is a garden, my thoughts are the seeds; my harvest will be either flowers or weeds.' Ask God to help you control your emotions. Paul says, 'Be glad for all God is planning...Be patient in trouble...and prayerful always.' Complaining magnifies the problem. Prayer turns negative energy into a powerful force for good. Look for the humour in it. Solomon said, '...he who is of a merry heart has a continual feast.' (Proverbs 15:15 NKJV) Laughter dispels tension, lightens the burden and fills your soul with joy. Appreciate the chance to learn, however difficult the problem.Solomon said, '...the diligent make use of everything...' (Proverbs 12:27 NLT) Learn from your experience regardless of how hard it is, and remember, some of the world's greatest discoveries and breakthroughs resulted from crises. Love unconditionally. Problems are caused by people, and under pressure it's tempting to lash out. The bottom line is: we all make mistakes, and nobody is beyond redemption! Aren't you glad about that? Learn to see people through God's eyes. '...Overcome evil with good.' (Romans 12:21 NIV) Be courteous, and maintain your dignity when you're under pressure (Romans 12:10).</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['By your patience possess your souls.' Luke 21:19 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Make peace your priority. Don't let your inner man be controlled by outside pressures. When you 'go to war' everybody suffers, but when you let '...the peace that comes from Christ control your thoughts...' (Colossians 3:15 CEV), it restores your perspective and creates an atmosphere that's conducive to solutions. Look for a breakthrough from an unexpected source.When you 'commit your way to the Lord...' (Psalm 37:5 NKJV), don't be surprised when the people and circumstances He sends into your life aren't what you expected. He spoke to Balaam through a donkey (Numbers 22), and He used a burning bush to get Moses' attention (Exodus 3). Don't be in such a hurry. Ever notice that the faster you go, the more behind you get? Jesus said, 'By your patience possess your souls.' As Henry Blackaby observes: 'God's timing is...best...He may be withholding directions to cause you to seek Him more intently. Don't try to skip the relationship and get on with doing. God is more interested in a relationship with you than He is in what you can do for Him.' Don't be too proud to ask for help. Solomon said, '...with humility comes wisdom.' (Proverbs 11:2 NLT) If the people you turn to aren't immediately available, be patient and don't give up. God designed us to work together, and somewhere up the road you will be called to help somebody by sharing what you're learning right now. 'He comforts us when we are in trouble, so that we can share that same comfort with others in trouble.' (2 Corinthians 1:4 CEV)</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...when you search for Me with all your heart.' Jeremiah 29:13 NKJV<br /><br /><p>God isn't moved by your eloquence or the multiplicity of your words. He's moved by a heart that spills the burdens of the day across the altar, exposing every pain to the power of a God who 'can'. Can what? Can do whatever you have the faith to believe Him for. '...Whatever things you ask when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you will have them.' (Mark 11:24 NKJV) Your confidence in prayer is not based on your ability to speak, but on God's ability to hear and understand. He knows what you are trying to say. The old hymn goes: 'In seasons of distress and grief, my soul has often found relief. And oft escaped the tempter's snare, by thy return, sweet hour of prayer.' Either learn to pray, or become good at worrying! What you give to God, He handles. What you keep,  handle. Spiritually, when everything is 'going out' and nothing's 'coming in', you collapse under the weight of it all. Is that where you are today? If so, prayer is your answer. It restores what life depletes. When you pray you're saying, 'Lord, I believe You're more competent to deal with this than I am, and I trust You to do it.' When you pray that way, the heart of your boss is in God's hands, the surgery you dread is in His hands, your children and your finances are in His hands. God is ready to intervene on your behalf - just pray from your heart. 'Commit your way to the Lord, trust also in Him, and He shall bring it to pass.' (Psalm 37:5 NKJV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...You have laid Your hand upon me.' Psalm 139:5 NIV<br /><br /><p>David writes: '...All the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be.' (Psalm 139:16 NIV) God put you here for a reason, but that doesn't mean others will understand it or agree with it. Nehemiah's critics thought he was on an ego trip, getting the prophets to speak well of him, and only out to enrich himself. Paul's critics called him a madman, a fool and a babbler. Christ's adversaries said that He was controlled by a devil. Expect attack, and be ready for it! Don't let it keep you from moving forward. Journalist Anna Quindlen, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1992, had a dream in her heart that took her down a road others couldn't understand. In an address for the class of 2002 at Sarah Lawrence College, Quindlen explained: 'When I quit the <i>New York Times</i> to be a full-time mother, the voices of the world said I was nuts. When I quit the paper again to be a novelist, they said I was nuts again... But if success is not on your own terms, if it looks good to the world but does not feel good in your soul, it is not success at all.' David said, 'You have laid Your hand upon me.' When a dream comes from God, it will seem outrageous to more than a few people. You'll have to overcome some nay-sayers to achieve it. That's ok. If someone tries to silence your hope or deny your progress in the course of pursuing your dream, maybe that person isn't your friend.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...When a storm strikes...God will keep safe all who obey Him.' Proverbs 10:25 CEV<br /><br /><p>Heart-rending scenes of nature's devastation are hard to forget. Victims caught in the path of hurricanes, floods and earthquakes are tossed around like matchsticks. But those prepared in advance escape its destruction. There is no such thing as a storm-free life! The words 'When (not <i>if</i>) a storm strikes,' teach us that we all go through times of heartache and trouble. The question is: are you prepared? You can be. God can protect you in times of loss, sickness, divorce, unemployment, loneliness and depression. You may not be able to predict life's storms or prevent them, but you can prepare for them and be protected in them by doing the following things: <i>Locate your storm shelter</i>. Mid-storm is no time to be caught in confusion, seeking refuge for yourself and your family. You must know in Whom and where your protection lies. The Bible says, 'The name of the Lord is a strong tower: the righteous run to it, and are safe.' (Proverbs 18:10 NKJV) God's 'name' speaks of His character, His reliability and His faithfulness. A man or woman without God is forced to be their own God - what a fearful thought! But those who love God can say, 'God is...always ready to help in times of trouble. And so, we won't be afraid! Let the earth tremble and the mountains tumble into the deepest sea. Let the ocean roar and...its raging waves shake the mountains.' (Psalm 46:1-3 CEV) The old Irish preacher had his own take on the hymn. He'd say, 'On Christ the solid rock I stand - all other rocks are sham-rocks!' Trust God; He's the only storm shelter you'll ever need.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['You have been...a shelter from the storm...' Isaiah 25:4 NIV<br /><br /><p>To be prepared for life's storms you must: (1) <i>Know your storm manual</i>. The hymnist Kelso Carter wrote: 'Standing on the promises that cannot fail, when the howling storms of doubt and fear assail, by the living Word I shall prevail, standing on the promises of God.' Emotion-based faith is like a broken crutch; it won't support you in life's storms. It's fair-weather Christianity and it doesn't work. God's Word stands sure; it's greater than surrounding conditions and will enable you to outlast any storm. 'Let the Word of Christ dwell in you richly...' (Colossians 3:16 NIV) Keep a rich deposit of Scripture within you at all times so you can make a withdrawal when you need it. Withstanding life's storms depends on your willingness to '...hear these words...and put them into practice...' (Matthew 7:24 NIV) So, memorise the Scriptures; read them until, if you're cut, you bleed Scripture. Meditate on God's Word until it fills and shapes your consciousness. When the storm came, Job said, '...I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my necessary food.' (Job 23:12 NKJV) (2) <i>Storm-proof yourself through prayer</i>. Many of us treat prayer like a visit to the emergency room; until then we neglect it. Imagine where Daniel would have been if he'd held off praying until he was staring down the lion's throat? Not a smart move. Instead, in his time of crisis Daniel drew on faith built by a lifestyle of daily prayer. And in your crisis, you too can make withdrawals from your account - as long as you've been faithful to make regular deposits.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go...' Genesis 28:15 NIV<br /><br /><p>To prepare for life's storms you must: (1) <i>Practise self-control</i>. Storms are much harder on the undisciplined and self-indulgent. The illusion that life should be easy, painless, an air-cushioned ride, makes you vulnerable to discouragement, disillusionment and defeat in hard times. The truth is, tough times don't last but tough people do! And tough people practise self-denial and self-control. It's their spiritual muscle for handling life's hardships. The Bible says, 'The fruit of the Spirit is...self-control...' (Galatians 5:22-23 NIV) God's Spirit will make you tough enough to control your greatest weakness - yourself - the thing that ultimately defeats you in the tough times. Paul lived by this principle. 'I discipline my body and keep it under control...' (1 Corinthians 9:27 ESV) Great athletes know that it's their conditioning, not the conditions, that determine their victory. (2) <i>Depend on God, not people</i>. 'It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man.' (Psalm 118:8 NKJV) Yes, others can help you at times, like a cast helps a broken leg. But once that leg is ready to bear its weight, you must discard the cast or your leg won't regain full strength. People can go so far; only God will go all the way with you. Paul writes: '...No one stood with me, but all forsook me. May it not be charged against them. But the Lord stood with me and strengthened me...The Lord will deliver me from every evil work and preserve me for His heavenly Kingdom. To Him be glory forever and ever. Amen!' (2 Timothy 4:16-18 NKJV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Let him...rely upon his God.' Isaiah 50:10 NKJV<br /><br /><p>One morning a man received four long-distance calls before he even got out of bed. Everybody had problems they wanted solved 'right now'. He told his wife to forget about breakfast, only to discover his car wouldn't start. So he called a taxi. When he got in the taxi he yelled, 'Let's go!' The driver asked, 'Where do you want me to take you?' He shouted, 'I don't care, I've got problems everywhere!' Do you feel like that today? Have you done all you know to do, but the situation hasn't improved? 'Who among you fears the Lord? Who obeys the voice of His Servant? Who walks in darkness and has no light? Let him trust in the name of the Lord and rely upon his God.' Note the word 'name'. God values His good name because it represents His power, His character and His faithfulness. So when you pray for anything in His name, you're trusting His power, His  and His faithfulness. It's like standing on a rock! We spend so much of our lives worrying about yesterday and tomorrow, yet one is buried and the other's unborn. There's not a thing we can do about either - except let them steal today right out of our hands. The Psalmist said, 'This is the day which the Lord has made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.' (Psalm 118:24 NKJV) So seize this day with its blessings and challenges and live every moment of it. Don't long for 'someday'. 'God is...a very present help...' (Psalm 46:1 NKJV) Just hand your worries to Him and let Him take care of them for you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Underneath are the everlasting arms....' Deuteronomy 33:27 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Addressing the nation of Israel for the last time, Moses told them, 'There is no one like the God of Israel. He rides across the Heavens to help you...The eternal God is your refuge, and His everlasting arms are under you...' (Deuteronomy 33:26-27 NLT) As you read the Bible you discover God did a lot of spectacular things for His people on mountaintops. On Mount Moriah, He met with Abraham and Isaac, revealing Himself as 'Jehovah Jireh', which basically means '<i>the Lord will provide</i>.' On Mount Horeb, He spoke to Moses through a burning bush and changed the nation of Israel's destiny. On Mount Sinai, He gave the Ten Commandments. On Mount Carmel, He sent down fire from heaven, consuming the prophets of Baal and turning the hearts of His people back to Him. But suddenly Moses made a shift in the middle of telling about this great God of high places. It is as though he was thinking, 'I can't leave these people with the thought that God is only on top; that He's with us only when everything is going right.' So he continued, 'The eternal God is your refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms.' The Hebrew word for 'underneath' means 'bottom'. So it could be translated, 'God's arms are underneath you when you're on the bottom.' No matter how deep the valley you have to walk, God's presence is deeper. It may feel like you are down today, but you cannot go so low that He is not there. Underneath you are His everlasting arms. The truth is: He's not just the God of the top; He's also the God of the bottom.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...As we have opportunity, let us do good to all...' Galatians 6:10 NKJV<br /><br /></p>
<p>Your Bible says, 'Do not forget to do good and to share...' (Hebrews 13:16 NKJV) 'To him who knows to do good and does not do it, to him it is sin.' (James 4:17 NKJV) '...Those who have believed in God should be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men.' (Titus 3:8 NKJV) It's important never to confuse your life with your work. What you are can never compare with what you do. There will be many others in your line of work, doing what you want to do, maybe even doing it better. Anna Quindlen wrote: 'You will be the only person alive who has sole custody of your life...your mind and...your heart. It's easier to write a résumé than craft a spirit or build a character. And a résumé is cold comfort when you're sad, broke, or lonely, or when you've got back the test results and they're not so good... I no longer consider myself the centre of the universe. I show up. I listen. I try to laugh... I have tried to make my marriage vows mean what they say. I pray. I'm good to my friends...without them I'd be a cardboard cutout. Get a life...not a manic pursuit of the next promotion or bigger pay-cheque or larger house. Do you really think you'd care about these things if you had an aneurysm or found a lump in your breast? Get a life in which you are generous... All of [us] want to do well, but if you don't do good, doing will never be enough.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['They looked to Him and were radiant, and their faces were not ashamed.' Psalm 34:5 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The Psalmist wrote, 'They looked to Him and were radiant, and their faces were not ashamed.' As a follower of Christ, that should be your testimony. Because you have placed your trust in Him you are able to say, 'I am not ashamed' of: (1) <i>His birth</i>. Mary was His mother, but God was His Father. So He was tainted with neither inherited sin nor practised sin, hence He meets all of God's requirements to be our Saviour. (2) <i>His miracles</i>. He never demanded money in exchange for a miracle. Not one supernatural act was performed for selfish or ostentatious purposes, but only to meet people's needs. (3) <i>His preaching</i>. Even His enemies had to admit, '...No man ever spoke like this Man!' (John 7:46 NKJV) Other men's words inform us; His words transform us. (4) <i>His claims</i>. He said, '...He who has seen Me has seen the Father...' (John 14:9 NKJV) You see the fullness of God expressed in the person of Jesus Christ. (5) <i>His death</i>. He bore your shame. You were morally and spiritually bankrupt. But He satisfied all of God's claims against you at the cross, writing 'Paid in full' across your account. (6) <i>His resurrection</i>. 'Lifted up was He to die, it is finished was His cry. Now in heaven exalted high, Hallelujah, what a Saviour.' And His promise is, '...Because I live, you will live also.' (John 14:19 NKJV) (7) <i>His mediator-ship</i>. Picture this: when you fail, He stands before God on your behalf, offering His blood as atonement for your sin. If you saw Him now you would say, 'I am not ashamed of Jesus.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I am not ashamed of the Gospel...' Romans 1:16 NKJV<br /><br /><p>As a follower of Christ you can also say, 'I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God to salvation for everyone who believes...' Our Gospel is not education or sophistication, but salvation. It's not reformation or rehabilitation, but redemption from the penalty and the power of sin. The Bible says, 'If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation: old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.' (2 Corinthians 5:17 NKJV) This is not the old car with a new set of plugs, points and a carburettor; it's a brand new model. Notice the words, 'For everyone who believes.' By placing your trust in Christ you are forgiven from all sin, clothed in Christ's righteousness, made fully acceptable in God's sight, and qualified for Heaven. You ask, 'How long does a prayer for salvation have to be?' The thief on the cross prayed only nine words: '...Lord, remember me when You come into Your Kingdom.' (Luke 23:42 NKJV) The tax collector in the temple prayed only seven words: '...God, be merciful to me, a sinner.' (Luke 18:13 NKJV) When Peter was sinking in the Sea of Galilee he only had time for three words: '...Lord, save me!' (Matthew 14:30 NKJV) And the good news is - Christ saved them all. You ask, 'How do I receive this life-changing power?' By faith! 'For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved. As the Scripture says, Anyone who trusts in Him will never be put to shame.' (Romans 10:10-11 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Change the way you think...' Romans 12:2 GWT<br /><br /><p>For things to change for the better, you must 'change the way you think.' For example: (a) <i>View setbacks as detours, not dead ends</i>. Winners don't just face adversity; they embrace it, knowing it leads to future success. (b) <i>Tune out the critics and focus on</i><i> doing your best</i>. Anybody who accomplishes anything worthwhile has to overcome naysayers. (c) <i>When you</i><i>'</i><i>re afraid, praise God until your faith rebuilds</i>. It may take a while, but praise and thanksgiving never fail, and they strengthen you to go on. (d) <i>When </i><i>you fail, look for the lesson and remember all the times you</i><i>'</i><i>ve succeeded</i>. Weed out self-doubt and replace it with Scriptural self-talk. (e) <i>When you</i><i>'</i><i>re heading into battle, visualise yourself winning in </i><i>God</i><i>'</i><i>s</i><i> strength</i> - with Him '...all things are possible.' (Matthew 19:26 NIV) (f) <i>Instead of focusing on the past and worrying about the future, focus on the </i><i>now</i> - that's where your influence is greatest. Remember, God said, '...As your days, so shall your strength be.' (Deuteronomy 33:25 NKJV) (g) <i>Instead of com</i><i>plaining, work on identifying solutions</i>, and more will come to you. (h) <i>When you</i><i>'</i><i>re distracted, focus on your breathing</i>, take a walk and clear your mind, think on what you can control, and surrender the rest to God. (i) <i>When you</i><i>'</i><i>re lonely, remember the peo</i><i>ple who</i><i>'</i><i>ve helped you this far</i> and who love and support you. (j) <i>When you</i><i>'</i><i>re fatigued, take time to rest</i> - but never ever give up! Finish strong in everything you do. (k) <i>When you</i><i>'</i><i>re under pressure and under scrutiny, smile </i>and have fun. You only live once. Life is short... so seize the moment!</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Let there be no strife between you and me...' Genesis 13:8 NAS<br /><br /><p>The conflict between Abram and Lot teaches us important principles about our families. Lot had lived peacefully in his Uncle Abram's home. Abram had taken him along on the journey of faith, when suddenly conflict arose. And because conflict reveals character, Lot showed his true colours. Since their growing herds were too big to share the same pastures, Abram suggested they split the land between them, offering Lot first choice. Lot '...chose for himself...' (Genesis 13:11 NAS) the best land, leaving the rest to his uncle. Lot moved to rich, sinful Sodom; Abram built an altar to the Lord. Same genes - totally different values! So: (1) <i>Consider the facts</i>. Abram was God's appointed leader and Israel's primary patriarch. God had promised him a homeland, fatherhood of a great nation, blessing and protection. And above all these, God promised that in him, '...All the families of the earth will be blessed!' (Genesis 12:3 NAS) In practical, day-to-day terms, Abram was the senior partner and major stockholder in the family business. He had shown love and generosity to his nephew, and in the crunch, valued their relationship over personal interests. Abram, therefore, deserved consideration and deference from his nephew. But Lot never gave it to him. (2) <i>Consider the point</i>. For the family's sake, Abram chose not to 'pull rank' or 'insist on his rights' or 'show who's boss'. He proved that God alone vindicates us! We shouldn't even attempt to vindicate ourselves. Abram chose grace over law, humility over pride, self-denial over 'rights', mercy over justice, love over lust, and character over popular opinion. Think about it!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Let there be no strife between you and me...for we are brothers.' Genesis 13:8 NAS<br /><br /><p>Family conflict brings out the worst and the best in all of us. But conflict itself isn't the problem - character is! Conflict just reveals what's important to us. Abram's priority was the family; Lot's was 'getting rich'. Abram's concern was harmony; Lot's was self-preservation. Abram was driven by his faith; Lot by his greed. Abram was a giver; Lot was a taker. But watch how the story turned out. (1) <i>What s</i><i>hould have happened?</i> The junior partner should have submitted to the senior; the follower should have deferred to the leader; the less-spiritual should have acknowledged the more-spiritual. But Lot failed on all counts! (2) <i>What could have happened?</i> As the God-appointed leader Abram could have assumed top dog status and enforced his will, but he didn't. He could have been concerned about winning, but wasn't. He could have called in his debts with Lot, but refused to. (3) <i>What did happen?</i> First, Abram elevated relationship above personal advantage. Second, he relinquished his 'rights', to keep peace in the family. Third, he 'turned the other cheek' and deferred to Lot. The greater gave way to the lesser. The stronger made allowance for the weaker. The mature showed mercy toward the immature. Did it make Abram the weaker man and Lot the stronger? Did Abram lose and Lot win? No! God always has the last word. And it was this: '...Look...northward and southward and eastward and westward...all the land which you see, I will give it to you and to your descendants forever.' (Genesis 13:14-15 NAS) Doing things God's way is the certain road to peace and prosperity. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I have set before you life and death...choose life...' Deuteronomy 30:19 NIV<br /><br /><p>Choice is the greatest power God gave you. Too many of us just accept our lives - we don't become leaders of ourselves. As a result, we can't get out of our own way. Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel wrote in <i>Souls On Fire</i> that when you die and go to meet your Maker, you're not going to be asked why you didn't become a messiah or find a cure for cancer. All you're going to be asked is why you didn't become you, why you didn't become all that you really are. Fulfilling God's will for your life requires taking responsibility for yourself and your life. How do you do that? By saying 'yes' to God first - then to yourself. Every time you say 'yes', you open yourself up to your God-given potential and to the greatest of possibilities. If you're used to saying 'no', you may find this difficult. If that is true in your case, then at least be willing to say 'maybe'. One day a father whose child was chronically ill asked Jesus to heal him. 'Jesus said to him, &quot;If you can believe, all things are possible to him who believes.&quot; Immediately the father of the child cried out and said with tears, &quot;Lord, I believe; help my unbelief!&quot;' (Mark 9:23-24 NKJV) If you're a self-doubter, pray that same prayer. God will answer it. Never forget that you are unique, possessing talents, experiences and opportunities that no one else has ever had - or ever will have. You're responsible to become all God made you to be, not only for your own benefit but for everyone else's.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['You must build...according to the pattern I will show you.' Exodus 25:9 NLT<br /><br /><p>Go to God for the plan. God told Moses: 'You must build this tabernacle and its furnishings exactly according to the pattern I will show you.' God knows what you will need in the future, you don't. He prepared Noah a hundred years in advance of the flood. He prepared Joseph to feed Egypt seven years in advance of the famine. Without God's guidance the best you'll ever have are estimates, educated guesswork and projections. 'To the Israelites at the foot of the mountain, the glory of the Lord appeared at the summit like a consuming fire. Then Moses disappeared into the cloud as he climbed higher up the mountain. He remained on the mountain forty days and forty nights.' (Exodus 24:17-18 NLT) Moses spent over a month waiting in God's presence for direction. Why? Because what he was building had to meet the needs of God's people for generations. So go to the place of prayer. Tell those around you, 'I'm not coming back until I hear from God and get His plan!' When God orders it, He pays for it. But when He doesn't give the order, and you decide to do it anyway, you're on your own! Why? Because you won't have confidence to go to Him in your time of need. Unless you start right, you won't finish right. You say, 'But I'm nobody special. Why would God speak to someone like me?' If God has called you, and He has, then you're special. His promise is, 'If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God...and it will be given to him.' (James 1:5 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...show me now Your way, that I may know You and...find grace...' Exodus 33:13 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Get to know the people. No minister has ever had so much trouble with a congregation as Moses had with the congregation of Israel in the wilderness. At the Red Sea, he was so happy that he wrote a song to celebrate their spectacular victory. But later, when the complaints were coming at him from every direction, he told God he wanted to die. It reminds us of one pastor who asked another, 'How many active members do you have in your church?' The other replied, 'Five hundred. Half of them are actively working for me, the other half are actively working against me.' Pastors, different people in your churches will play different roles in the plan God has given you. Some of the people you will like, some you won't. But you've been called to lead them all, so get to know them. On his deathbed, Jacob prophesied over each of his twelve sons describing both their nature and their future. He said Reuben was unruly, Simeon and Levi were prone to anger, Judah was born for leadership, Zebulun would extend his borders, Issachar was willing to carry the load, Dan was sharp when it came to dealing with people, Gad was a fighter who wouldn't retreat, Asher loved cooking, Naphtali loved raising children, Joseph would be wounded but would come back stronger than ever, and Benjamin would be an entrepreneur who knew how to excel in business (Genesis 49). To lead people successfully, you must know them. So pray, 'Show me now Your way, that I may know You and that I may find grace in Your sight.' </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us...' Acts 15:28 NKJV <br /><br /><p>Listen for God's guidance. As long as you keep listening to people whose opinions don't align with God's Word and God's will, you'll be frustrated and get nowhere. When important decisions that affect the future must be made, you must be able to hear from God. You must also welcome feedback. Why? Because if you're not teachable, you're not usable. Now, the majority opinion can be valuable in run-of-the-mill matters, but when a God-given vision is at issue, first and foremost you must listen for God's guidance. You say, 'Isn't there wisdom in having a plurality of leadership?' Yes, even the best leaders have blind spots and need people with 20/20 vision in those areas. '...certain men came down from Judea and taught the brethren, &quot;Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.&quot;' (Acts 15:1 NKJV) What was the result? '...Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and dispute with them, [and] they determined that Paul and Barnabas and certain others of them should go up to Jerusalem, to the apostles and elders, about this question.' (Acts 15:2 NKJV) How did the apostles handle it? They said: '...God, who knows the heart, acknowledged [the Gentiles] by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as He did to us, and made no distinction between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.' (Acts 15:8-9 NKJV) So after prayer and deliberation, the apostles wrote a letter to the church, saying, '...it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things.' (Acts 15:28 NKJV) And what was the result? 'When they had read it, they rejoiced...' (Acts 15:31 NKJV) </p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.' Romans 10:17 NKJV<br /><br /><p>If you want to know how strong your faith is, pay attention to what's coming out of your mouth. '...The word which they heard did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard it.' (Hebrews 4:2 NKJV) It's not enough to read God's Word; you must internalise it, and then vocalise it. We say all kinds of things, but the truth is that we don't really believe them because they don't show up in the way we live. You should live in such a way that if God is not who He says He is, you'll fall flat on your face. This means: (1) <i>Looking for opportunities to trust God more</i>. (2) <i>Trusting Him to come through for you regardless of the situation</i>. (3) <i>Strengthening your faith for the tough times ahead</i>. And here's how you do it: 'Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.' If someone could stick a thermometer under your tongue and take your spiritual temperature, the thing that would cause it to rise or fall would be the time you have spent in God's Word. You say, 'Right now my faith is very low.' Then start spending more time reading God's Word. You say, 'I wish I had the faith of so-and-so.' There's no mystery about how to close the gap between your faith and that of others - just spend more time in the Scriptures. Rearrange your priorities, take control of your time and put Bible reading at the top of your to-do list. If you're serious about growing in faith, it's a price you must be willing to pay. </p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...You are not your own.' 1 Corinthians 6:19 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Picture two people standing outside a house. One says, 'This is my house.' The other replies, 'How come?' The first one says, 'For three reasons. I built it. I paid for it. I live in it.' Let's look at the first reason why you belong to God: <i>Creation</i>. Some people think we all came from an amoeba. The problem is they can't tell us where the amoeba came from! The Bible says, 'God created man in His own image...male and female He created them.' (Genesis 1:27 NKJV) Some people say that the earth came into existence as a result of the 'big bang' theory. Yet if you told them, 'The car you drive right now was the result of an explosion at an assembly plant in Geelong,' they'd question your sanity. If there's a design, there must be a designer. If there's a creation, there must be a Creator. And since God made you, He holds ownership rights over you. The Bible says: 'Do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own? For you were bought at a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's.' (1 Corinthians 6:19-20 NKJV) Not only did God create you, He gave you certain gifts so that you could fulfil His purposes and bring glory to Him. So before they tag your toe and write your obituary, ask God what you were born to do. Only by finding and fulfilling His purpose, can you fill the God-shaped space within you, given to you when you were born. </p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['You were bought with a price...' 1 Corinthians 6:20 KJV<br /><br /><p>God's second claim on your life is <i>Calvary</i>. There's a story about two friends who went to law school. One became a judge; the other became a law-breaker and ended up in court. Guess who was sitting in the judge's seat? His friend. So how could the judge be merciful, yet still be just? Taking off the black robes of justice, he walked over to the dock where the prisoner stood and said, 'Not only am I this man's friend, today I'm his saviour. I will stand chargeable with all his debts.' At the cross, God took all your sin and put it on Christ's account, and took all Christ's righteousness and put it on your account. And the moment you trust Christ as your Saviour you're no longer under the sentence of death. The value of something is determined by the price a buyer is willing to pay for it. At Calvary God said, 'This is how much I love you!' Your Creator became your Redeemer. 'The Maker of the universe, as Man for man was made a curse. The claims of law that He had made, unto the uttermost He paid.' </p>
<p>To fulfil His purposes in the earth, God always had a man. To deliver the Israelites from Egypt, He used Moses. To challenge the prophets of Baal, He used Elijah. But when it came to your salvation, God 'saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor; therefore His own arm brought salvation...' (Isaiah 59:16 NKJV) The good news is: When God could not find a man, He Himself became a man; that we who are the sons of men, might become the sons of God. Awesome!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.' 1 Corinthians 6:20 KJV<br /><br /><p>God's third claim on your life is <i>consecration</i>. It's not a word we hear very much these days. It means 'to be set aside for exclusive use.' You say, 'But I have so many faults.' God's not looking for perfection, He's looking for willingness. The Bible says, 'Every high priest [was] taken from among men...' (Hebrews 5:1 NKJV) The people God calls and uses are all human and flawed in some way. Why would God call someone like that? Because they 'can have compassion on those who are ignorant and going astray, since [they also are] subject to weakness.' (Hebrews 5:2 NKJV) You say, 'My parents want me to go to Bible College and be a minister.' Well, there's good news and bad. The good news is that Bible College can deepen your devotion to Christ and give you insights into His Word. The bad news is that your parents can't call you; only God can! '...no man takes this honour to himself, but he who is called by God...' (Hebrews 5:4 NKJV) You say, 'How will I know I'm called to a ministry?' Fruitfulness! When controversy broke out in Israel over who should be in leadership, God told Moses to pick a man from each of the twelve tribes. That man's rod was placed in the Ark of the Covenant overnight, and the one whose rod 'budded' was the one God had called. (Numbers 17:1-8) The Bible says: 'A man's gift makes room for him...' (Proverbs 18:16 NKJV) When God calls you, He will open the doors, make the connections, and provide the resources. All He asks of you is a life that's consecrated to doing His will.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Let us keep in step with the Spirit.' Galatians 5:25 NIV<br /><br /><p>If the Christian life is about having a personal relationship with God, then God must still speak to us today. But a relationship can't be built on one-way speeches. First, it requires commitment. Then it requires communication between two people in which each speaks and listens to the other. 'You...are controlled...by the Spirit, if the Spirit of God lives in you...' (Romans 8:9 NIV) That means having Spirit-controlled responses, and making Spirit-led decisions. When you follow God, life no longer consists only of that which can be seen, felt or figured out. It includes walking by faith, trusting Him, learning to know His voice and the leadings of His Spirit. Some of us are reluctant to do that because we've seen people who claim to be doing it and their approach scares us. So when we sense the Spirit's leading we doubt it, analyse it, conclude it isn't logical and don't pay attention to it. Some of us want to obey the Spirit, but we're not sure we know that He's really speaking to us. We wonder, 'Is this God's voice or my own desires?' We've all experienced this; it's a normal part of the Christian life. This is why Paul writes, 'Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit.' (Galatians 5:25 NIV) Spiritual guidance is learned - one step at a time. Even the most mature believer will stumble and get it wrong at times. No problem: 'If the Lord delights in a man's way, He makes his steps firm; though he stumble, he will not fall, for the Lord upholds him with his Hand.' (Psalm 37:23-24 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The fruit of righteousness will be...confidence...' Isaiah 32:17 NIV<br /><br /><p>Never mistake competence for confidence; one is ability-based, the other comes from knowing who you are in Christ; that you're '...complete in Him...' (1 John 2:5 NIV) Kristin Armstrong says: 'The first thing I learned about confidence, was I didn't possess it...I had a thin glaze of arrogance covering up a core of fear. All those years of being a success in the eyes of the world left me deathly afraid of failure. Worldly success requires taking risks beyond the comfort zones of previous accomplishments. Spiritual success requires letting go of outcomes and allowing God to move on your behalf. I was so afraid of failure...I never found success in it either... the false confidence I'd known was built on my own abilities... However if you suddenly find a lump in your breast, or your spouse says he never loved you, or you get fired from your job, or your child is seriously ill, every tactic you've ever employed and every skill you've ever mastered will get you nowhere...The Bible says, &quot;...Have a sane estimate of your [abilities]...&quot; (Romans 12:3 PHPS)...once you realise you aren't perfect...you can exhale and start the task of being good enough...When your confidence stems from knowing the almighty, unchanging One, you cannot be shaken by change or circumstances. You...exude competence, peace, contentment, and fortitude.' Isn't it time you got out from under the pressure of acting like God and having all the answers? 'We have different gifts, according to the grace given us...' (Romans 12:6 NIV) When you use your gift to glorify God, you're doing what He intended you to do. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The gift of God is eternal life.' Romans 6:23 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Does your life feel empty? Do you long for peace, the knowledge that your sins are forgiven and the assurance of a home in Heaven? Today, place your trust in Christ and make Him Lord of your life. 'How?' you ask. Take the Roman road to salvation. (Found in the Book of Romans.) </p>
<p><i>Step 1</i>: 'for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.' (Romans 3:23 NIV) Face it, we're all sinners to the core, incapable of living the glorious lives God wills for us and desperately in need of a Saviour. <i>Step 2</i>: 'For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.' (Romans 6:23 NIV) The Gospel means 'good news' and here's the good news: your sins (all of them) have been paid for at the cross. <i>Step 3</i>: 'But God demonstrates His own love for us in this: while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.' (Romans 5:8 NIV) You can't earn salvation by good works or deserve it by having good character. God offers it to you freely. All you have to do is receive it by faith. <i>Step 4</i>: 'That if you confess with your mouth, &quot;Jesus is Lord,&quot; and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.' 'Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.' (Romans 10:9;13 NIV)</p>
<p>Now pray these words: 'Lord, I surrender my life to You. Come into my heart. By faith I receive the gift of eternal life. Thank You for setting everything right between You and me, in Jesus' name. Amen.' </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Run to win!' 1 Corinthians 9:24 NLT<br /><br /><p>In the Roman Empire, athletes stripped down to a simple loincloth so that nothing prevented them from running their best race. Referring to it, Paul writes: 'Don't you realise that in a race everyone runs, but only one person gets the prize? So run to win! All athletes are disciplined in their training. They do it to win a prize that will fade away, but we do it for an eternal prize. So I run with purpose in every step...' (1 Corinthians 9:24-26 NLT) How about you? Do you just want the fun of being in the race, or are you running to win? To succeed at being what God has redeemed and called you to be, you'll have to stop doing certain things, even enjoyable things, and begin doing other things that support your goals and help you to fulfil your God-ordained purpose. Sometimes this will mean saying 'no' to well-intentioned people who try to involve you in things that steal your time and produce the wrong results. It will also mean dealing with '...the sin that so easily entangles...' (Hebrews 12:1 NIV) When God says something is wrong, it's wrong! You don't need to rationalise, make excuses or feel sorry for yourself. You just need to agree, ask His forgiveness and get it out of your life. Who gets the prize? Those who pay the price! Paul knew he couldn't win the race without first bringing his body, mind and emotions under the control of God's Spirit. The same goes for you. And you can't expect somebody else to make you do what's right; you must listen to what God's saying to you, and take action. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Clothed and in his right mind...' Mark 5:15 NKJV<br /><br /><p>One of Christ's greatest miracles was the healing of a man who was controlled and tortured by evil spirits (Mark 5). The Bible says: 'His dwelling [was] among the tombs; and no one could bind him, not even with chains...neither could anyone tame him ...always, night and day, he was...crying out and cutting himself with stones.' (Mark 5:3-5 NKJV) Notice four things about this man's condition: (1) <i>He kept hurting himself</i>. Now, he used stones to do it, but some of us use drugs, food, sex, alcohol, overwork and negativity. What are you doing today that's hurting you? Until you can acknowledge it, you won't get free of it. (2) <i>He was preoccupied with death</i>. Why else would someone choose to live in a graveyard? Life's troubles can bring you to the place where you lose your very desire to live. (3) <i>He had no peace, day or night</i>. The downside of godless living is restlessness, irritability and discontent. Nothing satisfies or is ever enough. (4) <i>He lived in isolation</i>. Satan's job is made easier when you don't have a spiritual support system. Fellowship wrecks his plans. </p>
<p>Then Jesus came! He made a boat trip across storm-tossed Galilee to get to this man. Just one word from Jesus, and we read: '...they...saw the one who had been demon-possessed...sitting...clothed and in his right mind...' (Mark 5:15 NKJV) Out of gratitude the man wanted to join Jesus' disciples. But Jesus told him, 'Go home to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you...' (Mark 5:19 NKJV) When Christ sets you free, your first responsibility is to stay free and help set others free.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The Lord...has given rest to His people...' 1 Kings 8:56 NIV <br /><br /><p>Live for today, and put tomorrow into God's hands. Begin to eliminate the words 'what if' from your vocabulary. God will always be one step ahead of you. 'The Lord, He is the One who goes before you. He will be with you, He will not leave you nor forsake you; do not fear nor be dismayed.' (Deuteronomy 31:8 NKJV) The reason God is called the 'Alpha and Omega' in Scripture is because He not only initiates the starting point of your spiritual journey, He has arranged every step of it according with His will. He says to you: 'I know the plans I have for you, says the Lord. They are plans for good and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope...when you pray, I will listen...I will end your captivity and restore your fortunes.' (Jeremiah 29:11-14 NLT) If you're fearful of the future, check with the past. 'Blessed be the Lord, who has given rest to His people...according to all that He promised. There has not failed one word of all...He promised.' (1 Kings 8:56 NKJV) You will never conquer your worries entirely, for worries, just like weaknesses and character flaws, draw you closer to God and keep you dependent on Him. </p>
<p>For forty years in the wilderness the Israelites never missed a meal. God delivered it to the door of each of their tents daily. And He will provide for you too. As Bradford Torrey wrote: 'Not so in haste, my heart! Have faith in God, and wait; although He lingers long, He never comes too late.'</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Lord, &quot;Increase our faith.&quot;' Luke 17:5 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Faith answers the question, 'How?' with one word: 'God!' The Bible says, 'Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.' (Hebrews 11:1 NKJV) Notice: (1) <i>Faith is a 'substance'.</i> Some people see faith as something ethereal and 'otherworldly'. But it's not; we use faith every day. For example, you pick up the phone, call a department store, place an order, and they ask for your credit card number. Then they give you a receipt number. The receipt is what you hold on to while you're waiting for the item to arrive - it gives you the assurance that the product is on the way. And the same is true in the spiritual realm. God promises to answer your prayer, you believe Him, but your faith is the 'substance' or the receipt you hold on to while you're waiting. (2) <i>Faith is also 'evidence.'</i> Why would you believe that someone you can't see on the other end of a phone line would send you something just because you order it? Because it happens every day for others, and it's probably happened to you before. Therefore you're not being presumptuous or silly when you go to your letterbox expecting it to be there. You are not the first person to trust God and you won't be the last. 'Lord, You have been our dwelling place in all generations.' (Psalm 90:1 NAS) People have been trusting God for thousands of years and He has never let them down. His faithfulness is all the 'evidence' you need. So it's not foolish to put your trust in a God like that, is it?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['A hard worker has plenty of food...' Proverbs 28:19 NLT<br /><br /><p>Even in a bad job market 'good help is hard to find'. So when employers find it, they do all they can to keep it. Even in a long economic downturn, there are still practical rules that increase the likelihood you'll keep your job, and maybe earn a promotion. These rules line up with what's taught in God's Word: (1) <i>Understand that hard work is a blessing.</i> God created paradise, then He created us. Then He put us to work, saying, 'By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food.' (Genesis 3:19 NIV) God rewards 'sweat' (Proverbs 28:19). Giving your job, even a menial one, your best pleases Him. And ultimately He, not your boss, controls your future. (2) <i>Accept reality.</i> Wishing away your present circumstances while feeling entitled to better will just make you feel worse and get you nowhere. Our 'God [turns] the curse into a blessing.' (Deuteronomy 23:5 NIV) He gives 'beauty for ashes' (Isaiah 61:3 NKJV). In hard times, God raises up people with fresh ideas that actually make the future better than the past - not only for themselves but for others. And you can become one of those people. (3) <i>Make God your source.</i> '...I am the Lord your God who teaches you to profit, who leads you by the way you should go.' (Isaiah 48:17 NKJV) Make God your life coach. Give your boss the hard work he or she deserves, but trust only in the One Who promised to 'use His wonderful riches...to give you everything you need.' (Philippians 4:19 NCV) </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Get wisdom...get understanding.' Proverbs 4:7 NIV<br /><br /><p>In his book, <i>Emotional Intelligence</i>, psychologist Dr. Daniel Goleman says that IQ amounts to only 20 percent of success. To keep your job and earn a promotion, you need more than intelligence. Goleman suggests several things to help you succeed on the job: </p>
<p>(1) <i>Confidence</i>: Confident workers trust their God-given abilities. And where do you get this confidence? From God! 'It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man.' (Psalm 118:8 NKJV) Confidence in God gives you the assurance that you 'can do all things through Christ who strengthens [you].' (Philippians 4:13 NKJV) (2) <i>Curiosity:</i> 'Get wisdom. And in all your getting, get understanding.' Curiosity is eagerness to know, learn and understand more. Curious workers are interested in what's not obvious. Others presume that a solution doesn't exist or is too difficult, so they quit at the point at which they should be starting. But when others are saying, 'It's way beyond me,' the curious employee says, 'There's an answer. There's a better way. We just need more understanding.' Every boss wants the sort of curious worker who makes things better. (3) <i>Decisiveness:</i> 'God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.' (2 Timothy 1:7 NKJV) Fear results in an attitude that makes you pull back, or freeze in place, or give up. That spirit doesn't come from God, so resist it. Don't be afraid to take a prayed-over risk, or accept responsibility for an outcome.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience.' Colossians 3:12 NIV <br /><br /><p>Succeeding at your job requires: (1) <i>Empathy:</i> Always show consideration for other people's situations, needs, feelings and perceptions. Try to understand what it's like to walk in their shoes. By doing this you increase their motivation, improve the working environment, and raise the productivity level. 'Clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience.' You are supposed to 'wear' these qualities to work every day. (2) <i>Flexibility:</i> It's the capacity to adapt, adjust and advance. In an environment driven by economic difficulty and downsizing, rigid and reactive employees are often the first to be made redundant or fired. Learn to 'roll with the punches'. Paul did that. 'I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances...in any and every situation...I can do everything through Him who gives me strength.' (Philippians 4:11-13 NIV) When the winds of change blow, flexible people bend rather than break. They live to stand again, and even get promoted. (3) <i>Humour:</i> Start seeing yourself and the world around you with a sense of enjoyment. Refuse to take yourself too seriously. Look for the humour hidden in life's serious moments and you'll find it. People who are dispensers of misery just drag everybody down. God's Word says: 'Being cheerful keeps you healthy...' (Proverbs 17:22 GNT) 'A cheerful heart is good medicine...' (Proverbs 17:22 NIV) A good sense of humour improves things and makes the workplace better for everybody. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Children are a blessing...' Psalm 127:3 CEV<br /><br /><p>If you've forgotten how well off you are to have your family, read this: 'I'd finally had it. The children were loud, irritable and impossible. I was tired and fed up. My wife was tired and fed up. So I decided to run away from it all and have a day just for me; a day in which I did what I wanted. I was going to live it up and be as greedy as I pleased. I wasn't going to tend to anybody but myself. I zoomed out of the house with $50. &quot;There, I did it.&quot; I said to myself as I drove to the highway and headed north. Well, I went to a shopping centre, had a great time in a bookstore and bought the collected poems of Walt Whitman. Afterwards, I drove to McDonald's and ordered two hamburgers, my own large fries and my own large cola. I ate everything without being interrupted, without wiping anyone's mouth, nose or bottom. Then I ate the biggest chocolate ice cream I could find. I was free! I was out of town! So I drove to the cinema and watched a film without buying popcorn, without someone sitting on my lap, without escorting someone to the bathroom. I was a free man. I was living it up - and I was miserable. By the time I returned home, everyone was asleep. As I slipped into bed my wife whispered, &quot;We missed you.&quot; I answered, &quot;Me too.&quot; I never ran away from home again!'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Work as if you were doing it for the Lord, not for people.' Colossians 3:23 NCV<br /><br /><p>Keeping your job and earning a promotion calls for: (1) <i>Initiative:</i> Think outside the box. Better still, throw the old box away and ask God for a new one! Intelligence is more than just IQ. The average employee with initiative will always excel over the graduate without it. If you don't believe it, read history. Education alone won't make you productive, but the Spirit and the Word of God will. Paul writes, 'Let the Spirit renew your thoughts and attitudes.' (Ephesians 4:23 NLT) Peter writes, '...I have written...to stimulate you to wholesome thinking.' (2 Peter 3:1 NIV) Let God stimulate your mind with ideas that make you an in-demand employee. (2) <i>Perseverance:</i> What is it? It's the energy and desire to achieve. It's motivation, determination, commitment, faithfulness, patience, resilience in the face of difficulty and a willingness to work hard. Those who avoid the more demanding route and choose the easy way are costly to employ, decrease morale, reduce quality and lessen the company's productivity. Paul challenges his readers to persevere in their assignment. 'Here is my advice...you should finish what you started. Let the eagerness you showed in the beginning be matched now.' (2 Corinthians 8:10-11 NLT) (3) <i>Respect:</i> Always consider the rights and needs of others. Treat them sensitively, kindly, courteously, and within the limits of law, conscience and Scripture. 'In all the work you are doing, work the best you can. Work as if you were doing it for the Lord, not for people.' When you become such a worker, God is with you!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I will give...you...people for your life.' Isaiah 43:4 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Thousands have attended the <i>Women of Faith</i> conferences every year. Many have gone in search of hope, meaning and self-worth. After hearing one speaker after another describe God's love for His children, an attendee sent this email: 'In the movie <i>Hook</i>, Peter Pan had grown up, become old and overweight, and looked nothing like the Peter the Lost Boys knew. In the midst of the boys' shouting that this was NOT Peter, one of the smallest boys took him by the hand and pulled him down to his level. Then he placed his hands on Peter's face and proceeded to move the skin around, reshaping his face. The boy looked into Peter's eyes and said, &quot;There you are, Peter!&quot; I brought a lot with me to <i>Women of Faith</i>, things that only God could see. But throughout the weekend I could feel God's hands on my face, pushing away all the &quot;stuff&quot; I had brought. And then I could hear Him say, &quot;There you are. There you are!&quot;' Listen. God is saying the same words to you today, finding the beauty the years bury, the sparkle that time tries to take. Seeing you and loving the you He sees. Saying, 'There you are. There you are!' You say, 'I'm afraid I will never find someone to love me.' Don't you believe it! God says: 'Since you were precious in My sight, you have been honoured, and I have loved you. Therefore I will give men for you, and people for your life.' If you seek God, and reach out, God will bring the right people into your life.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Fools vent...the wise quietly hold it back.' Proverbs 29:11 NLT<br /><br /><p>Carol Kuykendall writes: 'My very pregnant daughter got her hair cut...from long to stylishly short. She was trying to get used to her new look when we ran into one of her friends. &quot;Oh no!&quot; her friend wailed...&quot;I don't like it!&quot; Then as if to rationalise her words, she quickly added, &quot;You know me. I'm a Truth-Teller!&quot; As we walked away my daughter told me she could've done without the truth that day!...It made me more aware of that critical moment in conversation when I'm faced with a choice: Do I say what I'm thinking? Or do I zip it? I keep hearing that &quot;telling it like it is&quot; and &quot;being real&quot; is good for relationships. Reality TV, confessions on Oprah and Twittering the Truth add to our reverence for authenticity. But here's what I know about myself: if I say everything I think, I can slay people in my path. And just because I think something - doesn't make it true...A good question to ask is: Is it helpful - or hurtful - to the person or our relationship? What about the timing and tone? [For example] a comment about a spouse's appearance is hurtful when they can't do anything about it, and will only make him or her self-conscious the rest of the evening.' The Bible says, 'Fools vent...the wise quietly hold it back.' Knowing when not to speak is often more important than knowing what to say. That's what Paul had in mind: 'Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up...that it may benefit those who listen.' (Ephesians 4:29 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[SoulFood: Ezek 46-48, Luke 1:57-66, Ps 139:7-12, Pr 15:28-30<br /><br /><p>Debbie, a radiant 37-year-old who worked at The Word For You Today in Atlanta, died after battling cancer. People everywhere prayed for her healing, including the elders at Northpoint Church. Some of those who attended her funeral wondered, 'Why?' The truth is, sometimes God heals us in response to the prayer of faith (James 5:14), other times He takes us to Heaven, which Paul describes as 'far better' (Philippians 1:23). This raises the question: 'Why are some people healed in response to prayer and others not?' The answer is: 'We don't know, and God doesn't tell us!' Paul, who wrote half the New Testament, had a ministry so miraculous that the dead were raised, yet he confessed, 'We know in part.' (1 Corinthians 13:9) </p>
<p>Pastor James Bradley sheds light on this difficult subject. He points out that in Hebrews chapter 11, some 'escaped the edge of the sword' (Hebrews 11:34 NIV), while others 'were put to death by the sword.' (Hebrews 11:37 NIV) But notice in verse 39, 'These were all commended for their faith.' Bradley writes: 'It seems clear that we can't always measure faith by results. Faith is a virtue and value on its own merit. Our faith is not based on what we get, it's based on who we trust.' Speaking of Debbie's death, he wrote: 'She did not fail her faith and her faith did not fail her. She was, and is, a wonderful example of trusting God in the most difficult of life's challenges. She's a champion of faith, and I was inspired by her unshakeable trust and love for the Lord.' </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Look after...widows...' James 1:27 NIV<br /><br /><p>Miriam Neff says: 'With [my husband] Bob's exit to Heaven...life changed: my calendar, my chequebook...what's in my frig...the look in my children's eyes when they step through the door on holidays. My living space is more cluttered. I seldom use make-up...there are other changes so personal they can't be shared. Loneliness and solitude are not descriptive enough...Widows experience so many firsts, we stop counting...As a widow I've learned that we all change. And much of the change is good. We become faith-filled because we can't face the day any other way. We become strong because we've no choice. We're compassionate because our heart has been broken.' The fact is, women whose husbands die lose 75 percent of their friendships, 60 percent experience health issues, one-third are clinically depressed one year later, and most face financial hardship. As one pastor says, 'Widows move from the front row of the church to the back, and then out the door. They go from serving and singing in the choir, to solitude and silent sobbing.' God cares so much about widows He mentions them over one hundred times in Scripture. He's a 'defender of widows' (Psalms 68:5 NIV). He 'watches over...and sustains [them]' (Psalms 146:9 NIV). James says, 'Religion that God...accepts as pure and faultless is...to look after...widows.' Miriam Neff adds: 'No one can comfort a widow like another widow...when we see another woman enter this experience...we want to comfort her...While the need for financial support and help...is common, the need for connection is more pressing...we need believing friends near us.' </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...So we might be the most important of all the things He made.' James 1:18 NCV<br /><br /><p>Be careful around people who don't value themselves, because they're incapable of valuing you. Look for those who enhance you, not inhibit you, who fertilise your mind and fortify your faith. When you're around them, you'll see your best qualities mirrored, and be nurtured by the words that come from their lips. When you encounter somebody who says you have nothing to offer, be sure to laugh - it's impolite to hear a joke and not laugh. When God made you He stepped back and said, 'That's very good.' (Genesis 1:31) So stop entertaining contrary opinions. You have so much potential that the word 'possibility' is written all over you. By God's grace you can be everything He desires. 'God decided to give us life through the word of truth, so we might be the most important of all the things He made.' You say, 'But I've so many regrets.' If you've repented and learned from them, get your eyes on the future! God's love isn't based on your performance. He didn't pick you because of your virtues. 'While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.' (Romans 5:8 NKJV) He's the God of second chances, and third ones too. Paul writes, 'God began doing a good work in you, and I am sure He will continue it until it is finished...' (Philippians 1:6 NCV) The God who brought you this far will take you the rest of the way - He's committed to you. Just make sure you're committed to Him.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...In the day of my disaster...the Lord was my support.' 2 Samuel 22:19 NIV <br /><br /><p>A phone call in the small hours, a malignant tumour, a police officer at your door, a child addicted to drugs - if you live long enough you'll be confronted with 'the day of disaster'. And it's the strength of your relationship with God that will dictate your response. CS Lewis said that we can either acquire the wisdom assigned to a trial, or keep repeating it until we 'get it'. One author points out that God's 'disaster-preparedness kit is found in Psalm 31:24 NIV: <i>Be strong</i>. Why? <i>Because God is fighting for you</i>. You must know God, know your convictions, and know how to tap into God's unlimited power. You are not who you, or anyone else thinks...God says you are strong. Believe Him! Take heart. Don't let your pain shut you down. Take the broken pieces and offer them to God...choose to live with love. A closed heart isn't worth fighting for. You've worked too hard to get this far, so work with Him to see your healing all the way through. Hope in the Lord. Put no stock in emotion, circumstances, or gossip...Place your hopes and dreams at the altar...God makes all things new and possible. Anything other than the real thing will fail...No matter how long I've spent in God's workshop, my progress is proven only in the moment of peril. We prepare in advance so our responses are involuntary...There isn't a situation, a temptation, or a question where Ephesians 6:10 doesn't apply: &quot;Be strong in the Lord and in His mighty power&quot; (NIV). On multiple-choice tests it's the answer...God isn't telling you to be tough on your own...rely on His strength and let Him do for you what He knows is best.'</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Don't begin until you count the cost...' Luke 14:28 NLT<br /><br /><p>Earning the right to lead calls for the following things: (1) <i>Prayerfully evaluating before you act.</i><i> </i>The very thing that makes leading others so appealing to your ego makes you vulnerable to their pressures and praise. 'When Jesus perceived that they were about to...make Him king, He departed again to the mountain by Himself alone.' (John 6:15 NKJV) Let's be honest - who amongst us doesn't want to be 'king' sometimes? But Jesus wasn't led by the applause of the crowd, He was led by the will of His Father. And you must be too. (2) <i>Not just filling the slot, but filling it with the right person.</i> Sometimes we give people jobs because we can't find anybody else to do them. But what happens when the job outgrows them? There's more at stake here than sparing somebody's feelings. Your fear of confrontation will permit people to languish in the wrong place, slowing down the vision and discouraging the gifted people around you who keep wondering, 'How long are you going to put up with this?' (3) <i>Seeking the best counsel you can find.</i><i> </i>'Be with wise men and become wise...' (Proverbs 13:20 TLB) Don't pay twice for the same information. Seek advice from someone you respect, someone who's already done what you want to do, particularly when your decision affects others and will be called upon to stand the test of time. What looks good to you today, or in somebody else's polished sales pitch, may not look so good tomorrow when you're presented with better options. Jesus gives the bottom line: 'Don't begin until you count the cost.' </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...If God has given you leadership ability, take the responsibility seriously...' Romans 12:8 NLT<br /><br /><p>Earning the right to lead calls for asking yourself: (1) <i>Can I live with the results of this decision?</i> Before you launch into something be sure you have what it takes to handle it. If you can barely cope now, how will you handle more? Before God builds the ministry, He builds the man or woman, because with added success comes added responsibility. (2) <i>Is the return worth the investment?</i> When you overcommit and overextend yourself, the first thing that suffers is your time with God. The next thing that suffers is your family. And without the covering of both, you'll be vulnerable. There are a lot of good causes in this world, but God will only prosper you when you focus on what He has called you to do. (3) <i>Are my expectations realistic?</i> William Carey said, 'Attempt great things for God and expect great things from God.' When human wisdom and ability won't take you a step further, faith will, because faith holds the hand of God. And with God, 'All things are possible.' (Matthew 19:26 NKJV) Just make sure you're operating in faith and not presumption! (4) <i>How can I survive today in order to thrive tomorrow?</i> Obstacles and opposition are inevitable; they're part of the journey. But you must not allow them to make you doubt God and what He's called you to do. Be like Abraham - don't 'waver', stand on God's Word. 'He did not waver at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God, and being fully convinced that what He had promised He was also able to perform.' (Romans 4:20-21 NKJV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Promise me... not to awaken love until the time is right.' Song of Songs 2:7 NLT<br /><br /><p>When we feel hurt and rejected there's something inside us that wants to prove we're still worthy and desirable. As a result we can jump into the next relationship too quickly. But just like an infant doesn't go from crawling to driving overnight, there's a process involved. If you try to circumvent it you'll end up back at square one, wondering what happened. One author says: 'A new relationship won't successfully heal you, avoid aggravating inflicted wounds, or instantly clean up a mess...Regardless of the temporary bliss, sooner or later you'll end up faced again with your old stuff...If this is your situation, do things the right way. Take your time...These things can't be feigned...rushed or...pursued. They'll be given to you when you're ready, and not a moment sooner...you want the real deal this time...and [God] wants to be your filter, so in order to reach the treasure of your heart, a person must first pass through Him.' Solomon writes that we should take care 'not to awaken love until the time is right.' Don't be in such a hurry to take the edge off your pain that you run ahead of God. It takes time for Him to make you into the person He wants you to become. While He's working on you, He's preparing the heart of the right partner to show up at the right time. In the meantime, there's a way to fill the emptiness inside; work on developing a closer relationship with God and He will 'fill you with...joy and peace.' (Romans 15:13 NIV) </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Godly sorrow brings repentance...and leaves no regret...' 2 Corinthians 7:10 NIV<br /><br /><p>There's the kind of regret that leads to despair because you don't think God's grace is sufficient to cover your sins. Then there's 'sadness...used by God [which] brings a change of heart...and...no regret.' (2 Corinthians 7:10 GNT) This kind draws you closer and makes you more dependent on Him.  'See what God did with this sadness of yours... Such indignation, such alarm, such feelings, such devotion, such readiness to punish wrongdoing! You have shown yourselves to be without fault...' (2 Corinthians 7:11 GNT) Jon Walker writes: 'As the economy closed in I began to regret not buying a less expensive home. If only we'd bought a cheaper house. If only we'd rented. If only we'd stayed in our first house. I can 'If only' myself into depression and stagnation where I'm stuck between regret and forward motion. When my focus is not on the One who provides...I let regret become bigger than God...and following that logic, I believe past choices, an event, a tragedy, a compromise, a mistake - is more powerful than the God who spoke the world into existence...We live in 'if only/what if' moments more than we realise. They wrap us in a sense of hopeless paralysis: we fear the bad choices we made [and] the choices we face. God pours His grace into the present...our walk is one where we make a decision and stick with it, trusting that even if we make mistakes, God's big enough to turn them around. When regret becomes ungodly sorrow versus godly sorrow, you find yourself submerged in self-pity instead of looking to Him to work things out for the good of &quot;those...He has called according to His purpose.&quot;' (Romans 8:28 NKJV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['No one who drinks the water I give will ever be thirsty again...' John 4:14 CEV<br /><br /><p>We all want to be loved and appreciated for who we are. And when it doesn't happen on our timetable, it's tempting to rush into another relationship hoping it'll make everything better. The last couple to 'live happily ever after' may have been Snow White and Prince Charming! Keith Anderson writes about a friend whose relationship had taken a serious nosedive: 'I told him not to be in a big hurry to find comfort and rush into the next relationship. Stop where you are, I said, and learn what you can from this failure, and then step on it - move ahead in growth. The real failure is not in falling down but in staying there when you have fallen... Jesus told His disciples to shake the dust from their failures and move on. It's good advice. Don't become caught up in your failures. Don't become condemned to repeat the past. Learn from your mistakes and move on. Didn't Paul say the same thing in Philippians? &quot;Forgetting what is behind... I press on.&quot; (Philippians 3:13-14 NIV)' </p>
<p>One day Jesus met a woman who'd been married five times and was pursuing yet another relationship. Recognising that her need was not for another man, but a relationship with God, He said, 'No one who drinks the water I give will ever be thirsty again.' (John 4:14 CEV) Jesus saw beyond her sin to her real need, and restored her sense of self-worth. Bottom line: only the water Jesus gives will quench your soul's thirst. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Your sins are forgiven.' Matthew 9:2 NAS<br /><br /><p>Jesus said to a quadriplegic lying on a bed, 'Take courage, son; your sins are forgiven.' Perhaps you're asking, 'What sins could a quadriplegic commit?' There are three ways to sin: (1) Commission: the things we do. (2) Omission: the good we fail to do. (3) Disposition: our wrong attitudes. Why didn't Jesus just say, 'Arise, take up your bed and walk?' Because when you know that your sins are forgiven, you have the confidence to ask God for what you need, and the courage to rise up in faith and do what He tells you. Knowing his sins were forgiven enabled this man to do what everybody thought was impossible. There's an important lesson here. After Adam sinned he hid from God. When God said to him, 'Where are you?' he replied, 'I heard Your voice in the garden, and I was afraid...' (Genesis 3:9-10 NKJV) How can you know when something is wrong for you? When it causes you to hide from God! When it makes you avoid prayer, Bible-reading and fellowship with God's people. The Bible condemns sins such as stealing and lusting, but what about other things that are not so clearly spelled out in Scripture? To know whether something is right or wrong for you, you need only ask one question: 'How will this affect my confidence before God?' You'll never go wrong asking that question. 'If our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence toward God. And whatever we ask we receive from Him, because we keep His commandments and do those things that are pleasing in His sight.' (1 John 3:21-22 NKJV)</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['I...lifted my eyes to Heaven, and...I was restored...' Daniel 4:34-36 NKJV<br /><br /><p>When King Nebuchadnezzar repented, his 'understanding...reason...honour and splendour returned...and...[he] was restored.' But when we have an image to maintain, we're reluctant to ask for help in case people think less of us. One author writes: 'To fall is bad enough, but to fall and not cry out for help is worse...Some people are so full of pride and self-sufficiency they think, 'If I can't get up myself, I won't let anyone help me.' Stop being so proud - that's what caused you to fall in the first place! The Bible says: 'Those who walk in pride [God] is able to put down.' (Daniel 4:37 NKJV) Pride is dangerous, it forces you to lie needlessly in a helpless state for days - and sometimes years. If you'd asked for help immediately, you could have gotten up and gone on with your life.' Proverbs 14:12 NKJV says, 'There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is...death.' Have you ever tried to rescue an injured animal? It doesn't know your only desire is to help; it just knows it's in pain, and as a result it strikes out at the person who least deserves it. This is especially true when you've been wounded by someone close to you and didn't see it coming. You can hurt so much that you stop trusting everybody, including God. You stop praying and reading the Bible, you avoid those who want to help, and you refuse to let anybody pray for you. The Bible says, 'Do not harden your hearts.' (Hebrews 3:15 NKJV) Today, acknowledge that you've fallen and let God restore you. </p>

<title><![CDATA[Hindrances to Prayer (2)]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[hindrances-to-prayer-2]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...You do not have, because you do not ask...' James 4:2 NIV <br /><br /><p>Here are two more hindrances to answered prayer: (1) <i>Failure to pray.</i> There are hundreds of prayers for specific things mentioned in the Bible and many instances given where answers are provided. The Bible is chockfull of prayers - and answers. Our problem is, we spend a lot of time talking about prayer and fail to get down to the business of praying. Elizabeth George said, 'Prayer... releases the energies of God.' The goal of prayer is not to overcome God's reluctance, but to believe Him and take hold of His willingness. His Word says: 'You do not have, because you do not ask.' AE McAdam wrote: 'No praying man or woman accomplishes so much with so little expenditure of time, as when he or she is praying.' Until you learn to pray in faith and wait on God for the answer, you'll get nowhere. (2) <i>Failure to care.</i> When the Israelites complained that God wasn't answering their prayers He told them, 'Stop oppressing those who work for you and treat them fairly...share your food with the hungry...Clothe those who are cold and don't hide from [those] who need your help. If you do these things...the Lord will answer.' (Isaiah 58:6-9 TLB) Sin and unbelief are not the only things that hinder your prayers; self-centered living will! A little girl prayed for several weeks asking God for a certain thing. Finally in frustration she said, 'By the way, Lord, I've mentioned this to You several times before.' If that's your situation, stop thinking about your own needs and focus on the needs of others.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Perfect love casts out fear...' 1 John 4:18 NKJV <br /><br /><p>Are you trying your best to serve the Lord, yet you sometimes doubt your salvation? Though you're unaware of any particular sin in your life, you still feel unworthy to stand in God's presence, confident of His acceptance. Read this Scripture. Better yet, write it down and carry it with you: 'Perfect love casts out fear.' Now, if God loved you with an imperfect love you'd have cause to worry. Man's love, which is imperfect, keeps a list of sins and consults it often. But not God's love. The moment you place your trust in Christ He views you as 'righteous' and fully accepted from that point on. His love casts out your fear because it casts out your sin. Do you remember these words from John's epistle? 'If our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.' (1 John 3:20 NKJV) That means it's possible to be forgiven, yet feel unforgiven. So when you feel unforgiven, doubt your feelings instead of doubting God. Don't give your emotions a vote. Go back to Scripture. God's Word outranks all self-criticism and self-doubt. As Paul told Titus: 'The grace of God has been revealed, bringing salvation to all people...You must teach these things... You have the authority.' (Titus 2:11-15 NLT) Are you trusting in Christ as your Saviour? Then begin to love boldly and live robustly. Nothing fosters courage like a clear grasp of grace. 'If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.' (1 John 1:9 NKJV) Note the words, 'All unrighteousness.' Having received God's forgiveness, live forgiven! </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...That...day...God will reveal who His children really are.' Romans 8:19 NLT<br /><br /><p><i>B</i><i>y living a sacrificial life</i>. Salvation is free, but graduation with highest honours costs dearly: 'I have suffered the loss of all things.' (Philippians 3:8 NKJV) Paul once had a comfortable life, then everything changed. He was beaten almost to death eight times. He faced danger at the hand of friend and foe. He endured nakedness, sleeplessness, starvation and thirst (2 Corinthians 11:23-29). Did he get discouraged? Yes. Did he give up? No. 'I am well content with weaknesses, with insults, with distresses, with persecutions, with difficulties, for Christ's sake...' (2 Corinthians 12:10 NAS) Did he pray for relief? Of course. Three times he asked the Lord to alleviate his suffering. When God replied, 'My grace is all you need. My power works best in weakness' (2 Corinthians 12:9 NLT), he learned to 'take pleasure in...insults, hardships, persecutions, and troubles' (2 Corinthians 12:10 NLT), leaning on God for strength. Where did he find such joy? Through 'the infinite value of knowing Christ.' (Philippians 3:8 NLT) Intimacy with Christ was his consuming passion. Though conscious of his problems, he stayed consecrated to his Lord. 'For His sake I have discarded everything else, counting it all as garbage, so that I could gain Christ.' (Philippians 3:8 NLT) Paul decided that whatever the cost, graduation with highest honours was worth it. 'To share [Christ's] glory, we must also share His suffering. Yet what we suffer now is nothing compared to the glory He will reveal to us later' on that 'future day...God will reveal who His children really are.' (Romans 8:17-19 NLT) Live today with that picture foremost in your mind.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I press on to...receive the heavenly prize....' Philippians 3:14 NLT<br /><br /><p><i>B</i><i>y living a focused life</i>. Great achievers stay focused on their goal. They are so single-minded that they are often considered fanatics. They filter out the extraneous and hone in on their target like a laser, while all around them others live lives cluttered with much-talked - about projects that never get off the ground. Paul's calling was his life's obsession. 'I focus on this one thing: Forgetting the past and looking forward to what lies ahead, I press on to reach the end of the race and receive the heavenly prize for which God...is calling.' (Philippians 3:13-14 NLT) It preoccupied him so much that all other interests paled into insignificance. He permitted nothing and no one to sidetrack him from winning. He wrote: 'Fight the good fight of the faith.' (1 Timothy 6:12 NIV) He knew it wasn't enough to be strong in faith, you must also be strong in the 'fight'. Sometimes fear, criticism and past failure dictate our direction and we drift aimlessly through our days. The future encroaches on us, looking more like the past. We 'oil the wheels that squeak the loudest', hoping for life to favour us. But it doesn't work! Graduation with highest honours: (1) <i>Takes focus</i>. And focus doesn't just happen, you must direct it. (2) <i>Takes single focus.</i> 'I focus on this one thing.' (3) <i>Takes forgetting past failures. </i>(4) <i>Takes intense anticipation of future success</i>; 'Looking forward to what lies ahead.' (5) <i>Takes a full-on defence.</i> 'I press on to reach the end of the race.' Take these steps, and you too will graduate with highest honours.</p>

<alias><![CDATA[hindrances-to-prayer-1]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...So that nothing will hinder your prayers.' 1 Peter 3:7 NIV<br /><br /><p>Here are two hindrances to answered prayer: (1) <i>Unconfessed sin.</i> 'Your sins have hidden His face from you, so that He will not hear.' (Isaiah 59:2 NIV) As a believer, God expects you to walk in obedience. 'What does the Lord require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.' (Micah 6:8 NIV) Notice, these are 'requirements'. If you don't meet them you're wasting your time praying, unless it's a prayer of repentance. You must seek God's forgiveness, and then He will hear your prayers. (2) <i>Unresolved conflict.</i> 'Husbands...be considerate as you live with your wives, and treat them with respect...so that nothing will hinder your prayers.' There's no point praying if you are always fighting with one another. 'Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates his brother is still in the darkness.' (1 John 2:9 NIV) God will answer when you come out into the light, deal with the thing that drove you apart, and attempt to mend the relationship. Now, sometimes it isn't possible to make amends. 'If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone.' (Romans 12:18 NIV) Sometimes the other person would rather keep the issue alive than accept your apology. When that happens, look into your heart. Do you really want restoration, or would you rather place blame and let things fester? If your attempts have been wholehearted and honest, God won't let a broken relationship stand in the way of your prayers. But if your attempts have been half-hearted and self-serving, try again - this time for real.</p>

<title><![CDATA[Keep Your Vision Alive!]]></title>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...We grope...feeling our way like men without eyes...' Isaiah 59:10 NIV<br /><br /><p>The Pilgrims who founded America landed at Plymouth Rock full of vision. The first year they established a town, the next year they elected a town council. In their third year the town council proposed building a road eight kilometres out into the wilderness for westward expansion. But the townspeople criticised it as a waste of public funds. Amazing! Once they had been able to see across oceans to new worlds, now they couldn't see a few kilometres down the road. What happened? They failed to keep their vision alive. How can you keep that from happening to you? </p>
<p>(1) <i>Keep your vision before you at all times.</i> 'Write the vision and make it plain...that he may run who reads it.' (Habakkuk 2:2 NKJV) Your vision is the road map for your life. So write it down, read it regularly and keep it before you at all times. (2) <i>Make sure the vision is yours, not somebody else's</i>. In the name of being 'sensible' or 'practical', many of us ignore our God-given desires. We undertake a career to please our parents, our spouses or others. That may make you dutiful, but it won't make you successful. You cannot fulfill a vision that is not your own! (3) <i>Believe in yourself even when others don't</i>. You may succeed if nobody else believes in you, but you will never succeed if you don't believe in yourself. No matter how old you are, always stay young at heart. Pearl S. Buck said, 'The young do not know enough to be prudent, therefore they attempt the impossible, and achieve it generation after generation.' </p>

<alias><![CDATA[deal-with-the-rooster]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['There is...no condemnation...' Romans 8:1 NKJV <br /><br /><p>Booker T. Washington tells a wonderful story about his mother. Every morning of his young life, he, along with all the plantation slaves, was awakened by the crow of a rooster. Long before daybreak the unwelcome noise would fill the shanties, reminding Washington and his fellow workers to crawl out of bed and leave for the cotton fields. That rooster's crow came to symbolise a life of long days and backbreaking labour. But then came the Emancipation Proclamation. Abraham Lincoln pronounced freedom for all slaves. The first morning after, young Booker was awakened by the rooster again. Only this time his mother was chasing it around the barnyard with an axe. That day the Washington family fried and ate their alarm clock for lunch. Their first act of freedom was to silence the reminder of their slavery. Are any roosters stealing your sleep? You might need to sharpen the blade. The great news of the Gospel is, yes, His grace is real, and so is your freedom! 'There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.' Forget your sins for God's sake, because when you keep bringing them up you bother Him! Does that sound too strong for you? Then read what God says about your sins: 'I, even I, am He who blots out your transgressions for My own sake; and I will not remember your sins.' (Isaiah 43:25 NKJV) God has buried your sins in the 'depths of the sea' (Micah 7:19 NIV) and posted a sign beside it which reads, 'No fishing in these waters.' </p>

<title><![CDATA[The Blame Game (1)]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[the-blame-game-1]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[ '...I am innocent...It is your responsibility!' Matthew 27:24 NIV<br /><br /><p>More and more, we are becoming a blame-oriented culture. Today our misfortunes are deemed to be somebody else's fault. 'I'm this way because of them. They did it to me.' And it didn't begin with us. It goes all the way back to Adam in the Garden of Eden when he told God, 'The woman...You gave...me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate' (Genesis 3:12 NKJV). It's in our DNA! We say the breakdown in our marriage was our partner's fault, or we drink too much because somebody drives us to it, or we're unwell because of the fast-food industry. Let's sue them! Shifting responsibility may alleviate momentary guilt, but it's a deadly game with no winners. In sentencing Christ to die, Pilate said, 'I am innocent of this man's blood...It is your responsibility!' He thought by dumping the blame onto the Jews he would avoid upsetting either his wife or his critics, and prove himself innocent. But the buck stopped at his desk! Understand this: God holds you responsible for your decisions and actions 'God...will judge all people according to what they have done.' (Romans 2:6 NLT) And your failure to make the right decision, or take the right action, also earns you His guilty verdict. Paul writes, 'You cannot mock the justice of God. You will always harvest what you plant.' (Galatians 6:7 NLT) Others may be guilty of offending you, and that's their harvest to reap. But your harvest depends on your reactions. Accepting responsibility before God is how you alleviate your guilt, discouragement and stress.</p>

<title><![CDATA[The Blame Game (2)]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[the-blame-game-2]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['The woman you put here...gave me some...and I ate it.' Genesis 3:12 NIV <br /><br /><p>Blaming came naturally to Adam and Eve, the father and mother of the human race. After all, who could fault them? God did! Their blame was a result of how sin had changed them. Their relationship to themselves, each other, their environment, and even God, was radically changed by their irresponsibility. And since God can do nothing with people who won't take responsibility for their decisions, He dismissed them from Paradise. What a price to pay! </p>
<p>Here are two good reasons for giving up the blame game: (1)<i> It makes you a victim</i>. When you make someone else responsible for your circumstances, you put the power to change things in their hands. That means nothing will change unless they decide to change it. You make them master of your fate. Only by accepting personal responsibility can you retain the power to change your circumstances. (2)<i> It makes you miserable.</i> You say, 'But they hurt me.' Yes, and by harbouring resentment you are hurting yourself over and over. The Bible says, 'See to it...that no bitter root grows up to cause trouble and defile many.' (Hebrews 12:15 NIV) Before you know it, your entire outlook gets distorted. 'See that no one...is godless like Esau, who for a single meal sold his inheritance rights... Afterward...when he wanted to inherit this blessing, he...could bring about no change of mind, though he sought the blessing with tears.' (Hebrews 12:16-17 NIV) Forgive, take back your life, and get out of the blame game!</p>

<alias><![CDATA[the-blame-game-3]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...if you refuse to forgive others, your Father will not forgive your sins.' Matthew 6:15 NLT<br /><br /><p>Blaming creates enemies. The person you are blaming will ignore you, compile numerous proofs of their innocence, and resent you. And their friends will defend them and become your enemies. Even your own friends will get fed up with your complaining and distance you. Your 'root of bitterness' will spread, causing 'many [to be] defiled,' and making things worse (Hebrews 12:15 NKJV). Blaming rubs off. Blamers beget blamers. Your family gets drawn in, so they suffer too. 'Keep away from angry...people, or you will learn to be like them and endanger your soul.' (Proverbs 22:24-25 NLT) Stop it - you're passing on your misery and dysfunction to those who love you! Blaming is addictive. The justification we feel in blaming hooks us for the long run. It manipulates our anger, making us feel ok about shifting responsibility. It gets progressively easier to complain rather than to resolve the problem. Like any addiction, it has to be fed more and more to achieve its reward. Sooner than you think, you've become a skilled, confirmed 'blame-aholic.' Blaming sabotages forgiveness. You can't forgive someone while you're judging and resenting them. And while you're squandering your time and energy blaming them, you forfeit your right to receive God's forgiveness. 'But if you do not forgive men their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.' (Matthew 6:15 NIV) It's time to give up the blame game, own responsibility for your life, and take back your God-given power to respond to things according to His Word!</p>

The story's told of a couple who decided to buy a new playpen for a friend, on the arrival of her sixth child. A year later the friend wrote back saying, 'Thank you for the pen. It's wonderful - I sit in it every afternoon and read, and the children can't get near me.' Seriously, what do you really know about your child? Their struggles, their heroes, their music, their friends, their fears, their dreams? If your answer is 'not much,' start making changes right away! (2) <i>Listen to them</i>. If some of us paid as much attention to our garden as we did to our children, we'd be living in a weed patch. You'll never understand your child until you take time to listen to what they're saying - and what they're not saying. (3) <i>Believe in them</i>. As a child, the great Caruso was told by a music teacher that he had no talent at all. Parent, make sure your voice is the loudest. Build their confidence; give them the faith and self-worth required to overcome the obstacles they'll face in life. (4) <i>Let them see God in you.</i> Three kids were discussing their fathers. One said, 'My father knows the mayor.' Another said, 'My father knows the governor.' Confidently the third said, 'That's nothing; my father knows God!' Dad, Mum, do you know God? If you don't, commit your life to Him today.</p>

<title><![CDATA[How to Raise a Timothy]]></title>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Your sincere faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice...' 2 Timothy 1:5 NIV<br /><br /><p>Leaving your mark on your children isn't voluntary, but leaving a godly mark on them is. The seeds you sow today will continue to grow in them lifelong and in your grandchildren too. Paul saw in Timothy the potential harvest he'd produce for Christ. He saw, too, that the fruit originated with the root: a mother and grandmother who were sold out to Christ. What an encouragement for widowed, divorced, single mothers and those without believing husbands. These two women raised a servant of God without the help of a Christian father. And Mother, God can enable you to do likewise! </p>
<p> What does it take to raise a Timothy? Two things: (1)<i> It takes a role model.</i> Paul spoke of Timothy's 'sincere (Greek: un-hypocritical) faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice and...now lives in you.' The faith they imparted 'first lived in' each of them. If it's to live in our kids, they must first see it living in us. In a world where fakes sometimes masquerade as Christians, genuine faith stands out like a beacon against the night sky. Our children have a built-in 'detector' that picks up on counterfeits and rejects them. But the genuine article will draw them like a magnet. (2)<i> It takes teaching God's Word</i>. Timothy's mother and grandmother planted the Scriptures in the receptive soil of his young heart before the surrounding culture could get to him. Paul reminded him 'how from infancy you have known the holy Scriptures.' (2 Timothy 3:15 NIV) That's how to raise a Timothy.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...I sat where they sat...' Ezekiel 3:15 NKJV<br /><br /><p>In an attempt to insulate ourselves against the evils in the world, we can isolate ourselves from those God's called us to reach out to. At the beginning of Ezekiel's ministry he wrote, 'The hand of the Lord was strong upon me. Then I came to the captives...and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.' (Ezekiel 3:14-15 NKJV) True ministry begins with sitting in the other person's seat. Former President Jimmy Carter was a Sunday school teacher in his church. Recalling it in an interview, he said: 'Most church members - including me - rarely reach outside to people who are different from us or less fortunate. Quite often my Sunday school class will say, &quot;Why don't we take up a collection and give a nice Thanksgiving meal to a poor family?&quot; The next question is: &quot;Who knows a poor family?&quot; Nobody does! We have to call the Welfare Office to get the name and address.' So, do you know any needy people? Compassion is putting yourself in the other person's place. It's asking God to help you understand what's really going on with them. It's hearing what they're not saying as well as what they are. It's understanding that sometimes their anger is only masking their fear, that they're crying out for help in the only way they know how. Before Peter denied the Lord, Jesus said to him, 'When you have returned to Me, strengthen your brethren.' (Luke 22:32 NKJV) When God's grace touches your life you will always reach back for others! And here's why: people don't care how much you know until they know how much you care.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Stop being bitter and angry and mad at others...' Ephesians 4:31 CEV<br /><br /><p>A man who had been bitten by a rattlesnake was rushed to the hospital. When he asked the doctor, 'Is it life-threatening?' the doctor said, 'The bite isn't, but the poison is.' The 'bites' you suffer at the hands of others are painful and upsetting, but they're not lethal. What happens to you normally doesn't destroy you, but what happens in you afterwards can. Like venom, bitterness first poisons your mind, then your relationships. It causes you to replay the hurt until it controls you, stealing the future God planned for you. But it doesn't have to be that way. You can overcome bitterness. God says, 'Stop being bitter and angry and mad at others.' And what God commands, He will give you the grace to do. When Peter asked Jesus, 'Should I forgive my brother seven times?' Jesus said, 'No, you must forgive him seventy times seven.' (Matthew 18:21-22) In other words, 'Forgive, and keep on forgiving until it no longer bothers you.' What causes bitterness? Anger that's allowed to take residence in your thought-life. God's purpose for anger is to motivate you to tap into His power for solving problems; otherwise they become permanent. Solving the problem resolves and relieves your anger. But anger can become long-term bitterness when you fixate on 'who did it to me', making you hostile, critical, blaming and punitive. You say, 'Can I really stop my anger?' Yes, with God's help you can control your reactions and behaviours, and starve your anger to death. 'The fruit of the Spirit is...self-control.' (Galatians 5:22-23 NIV)</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Run in such a way as to get the prize.' 1 Corinthians 9:24 NIV<br /><br /><p>We say things like, 'It's a rat race out there, and the rats are winning,' 'Nice guys finish last,' 'Winning isn't everything - it's the only thing!' Such sentiments characterise our culture, driving workaholic lifestyles that destroy health, fracture family life, and eliminate the spiritual discipline required to have a growing relationship with God. So what should we do? Avoid all competition? Opt out of the race? Retire and watch the world go by? No, those are not options for a follower of Christ. So: (1) Beware of competitiveness that leads to jealousy. Cain's competitiveness toward his brother Abel led him to murder (Genesis 4:1-8). He tried to put his brother down in order to lift himself up. King Saul tried to kill David when the crowd sang, 'Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.' (1 Samuel 18:6-11 NKJV) Those words caused jealousy to grow like a cancer in him. (2) Understand that by seeking to excel in your calling, you exalt Christ. Paul writes: 'in a race...only one gets the prize... Run in such a way as to get the prize. Everyone who competes [does] it to get a crown that will not last; but we do it to get a crown that will last forever.' (1 Corinthians 9:24-25 NIV) No second-rate effort, no settling for mediocre outcomes. 'I'm running hard for the finish line. I'm giving it everything I've got. No sloppy living for me. I'm staying alert and in top condition.' Getting ahead of others isn't what it's about; it's about maximising all you do for God's glory! 'Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for men.' (Colossians 3:23 NIV)</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...The Lord is my helper, I will not be afraid...' Hebrews 13:6 NIV <br /><br /><p>Worry is a squatter; you must evict it. In certain situations if a house lies empty long enough, anyone can move in and occupy it. Worry does that too. It roams around looking for an empty mind, and then moves in. Has worry taken up residence in your mind today? Is it there when you wake in the morning and go to bed at night? As a follower of Christ you have the authority to serve worry an eviction notice and it must leave. The only thing that enables it to stay is your ignorance of that truth. When your mind is occupied with God's Word, worry sees a 'no vacancy' sign and moves on. Paul writes: 'For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh. For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds, casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ.' (2 Corinthians 10:3-5 NKJV) The weapons God has given you to fight with are greater than the fears you face. But you must know your weapons, keep them in good repair, and be able to use them. 'Therefore thus says the Lord God of hosts: &quot;Because you speak this word, behold, I will make My words in your mouth fire, and [your worries] wood, and it shall devour them.&quot;' (Jeremiah 5:14 NKJV) When you believe God's Word with all your heart and begin to speak it in the face of your worries, 'It shall devour them.'</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['If you know these things...do them.' John 13:17 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says, 'Faith without works is dead.' (James 2:20 NKJV) Certain prayers only get answered when you take action. When the woman with the issue of blood took the initiative, pressed through the crowd and touched the hem of Jesus' garment, He told her, 'Take heart...your faith has healed you.' (Matthew 9:22 NIV) And on another occasion we read, 'As He entered a certain village, there met Him ten...lepers...they lifted up their voices and said, &quot;Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!&quot; So...He said to them, &quot;Go, show yourselves to the priests...&quot;' (Luke 17:12-14 NKJV) According to Jewish law, an unclean person discovered in the vicinity of the temple could be stoned to death. So by following Jesus' instructions these people were literally putting their lives on the line. But they did it, and 'as they went they were cleansed.' (Luke 17:14 NKJV) Jesus said, 'If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.' Your decisions and actions are based on what you believe. Keith Butler writes: 'Anybody can believe...sitting in church, or when all is right in their life. But when you get outside, you find out what you've really got... Healing power was obviously available, and these men believed Jesus could heal them. That's why they came to him in the first place. They didn't doubt His ability...The key was, as soon as they did what Jesus told them they were healed.' So the word for you today is: <i>Put your faith into action</i>.</p>

'Sure,' he responded. 'What do you do about it?' the parishioner said. 'I get up again. Being down isn't my problem - staying down is. I'm either up, or I'm getting up. I've learned not to park in between.' Although feeling down is universal, sociologists warn us to guard against its two most common causes: <i>fear</i> and <i>fatigue</i>. Let's look at them:</p>
<p><i>Fear</i>: When Edomite armies marched against Israel's king, fear gripped him and his nation. Feeling powerless, they feared losing their God-given land and possessions. If the stress of the last few years has left you feeling fearful, do what Judah's king did. He turned to God and prayed: 'Whenever we are faced with any calamity...we can...stand in Your presence...We can cry out to You...and You will hear us and rescue us.' (2 Chronicles 20:9 NLT) Don't let fear cause you to abandon your hope and your vision. Instead, stand in God's presence, cry out to Him, and watch Him rescue you. Throughout the Old Testament, God reminded His people of His track record of goodness. He wanted them to remember it and take courage. But sometimes fear would cloud their memory and they'd begin to doubt. Sound familiar? So He told them, 'Do not be...discouraged...the battle is not yours, but [Mine].' (2 Chronicles 20:15 NIV) In other words, 'You don't have to defeat the foe, that's My job. I'm in charge; trust Me to work it out.' So remember Who's in control of your circumstances today. Stand in His presence, believe His promise!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let us not grow weary while doing good...' Galatians 6:9 NKJV <br /><br /><p><i>F</i><i>atigue</i>: Remember the old saying, 'You can't burn the candle at both ends'? Today we've gone from candle power to electric power, and few of us pay heed to that old saying anymore. We want bigger homes, fancier cars and more exotic holidays etc. So we start earlier, work harder and finish later. Then we stagger home and fall asleep in front of the television, worn out and feeling guilty about spending so little time with our family. We forget that God designed us to need one work - free day a week for rest and spiritual renewal (Exodus 20:8-11). As a result, fatigue saps our creative energy, distorts our outlook, diminishes our joy, erodes our confidence and drains us spiritually. Elijah is a great example of this. Single-handedly he defeated the prophets of Baal (1 Kings 18:17-46). In answer to his prayer God sent fire from Heaven that consumed the altar and turned Israel back to God. It was a spectacular victory, yet on the heels of it he got so down that he actually asked God to take his life. Now that's reaching an all-time low! So what did God do? Like any good doctor, He diagnosed the man's problem and prescribed three things: proper diet, adequate rest, and a good assistant - Elisha. Many of us, who love what we do for a living, can have a tendency to get out of balance. We have no boundaries so we risk burning out. We 'grow weary while doing good.' What's the answer? 'He restores my soul.' (Psalm 23:3 NKJV) The word 'restores' has two parts: 'rest' and 'store'. Relax physically, and replenish spiritually. That's what to do when you feel down!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Why should we sit here waiting to die?' 2 Kings 7:3 NLT<br /><br /><p>Unless you're willing to take risks you won't succeed in life. Yes, there's a time for playing it safe. But when caution becomes a lifestyle, you get bogged down in mediocrity and failure while life passes you by. When you finish praying, searching the Scriptures and listening to godly counsel - you've got to step out in faith. </p>
<p>Four lepers sat outside the besieged famine-stricken city of Samaria. They considered their situation. 'We're starving to death. There's food in the enemy camp. Enemy soldiers are swarming over it. We can play it safe, sit here and die. Or go into the camp and see whether they feed us or kill us!' They knew their worst option was playing it safe and doing nothing. So what happened? They were saved by taking a step of faith. Now, your risks may be less dramatic. But unless you take them, you'll never fulfill your God-given assignment in life. The Bible says, 'Whoever digs a pit may fall into it; whoever breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake. Whoever quarries stones may be injured by them; whoever splits logs may be endangered by them.' (Ecclesiastes 10:8-9 NIV) By trying to avoid falls, bites, injuries, danger etc., you miss out on life's opportunities. Walking by faith means: (1) <i>Accepting worthwhile risks.</i> You've got to go out on a limb, for that's where the fruit is. (2) <i>Preparing wisely for your risks.</i> God rewards excellence. 'Using a dull axe requires great strength, so sharpen the blade...That's the value of wisdom; it helps you succeed.' (Ecclesiastes 10:10 NLT) So go ahead, step out in faith!</p>

<title><![CDATA[The Answer to Your Worries]]></title>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Death and life are in the power of the tongue...' Proverbs 18:21 NK<br /><br /><p>Your words either work for you or against you. The Bible says, 'Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it will eat its fruit.' The old saying, 'You'll eat your words,' is not a meaningless cliché, it's the truth! Jeremiah the prophet writes, 'Your words were found, and I ate them, and Your word was to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart...' (Jeremiah 15:16 NKJV) The Psalmist writes, 'They cried out to the Lord in their trouble, and He saved them out of their distresses (worries). He sent His word and healed them...' (Psalm 107:19-20 NKJV) God's Word is the medicine that heals worry. So what God has to say about the issue must be what you have to say about it too, otherwise you're contradicting Him and disconnecting yourself from the source of all blessing. If you're wise, you will surround yourself with like-minded people who speak God's Word into your life, and limit your time with those who have no interest in it. If you want to grow the right kind of fruit, you must have the right climate. And the words you speak (and listen to) determine the climate of your life, the direction in which it goes, and the results you get. There is no 'secret' to success. The Bible says that when you learn to 'meditate day and night' in God's Word, you will 'prosper in all you do.' (Psalm 1:2-3 NIV) So the answer to your worries is in God's Word!</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Discipline your children, and they will give you rest; they will give delight to your heart.' Proverbs 29:17 NRS<br /><br /><p>We're producing a generation of kids who are allowed to rear themselves with the aid of television, violent DVDs, and the internet (which can be a minefield!) Often both parents work, leaving one child to supervise another. As a result they become a law unto themselves. 'A child left to himself disgraces his [parents].' (Proverbs 29:15 NIV) Most of us are loving parents, but our children need discipline and rules to live by. Love has a backbone, it's called law and order. Without it, love is just license. '...if you love your children, you will be prompt to discipline them...' (Proverbs 13:24 NLT) Remember the cute <i>Dennis the Menace</i> cartoon where Dad, strap in hand, makes disobedient Dennis 'assume the position'? He says, 'This is going to hurt me more than you.' Dennis responds, 'Don't feel obligated to hurt yourself on my behalf.' Enforcing law and order isn't easy. But the alternative is a betrayal of our children and our God-given responsibility! Failure to enforce law and order to gain short-term popularity with our kids always ends up costing us their long-term respect. Expecting younger kids to work out for themselves what's right and wrong is a burden they shouldn't have to bear; their neurological and moral equipment isn't sufficiently developed yet for such responsibility. The Bible says, 'A youngster's heart is filled with foolishness, but discipline will drive it away.' (Proverbs 22:15 NLT) Your children learn to make good decisions from the rewards and consequences of dealing with law and order at home. So don't fail them!</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...if you love your children, you will be prompt to discipline them.' Proverbs 13:24 NLT<br /><br /><p>Children who are a joy to live with don't get that way by living in a lawless home. Ever see the film <i>Bonnie and Clyde</i>? The big story behind Bonnie is the mother who raised her. She thought everything Bonnie did was 'cute'. She actually eulogised her: 'As the flowers are all made sweeter by the sunshine and the dew; so this old world is made brighter by the lives of folks like you!' But Bonnie wasn't so cute when she went on a murderous rampage. Giving your child structure makes them feel cared for and secure. So here are two guidelines: (1)<i> Explain the rules clearly.</i><i> </i>Punishing a child over a rule they don't understand just makes them resentful. The fewer your rules the better - just make them understandable, doable, and observable. 'Preaching' and moralising only creates resistance. (2)<i> Enforce the rules consistently.</i><i> </i>What brings a smile today shouldn't bring a slap tomorrow. Inconsistency weakens your authority and breeds disobedience in them. Here are some things to shun: (a) <i>Avoid comparisons. </i>No child should be expected to be just like another. (b) <i>Avoid hurtful labels</i> such as 'You're stupid, lazy, bad, a waste of time,' etc. Describe their actions; don't demolish their self-worth. (c)<i> Avoid idle threats. </i>Enforce the rule, or drop it. (d) <i>Avoid bribes;</i> they just breed manipulation and diminish the importance of rules. (e) <i>Avoid making fun of their weaknesses</i>. (f) <i>Don't fear saying 'No!'</i> Their future success and happiness depend on learning to deal with it. (g) <i>Admit your failures</i>. However, although you 'blow it' occasionally, you're still responsible to require they follow your laws, not your lapses! </p>

<alias><![CDATA[persist-in-prayer]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['This, then, is how you should pray...' Matthew 6:9 NIV<br /><br /><p>If prayer came naturally, God wouldn't have to remind us so often to do it. A consistent prayer life requires crucifying our selfish nature. But when prayer doesn't seem rewarding, we're apt to abandon it. So how can you pray and get results? (1) <i>Before you ask, adore!</i> Any prayer that begins with asking can become self-centred and shallow. 'Enter His gates with thanksgiving and His courts with praise; give thanks to Him and praise His name.' (Psalm 100:4 NIV) When God's love, goodness and faithfulness are your starting point, you're lifted out of yourself, your spirit is prepared for 'connecting' with God, the content of your prayer becomes more Scriptural, and you get results. In the Lord's Prayer, Jesus directs our attention first to God's name, then His Kingdom and then His will. After that, we ask for 'our daily bread'. Thanksgiving doesn't condition God to bless you - it conditions you to receive His blessing. (2) <i>When you pray, persist!</i> God's not an automated teller. You are supposed to stay engaged with Him until He decides to answer you. This involves an attitude of faith, persistence and patience. Jesus gave us a parable about a woman who kept pleading with a hardhearted judge to grant her petition. When she finally wore him down, he gave her what she asked. Jesus had only one purpose for the parable: 'To show them that they should always pray and not give up.' (Luke 18:1 NIV) The point is not that persistence forces God's cooperation, it's that God wants you to pray and not quit. When you persist God will answer, 'and quickly!' (Luke 18:8 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['[Like] a child without wisdom; when the time arrives, he [or she] does not come to the opening of the womb.' Hosea 13:13 NIV<br /><br /><p>Timing is an integral part of God's plan for your life. You need to know what to do, and when to do it. If you wait too long you'll miss your window of God-given opportunity. One author points out that as believers we experience two births: a natural and a spiritual birth. She writes: 'For some...spiritual birth happens in childhood. Others, like me, have to work to get there with a combination of effort and...the stripping down of layers of independence. Regardless of how we get to the spiritual labour/delivery room, at our appointed time - unlike a natural birth...we must be willing to be reborn. We can't remain in darkness and isolation. &quot;When the time arrives [to] come to the opening of the womb&quot; and be pushed into the world as a new creation, you must be willing to emerge. We all know people who attend every seminar and read every self-help book. They're always getting ready to emerge, but never quite make it. You may even be one of them. Perhaps God has given you a vision but you've hidden it away for so long waiting for the right time, it has become stale. Visions have a shelf life. They are for &quot;an appointed [fixed, chosen, prearranged] time.&quot;' (Habakkuk 2:3 NIV) Maurice Chevalier said, 'If you wait for the perfect moment when all is safe and assured, it will never arrive. Mountains will not be climbed, races won, or lasting happiness achieved.' Bottom line: you can sit on the bench, or get involved in the game. Which will it be?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['But God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us...' 2 Corinthians 7:6 NIV<br /><br /><p>You say, 'Surely Paul was too spiritually mature to feel downcast?' Apparently not! The chief apostle and leader of the church experienced discouragement, stress, restlessness and even fears. 'When we arrived in Macedonia there was no rest for us. Outside there was conflict from every direction, and inside there was fear. But God, who encourages those who are discouraged, encouraged us by the arrival of Titus...' (2 Corinthians 7:5-6 NLT) So, where do we turn for strength in our times of trouble? Consider some ways God sends us comfort and encouragement: (1) <i>He comforts us by His presence.</i> 'Now may...God our Father, who loved us and by His grace gave us eternal comfort and a wonderful hope, comfort you and strengthen you in every good thing.' (2 Thessalonians 2:16-17 NLT) It's God's nature to be with us, to give us comfort when we're mourning (Matthew 5:4), brokenhearted (Psalm 147:3), overwhelmed (Psalm 145:14), worried (Isaiah 41:10) or unwell (Psalm 41:3). But we must acknowledge His presence and accept His comfort! (2) <i>He comforts us by His Word.</i><i> </i>'Remember Your promise to me; it is my only hope. Your promise revives me; it comforts me in all my troubles.' (Psalms 119:49-50 NLT) (3)<i> He comforts us through our prayers.</i> '...As soon as I pray, You answer me; You encourage me by giving me strength.' (Psalm 138:3 NLT) (4) <i>He comforts us through godly friends.</i> Paul writes: 'God...comforted us by the coming of Titus.' Today, look for those who bring comfort, and practise comforting others.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...So take courage! For I believe God. It will be just as He said...' Acts 27:25 NLT<br /><br /><p>Robert Schuller was on a cruise ship off Queensland when the captain announced they were about to navigate a very narrow and dangerous crevice. They needed at least ten metres of water to get through and avoid running aground. Just then a small motorboat approached with a captain from Australia. As he boarded the big ship, the crew saluted and stepped aside to let him take the helm. This man specialised in maneuvering big ships through small spaces, and because of his expertise they made it through without a problem. There's an important lesson here. Before you get caught in life's storms, make sure Jesus is at the helm, and that you know who your traveling companions are. In the midst of a gale that threatened to sink their ship, Paul stood up and announced, 'Take courage! For I believe God. It will be just as He said.' Paul had confidence because he knew who the real Captain was that day. He never doubted for a moment that God would honour His promise to save him, and everyone on board. When you go through storms that shake your faith you need people who know what the Word of God says, people who believe that God will 'do exactly' what He said no matter how bad the circumstances look. Such friends are few and far between, and they're precious. If you have one or two of them in your life today you're blessed, so thank God for them.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['The boat was now in the middle of the sea, tossed by the waves...' Matthew 14:24 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Talk about a person caught in a storm! Jeremiah could tell you the height of the waves and the speed of the wind. He realised how fast he was sinking, so he shifted his gaze. 'But this I call to mind, and therefore I have hope: The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases, His mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness. &quot;The Lord is my portion,&quot; says my soul, &quot;therefore I will hope in Him.&quot;' (Lamentations 3:21-24 NRS) When Jeremiah turned his eyes away from the waves to look to God, he started to recite a quintet of promises: (1) 'The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases.' (2) 'His mercies never come to an end.' (3) 'They are new every morning.' (4) 'Great is Your faithfulness.' (5) 'The Lord is my portion.' The storm didn't cease, but Jeremiah's discouragement did. Paul talks about 'speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord.' (Ephesians 5:19 NKJV) Great hymns are a great help. They help you to get your eyes on the One who walks on the water and calms the storm. 'Great is Thy faithfulness O God my father, there is no shadow of turning with Thee. Thou changest not, Thy compassions they fail not, as Thou hast been, Thou forever shalt be. Great is Thy faithfulness, great is Thy faithfulness, morning by morning new mercies I see. All Thou hast promised Thy hand hath provided, Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me.' </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['There is in store for me the crown...' 2 Timothy 4:8 NIV<br /><br /><p>Do you remember the feeling you had when your name was called to receive your college diploma or university degree and you heard the words, 'Congratulations on your graduation.' You did it! All your effort paid off. Your accomplishment had finally been acknowledged. Now, multiply that feeling a thousand times over! Picture yourself entering the presence of the One who will award you the crown of righteousness while the saints of all the ages look on. Paul anticipated graduating with highest honours: 'I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. Now there is in store for me the crown...' (2 Timothy 4:7-8 NIV) For the next few days, let's talk about how you can graduate this life with highest honours. </p>
<p><i>By living an unselfish life</i>. There's no greater obstacle to the life that God designed you to live, than selfishness. Ego and self-promotion pollute our souls and destroy our relationships. Paul understood the need to dethrone ego. 'I no longer live, but Christ lives in me.' (Galatians 2:20 NIV) This reflected: (a) <i>A change of values. </i>Paul once lived to persecute Christians; now he says, 'For to me to live is Christ...' (Philippians 1:21 NIV) (b) <i>A change of ambition.</i> The old Paul, whose goal was to be a recognised champion of religion, says, 'But whatever was to my profit I now consider loss for the sake of Christ.' (Philippians 3:7 NIV) (c) <i>A change of mind. </i>The brilliant philosopher, Pharisee and lawyer renounces his self-seeking ways and writes, 'Think the same way that Christ Jesus thought.' (Philippians 2:5 CEV) </p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...The prudent [wise] considers well his steps.' Proverbs 14:15 NKJV<br /><br /><p>After you've prayed, planned and prepared, there comes a point where you've got to take the plunge. Is it scary? Absolutely! There are two kinds of people: Those who leap before they look; they are driven by impulse. Then there are those who look, and look, and look but never leap; they are controlled by fear. Which are you? To get to the Promised Land, Israel had to cross the River Jordan at flood tide. It must have made the strongest heart skip a beat. God had promised that when the feet of the priests carrying the ark stepped into the water it would roll back. Can you imagine their thoughts? 'Couldn't we wait till the tide goes down? Why do I have to go first? What if the waters don't roll back and I drown?' The step between prudence and paranoia is short and steep. Prudence wears a seatbelt; paranoia avoids cars altogether. Prudence washes with soap; paranoia avoids human contact altogether. Prudence saves for old age; paranoia clings to every penny. Prudence prepares and plans; paranoia panics. Prudence calculates the risk and takes the plunge; paranoia never enters the water. To reach your God-ordained destiny you must stop holding back, obey God and step into the water. The moment you do, doors will begin to open and resources will be released, where there now seems to be only shortage. God will provide the means, the method, and the manpower. So stand on His promise: '...I have loved you; therefore I will give men for you, and people for your life. Fear not, for I am with you...' (Isaiah 43:4-5 NKJV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Underneath are the everlasting arms...' Deuteronomy 33:27 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Picture this: A father and his two small children are playing. He's in the swimming pool, and he invites them to run and jump into his arms. One does, the other doesn't. The one who doesn't, watches gleefully, applauds and jumps up and down. But when her dad invites her to do the same she shakes her head and backs away. Is that you? Living on the edge of the pool, never taking the plunge, happy to experience life vicariously through others? Preferring to take no risk, rather than any risk? For fear of the worst, you never enjoy the best. You say, 'But I'm not sure what I'm jumping into!' Read this: 'Underneath are the everlasting arms.' Foolishness is closing your eyes and jumping before you know there's even water in the pool, or that your father has said, 'Come, I'll catch you.' Faith is knowing that the only way to conquer your fear of the water is to take the leap, because the One who is calling you has been there for you from the moment you became His child. Nothing is more important to Him than your safety, the development of your faith, and your total success in life. God told Joshua, '...arise, go over this Jordan...to the land which I am giving [you] ...Only be strong and very courageous, that you may observe to do according to all the law which Moses My servant commanded you; do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may prosper wherever you go.' (Joshua 1:2;7 NKJV) Note the words, 'Arise, go, be strong.' In other words: take the plunge!</p>

A Roman father held absolute right and control, legally entitled 'patria potestas', over his children at any age. Roman adoption was a two-step process that transferred children from one patria potestas to another. (1) <i>Emancipation</i>. This step included a symbolic sale where the natural father twice 'sold' and 'bought back' his child, and a third where he didn't buy them back, ending his paternal rights. (2) <i>Vindication</i>. Here the adoptive father presented his case for adoption to a Roman magistrate, who legally transferred the child to his patria potestas. Likewise, we have been transferred from Satan's grip to our heavenly Father's blessed patria potestas! The benefits of Roman adoption were Paul's chief focus in Romans chapter eight: (a) The adopted person lost all rights in their old family and gained a new father, plus all rights of a legitimate member of their new family. (b) They became heir to their new father's estate. When there were other siblings, they became joint-heirs together. (c) All their debts were completely cancelled, legal records of their history were expunged; the past had no effect on their new life. (d) Seven citizens witnessed all legal adoptions. If the adoptee's legitimacy was ever challenged, each witness could testify to their legitimate standing. Thank God, 'The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children.' (Romans 8:16 NIV) No less than the sevenfold Holy Spirit Himself validates your membership in God's family! </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The poles...are not to be removed.' Exodus 25:15 NIV<br /><br /><p>The Ark of the Covenant represented the presence of God in the midst of His people. When the Philistines captured it, they were smitten with tumours. When they placed it in their temple, their god Dagon fell to the ground (1 Samuel 5). The moral of this story is - don't mess around with the things of God! Even if you are not prepared to serve God; at least be wise and revere Him. </p>
<p>When Israel conquered the Philistines, David decided to bring the Ark, the symbol of God's presence, back home to Jerusalem. Now, when God designed the Ark, He put rings on the side of it, and poles through those rings, saying it must only be carried on the shoulders of special priests. But somebody thought of 'a better way', so they put it on a new cart pulled by an ox. And that's when everything went wrong. When the Ark started to slip off the cart, a well-meaning bystander decided to steady it. And he died for it! You say, 'That's pretty extreme.' There's a lesson here for those who want to package God's presence, market it, and 'take it on the road'. Who is qualified to carry God's presence? Only believer-priests who have been cleansed by the blood of the Lamb, are washed by the Word at the laver, who fellowship with God at His table, who worship Him at the altar of incense, and who walk in the light of truth represented by the seven-branched lampstand. Away with newfangled carts! '...the Lord added to the church...' (Acts 2:47 NKJV) If we are going to carry God's presence and build His church, we've got to do it His way.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...mind your own business...earn your own living...' 1 Thessalonians 4:11 GNT<br /><br /></p>
<p>We're not very good at knowing the difference between helpfulness and interference! Suppose two people we care about are in conflict. We think we can be the Red Cross and salvage things. Ultimately, with our good intentions in ruins, we're in over our heads. Looking back, we say, 'I'll never do that again' - until the next time! Here are some healthy relationship boundaries. Sometimes when two people are at odds with each other they 'triangle in' a third person to focus on, attempting to lower their stress. Whoever they triangle in gets caught in the middle, becomes entangled in their unresolved issue, and ultimately becomes their shock absorber. Unfortunately, when that person's rescue attempt backfires they become part of the problem, keeping the issues and themselves stuck. So what should you do? (1) <em>Unless God puts you in the middle, stay out!</em> The Bible says, '...mind your own business...' (1 Thessalonians 4:11 GNT) If your name's not on it, don't pick it up! Try saying, 'I care about you both too much to complicate things with unqualified advice. I'll pray that God gives you the wisdom to do what's right for each other.' (2) <em>Maintain a caring relationship with both people</em>. Relationship specialist, Edwin Friedman, says, 'The way to bring change to the relationship of two others is to maintain a well-defined relationship with each, and avoid taking responsibility for their relationship.' Don't take sides. Don't let them pull you in. If they try, remind them that you're praying and trusting God to help them resolve the problem, and that you're confident He will do it.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['But his sons did not walk in his ways...' 1 Samuel 8:3 NIV<br /><br /><p>At times every parent despairs over a child's decisions and actions. 'I did my best to bring them up correctly; did I fail as a parent?' Failure is a fact of life - and of parenting - and nobody does it perfectly! Parents assume a heavier load of guilt than they deserve. Consider some Bible examples of real-world parenting: Isaac had, at best, a 50 percent success rate with his sons, Jacob and Esau. Aaron struck out completely with Nadab and Abihu. Manoah's boy Samson didn't win the 'son-of-the-year award'! And Samuel, a recognised moral and spiritual giant, watched his sons reject his example and teaching and pursue lives of bribery and shame. Since Adam, children 'doing their own thing' have broken their parents' hearts! So what is a parent to do? (1) <i>Realise you</i><i>'</i><i>re not responsible for their decisions</i>. They make their own choices. Condemning yourself just discourages you, and it undermines your ability to be the parent they need. The Bible says, '...Salvation is of the Lord.' (Jonah 2:9 NJKV) He saves and delivers - not you. (2) <i>Pray for them and give the</i><i>m to God</i>. Anxiety and frustration will only make you the kind of parent they don't enjoy being around, and who can't enjoy them. You're not built to carry such a load; your heavenly Father is, and He wants to carry it for you! (1 Peter 5:7) (3) <i>Remember th</i><i>at God loves them more than you do!</i> He gave His only child to save yours. He knows their heart, and how to reach it and turn it toward Him. So give your child to Him!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...let the Spirit renew your...attitudes.' Ephesians 4:23 NLT<br /><br /><p>When you sell a house, it feels great to get rid of stuff you've accumulated. You wonder why you lived so long with it weighing you down. It's the same with mental and emotional clutter. Jon Gordon says, 'Why do we fill our life with so many things that weigh us down? Thoughts that hold us back. Habits that limit us. Distractions that derail us. Negative people [who] drain us. Fear that paralyses us... time zappers that sabotage...productivity. We spend so much time...on things that don't matter - we fail to focus on what does matter. We fill up with so many things that generate negative energy, there's no room for positive energy in our lives.' Paul writes, '...throw off your...former way of life...let the Spirit renew your thoughts and attitudes.' (Ephesians 4:22-23 NLT) The clutter you need to lose includes: believing you're alone, trying to please everyone, feeling insecure, putting yourself down, needing everyone to like you, jumping to negative conclusions before you know the facts, thinking you're always right, recalling all the times you messed up, wanting to know how it all turns out, needing to have all the answers, worrying you'll lose the memories if you let go of the memorabilia, agonising you're not rich enough, good enough or clever enough, surrounding yourself with people who recall the bad times and not the good, making energy-sucking comparisons, observing life instead of participating, believing your best days are over, constantly waiting for the right moment, fearing you'll look foolish, focusing on negative type-casting...and anything else you don't want to pass on to your children. How can you get rid of the clutter? '...let the Spirit renew your...attitudes.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I am the Lord your God...who directs you...' Isaiah 48:17 NIV <br /><br /><p>The Ark of the Covenant represented three things to the people of Israel. And these are three things you need in your life. Let's look carefully at each: </p>
<p>(1) <i>Victory</i>. When Israel went into battle they must have looked strange to their enemies because the priests who carried the Ark of the Covenant went ahead of the army. Indeed, when their enemies saw it they may have laughed and said, 'What's that all about? What's the big deal with the box?' But after they had been humbled by defeat they realised they weren't fighting man, but God. And when you are in right standing with God He will go before you and fight your battles. And the great thing is God has never lost a battle. (2) <i>Guidance</i>. When the Israelites needed direction, God spoke to them in the place where the Ark rested in the tabernacle. And they discovered what you will discover: when you seek God's guidance and listen to Him, you won't get it wrong. His guidance system is infallible: '...I am the Lord your God...who directs you in the way you should go.' (Isaiah 48:17 NIV) (3) <i>Prosperity</i>. Prosperity simply means, 'Having enough to do the will of God.' And that's how much God wants you to have, no more and no less. When the Ark rested for three months in the house of a man called Obed-Edom, all that he had was blessed and multiplied (2 Samuel 6:10-12). Could you use more victory, more guidance and more prosperity? Spend time in God's presence, and then carry it with you wherever you go. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...So He is first in everything.' Colossians 1:18 NLT <br /><br /><p>The Ark of the Covenant is mentioned in Scripture about 180 times, so it must be important. Every bit of activity in the outer court and inner court of the tabernacle was for one purpose, to lead you into the Holy of Holies where God's presence was. Old Testament symbols, such as the Ark, are a picture of New Testament realities. In this regard, the Ark, which was the most important piece of furniture in the tabernacle, is a picture of the Christ we love and serve. He is Lord. He is supreme. There's no one like Him. And He alone is worthy of all praise! Paul writes: 'Christ is the visible image of the invisible God. He existed before anything was created and is supreme over all creation, for through Him God created everything in the heavenly realms and on earth. He made the things we can see and the things we can't see - such as thrones, kingdoms, rulers, and authorities in the unseen world. Everything was created through Him and for Him. He existed before everything else, and He holds all creation together. Christ is also the head of the church, which is His body. He is the beginning, supreme over all who rise from the dead. So He is first in everything. For God in all His fullness was pleased to live in Christ, and through Him God reconciled everything to Himself...' (Colossians 1:15-20 NLT) If your faith is 'me-centred', you'll get nowhere with God. But when your faith is 'Christ-centred', then everything Christ has becomes available to you!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...riches do not endure forever, and a crown is not secure for all generations.' Proverbs 27:24 NIV<br /><br /><p>One large insurance company advertises itself as 'the Rock', claiming to be the foundation of our financial security. Remember when we trusted these taglines? Not anymore; it's not the same world. Financial uncertainty characterises today's world of failing banks, crumbling investment giants, shrinking multinational corporations, swelling queues of the under-employed and unemployed, plus an epidemic of fear plaguing the hearts of the currently-employed. For the young, the joy of graduation has become the stress of university debts and a shrinking job market. Many older people are trading in their retirement dreams for a new twenty-first century reality: 'work till you drop'. In such times, where can we turn? To politicians? To government? To the next get-rich-quick guru? The Bible says, '...riches do not endure forever, and a crown [human government] is not secure for all generations.' (Proverbs 27:24 NIV) What's the answer? Turn to the only reliable source of security: God! There's no financial crisis in His Kingdom! Israel hungered and thirsted and He sent them fresh manna, and water from the rock. He assigned ravens to feed Elijah, multiplied oil and flour to sustain a destitute widow's family, fed thousands from a boy's lunch of five loaves and two fish. And He asks us: '...is anything too difficult for Me?' (Jeremiah 32:27 NAS) No! So: (1) Trust God to provide for you. (2) Do what He tells you to do. (3) Believe that God 'will'. 'The lambs will provide you with clothing, and the goats with the price of a field. You will have plenty...to feed you and your family...' (Proverbs 27:26-27 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant.' Mark10:43 NIV<br /><br /><p>Disneyland is referred to as 'the Magic Kingdom'. For those who work there, one value is emphasised above all others. It's what puts the 'magic' into that kingdom. What is it? Servanthood! Employees are told that when you walk through those gates, you serve. You treat every encounter with people as if they were your personal guest. If they need directions, you escort them. If they ask a question you've heard a hundred times, you answer it as if you'd never heard it before. There's a ride called the <i>Jungle Cruise</i>, and the most common question asked about it is, 'How long is this ride?' So the staff is given a prepared, standard answer: 'The <i>Jungle Cruise</i> is an exciting adventure ride that lasts ten minutes.' But one employee had been asked it once too often, so when a couple asked, 'How long is the <i>Jungle Cruise</i>?' he said, 'Three days.' The couple got out of the line, left the park, went back to Disney Hotel where they were on their honeymoon, packed up their suitcases, checked out, and came back to the line at the <i>Jungle Cruise</i>. The next day that Disneyland employee was gone. Someone else was standing at the line to say, 'The <i>Jungle Cruise</i> is an exciting adventure ride that lasts ten minutes.' When you represent God's Kingdom you're supposed to go out of your way to facilitate people, love them and meet their needs. Why? Because Jesus, the King in this Kingdom, said, '...the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve...' (Matthew 20:28 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['To those who use well what they are given, even more will be given...' Matthew 25:29 NLT<br /><br /><p>Your value in a job is determined by the value you add to the job. When a Christian goes to work each day, God holds them accountable for adding, enhancing and improving things in their workplace. Jesus told the story of three men who were each given money. One was given five bags of it, another two, and another one. The first two '...went and traded with them, and gained...' (Matthew 25:16 NAS) They showed skill, initiative, and made 100 percent profit. So they were commended by their master. But the third man just punched the clock, called in sick, didn't train, try, dare or do. So his job review didn't go too well. And Jesus said something that ought to make us all sit up and take notice: 'To those who use well what they are given, even more will be given, and they will have an abundance. But from those who do nothing, even what little they have will be taken away.' That means if your attitude and work ethic are poor, you're in trouble with God. So, let's stop and think about your job. If Jesus were your supervisor, would you do your work any differently? How would you answer the phone, type documents, treat your employees, or teach your pupils if Jesus were checking your work? As a citizen of God's Kingdom you need to periodically review your attitude on the job, solicit feedback on how you can grow, demonstrate love and grace to those you work with, make your company profitable, and enjoy the work you do. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The father [or mother] of a righteous man has great joy...' Proverbs 23:24 NIV <br /><br /><p>The hardest work is sometimes the most overlooked work. A husband came home from work one day and the house was an absolute mess. Clothes were strewn all over the floor, dirty dishes filled the sink, the kids were crying, the beds were unmade, the bathroom smelled badly and the TV set was blaring. When he asked his wife what was going on, she replied, 'You know how you ask me every night what I did all day? Well, today I didn't do it.' If you're a stay-at-home mum or dad, God considers your work to be important. It's more important to the future than just about any other profession - because you're determining the quality of the next generation. Martin Luther said, 'What you do in your house is worth as much as if you did it up in Heaven for our Lord.' One day God will say, 'Well done,' to parents who cared for children - bathing them, feeding them, cleaning up after them - when they were tired and thought nobody was looking. Somebody is looking. Somebody is keeping track. It is worth it! You are the one who makes your work significant - not the other way round. When you discover the gifts God has given you and the passions He has placed within you, and put them to work in the service of values you deeply believe in - you are 'working for God' in the truest sense. So each day ask God to make your work go well. And try to identify the larger picture in your work that makes it a 'calling'. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['A righteous person may fall...but he gets up again...' Proverbs 24:16 GWT<br /><br /><p>You can tell a lot about somebody by how they respond to life. Everybody gets knocked down, but how fast you get up again is what counts. Verla Wallace says: 'Failure teaches us things we can't learn any other way... Treat it as a visitor allowed to deliver unpleasant news, but don't let it take up residence... All failures are not equal. For example, when a beautiful, talented young woman is the first runner-up in a Beauty Pageant, some say she failed. Yet some people would give their right arm to be named the second most attractive female in a national competition. It's a matter of perspective... [examine] your failures and weigh them according to their importance in the overall scheme of things...I once received a 'D' at college... it's ridiculous, but that sticks in my mind like a pebble in my shoe. Why do I fixate on that and not the fact that it happened during the term I carried nineteen credit hours, worked part-time, got engaged, and spent six weeks in the college health centre with mononucleosis? When I put the experience in context, it loses its power to undermine my confidence. Failure teaches us what's important. I have a friend who was downsized out of a job... It caught her by surprise because she was good at her work. &quot;I tended to be full of pride,&quot; she says. &quot;I got away with it because I was so successful. Losing my job...humbled me. With pride you have no permission to fail. It's a heavy yoke...and I don't wear it any more. I feel lighter in my spirit without the burden of having to be perfect.&quot;'</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...when you have done the will of God, you will receive what He has promised.' Hebrews 10:36 NIV<br /><br /><p>Many of us may remember singing in church, '<i>Every promise i</i><i>n the Book is mine!</i>' Exciting words - but are they entirely true? If you've prayed for the fulfilment of a Bible promise that didn't materialise, you may have wondered, felt disillusioned, or even stopped trusting. What's true is that every promise in the Book intended for you, is yours! God is committed to keeping every promise He has made (Matthew 24:35). So how can you know which Bible promises are yours? Here are some Scriptural guidelines to help you: (1) <i>Be sure you</i><i> understand the promise</i>. God is committed to His Word, not to your interpretation of it. When Jesus said, '...Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up' (John 2:19 NKJV), His audience completely misunderstood Him, thinking He meant the literal temple when He meant His body. (2) <i>Walk in the Spirit, not the flesh</i>. Walking in the Spirit, Peter received divine understanding of Christ's deity. When Jesus asked, 'Who do you say I am?' Peter answered, 'You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.' Jesus replied, '...this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by My Father...' (Matthew 16:15-17 NIV) Soon afterwards, walking in the flesh, the same man totally misunderstood Jesus and was severely rebuked by Jesus (Matthew 16:21-23). Why? Because '...the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God... nor can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.' (1 Corinthians 2:14 NKJV) So submit your thoughts to God; pray for His guidance, and in due course, you'll get the insight you need. </p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...no...Scripture is...of one's own interpretation.' 2 Peter 1:20 NAS<br /><br /><p>Here are two more principles for discerning which promises in Scripture are for you: (1) <i>Try to understand the context</i>. No Scripture stands in isolation, but should be read in conjunction with every other Scripture on the same topic. If you isolate 'I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me' (Philippians 4:13 NKJV), believing 'all things' includes leaping from a twelfth-storey window, don't blame God's Word for your unexpected demise! You should also have read the context which says, '...I have learned both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. I can do all [these] things through Christ who strengthens me.' (Philippians 4:12-13 NKJV) This Scripture doesn't mean you can do anything you want, but that God will enable you to get through anything you encounter while doing His will. (2) <i>Test S</i><i>cripture by Scripture, not by your own desires</i>. 'No prophecy of Scripture is a matter of one's own interpretation.' Some Bible promises are universal in application, and some are personal. The personal ones apply to the intended hearer; the universal ones apply to all believers. Know which is which. If you think the Scripture, '...Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household' (Acts 16:31 NKJV), guarantees your entire family's salvation, you might be disappointed and think that God failed. No, that was a personal promise made and fulfilled to the Philippian jailer. A universal word for you and your family is, '...In fact, God...wants everyone to turn from sin and no one to be lost.' (2 Peter 3:9 CEV) He wants your entire family to be saved!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Impress them on your children...' Deuteronomy 6:7 NIV<br /><br /><p>In an interview with <i>Christianity Today</i>, Dr. James Dobson said: 'The culture has totally changed. Girls today are growing up too fast; the influences of the entertainment industry have changed everything. Girls are experiencing things their mothers and grandmothers never experienced. The age compression thrusts girls into adolescent experience far too early, gets them thinking about sexuality at an early age and creates pressure. We are dealing with evidences of emotional turmoil, including eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia; 90 percent of those with eating disorders are girls, some of them as young as five. Recently a clothing manufacturer finally took this product off the shelves: bikinis with padded bras for seven-year-olds! You also have cutting, piercing and sexual aggression among elementary school age kids and early involvement in drugs and alcohol. Girls have now reached parity with boys in binge drinking, and there's a high level of violence among girls. One out of three boys and girls is either a victim or a perpetrator of bullying. We've seen news recently about girls who hang themselves after being taunted. There has never been an easy time to raise kids, but it's harder today.' Parent, if living in your dream home and climbing the ladder of success means losing your children, you'll regret it. You've only one chance to get it right. 'These commandments that I give you today...Impress them on your children. Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up.' (Deuteronomy 6: 6-7 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Talk about them when you sit...when you walk...when you lie down ...when you get up.' Deuteronomy 6:7 NIV<br /><br /><p>When asked, 'How do you teach your daughter about healthy self-esteem while not training her to be self-focused?' Dr. Dobson gave this answer: 'Girls in their adolescent and middle school years are going through puberty, and that brings about acne and gangly bodies. Those girls look at role models like Britney Spears, Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan. If they dare to be a little overweight - not even fat, but slightly overweight - they hear about it all day long. It tears into the heart and worth of a girl who just wants to be a princess, who wants to be loved by somebody. If the father in this situation doesn't affirm her, love her, tell her she's pretty, put his arm around her and give her attention, she often looks for it elsewhere. The only thing she has to bargain with is her sexuality, and she thinks she'll be loved if she gives certain gifts of her sexuality. We know where that leads: he gets what he wants and dumps her, and she doesn't get what she wants, which is love.' Dad, if you've been AWOL, come back to your children, particularly your daughters. Your home is a classroom. What you teach them there, they will take with them into the rest of their lives. If your life is out of order today, repent, get right with God and start paying attention to what really matters. You can't undo the past, but with God's help you can give your children the future they deserve. But it must become one of your highest priorities.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord.' Ephesians 6:4 NIV<br /><br /><p>When asked, 'How do you suggest parents handle their children's activities on web sites like Facebook and Twitter?' Dr. Dobson gave this advice: 'Parents have to know what technology their kids are using. Sexting is a terrible thing. ['Sexting' is the new term for children exposing themselves to one another online, thinking they are safe because they are in the sanctuary of their own home.] Pornography is pervasive, and parents need to keep up with changes in technology and protect their kids. That's a tough assignment, because kids are ahead of them. Parents often have extremely demanding careers and when they come home they have nothing left to give, so the culture will often take your kids to hell.' One night long ago a father and his daughter were out on a lake when their small boat was caught in a storm. As he rowed, Dad kept saying to his daughter, 'Can you see the shore? Can you see the shore?' After a terrifying hour the little girl pointed over her dad's shoulder and said, 'Yes, I see the light. Mum said if we were out after dark she would hang a light in the window.' When they finally got home a tearful mother hugged her husband and daughter, and thanked God for their safe return. Looking at her, the little girl said, 'Mum, you never had to worry. We steered by your light!' Parent, your children are being caught in life's storms. They are rowing in the dark with no sense of direction. Live for God, and give them a light they can steer by! </p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled...' Matthew 26:56 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>The death, burial and resurrection of Jesus fulfilled no less than 29 different Old Testament prophecies. The odds of that happening are virtually impossible! Mathematician Peter Stoner has a graphic example similar to this: suppose New South Wales was covered in dollar coins half a metre deep. One of the coins has a mark on it. What is the probability that a blindfolded person could, on their first attempt, select that exact coin? That's the likelihood of just eight prophecies being fulfilled in one lifetime. However Jesus fulfilled 29 of them in one day! Let's look at some of the prophecies He fulfilled: (1) '...They pierced My hands and...feet.' (Psalm 22:16 NKJV) (2) 'They divide My garments...and...cast lots.' (Psalm 22:18 NKJV) (3) '...in that day...I will make the sun go down at noon, and...darken the earth in...daylight.' (Amos 8:9 NKJV) Jesus predicted both His death and His resurrection. He told His critics, '...&quot;Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days.&quot;...the temple He had spoken of was His body.' (John 2:19-21 NIV) Jesus pre knew every event, including Judas' betrayal, the high priest's hypocrisy and Peter's denial - and didn't stop them. Why? 'That the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled.' So you can trust your Bible because it's true. And something else is true too. God is '...able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine...' (Ephesians 3:20 NIV) Note the words 'immeasurably more'. What seems impossible to you at the moment is all in a day's work for Him. So start trusting Him to work on your behalf.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Help us for the glory of Your name...' Psalm 79:9 NLT<br /><br /><p>For fifteen years Mike Cleveland, airline pilot and founder of <i>Setting </i><i>Captives Free</i>, seemed powerless as his addiction to online pornography devastated his life, his marriage and his family. The spiral of lust enslaved him 'until there wasn't a moment of his days free from its tortured domination.' The cycle of prayers for deliverance, followed by repeated indulgence in porn, X-rated DVDs and sex chat-rooms, plunged him deeper into the darkness of despair and self-loathing. He longed to escape the underworld of secret soul-destroying sin but every pathetic attempt left him unchanged, unhinged and uncertain freedom was possible for him. Mike turned to self-help books, counsellors and friends without success. His repeated disappointment, when every effort failed, led to increasing guilt and self-incrimination. When his wife insisted on a last-ditch visit to see her, the lights in their bleak prison cell suddenly came on. Mike learned that '...deliverance belong(s) to the Lord' (Jonah 2:9 AMP), and its rules are all dictated by Him. Mike's old motivations for getting clean - 'saving my marriage for my kids' sake; I'm a Christian, a seminary graduate and preacher' - were full of 'loopholes and escape clauses' and produced one botched disaster after another. His pastor taught him that the only viable motivation for getting clean and staying clean was a commitment to glorifying God in all of his decisions, because God delivers the powerless, 'For the glory of [His] name.' When Mike learned, '...whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God' (1 Corinthians 10:31 NIV), the doors to freedom from years of sexual addiction began to open. Yours can too.

<introtext><![CDATA['...command that these stones become bread.' Matthew 4:3 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says, '...Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.' (Matthew 4:1 NKJV) This seems to be God's standard operating procedure. Why? Because He's a good general; before He puts you into battle He puts you into boot camp. Imagine it: you're up at dawn, running for miles with a heavy backpack, crawling under barbed wire barriers with bullets whizzing over your head, taking orders from authority figures you don't know and probably don't like. But if you pass the test; you get to wear the uniform. On the threshold of His ministry, God led His Son into a situation where He would face three levels of attack. You will face them also. Let's look at the first one: </p>
<p><i>The attack over the bread</i>. Did Jesus need bread? Yes, He'd been without food for forty days. But He knew that His greatest need was not for natural food but spiritual food. So He told Satan, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.' (Matthew 4:4 NKJV) Only when you're convinced God will take care of all your material needs, will you start putting spiritual things first in your life. Until that happens, you'll think you have to take care of yourself. As a result, you will walk in fear and not faith. That's not how God wants you to live. '...seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.' (Matthew 6:33 NKJV) When you worry, you don't trust God. When you trust God, you don't have to worry. The choice is yours. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Then the devil...set Him on the pinnacle...' Matthew 4:5 NKJV<br /><br /><p><i>T</i><i>he attack on the pinnacle</i>. Let's look at the second temptation Jesus faced: 'Then the devil took Him up into the holy city, [and] set Him on the pinnacle of the temple.' Here you deal with the fear of failure. Satan will whisper, 'You're on the pinnacle of success now, but you could easily fall off.' He will bring up your past failures. He will remind you of leaders who crashed and burned. He will say, 'If people realised how little you really know, or the issues you're struggling with, they wouldn't respect you.' There are two kinds of fear: healthy fear and unhealthy fear. Healthy fear will keep you dependent on God; it will protect you from pride and self-sufficiency. 'Therefore let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall.' (1 Corinthians 10:12 NKJV) But there's an unhealthy fear that will keep you in the boat when Jesus is calling to you to step out and walk with Him on the water. You say, 'But Peter almost drowned.' Yes, but he was the only one of the disciples who experienced the joy of walking on the water! Having faith doesn't mean you won't experience a sinking feeling at times. You have a choice. You can give in to fear, or trust the God who has called you, sustained you, and never failed to give you the strength needed to cope with whatever you face. If your own intellect or talents are the basis of your confidence, you have good reason to fear. But if God is the basis of your confidence, you have nothing to fear. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...All these things I will give you...' Matthew 4:9 NKJV<br /><br /><p><i>T</i><i>he attack over the cross</i>. Let's look at the third temptation Jesus faced: '...The devil took Him up on an exceedingly high mountain, and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. And he said to Him, &quot;All these things I will give You if You will fall down and worship me.&quot;' (Matthew 4:8-9 NKJV) Satan's third attack was over a cross-less life. In essence, he told Jesus, 'You don't have to carry the cross. Just bow to me and you can have it all.' Jesus said, 'Away with you, Satan!' (Matthew 4:10 NKJV) 'Away' with any teaching that says God is your concierge and He has to wait on you! Or that He's like a vending machine; all you have to do is put in a few coins and whatever you want will come out. </p>
<p>Paul writes, 'I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.' (Galatians 2:20 NKJV) Has God promised to bless you? Absolutely! But that doesn't mean you'll never get hurt, or face lack, or fatigue, or be betrayed and disappointed by others. Jesus said, '...unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies [to self], it remains alone; but if it dies [to self], it produces much...' (John 12:24 NKJV) Have you ever heard the expression, 'Dead man walking?' To do God's will, you have to die to your own will, and do it daily. But if you're willing to, God will take you to a new level of blessing. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...have your sandals on and your walking stick in your hand...' Exodus 12:11 NCV<br /><br /><p>The Boy Scout motto is 'Be prepared,' and it's a good one. In Exodus, God told Israel, '...eat...fully dressed as if you were going on a trip...have your sandals on and your walking stick in your hand.' In other words, 'Be ready when I tell you to move!' Maybe there's an area in your life where God is telling you it's time to move, but fear is making you hold back. Don't! Change is just evidence of growth. What worked yesterday can be tomorrow's recipe for failure. You can't become who you are destined to be, if you insist on staying as you are. John Patterson said, 'Only fools and dead men don't change... Fools won't, and dead men can't.' Change isn't the enemy. Once you start seeing yourself as a lifelong learner looking for ways to grow and improve, change becomes your friend. Learn from the people you meet, pursue new ideas, strategies and ways to push yourself out of your comfort zone. Jim Penner says: 'Our bodies change no matter how hard we exercise to battle ageing... Our homes change as our needs ebb and flow. Our places of employment change as the winds of economic forces blow or new opportunities come... friendships change as family needs and employment pull us away... Many of these changes become enjoyable new seasons...sometimes they're painful. But no matter what season of change you find yourself going through...you can find comfort in Malachi 3:6, &quot;For I am the Lord, I do not change.&quot; His mercies endure forever...and it's an awesome feeling knowing He loves and directs you just like He directed all His people who came before you.' </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Those who wait upon the Lord...' Isaiah 40:31 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The word 'wait' here can give us a picture of two things. The first is of a waiter at your table attending to your needs. The second is making a request of a judge or someone in power. Your success depends on approaching them the right way, and on their willingness to grant your request. Since they hold the power, you must be patient and wait for them. Are you getting the idea? Our problem is twofold. First, we want God to wait on us, instead of the other way round. Second, we don't want to wait for anything! We drive to work listening to the radio and talking on the phone; some of us even put ourselves and others at risk by text-messaging. It's been said that in the days of the Old West if someone missed a stagecoach they were content to wait a few days, even a week, for the next one... but now we don't even want to wait for the next section of the revolving door. What God does in you while you are waiting is often more important than what you're asking God to do. Waiting on God brings rewards that nothing else will. Here are a few of them: (1) <i>Vindication</i>. 'Do not fret because of evil men or be envious of those who do wrong... Delight yourself in the Lord and He will give you the desires of your heart.' (Psalm 37:1-4 NIV) (2) <i>Strength</i>. 'Wait on the Lord... and He shall strengthen your heart...' (Psalm 27:14 NKJV) (3) <i>Deliverance</i>. 'I waited...for the Lord... He brought me up out of a horrible pit...' (Psalm 40:1-2 NKJV) So relax, wait on God and He will come through for you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I...am the Lord, and besides Me there is no saviour.' Isaiah 43:11 NKJV <br /><br /><p>The Israelites were commanded not to make any 'graven image' of God. Why? Because God made us, we didn't make Him. A god you can make is a god you can control and make do whatever you wish. The ancient Greeks had a host of gods, all created by men. Some demanded human sacrifice; others permitted prostitution, and even promoted it in their temples. When we reverse the order and start to create God in our own image (according to our own imagination) we get the following things: (1) A god who's liberal or conservative, a hawk or a dove; a god politicians conveniently pull out of a box at election time to gain votes even though they don't truly serve him. (2) A flexible god who permits you to do whatever you want, and you can then say, 'I just felt led to do it.' (3) A god who promises to bless his children but never discipline them. (4) A god you can 'keep in his place' until you need him. (5) A god who is not supreme, but happy to be one of many deities offering many ways to Heaven. Not so! God says, 'I, even I, am the Lord, and besides Me there is no saviour.' Jesus said, 'I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.' (John 14:6 NKJV) Jesus doesn't need a makeover to bring Him into alignment with the internet and the space age. He is Lord! Indeed, as Hudson Taylor said, if He is not Lord over all, He is not Lord at all! </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom...' Proverbs 9:10 NKJV <br /><br /><p>In a world out of control, we like a god we can control: a comforting presence who blesses, provides and advises. Kind of like 'God in a box'. But when it comes to Christ, no box works. His contemporaries designed an assortment of boxes for Him, but He didn't fit in any of them. They called Him a revolutionary, but He paid taxes. They labelled Him a country carpenter, but He confounded scholars. They came to see His miracles, but He refused to entertain them. He was a Jew who attracted Gentiles, a rabbi who gave up on synagogues, a holy man who hung around with prostitutes. In a male-dominated society, He recruited females. In an anti-Roman culture, He opted not to denounce Rome. He talked like a king yet lived like a pilgrim. People tried to put Him in a 'box', but they couldn't. And we can't either; indeed we must not! '...The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding...' (Proverbs 9:10 NIV) Most of our fears are unhealthy. They rob us of peace and joy. But the fear of the Lord does the opposite. Ellen Davis writes: 'There is nothing neurotic about fearing God. The neurotic thing is not to be afraid, or to be afraid of the wrong thing. That is why God chooses to be known to us, so that we may stop being afraid of the wrong thing. When God is fully revealed to us and we &quot;get it&quot;, then we experience the conversion of our fear... &quot;fear of the Lord&quot; is the deeply sane recognition that we are not God.' </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...&quot;This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Hear Him!&quot;' Matthew 17:5 NKJV<br /><br /><p>On the Mount of Transfiguration, Moses, the law giver, and Elijah, who represents the prophets, stood side by side with Jesus. But Jesus outshone them all. The Bible says, '...His clothes became radiant, intensely white, as no one on earth could bleach them...' (Mark 9:3 ESV) In that moment Jesus was God in His purest form. Awed by Him, Peter said, 'Lord...if You wish, let us make here three tabernacles: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.' (Matthew 17:4 NKJV) It was a sincere sentiment, but it was sincerely wrong. 'While He was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them; and suddenly a voice came out of the cloud, saying, &quot;This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Hear Him!&quot;' The word <i>beloved</i> implies 'unique.' There is no one else like Jesus! Not Moses. Not Elijah. Not Peter. Not Zoroaster, Buddha, or Muhammad. No one in Heaven or on earth. Three shrines would have made Moses and Elijah equal with Christ, and God would have none of it. Only one shrine should be built, because only one person on the mountain deserved to be worshipped. 'When the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces and were greatly afraid.' (Matthew 17:6 NKJV) The One who hung the stars in space and left Pharaoh's armies at the bottom of the Red Sea stood among them. The sight of Him took their breath away, removed every trace of arrogance and caused them to end up face-down on the ground. How long has it been since you felt such reverence for God?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let all that I am praise the Lord...' Psalm 103:2 NLT<br /><br /><p>The Bible equates God with light, and light with holiness. '...God is light; in Him there is no darkness at all.' (1 John 1:5 NIV) Paul said that God dwells in '...unapproachable light...' (1 Timothy 6:16 NIV) Scripture refers to Christ '...who is holy, blameless, pure, set apart from sinners...' (Hebrews 7:26 NIV) So how should you approach such a God? As you would an auditor when your books don't balance? Or a dictator who holds the power of life and death? No, Jesus told us to pray, '...Our Father in Heaven, hallowed be Your name.' (Matthew 6:9 NKJV) There's your answer! You must come to God as a father who loves you dearly and desires only what is best for you, while always regarding Him with profound reverence. As your awe of God expands, your fears in life will diminish. A big view of God translates into big courage; a small view of God generates no courage at all. A puny God can't help you when cancer strikes, your family is in trouble, or you've no way to pay your bills. A 'do-me-a-favour' Jesus may look good stuck on your dashboard, but that image can do nothing for your fears. You need an awesome God who, while diminishing your ego, enlarges your faith and blows your mind. David wrote: 'Let all that I am praise the Lord; may I never forget the good things He does for me. He forgives all my sins and heals all my diseases. He redeems me from death and crowns me with love and tender mercies. He fills my life with good things...' (Psalm 103:2-5 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear?...' Psalm 27:1 NKJV <br /><br /><p>We all need an encounter with the transfigured Christ; the One who is greater than Moses the law giver and Elijah the prophet, and all the other prophets who have ever lived. The One who wears the true crown of the universe, God's beloved Son. We need to fall on our face and see Him as the Holy One, the Highest One, the Only One. As you do, all your fears, save the fear of Christ Himself, will melt like an ice cube on a summer day. You will agree with David: 'The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear?' In the book <i>Prince Caspian</i>, there is a great illustration of this. Lucy sees Aslan the lion for the first time in many years. He has changed since their last encounter. His size surprises her, and she tells him as much. 'Aslan,' says Lucy, 'you're bigger.' He replies, 'That is because you are older, little one.' Lucy says, 'Not because you are?' He replies, 'I am not. But every year you grow, you find me bigger.' And so it is in our walk with Christ. The longer we serve Him, the greater He becomes. It's not that He changes, but that we do. We see dimensions, aspects, characteristics we never saw before; increasing and astonishing increments of His purity, power and uniqueness. Only when we have fallen at His feet in humility and total dependence will He say to us what He said to His disciples on the Mount where He was transfigured: 'Arise, and do not be afraid.' (Matthew 17:7 NKJV)</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['I have glorified You on the earth...' John 17:4 NKJV<br /><br /><p>At the end of His life, Jesus was able to pray, 'I have glorified You on the earth. I have finished the work which You have given Me to do.' Jesus didn't try to compete with John the Baptist or model Himself after some Old Testament prophet. He knew what 'success' was for Him. To know what it is for you, you must: </p>
<p>(1) <i>Discern what success really is</i>. When others feel good about you, you're popular; but when you feel good about yourself, you're successful. Your life's highest calling will always create the highest level of joy within you. (2) <i>Before you set goals, pray</i>. 'In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths.' (Proverbs 3:6 NKJV) It's not wrong to set goals, it's just wrong to set them without first consulting God. (3) <i>Stop expecting others to bring you success</i>. Don't wait for flowers to arrive. God gave you seed; start growing some of your own. 'Pay careful attention to your own work, for then you will get the satisfaction of a job well done, and you won't need to compare yourself to anyone else.' (Galatians 6:4 NLT) And besides, when you're less needy you'll become more attractive to others. (4) <i>Get over yourself</i> - everyone else has. A minister said he was praying one day, 'Father, why does the devil keep reminding me of my past?' God replied, 'Because he's running low on material!' Repent, and then move on. God says He will '...not remember your sins.' (Isaiah 43:25 NKJV) There's only one good reason to bring up the past, and that's to learn from it and grow wiser. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Blessed is the man who perseveres...' James 1:12 NIV<br /><br /><p>Here are three keys to victorious living: (1) <i>Perseverance</i>. Dr G. Campbell Morgan tells of a man whose shop burned to the ground. The next morning he set up shop in the middle of the charred ruins and put up a sign that read, 'Everything lost except wife, children and hope - business as usual tomorrow morning.' So get back up again! 'Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, because when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life.' (2) <i>Purpose</i>. Helen Keller wrote, 'Many persons have the wrong idea of what constitutes true happiness. It is not attained through self-gratification, but through fidelity to a worthy purpose.' Jesus said, '...the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve...' (Mark 10:45 NKJV) Don't pray for a generous heart, practice being generous and your heart will fall into line with your actions. As long as you are a sower, God will give you seed (2 Corinthians 9:10). (3) <i>Perspective</i>. Your disappointment may turn out to be God's appointment. 'In his heart a man plans his course, but the Lord determines his steps.' (Proverbs 16:9 NIV) Remember how an oyster makes a pearl? When a grain of sand gets into its shell, the oyster wraps it in layer after layer of beauty until a pearl is formed. The poet wrote: 'This tale has a moral, for isn't it grand, what an oyster can do with a morsel of sand? And what couldn't we do, if we'd only begin, with some of the things that get under our skin.' Have the right perspective. Try to see God at work in what you are going through today! </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['You are the salt of the earth...' Matthew 5:13 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Jon Gordon says: 'I speak to a lot of organisations on the importance of positive leadership and the benefits of building a positive culture that fuels performance. Yet the most common question I receive is, &quot;How do I stay positive when my boss isn't?&quot; Here are a few suggestions: Even though you're not the leader...focus on being the best and bringing out the best in the people you work with...tune out negativity and negative comments. Remember, you can't control what other people say and do, but you can control how you react.' Dr. David Hawkins says, 'Eighty percent of the population vibrates to a negative frequency. It's all around us. Stay above the fray.' There's an old adage, 'Never wrestle with a pig because you'll both get dirty - and the pig will enjoy himself!' Jesus said, 'You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.' (Matthew 5:14 NKJV) Make up your mind to be the beacon that shines in your workplace. Bottom line: most people don't enjoy being negative. Many times they're that way because of stress, being too busy and fear. Most of them just need a wake-up call to break out of their rut, and contrary to what you may think, you can be that instrument of change. Jesus also said, 'You are the salt of the earth,' and salt has two functions. It stops things from going bad, and it adds taste and flavour. Your job as a Christian is to preserve, reconcile, and give hope to those around you; including the people you work with every day. So, take God to work with you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved...' Acts 16:31 NKJV<br /><br /><p>By putting your trust in Christ, your soul will be saved and your life will be changed for the better. Testimonies that this is so come from hundreds of thousands of famous people. Such a testimony is that of William Gladstone, one of Britain's greatest Prime Ministers, whose life was transformed by God. Another is Abraham Lincoln who tells us in his letters that at Gettysburg, the day he delivered his famous address, he too was born again of God's Spirit. Martin Luther had been exceedingly religious, even as Nicodemus was, and yet had known nothing of the new birth. But all that changed when he discovered these words in Scripture: '...The just shall live by faith.' (Romans 1:17 NKJV) Writers like Fyodor Dostoevsky and Leo Tolstoy of Russia have described the work of God's Spirit as utterly transforming their lives. Men like Chuck Colson, aide to President Richard Nixon and author of the bestseller <i>Born Again</i>,<i> </i>have told of being radically changed by the new birth. And whether you live in a mansion or a mud hut, you too can be saved. When the Philippian jailer asked Paul, 'What must I do to be saved?' Paul didn't give him a theological dissertation. No, he simply said: 'Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household.' Think: Not only can <i>you</i> be saved today, but through your life and testimony your entire family can be won to Christ, if they repent (2 Peter 3:9). Imagine the difference that could make! Do you have to understand it? No, but you can experience it. How? By placing your trust in Christ today.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.' Proverbs 15:1 NAS<br /><br /><p>Do you sometimes find yourself saying, 'I get so angry when they refuse to listen to my viewpoint. How can I <i>make </i>them listen and hear what I'm trying to say?' Unless you're involved in an official debate, arguing with someone who's unwilling to listen is useless and a waste of time. State your viewpoint with clarity and purpose, but don't become defensive and argumentative if it's not received. You'll only hurt yourself and the relationship if you become argumentative. Don't allow anyone to draw you into strife or arguing. Hold your tongue, and try to remember these words of wisdom: 'A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger. The tongue of the wise makes knowledge acceptable, but the mouth of a fool spurts folly.' (Proverbs 15:2 NAS) What must surely be one of the most frustrating conversations in history was reported in <i>Theatre Art</i><i>s</i> Magazine. A subscriber, wishing to report on a particular upcoming event in his community, dialled directory enquiries to get the magazine's telephone number. The operator drawled, 'Sorry, but there's nobody listed by the name of Theodore Arts.' The subscriber insisted, 'It's not a person; it's a publication. I want Theatre Arts.' The operator responded, this time a little louder. 'I told you, we have no listing for Theodore Arts in this city. Perhaps he lives in another city.' By now the subscriber was thoroughly peeved. 'Confound it, the word is theatre: T-H-E-A-T-R-E!' The operator came back with equal certainty in her voice, 'That is not the way to spell Theodore.' Arguing; it's a waste of time.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...he...earns wages to put into a bag with holes.' Haggai 1:6 NKJV<br /><br /><p>There are four kinds of givers noted in the Bible. For the next few days let's look at each. <i>Bag people</i>. In the days of Haggai the prophet, the Israelites were so busy making money that they had no time for God. Sound familiar? So he said to them: '&quot;Is it time for you yourselves to dwell in your panelled houses, and this temple to lie in ruins?&quot;...&quot;Consider your ways! You have sown much, and bring in little...and he who earns wages, earns wages to put into a bag with holes&quot;...&quot;You looked for much, but indeed it came to little; and when you brought it home, I blew it away. Why?&quot; says the Lord of Hosts. &quot;Because of My house that is in ruins, while every one of you runs to his own house.&quot;' (Haggai 1:4-9 NKJV) If you want God to be interested in your house, be interested in His house. If you want God to bless your house, begin to bless His house. If you want God to provide for your house, start providing for His house. You say, 'How much should I give?' God sets the baseline at one-tenth of your income (Leviticus 27:32). Whatever you give beyond that will be determined by three things: (a) <i>Your ability</i>. 'Every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of the Lord your God which He has given you.' (Deuteronomy 16:17 NKJV) (b) <i>Your desire to reap</i>. God will '...multiply the seed that you have sown...' (2 Corinthians 9:10 NKJV) (c) <i>Your love</i>. 'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.' (Matthew 22:37 NKJV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...the bin...shall not be used up...' 1 Kings 17:14 NKJV <br /><br /><p><i>B</i><i>in people</i>. In the middle of a devastating famine, God sent the prophet Elijah to Zarephath, saying he'd meet a widow there who would feed him. Why did God not send Elijah to a wealthy family? Because they didn't need a miracle, she did! When Elijah asked this woman for something to eat she told him that she'd '...only a handful of flour in a bin...' (1 Kings 17:12 NKJV) She had just enough for one more meal, then she and her son would die. Perhaps you're thinking, 'Typical preacher! They'll take the last bite out of your mouth and the last penny out of your pocket.' No, this was the best day of her life! She was about to step into miracle territory. But first she had to overcome the fear of giving. 'Elijah said to her, &quot;Do not fear...make me a small cake from it first, and bring it to me...&quot; For thus says the Lord God of Israel: &quot;The bin of flour shall not be used up...until the day the Lord sends rain on the earth.&quot;' (1 Kings 17:13-14 NKJV) How does this story turn out? 'So she went away and did according to the word of Elijah; and...the bin of flour was not used up...' (1 Kings 17:15-16 NKJV) Day after day, without fail, she reached into the bin and found more flour. She discovered that when you obey God's Word He will meet your every need. Are you a bin person? Are you afraid of letting go of what you have in case you don't have enough? Don't be. You will never out-give God! Whatever you give to Him, He has promised to give back '...good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over...' (Luke 6:38 NKJV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...they took up twelve baskets full...' Mark 6:43 NKJV<br /><br /><p><i>B</i><i>asket people</i>. A boy gave his lunch to Jesus and He used it to feed five thousand people. Afterwards, 'They took up twelve baskets full of the fragments.' Basket people find a need greater than their own and say, 'Lord, here's what I have; take it, bless it and use it.' What a contrast this boy was to the disciples. Notice: (1) <i>They tried to escape the prob</i><i>lem</i>. 'Send them away, that they may go...and buy themselves bread...' (Mark 6:36 NKJV) Your faith only grows by facing your problems and looking to God for answers. Indeed, when you solve the problem you position yourself to receive what God has in store for you next. (2) <i>They didn</i><i>'</i><i>t know what they had</i>. Jesus said, 'How many loaves do you have? Go and see...' (Mark 6:38 NKJV) Moses had a rod, but it parted the Red Sea. David had a slingshot, but it brought down a giant. You may not know it, but God has given you the answer. He's given you something capable of multiplying once you put it into His hands. The key is, 'Go and see.' (3) <i>They despised the day of small things</i>. 'There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two small fish, but what are they among so many?' (John 6:9 NKJV) Instead of looking at your lack, look at God's abundance and His willingness to work on your behalf. 'Do not despise this small beginning, for the eyes of the Lord rejoice to see the work begin...' (Zechariah 4:10 TLB) Factor God into the equation. The formula for success is you - plus God!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Joseph opened the storehouses [barns] and sold grain to the Egyptians...' Genesis 41:56 NIV <br /><br /><p><i>B</i><i>arn people</i>. God used Joseph to feed the nations during a time of worldwide famine. When Pharaoh's advisers couldn't interpret his dream, Joseph did. He actually gave Pharaoh a plan that would not only feed Egypt during seven years of famine, but also feed the world and cause Pharaoh to come out of this crisis a richer man. When you serve God, He can give you information about the future. He can give you not only the wisdom to survive, but thrive when you're in a recession. But you can't build such a relationship with God overnight! Joseph's journey to the throne of Egypt led through years of delay, detours and discouragement. He experienced betrayal at the hands of his family, temptation and slander at the hands of his employer's wife, false imprisonment, years of waiting and wondering when God would fulfil His promise to make him a leader. But he never doubted God. And you must not either! If God can take an ex-con like Joseph and make him the prime minister of Egypt, no obstacle and no enemy can keep Him from fulfilling His promise to you. </p>
<p>So, if you're a bag person, 'consider your ways' and start putting God first in your finances. If you're a bin person, 'be not afraid,' give, and God will give back to you. If you're a basket person, place what you've got into God's hands and watch Him multiply it. If you're a barn person with a heart that longs to meet the needs of a hurting world, nothing your enemies do will stop you. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The Lord forbid that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to you!' 1 Kings 21:3 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says: '...Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard...next to the palace of Ahab king of Samaria. So Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, &quot;Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a vegetable garden, because it is near, next to my house; and for it I will give you a vineyard better than it. Or, if it seems good to you, I will give you its worth in money.&quot; But Naboth said to Ahab, &quot;The Lord forbid that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to you!&quot;' (1 Kings 21:1-3 NKJV) Standing by his 'inheritance' cost this man of integrity his life. Today the faith of our fathers is coming under increasing attack from the schoolroom to the boardroom. Scriptural principles which have guided us for generations are being challenged and undermined by the Ahabs of this world who sit in places of power. The Bible predicted it and told us to be alert, but not afraid. God said to the end-age church, 'Do not fear any of those things which you are about to suffer... Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life.' (Revelation 2:10 NKJV) Naboth refused to sell out for money. He refused to sell out for that which looked 'bigger and better'. He refused to sell out in order to win the favour of those in high places. And he is an example to you. So stand squarely on God's Word and refuse to budge. Gather up your children in faith's arms and declare, '...as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.' (Joshua 24:15 NKJV) </p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...We have fellowship with each other, and the blood of Jesus...cleanses us from all sin.' 1 John 1:7 NLT<br /><br /><p>The Bible says, 'a nearby neighbor can help you more than relatives who are far away.' (Proverbs 27:10 GNT) Sometimes it's easier to develop close friendships with those outside your immediate family circle. But there's another kind of 'blood relative' mentioned in the Bible: brothers and sisters joined together through the blood of Jesus (1 John 1:7). It's the kind of relationship that doesn't allow you to go off and do your own thing. It requires us to be 'peace-makers who go on quietly sowing for a harvest of righteousness - in other people and in themselves.' (James 3:18 PHPS) It calls for a long-term commitment not readily understood by the 'me generation' where, when the going gets tough, it's acceptable to bail out of a relationship and move on. Tom Sabens points out that the world doesn't understand the Christian concept of brotherhood and sisterhood: 'It says find friends among like-minded, like-income people who vote like you and have the same golf handicap. These friendships work until the bottom falls out of your life, you face a pressing problem, or a tragic loss, or a serious illness, and suddenly you realise that no one cares much about you. Why? Because you've made no investment in anybody's life, and now when you need to make a withdrawal there's no money in the friendship bank.' Sacrificial love is the foundation of true friendship. Paul writes, 'I have no one else like Timothy, who genuinely cares about your welfare. All the others care only for themselves...But you know how Timothy has proved himself.' (Philippians 2:20-22 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Being fully convinced that what He had promised He was also able to perform.' Romans 4:21 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The reason we don't turn to God more often is because at some basic and unconscious level we are not 'fully convinced' He is able and willing to move on our behalf. Being able to admit that to yourself is humbling; it's also the point at which you begin to deal with your lack of faith in God. Nothing in your life will change until you pray, 'Lord, help me. I say things with my lips that I don't follow through in my behaviour.' Once you begin to pray that way you can start walking through your Bible, rediscovering that 'God is able.' He's able to provide for you when you're in a wilderness. He's able to defeat the giants that stand in your way. He's able to go through fiery trials with you and bring you out unharmed. He's able to promote you when you've been overlooked or opposed. 'Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us.' (Ephesians 3:20 NKJV) Whatever it takes to own the words, 'God is able,' do it; otherwise you won't be able to pray with confidence. You'll make a few wishes on your knees, but you won't be able to persevere in prayer until you know in your heart of hearts that God is able - and that He's willing! Nothing is too difficult for Him. He's just waiting for you to recognise that, and come to Him in faith asking for help. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['We are God's masterpiece...' Ephesians 2:10 NLT<br /><br /><p>The fear of being nothing but a big zero can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. It works like this: When it's time to go for a job interview your fear kicks in and you think, 'I'll never impress them, I'll look stupid. They'll ask me questions I can't answer.' A mouse in a lion's den has better odds of success. So you fail miserably, and descend yet another level into the basement of self-defeat. Or consider the girl who's asked out on a date by a good looking guy. So good looking, that she wonders what he sees in her. She's sure that once he gets to know her, he will finish with her. So insecurity drives her to use the only tool she trusts, her body. She sleeps with him on the first date for fear there won't be a second, and she ends up feeling like the disposable woman she didn't want to become. The fear of insignificance creates the very result it dreads, and arrives at the very destination it tries to avoid. Stop! You're disagreeing with God! You're questioning His judgment and second-guessing His taste. His Word says He can't stop thinking about you. If you could count His thoughts of you, 'They would be more in number than the [grains of] sand.' (Psalm 139:18 NKJV) Why does God love you so much? For the same reason an artist loves his paintings. 'We are God's masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so that we can do the good things He planned for us long ago.' So when you get up each morning, look in the mirror and tell yourself, 'I matter, because God loves me!'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...You...promised...good things to your servant.' 2 Samuel 7:28 NIV<br /><br /><p>We strive each day to 'walk by faith, not by sight.' (2 Corinthians 5:7 NKJV) But it doesn't come easily. It takes a mind saturated in Scripture to make a faith choice when you're staring down the barrel of a situation that seems impossible. So how do you develop that kind of faith? For a relationship to thrive, both parties must invest time and energy into getting to know one other. Lasting connections are based on trust, and an intimate knowledge of the other person's habits and character. And it's the same with God. Over time, as you prove His faithfulness it becomes easier to let go of your fear and replace it with trust. Kristin Armstrong writes: 'Getting to know God means walking with Him, spending time in His Word, getting to know His spotless character and the countless examples of His unfailing love illustrated in His ironclad promises. It means praying, talking, sharing all the details of your life and the inner workings of your heart. He knows it all already, but He enjoys the intimacy of the conversation. And like any balanced relationship, we can't always be the one talking. We have to make time to listen, to come before the Lord and get quiet, by silencing the noise of our thoughts and the rush of our emotions.' Remember, the only place fear has to work is in the empty space where your faith should be. Fear is based on what you see and hear. Faith is based on knowing that God's Word is reliable, and that He has promised 'good things' to those who believe Him for them! </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Love covers over a multitude of sins.' 1 Peter 4:8 NIV<br /><br /><p>Are you struggling to bring up your children on your own? If so, teach them these three principles. As you do, they'll be reinforced in you. You'd be surprised how many instructors learn while they teach. So: (1) <i>Teach them how to love imperfect people.</i> Let them know that loving is a risk, but it's worth taking. Hearing you say that will help them to grow up and not become cynical because of what they've been through. Explain that when you love people, you must love what's good and accept what's still under construction. And it'll save them heartache if you teach them that sometimes we'll disappoint each other, and that God's remedy for this is, 'Love covers over a multitude of sins.' (2) <i>Tell them that the future can be better than the past.</i><i> </i>We are fuelled by the past, but fuel only works when it's combusted into another form. So allow the pain of the past to fuel your future with compassion, wisdom and hope. Many of the people we admire have experienced failure. This year's winner was last year's runner-up. So learn from your mistakes and seize the new day. Once you do that, '...All things are possible.' (Matthew 19:26 NKJV) (3) <i>Show them how to adapt to change.</i> When you get stuck in the past, it's always at the expense of the future. After the initial shock is over and your anger has subsided, start making plans. Draw closer to God and decide to live again. Don't get stuck in a stage that was just meant to be part of a process. This too shall pass - let it!</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Trying to become perfect by your own human effort?' Galatians 3:3 NLT<br /><br /><p>American columnist Ann Landers wrote, 'Rose-coloured glasses are never made in bifocals. Nobody wants to read the small print in dreams.' The small print in every dream is <i>reality</i>. You may fulfill your dream, but you won't do it perfectly. Looking back you'll say, 'If I knew then what I know now.' But if you could live all over again you'd probably say the same thing. The truth is the journey will take longer than you hoped. The obstacles will be more numerous than you thought. The disappointments will be greater than you expected. The lows will be lower than you imagined. The price will be higher than you anticipated. Stop expecting more than what's reasonable. Stop seeing minor mistakes as major catastrophes. To break free from perfectionism, Dr. Chris Thurman says: 'Humble yourself: repent of being so filled with pride that you think you're equal with God. Be reality focused: accept life as it is, not how you think it should be. Establish attainable goals: make them realistic and achievable in the here-and-now. Set reasonable time limits: instead of spending time struggling to do one thing perfectly, prioritise and dedicate a reasonable amount of time to each activity. In less-important areas, accept good-enough; not every job has to be (or can be) done exceptionally well. Lose the all-or-nothing thinking: not every situation is black and white - most contain shades of grey. Learn from your mistakes, then move on. Confess your shortcomings: acknowledging your weaknesses releases you from the pull of perfectionism. Find your worth in God: not in &quot;your own human effort&quot;, in what you do and how well you do it.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['We have different gifts, according to the grace given us...' Romans 12:6 NIV <br /><br /><p>One Christian writer says: 'When my friend had her first child she applied all her career talents to making a smooth transition into motherhood. She kept a rigid schedule, napped her son on time, planned time for grocery shopping, and always managed to have a nice dinner prepared by the time her husband got home. She kept up this façade till she could handle the stress no longer. Finally, she cracked. She left the house a mess, forgot to shower, never went to the supermarket, and when her husband came home she handed him the dirty baby...and declared the house a dinner-free zone! What did her husband do? He fell to his knees in an exaggerated &quot;Hallelujah!&quot; then spun his long-lost wife into a magnificent hug. &quot;You're back!&quot; he declared...Her gifts, apart from being a great wife, mum and businesswoman, are her sense of humour, her sass, her fun, and her authenticity...all the things her husband missed when her personality went on a postpartum hiatus.' If you're 'trying to become perfect by your own human effort' (Galatians 3:3 NLT), it's not going to happen! 'We have different gifts, according to the grace given us.' When you strive to be somebody other than the person God intended, you end up feeling angry, inadequate and frustrated. God purposely gifted us all in different areas. Once you realise that, you can start to minister from your particular area of giftedness. Remember, every one of us is a work-in-progress, so cut yourself some slack. Instead of trying to become perfect, begin to thank God for making you one-of-a-kind.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'I will set before my eyes no vile thing...' Psalm 101:3 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>Fearing the population growth of the Israelites, Pharaoh told the Hebrew midwives, 'When you help the Hebrew women in childbirth and observe them on the delivery stool, if it is a boy, kill him...' (Exodus 1:16 NIV) This word 'stool' is the same word that's used to describe a potter's wheel. If Satan can destroy you while you're still on the wheel, in the process of being formed, he's accomplished his goal. And today one of his strategies for destroying men and boys is pornography. David's affair with Bathsheba began with the words, 'From the roof he saw a woman bathing. The woman was very beautiful, and David sent someone [to get] her' (2 Samuel 11:2-3 NIV). Looking back on this painful chapter in his life, David wrote, 'I will walk in my house with a blameless heart. I will set before my eyes no vile thing.' According to the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, a man named Joe from Rockford, Illinois, ran a live internet sex site. Joe had a ten-year-old son. On his home computer Joe installed filtering software to limit what his son could do on the internet. Joe explained: 'It's not that I keep him sheltered, but my wife and I pay close attention to what he reads, what he watches on TV and what he does on the computer, because we have a responsibility to him to be the best parents we can.' What hypocrisy! Pornography is as addictive as any drug. It puts images on file that mould your mind - images the devil can replay and use to enslave you. So, don't go there!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...To go and be with Christ, which would be far better...' Philippians 1:23 NLT <br /><br /><p>No matter how much you enjoy where you are living at present, there's always a longing in your heart for the place you call 'home'. And how much more so for those who have been born again into God's redeemed family! The world has its beautiful shorelines and landscapes, but deep down we yearn, like Paul, for our heavenly Father, heavenly family and home. 'For to me, living means living for Christ, and dying is even better...I'm torn between two desires: I long to go and be with Christ, which would be far better for me.' (Philippians 1:21-23 NLT) Leaving this life to be with Christ, in Paul's judgment, 'is far better'. Far better than what? Anything else! Nothing here can compare with what awaits you there! '...No eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no mind has imagined what God has prepared for those who love Him...' (1 Corinthians 2:9 NLT) You ask, 'How will this transition happen to us?' At death, 'The dust [our body] returns to the ground it came from, and [our] spirit returns to God who gave it.' (Ecclesiastes 12:7 NIV) Our bodies will 'fall asleep in Christ.' (1 Corinthians 15:18) Our God-indwelled spirits return to His presence, delighting in 'the fullness of joy' and revelling in the 'pleasures forevermore' that are found in abundance at His right hand (Psalm 16:11). While we wait, anticipating our best days, Heaven's hosts rehearse for the drama of the ages, the awesome return of Christ as we accompany Him in our glorified bodies! We say, '...Come, Lord Jesus.' (Revelation 22:20 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['In everything give thanks...' 1 Thessalonians 5:18 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Author Barbara Johnson was frazzled; she was running late, and on the bus to work she had to stand. Her attitude was going downhill fast when a cheery voice from the front of the bus announced, 'Beautiful day, isn't it?' She couldn't see the man, but she listened to his commentary as he described the lovely scenery...this church...that park...a cemetery...a firehouse. His grateful attitude lightened the mood of everybody around him. Then as Johnson got off the bus she caught a glimpse of the speaker: an average-looking man wearing dark glasses and carrying a white stick! Paul said, 'In everything give thanks, for this is the will of God.' We don't thank God for trials, we thank Him in them. Gratitude is like a boomerang. It blesses the recipient, enables a 180-degree turn and blesses the person who gives thanks. Whatever the crisis in your life, God is prepared for it and has made sure you are equipped to endure it. Many other people have experienced exactly what you're going through. Some have made it through victoriously. No matter what the temptation God promised to '...make a way to escape, that you may be able to bear it.' (1 Corinthians 10:13 NKJV)  Every trial has its escape route. They are inseparable. But the devil doesn't want you to know that. Every time you're in the middle of a test, he insists there's no way out. So when the devil is really on your case, piling on the pressure, that's an indication the way of escape is close at hand. We need to do what God says: <i>rejoice</i>! Remember: '...The joy of the Lord is your strength.' (Nehemiah 8:10 NKJV) When you continue to give thanks and have His joy, it gives you strength for the journey.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...You will not grieve like people who have no hope.' 1 Thessalonians 4:13 NLT<br /><br /><p>Our culture makes death a subject to avoid or to speak of with gloom. When the subject comes up, even Christians try to dodge the bullet by escaping into vague, irrelevant-sounding metaphors. But God's Word makes death clear and unthreatening for those who trust in Christ. 'Dear brothers and sisters, we want you to know what will happen to the believers who have died, so you will not grieve like people who have no hope.' God's Word is direct, concrete, and encouraging on this subject. 'Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His [godly ones].' (Psalm 116:15 NKJV) From our heavenly Father's perspective, death just opens the door for Him to enjoy perfect, eternal, delightful fellowship with each of His redeemed children. 'I heard a voice from Heaven say, &quot;Write: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; says the Spirit, &quot;they will rest from their labour, for their deeds will follow them.&quot;' (Revelation 14:13 NIV) The Bible assures every believer that their death is not a tragedy but a triumphal entry into Heaven. The Amplified Bible puts it: 'Blessed (happy, to be envied).' God instructed John, 'Write this.' Why? Because God understands that when we lose a loved one we tend to forget His perspective and adopt an emotion-driven perspective. Rejoice, believer, '...Whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord.' (Romans 14:8 NIV) And the Lord takes good care of what belongs to Him!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...God will bring back with [Jesus] the believers who have died.' 1 Thessalonians 4:14 NLT<br /><br /><p>Dealing with death separates us into two categories: the hopeless and the hopeful. The hopeless believe that they have nothing to look forward to. Their losses feel permanent - the end of life and all that's good. But the hopeful have everything to look forward to. Their losses are temporary - the beginning of an endless life filled with God's finest gifts. God wants you 'to know what will happen to the believers who have died so [you] will not grieve like people who have no hope.' (1 Thessalonians 4:13 NLT) Our hope results from knowing these truths:</p>
<p>(1) '<i>We believe that Jesus died and was raised to life again.</i>' (1 Thessalonians 4:14 NLT) All hope begins here: believing in Jesus' death for our sin and His resurrection to represent us before God. (2) <i>Since we believe this, we also believe that...Jesus returns</i>. Faith in Christ's physical return to earth gives us confidence that 'God will bring back with Him the believers who have died.' God will raise us from our resting places and bring us back again with Jesus (Romans 8:11). At that moment, 'He will take our weak mortal bodies and change them into glorious bodies like His own...' (Philippians 3:21 NLT) Never again will you be vulnerable to cancer, diabetes, heart disease, arthritis, strokes, Lou Gehrig's disease, paralysis, disabilities, weariness, weakness, grief, fear, depression, temptation, addictions, failure, remorse, suicidal thoughts, bipolar disorder, OCD or PTSD or any kind of ailment. You'll be transformed into the very likeness of Christ. Isn't that wonderful?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['We tell you this directly from the Lord...' 1 Thessalonians 4:15 NLT<br /><br /><p>What Paul wrote about death, he heard straight from the Lord: 'We tell you this directly from the Lord: We who are still living when the Lord returns will not meet Him ahead of those who have died.' The Lord reserves this high privilege exclusively for those who die in Him; they will be the first to experience the resurrection. Try to imagine that moment. Arising from their rest like we do after a good night's sleep, now dressed in Christ-like bodies, they awake to the sight of their Lord returning in glory with His angels. They meet Him - the first believers to witness His return, the initial wing of His airborne vanguard to escort Him back to earth. This is no pipe dream or mere fantasy; Paul got it 'directly from the Lord'. Our source is flawless! He writes: (1) 'Together with them, we who are still alive...will be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air...' (1 Thessalonians 4:17 NLT) Living believers will rise to join with resurrected brothers, sisters, parents, grandparents, children, grandchildren, spouses, friends, family of God never-met-before, in a spectacular mid-air reunion with Christ. We'll be together, inseparable, eternal, one international, multicultural, love-based, Christ-centred family! (2) '...Then we will be with the Lord forever.' (1 Thessalonians 4:17 NLT) No speculating or imagining what He's really like. '...For we will see Him as He really is.' (1 John 3:2 NLT) We will see, touch and talk with Jesus as we do each other. And He will respond to us in real time! (3) 'Encourage each other with these words.' (1 Thessalonians 4:18 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...see that you also excel in this grace of giving.' 2 Corinthians 8:7 NIV<br /><br /><p>Paul tells the Corinthians: '...see that you also excel in this grace of giving.' (2 Corinthians 8:7 NIV) Then he challenges them with the example of the givers in Macedonia: '...we must tell you about the grace...given to the Macedonian churches. Somehow, in most difficult circumstances, their joy and the fact of being down to their last penny themselves, produced a magnificent concern for other people... they were willing to give to the limit of their means...without the slightest urging from me or anyone else. In fact they simply begged us to accept their gifts and so let them share the honours of supporting their brothers in Christ. Nor was their gift...a mere cash payment. Instead they made a complete dedication of themselves first to the Lord and then to us, as God's appointed ministers.' (2 Corinthians 8:1-5 PHPS) Notice, the Macedonian givers: (1) <i>First gave themselves to the Lord, without reservation</i>. (2) <i>Understood that everything they possessed was through God's grace alone</i>. Paul said that the way he knew the Macedonians had given themselves to the Lord, was that they begged him for the offering plate. Wow! When was the last time you sat in church, anxiously waiting for the offering to be taken because you couldn't wait to give? This is not giving because the minister is begging, or the ministry will go under, or you feel guilty, or you're trying to broker a deal with God. No, this is giving out of the overflow of God's goodness to you. This is true giving!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...see that you also excel in this grace of giving.' 2 Corinthians 8:7 NIV<br /><br /><p>Our giving should be regulated and motivated by gratitude for what Christ has done for us. Paul writes: '...though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, so that you through His poverty might become rich.' (2 Corinthians 8:9 NIV) Understanding how gracious and generous God is to us is important, because some of us give Him our leftovers; if we've anything left after we've paid our bills and done everything we wanted to do, we'll give. But even if we give God a million dollars, if it's out of our leftovers, have we given Him our best? (Malachi 1:6-14) Some people are 're-givers'. Re-givers receive a present they don't want, wrap it up and give it to someone else. Some folks have whole wardrobes full of these kinds of gifts. That's how some of us approach giving to God - and it's an insult! In the New Testament you don't see preachers begging, selling stuff or using gimmicks to raise money for God's work. What you see is people like the Macedonians responding to God's grace because they understood and loved the God they served. Everything God created was meant to give. He created the sun to give light during the day and the moon and stars during the night. He created flowers to give seeds. God Himself is a giver: 'For God so loved the world, that He gave...' (John 3:16 KJV) When you understand grace, circumstances take a back seat. Your giving is not determined by your debt-to-income ratios, financial indexes, leading economic indicators or tax code. No, your giving is motivated by God's grace!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The tongue of the wise promotes health.' Proverbs 12:18 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Matthew Henry describes grace as 'salt that seasons' our words and 'keeps them from corrupting'. Salt has two primary purposes: it preserves, and it adds flavour. So when the Bible says your words should be 'seasoned with salt' (Colossians 4:6 NIV), it means they should preserve and not corrupt, always be in good taste, and promote wellbeing. James the apostle says, 'You can't draw fresh water from a salty spring.' (James 3:12 NLT) In other words you can't fake what's in your heart. It's not just a question of learning to say the right things; it's about having a right attitude, because what you say reflects 'the things that are in [your] heart.' (Matthew 12:34 NCV) Solomon says, 'There is one who speaks like the piercings of a sword, but the tongue of the wise promotes health.' (Proverbs 12:18 NKJV) Unless you are careful, you can end up talking yourself and the people around you into all kinds of problems. Mark Brazee says: 'We have the ability to speak words of faith, which cause miracles to manifest...Faith is a law and we operate in it with our words, either to our benefit or our destruction...&quot;The tongue of the wise promotes health.&quot; We could turn that around and say, &quot;The tongue of the unwise promotes sickness.&quot; It's your choice. You can line up your mouth and heart with what the devil tells you, or you can operate in faith by lining your mouth and heart up with God's Word, pointing towards His blessings. Faith works by believing and saying what God says.' So begin to speak words of healing.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Be careful to do what is right...' Romans 12:17 NIV<br /><br /><p>Jeremiah writes, 'Like a partridge that hatches eggs it did not lay is the man who gains riches by unjust means...in the end he will prove to be a fool.' (Jeremiah 17:11 NIV) Don't think that you can do whatever you like in small things, and be ok as long as you've no major lapses. Whether you steal ten cents or a million dollars, you're still a thief. The Oxford Dictionary defines integrity as - <i>honesty</i>. Every time you break a moral principle it becomes harder, not easier, to act with integrity. Everything you've done in the past, including the things you've neglected to do, comes to a head when you're under pressure. That's why developing integrity requires constant vigilance. John Morley observed, 'No man can climb out beyond the limitations of his own character.' And that's particularly true when you're a leader. So: (1) <i>Keep your promises.</i> When you make a promise you create hope. When you keep a promise you create trust. (2) <i>Acknowledge your mistakes</i>. When your decisions don't turn out the way you intended, you owe people an explanation. (3) <i>Apologise and try to make amends.</i> When your actions hurt others, you need to admit that what you did was wrong and say you're sorry. This is usually very painful in the moment. But not only is it the right thing to do, it can actually shorten the agony and help you to put the incident behind you. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Care for the flock that God has entrusted to you...' 1 Peter 5:2 NLT<br /><br /><p>Projecting too far ahead can keep you from devoting your energy to the task at hand. The Bible says, 'Care for the flock that God has entrusted to you...And when the Great Shepherd appears, you will receive a crown of...glory.' (1 Peter 5:2-4 NLT) Terry Nance says: 'There was a time when God began to do great things in my life...it was the fulfillment of many dreams...During this period I started experiencing more problems and confrontations...I felt like a fireman. As soon as one blaze was extinguished, another cropped up...I felt run down and discouraged. I thought, &quot;I'll go to the mission field where the work is fun and I can just send back postcards.&quot; Then I saw a vision of David being anointed by Samuel, and the Lord asked me, &quot;What did David do after he was anointed king?&quot;...I answered, &quot;He went back to tending his father's sheep.&quot; (1 Samuel 17:15) The Lord continued, &quot;Had David gone looking for a giant to kill at that time, the lion and the bear would have eaten his flock. This Bible school is your flock, so tend to it.&quot;...Whether you're a pastor, an associate, a music director, or a layman, each of us has a flock...David's flock was his assignment from God, and...although he'd been anointed king...his first priority was to tend to his first assignment. The giants will come, and if you stay with your assignment, at the right time you'll meet and conquer yours. You'll be exalted - after you've proved yourself faithful.' Wherever your 'flock' is right now, that's where God expects you to be. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...Do not walk in the way of evil.' Proverbs 4:14 NKJV<br /><br /></p>
<p>Every path you take in life leads to somewhere. The Bible says, 'Do not enter the path of the wicked, and do not walk in the way of evil. Avoid it, do not travel on it; turn away from it.' (Proverbs 4:14-15 NKJV) Today our children are getting hooked on drugs - some so powerful that it takes just one hit and they are addicted. So talk to your children early in life about the traps that Satan has set for them. Let them know that: (1) any habit you feed always grows stronger; (2) any habit you feed always demands more; (3) any habit you feed always takes control of you.</p>
<p>Comedian and actor Chris Farley was found dead in his downtown Chicago apartment on 18 December 1997. He died of a drug overdose. His death at age 33 was no surprise to his friends. He had been in and out of various rehabs to clean up his life. Shortly before his death he told a reporter: 'I used to think that you could get to a level of success where the laws of the universe didn't apply. But they do. It's still &quot;life on life's terms&quot;, not on movie-star terms. I still have to work at relationships. I still have to work on my weight, and some of my other demons. Once I thought that if I had enough money in the bank, if I had enough fame, everything would be all right. But I'm a human being like everyone else. I'm not exempt.' So before you step onto the path, stop and ask yourself, 'Where does this path lead?'</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...He knew what was in a man.' John 2:25 NIV<br /><br /><p></p>
<p>Here are three areas in which you must learn to have realistic expectations: (1) <i>You must have realistic expectations of yourself</i> When you do things poorly you usually feel bad. That sets in motion a neverending cycle of reaching for things that are out of reach, hoping to prove something you don't have to prove in the first place. You think you should be able to do what others do, yet if you are not similarly gifted you cannot excel in it. You don't need to prove anything! Just obey God, and allow Him to take care of your reputation. As long as you expect to excel outside your gifting and calling, you will always end up disappointed. (2) <i>You must have realistic expectations in your relationships with others</i>. To make yourself responsible for someone else's happiness, or them for yours, leads to a life of frustration. Abraham Lincoln said, 'Most people are about as happy as they make up their minds to be.' If people don't have the right outlook in life, you, and a hundred others like you, won't make them happy. (3) <i>You must have realistic expectations concerning life</i> Jesus said, '..._GoBack_GoBackIn the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world' (John 16:33 NKJV). As long as you're in this world you'll have problems. Nobody gets a free pass. But don't worry; the Lord's got everything under control. Just learn to be realistic. You will always have to deal with unpleasant situations, stubborn problems and difficult people. But your attitude (not theirs) is what determines whether or not you enjoy life.</p>

<title><![CDATA[The Power of Forgiveness (1)]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[the-power-of-forgiveness-1]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Forgiving each other, just as...God forgave you.' Ephesians 4:32 NIV<br /><br /><p>The power of forgiveness is an awesome thing. No relationship can survive without it, much less thrive. Whatever the issue, forgiveness sets both sides free, takes a weapon out of Satan's hands, and opens the door for God to go to work in the situation. This is never more so than in your family. The truth is, it's easier to forgive an enemy you seldom see than a loved one you have to live with every day. But you must do it. A seventeenth century clergyman said, 'He who cannot forgive others, breaks the bridge over which he must pass himself.' Paul writes: '...Clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. Bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances you may have against one another. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. And over all these virtues put on love...' (Colossians 3:12-14 NIV) Teach your children how to forgive. If you expose them to your anger, make sure that they're also around when you show grace. Teach them how to deal with the issue, without attacking the person. Let them know that a difference of opinion can lead to a decision that makes things better for everyone, and that as a family member you can be 'wrong' and still be treated right. This may mean teaching them things you were never taught. If so, learn from your parents' mistakes and don't pass them on to your children. '...Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry, and do not give the devil a foothold.' (Ephesians 4:26-27 NIV) In other words, forgive when you are hurt, and don't take your resentments to bed. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Forgive whatever grievances you may have against one another...' Colossians 3:13 NIV<br /><br /><p>In <i>Restoring Your Spiritual Passion</i>, Gordon MacDonald writes: 'One memory that burns deep within is that of a plane flight on which I was headed toward a meeting that would determine a major decision in my ministry. I knew I was in desperate need of a spiritual passion that would provide wisdom and submission to God's purposes. But the passion was missing because I was steeped in resentment toward a colleague. For days I had tried everything to rid myself of vindictive thoughts toward that person. But try as I might, I would even wake in the night thinking of ways to subtly get back at him. I wanted to embarrass him for what he had done, to damage his credibility before his peers. My resentment was beginning to dominate me, and on that plane trip I came to a realisation of how bad things really were... As the plane entered the landing pattern, I found myself crying silently to God for the power both to forgive and to experience liberation from my poisoned spirit. Suddenly it was as if an invisible knife cut a hole in my chest and I literally felt a thick substance oozing from within. Moments later I felt as if I'd been flushed out. I'd lost negative spiritual weight, the kind I needed to lose. I was free. I fairly bounced off that plane and soon entered a meeting that did in fact change the entire direction of my life.' Forgiveness: (1) Frees you from the grip of a negative force. (2) Positions you where God can bless you. (3) Teaches little people how to be big people.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The boat was now in the middle of the sea, tossed by the waves...' Matthew 14:24 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Jesus had accompanied His disciples in a previous storm and calmed it. But now He was up on a mountain praying, and they were alone, 'tossed by the waves'. Why? Because sometimes the teacher has to step back in order to see how much the pupil has learned. Is that what's happening in your life at the moment? The Sea of Galilee is only about 21 km long and 12 km wide. But when the wind sweeps down from the Golan Heights it can churn those waters into a blender for two or three days, and it could sink a fishing boat like the one the disciples were in. Note the words, 'tossed by the waves'. Is that where you are today? In the middle of a divorce, tossed by guilt? In the middle of a home foreclosure, harangued by creditors? In the middle of an illness, tossed by pain, and an even more painful prognosis? 'Now in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea. And when the disciples saw Him...they were troubled, saying, &quot;It is a ghost!&quot; And they cried out for fear. But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, &quot;Be of good cheer! It is I; do not be afraid.&quot;' (Matthew 14:25-27 NKJV) Here are words worth writing down and recalling often: '...Take courage. I am here!' (Matthew 14:27 NLT) You will never go where Jesus cannot reach you. Look over your shoulder; that's Him following you. Look into the storm; that's Him coming toward you. Today, open your eyes and recognise Him.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Jesus...went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil.' Acts 10:38 NKJV <br /><br /><p>The Bible says: 'Peter answered Him and said, &quot;Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water.&quot; So He said, &quot;Come.&quot; And when Peter had come down out of the boat, he walked on the water to go to Jesus. But when he saw that the wind was boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink he cried out, saying, &quot;Lord, save me!&quot; And immediately Jesus stretched out His hand and caught him, and said to him, &quot;O you of little faith, why did you doubt?&quot; And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased. Then those who were in the boat came and worshipped Him, saying, &quot;Truly You are the Son of God.&quot;' (Matthew 14:28-33 NKJV) The main message for you in this story is - where to stare in a storm. We cannot choose whether or not storms come, but we can choose where we stare during a storm. When you are staring into the face of cancer, heart disease, or some other life-threatening illness, some of the first questions that come to mind are: 'Who is the doctor? What is his experience? Is he able? Is he available?' Yes, He is! Jesus' CV reads: 'God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him.' Note the word 'all'. He can meet all your needs. So keep your eyes on Jesus and draw strength from Him. The One who 'went about doing good and healing all' is on your side today. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['You will also declare a thing, and it will be established for you...' Job 22:28 NKJV<br /><br /><p>It's not what others say to you or about you that determines your future; it's what you say to yourself when others have finished speaking! The Bible says, 'Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it will eat its fruit.' (Proverbs 18:21 NKJV) You say, 'I'd love to have a better relationship but I'm afraid that if I make the first move and they don't respond, I'll feel rejected.' Or, 'I'd like to pursue my education but I'm afraid if I register for classes and can't do the work, I'll feel stupid.' These kinds of words become self-fulfilling prophecies. Until you replace your negative self-talk with faith-talk, you'll always live in fear. Your mind is like the womb of your spirit; it nurtures each seed you sow until the time of delivery. If you don't want what a seed will ultimately produce, you must stop sowing it, or feeding it. Your first step in breaking fear's hold over you is in recognising the self-talk that got you into trouble in the first place. This is not easy to do. It takes vigilance, self-awareness, discipline and scriptural reprogramming. But by changing your thoughts you'll begin to change your life. Job says, 'You will...declare a thing, and it will be established for you.' And the amazing part is - at times you may not feel like you believe the particular Scripture you're standing on! That's ok; your inner self accepts what it's consistently fed and begins to act accordingly. So starting today, serve an eviction notice to every negative thought that's holding you back and begin feeding your mind with God's Word.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...From one degree of glory to another...' 2 Corinthians 3:18 AMP<br /><br /><p>How would you describe someone who is spiritually mature? Leonard Wedel says: 'A mature person does not take himself too seriously...keeps himself alert in mind...does not always view with alarm every adverse situation that arises...Is too big to be little...never feels too great to do little things, and is never too proud to do humble things...never accepts either success or failure in themselves as permanent...is one who is able to control his or her impulses...is not afraid to make mistakes...has faith in themselves which becomes stronger as it is fortified by their faith in God.' So, measured by that standard, how well are you doing? Are you able to evaluate your progress, without getting discouraged or feeling condemned? Can you look at how far you still have to go, yet be able to appreciate and celebrate how far you have already come? The Bible says we are changed 'from one degree of glory to another'. Notice, spiritual maturity takes place by degrees. In small steps, not giant leaps. You must learn to live by God's Word, not by how you feel, for His Word states that as long as you believe, God is working in you. '...The Word of God...is effectually at work in you who believe [exercising its superhuman power in those who adhere to and trust in and rely on it].' (1 Thessalonians 2:13 AMP) There is a direct connection between your daily intake of God's Word and your maturity level. And the good news is: God hasn't left us to do it on our own. 'We...are being transformed...from glory to glory...by the Spirit...' (2 Corinthians 3:18 NKJV) </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...They gather gossip, and...spread it...' Psalms 41:6 NLT<br /><br /><p>A man is said to have approached Socrates one day to share some gossip. The wise philosopher asked, 'First, are you certain it's true? Second, is it something good? Third, is it something useful?' When the man said, 'Not really,' Socrates replied, 'Well, if it's not true, good or useful, why talk about it?' Gossip can feel like a form of intimacy, but it's actually a false bond motivated by the desire to diminish another person and make yourself look good. David said, 'They visit...as if they were my friends, but...they gather gossip, and...spread it...' Solomon said, 'Gossip separates...best...friends' (Proverbs 16:28 NLT), and it can cause you to lose 'your good reputation' (Proverbs 25:10 NLT). Kevin Miller says: 'A challenge in ministry is confidentiality - how open can you be? The following questions can help you decide: Are you telling someone who can do something about the problem by helping, or offering discipline or correction? Are you talking to someone wise enough to help you process your feelings and courageous enough to make you do the right thing by confronting the other person, or confessing where you're at fault? Is this news approved for sharing? Are you breaking a confidence, and if so, is it strictly because the person is endangering someone's life, including their own? Are you willing to divulge your source so it can be checked? When you say this, does it break your heart? Have you examined your own life and confessed where you've sinned in similar areas? Are you praying for the person? Would you be comfortable if someone was saying this about you?'</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Along unfamiliar paths I will guide them...' Isaiah 42:16 NIV<br /><br /><p>Change forces us out of our comfort zone and into the discomfort of the unfamiliar. And while it can turn your world upside down, it makes you face your greatest fears and deal with the things that steal your joy, peace, and confidence. Change can be your friend or foe, depending on how you use it. Running away turns it into an enemy; embracing and learning from it makes it one of your greatest allies. C. Neil Strait said: 'Change is always hardest for the man who's in a rut for he has scaled down his living to that which he can handle comfortably, and welcomes no change or challenge that would lift him up.' When you are facing the unknown, instead of automatically going into resistance mode, '...Fix your eyes on what lies before you...stay on the safe path.' (Proverbs 4:25-26 NLT) Ask yourself: What is God trying to teach me? How can I become stronger and wiser? What opportunities does it hold? John Mason says: 'Correction and change always result in fruit...One change makes way for the next, giving you the opportunity to grow. Every time you think you're ready to graduate from the school of experience, somebody thinks up a new course...If you can figure out when to stand firm and when to bend, you've got it made.' You don't have to fear what lies ahead. '...Along unfamiliar paths I will guide them; I will turn the darkness into light before them and make the rough places smooth...I will not forsake them.' God never closes a door without opening another one - but you must be willing to walk through it. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Can two walk together, unless they are agreed?' Amos 3:3 NKJV<br /><br /><p>A successful marriage is based on two things: 'finding' the right person, and 'becoming' the right person. And the second thing is harder than the first. Just because two people share the same bed and the same name, it doesn't guarantee harmony. Here are some practical suggestions based on the word E-V-A-L-U-A-T-E:</p>
<p><em>Enjoy</em>. Do you enjoy the same things? Maybe it's not a big deal now, but later when your husband is glued to the big match on TV and you want a little conversation, it will be. <em>Values</em>. The Bible asks, 'Can two walk together, unless they are agreed?' Are you able to agree on major issues such as intimacy, parenting, finances, in-laws, goals and your relationship with God? You may disagree over many things, but these are make-or-break issues. <em>Accessibility</em>. Are you both emotionally accessible, or is he the strong silent type who doesn't communicate - or understand your need to? <em>Love</em>. Do you really love each other? Not the Hollywood version but the kind that listens to your spouse's opinions and concerns, overlooks their faults and failings, values them and expresses itself through kindness? <em>Understanding</em>. As surely as God doesn't make two snowflakes alike, He doesn't make two people alike. So, can you understand and handle each other's differences? <em>Appreciation</em>. Your partner can't read your mind, so get into the habit of expressing your appreciation for one another. <em>Temperament</em>. If you're naturally upbeat but they're moody and introverted, you may have an oil-and-water mix. How will you handle this? <em>Environment</em>. If you're from different backgrounds, are you comfortable in the same social and spiritual settings? If you want a happy marriage, E-V-A-L-U-A-T-E these things.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Given to hospitality.' Romans 12:13 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Making others feel loved and valued is a hallmark of discipleship (John 13:34-35). Welcoming newcomers was important in the early church, and it's just as important today. Social customs may change, but God's Word doesn't. Jesus said, 'Anyone who receives you receives Me...' (Matthew 10:40 NLT) As a follower of Christ it's your job to make new people feel like part of 'the household of faith' (Galatians 6:10 NKJV). Established friendships within churches can easily become religious cliques where we smile and speak to newcomers, but spend all our time with a select group of people we already know. Most of us are satisfied with our existing circle of friends, so we need to be looking for ways to include others. People come to church hoping for love and acceptance, and if they don't find it within a short time they move on. So keep your spiritual antennae tuned to people who seem uncomfortable and out of place. Most people have had at least one negative experience in church, so they need some extra T.L.C. (Tender Loving Care). The Bible says, 'Carry each other's burdens...' (Galatians 6:2 NIV) Genuine warmth and caring attract people. First impressions count. Church should be a place where our love for people who are hurting is evident from the minute they walk in the door. And remember, God doesn't just use these relationships to meet the needs of those coming out of difficult situations - He uses them to mature us too. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['No matter how fast you run, you won't escape. No matter how strong you are, you will lose your strength...' Amos 2:14 CEV<br /><br /><p>Sorry, but problems don't magically solve themselves because you refuse to deal with them. Actually, they multiply, and 'no matter how fast you run, you will not escape.' Kristin Armstrong says: 'We become...adept at running...We try to flee from our pain, our past and our issues. The problem is, we can't run or hide or push things away forever. Eventually we'll tire...and have to slow down. And when we do, all our junk will come rolling behind...headed straight for us at top speed. All the time we've been fleeing, our junk has been snowballing...picking up size and momentum. If we aren't brave enough to face it when it's &quot;small,&quot; it'll run us over later. Now's the time to...deal with it...as fast and as strong as you are, you can't keep this up much longer.' So what problem are you running from today? What issues are causing you to 'lose your strength?' Make up your mind to stop right now and deal with them. 'Do not give the devil a foothold' (Ephesians 4:27 NIV) by spending one more day on the run. It doesn't matter how badly you've failed in the past, '...The blood of Jesus...cleanses us from all sin' (1John 1:7 NLT). Whether it's a stubborn habit, or someone you fear confronting, 'step up to the plate.' The thing that's chasing you will lose its power when you face it down in the name of Jesus. Paul says, '...Having done all...stand' (Ephesians 6:13 NKJV). And you do that through the power of God, not in your own strength. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Train up a child in the way he should go...' Proverbs 22:6 NKJV<br /><br /><p>A mathematics teacher, who agreed to babysit while her friend went shopping, left her this note: 'Dried tears 11 times...tied shoelaces 15 times...blew up balloons, five per child... warned children not to cross the street 26 times...children insisted on crossing the street 26 times. Number of Saturdays I'll volunteer to do this again - zero!'</p>
<p>The following <em>Beatitudes for Parents</em> were written nearly 50 years ago by Marion E. Kinneman when her daughters were raising her six grandsons. They're still spot-on! 'Blessed are those who make peace with spilled milk and mud, for of such is the kingdom of childhood. Blessed is the parent who engages not in the comparison of his child with others, for precious unto each is the rhythm of his own growth. Blessed are those who have learned to laugh, for it's the music of a child's world. Blessed and mature are those who without anger can say &quot;No,&quot; for comforting to a child is the security of firm decisions. Blessed is the gift of consistency, for it brings heart's-ease in childhood. Blessed are they who accept the awkwardness of growth, for they are aware of the choice between marred furnishings and damaged personalities. Blessed are the teachable, for knowledge brings understanding and understanding brings love. Blessed are the men and women, who in the midst of the unpromising mundane, give love, for they bestow the greatest of all gifts to each other, to their children, and, in an ever-widening circle, to their fellowmen.'</p>
<p>One successful entrepreneur said, 'I may be a self-made man, but the blueprints came from my mum and dad.' Bottom line: <em>Children learn from their parents. What are you teaching yours?</em></p>

<introtext><![CDATA[ 'The believers met together in the Temple every day...' Acts 2:46 NCV<br /><br /><p>It's estimated there are over half a billion practising Christians in the world. But the church wouldn't even exist today if it hadn't been for a small group of disciples who were sold on Christ. The things of God were not a part-time interest or a convenience-based commitment to those early Christians, but their highest priority. If you want to be serious about God, stop and reflect on what they took seriously. </p>
<p>They took church seriously. 'The believers met together in the Temple every day.' Question: Are you a hit-and-miss churchgoer? Do you get upset if the service exceeds an hour or the minister takes an extra ten minutes? Is once-a-week your limit? Not for these New Testament Christians! So what drew them? The temple's orchestra and choir? Cutting-edge media or youth programmes? Did they have more time and less responsibility than we have? No, everything about their life was harder, took longer and was less convenient. Yet their encounter with Jesus so transformed their priorities that, 'Every day they continued to meet...' (Acts 2:46 NIV) They hungered to gather in the presence of the Lord, believing His promise, 'Where two or three gather together as my followers, I am there among them.' (Matthew 18:20 NLT) Taking God seriously requires regular involvement with other Christians, experiencing this unique aspect of His presence, hearing His Word together, and encouraging one another (Hebrews 10:25). You need that special dimension of fellowship with God that happens only when His family gathers together with Him.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The believers met together...and shared everything...' Acts 2:44 NLT <br /><br /><p>Getting Serious about God (2)</p>
<p>They took fellowship seriously. We are more than a common-interest-based social club. We're a family: birth-children of our heavenly Father, blood relatives. The cross made it so. '...We have all been baptised into one body by one Spirit...' (1 Corinthians 12:13 NLT) Those early disciples valued their relationship. It went beyond merely singing hymns and hearing sermons. They 'met together...shared everything they had...sold their property and possessions and shared the money with those in need.' (Acts 2:44-45 NLT) Do we have such selfless love, caring enough to share everything we own with our brothers and sisters in need? How many of them shared what they had? 'All the believers.' How much did they share? 'Everything they had.' God's Word describes His church as a body. Its members exist individually but they can only function properly in connection with one another. Arms, hands, legs, shoulders etc. cannot live separately; they must be joined to a body with a head to accomplish their purpose. The early church survived incredible persecution and achieved amazing things. Why? Because they understood the need to value each other and to sacrifice personal interest for the sake of the whole. As isolated, self-reliant, self-promoting individuals they would have been destroyed by the overwhelming force of their enemies. As a believer, you may survive apart from the church, but you can't thrive. Your God-given potential will never be realised until you commit wholeheartedly to a local fellowship and invest yourself in serving God's vision for that church. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['All the believers devoted themselves to...prayer.' Acts 2:42 NLT <br /><br /><p>They took prayer seriously. The New Testament church was conceived in the womb of prayer. After ten days of united prayer in the upper room, 'Everyone present was filled with the Holy Spirit...' (Acts 2:4 NLT) What happened next? They launched a church that's still impacting the world after two thousand years. Did their prayer-life diminish once the church was established? Not in the least! 'All the believers devoted themselves...to prayer.' It remained a prayer-conditioned fellowship. It was born, bathed and brought to fruition in prayer. They bequeathed us the empowering biblical principle that nothing important and lasting happens without prayer. Today if you want to get a small crowd in church, call a prayer meeting! Question: How much do you pray? What makes you a stranger to the place of prayer? Is it the myth that prayer is hard work? It's not - if your priorities are right. Do you wear yourself out, worrying about things as though everything's up to you? Prayer will make the hard bits of your life easier, and more fruitful. Consistent prayer lifts you to a higher, positive place where you learn how to accomplish more while experiencing a deep peace of heart and soul. Jesus said: 'Come to Me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.' (Matthew 11:28-30 NIV) Seriously, can there be a better way to live?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let us not give up meeting together...' Hebrews 10:25 NIV <br /><br /><p>They took God's Word seriously. 'They spent their time learning the apostles' teaching...' (Acts 2:42 NCV) Researchers tell us that, today, personal Bible reading is less common among Christians than prayer. Instead of a Word from God that fortifies us for the challenges of the day, we've substituted exercise and cappuccino. Our Bible reading is confined to the pastor's Sunday sermon. The early disciples were so committed to the Word that they 'spent [invested, paid the price with] their time, learning [studying to understand and master] the apostles' teaching.' God's Word not only enabled them to withstand life's challenges, but when persecution made them fugitives, they took the Word with them and planted new churches around the world (Acts 8:4). Are you growing in God's Word so that it fortifies you against tough times and prepares you to influence your world for Christ? They took worship and praise seriously. 'They stayed continually at the temple, praising God.' (Luke 24:53 NIV) For many of us, the word 'worship' has come to mean the Sunday morning service - a place we attend rather than the voluntary act of devoted hearts glorifying God. Being a spectator at the Sunday service isn't worship. The New Testament believers understood David's instruction: 'Enter His gates with thanksgiving and His courts with praise...' (Psalm 100:4 NIV) Do you want to be a serious worshipper? Enter His presence focused exclusively on His goodness, and wholeheartedly express to Him your appreciation for all He is! </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I bear him witness that he has a great zeal...' Colossians 4:13 NKJV<br /><br /><p>John Wesley, founder of the Methodist Church, travelled 400,000 km on horseback, averaging 32 km a day for 40 years. He preached 40,000 sermons, produced 400 books, and knew ten languages. At 83, he was annoyed that he couldn't write more than 15 hours a day without his eyes hurting. And at 86, he was ashamed he couldn't preach more than twice a day. He complained in his diary of an increasing tendency to lie in bed until 5.30 a.m. One word described Wesley's life: <i>zeal</i>. Paul writes: 'Epaphras...greets you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God. For I bear him witness that he had a great zeal for you...' (Colossians 4:12-13 NKJV) We speak of 'getting up a head of steam'. It's the language of the locomotive. Steam is literally water turned to energy. Kate Eaton wrote in the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>: 'You may see it above your whistling tea kettle or on your bathroom mirror, but that's not it. Steam is the clear vapour between the hot water and the visible mist. As it forms at 100°C, it expands to take up much more space than its liquid state. This explosive expansion, harnessed in a giant locomotive, is what powered 250-tonne engines and enabled them to pull twenty or more railcars through the Blue Ridge Mountains, across the great plains and over the deserts to the west. It's a powerful force.' If you work for God, you must spend time with God, otherwise you'll run out of steam! </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['He...guided them in the wilderness...' Psalm 78:52 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The wilderness is a place where growth is difficult, water is scarce, and you plod on when there's no end in sight. You can have a wilderness experience anywhere: at a graveside, at the Job Centre, or in a divorce court. In the wilderness: (1) <i>There seems to be no way out</i>. In Scripture, the number forty represents struggle. Noah experienced storms for forty days. Moses spent forty years alone in the desert. Jesus was tempted by the Devil for forty days. (2) <i>You begin to think the worst</i>. The wilderness weakens your resolve. It makes you look for an easy way out. A troubled marriage can make you look the wrong way at somebody else's husband or wife. It's the breeding ground for dishonesty, depression, even pornography - things you normally wouldn't find appealing. 'Jesus...was led by the Spirit in the wilderness, where he was tempted by the devil...' (Luke 4:1-2 NLT) Notice: going face to face with the devil was God's idea. Jesus, the last Adam, came to succeed where the first Adam failed. 'Because one person disobeyed...many became sinners. But because one righteous person obeyed...many will be made righteous.' (Romans 5:19 NLT) Jesus overcame the devil by using God's Word. Three times He said to Satan, 'It is written.' (Luke 4:4, 8, 12 KJV) And God's Word is still your wilderness-survival guide. After using it, Jesus left the wilderness clothed in the power of God's Spirit, ready to launch His ministry. And God can do the same for you. 'He...guided them in the wilderness...He led them on safely, so that they did not fear...' (Psalm 78:52-53 NKJV) </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Do not be afraid...I am with you...' Acts 18:9-10 NIV<br /><br /><p>When Paul tried to share his new faith with his old friends, 'They opposed him.' (Acts 18:6 NKJV) It hurts to be rejected by those you love. It seems like Paul was so hurt by their rejection that God had to encourage him, saying, 'Do not be afraid...I am with you, and no one is going to...harm you.' Even when Paul reached out to some of the apostles, they were wary of him. They saw him as too Jewish to be Christian and too Christian to be Jewish. Throughout his ministry, Paul suffered disappointment and rejection at the hands of those he loved. But when people fail you it drives you into the arms of God. Being rejected by others can actually bring a greater intimacy with Him. When they stoned Paul and left him for dead, 'he got back up' and went on to greater things (Acts 14:19-20). Being rejected makes you lean on God like never before, because you've nowhere else to turn! In fact, at times like that, unless you hear from God, there's no other word of hope coming! When others reject you, God has a way of opening doors to new levels of blessing you'd otherwise miss. Your greatest spiritual growth will generally result from your greatest trials. The Psalmist wrote: 'You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies [vindication]: you anoint my head with oil [daily empowerment]; my cup runs over [greater blessing].' (Psalms 23:5 NKJV) The truth is, without some pain and opposition, you wouldn't get to sit at God's table and enjoy His best. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The world and all that is in it is Mine...' Psalm 50:12 NRS<br /><br /><p>The Bible says, '...God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being.' (Genesis 2:7 NKJV) Until then, we were just inanimate lumps of clay in human form. At that point God breathed into us two important things: </p>
<p>(1) <i>Imagination</i>. It distinguishes us from all other living creatures. It's what makes us capable of going to the moon, inventing the internet, having a dream, and worshipping our Creator. But even when God gives you a concept; you must work to make it a reality. God said, 'The world and all that is in it is Mine.' That means that when you get ready to build and you only have a few bricks, you can pray for more bricks and God will give them to you. It also means that instead of complaining about what you don't have, you look at what you do have, and what you can make of it with God's help. (2) <i>Freedom of choice</i>. God has empowered you with the ability to make the right choices and act on them. But even though God has given you this ability, don't try to go it alone. Jesus said, 'What is born of...[the physical is physical]; and what is born of the Spirit is spirit.' (John 3:6 AMP) Always depend on the Holy Spirit. He's called 'the Helper' for a reason (John 14:26 NKJV). Jesus promised His disciples, 'You shall receive power [ability, efficiency and might] when the Holy Spirit has come upon you...' (Acts 1:8 AMP) Imagination and freedom of choice - use them to glorify God. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['God created man in His own image...' Genesis 1:27 NIV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says: 'God created man in His own image...male and female He created them. God blessed them and said... &quot;Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over...every living creature that moves on the ground.&quot; Then God said, &quot;I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours...&quot;' (Genesis 1:27-29 NIV) God has given you everything required to succeed at whatever He's called you to do. But you must tap into your God-given creativity! The Bible says, 'Where there is no vision, the people perish.' (Proverbs 29:18 KJV) Every great accomplishment begins as a vision, and every God-given vision comes with the innate power to fulfil it. Others may be more educated and experienced, but they don't have a monopoly on creativity. The chances are, there's a 'God-idea' inside you right now that's just waiting to be released. By not tapping into it, you're settling for less than God wants you to have. Whatever you feel called to do - write, paint, preach, play a piano, build a business, nurse, teach - make the leap and do it. If you wait until you can do it perfectly or without criticism, you'll never do it! Walking on water begins with one step of faith. It also brings you closer to Jesus. You see, Jesus wasn't in the boat, He was out on the water saying to His disciples, 'Come.' (Matthew 14:29 NKJV) Only one of them did: Peter. And though he did it imperfectly, it changed his life. So don't be afraid, tap into your creativity and watch what happens. </p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['The plans of the diligent lead to profit...' Proverbs 21:5 NIV<br /><br /><p>In his book, <i>Thinking for a Change</i>, Dr. John Maxwell says, 'The right thought, plus the right people, in the right environment, at the right time, for the right reason, always produces the right result.' Let's take a minute and break those words down: (1) <i>The right thought</i>. Thinking produces ideas, and ideas have incredible power and potential. But every idea begins as a 'seed thought,' so you have to nurture and protect it. (2) <i>The right people</i>. When you expose the right idea to the right people, great things happen. In their company it blossoms and becomes infused with possibility. (3) <i>The right environment</i>. In the right environment thinking is valued, ideas flow freely, fresh eyes are welcome, changes are expected, questions are encouraged, egos are checked, ideas stimulate better ideas, and thinking generates teamwork. (4) <i>The right time</i>. The Emperor Hadrian said, 'To be right too soon, is to be wrong.' While still in the 'stretching' stage of an idea, present it without expectation, time frames, or rigidly defined goals. Why? Because if you try to implement your idea too early it may not survive. (5) <i>The right reason</i>. JP Morgan said, 'A man always has two reasons for doing anything: a good idea, and the real reason.' Motives matter - and selfish motives disqualify us. God only gets behind ideas that fulfil His purposes and demonstrate His love for others. Sometimes an idea becomes great when it partners with another idea; other times it excels just as it is. One thing is certain: as you stretch your thinking, you will discover that your thinking is stretching you.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Let my words and...thoughts be pleasing to You, Lord...' Psalm 19:14 CEV<br /><br /><p>Are you afraid to speak up in case you encounter disapproval? The Bible says, 'Fearing people is a dangerous trap...' (Proverbs 29:25 NLT) And fear is common among people-pleasers. Kristin Armstrong writes: 'A pleaser daughter is one who, at any age, still tries to please her parents. From report cards to parenting style...her decisions are coloured by the opinions of the people who raised her. But remember what Paul said, &quot;When I was a child...I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me.&quot; (1 Corinthians 13:11 NIV) A pleaser friend is one who can't say no. Resentment may build up, but she always turns up and takes care of things. What she considers love and loyalty are often exploited by others who seek reliance, co-dependency and caretaking. A pleaser employee consistently works long hours without compensation or appreciation, covers for others who don't pull their weight, and bites her tongue when her boss or colleagues take credit for her work. A pleaser wife is one who in her desire to be perfect...becomes an altered version of the woman her husband fell in love with. A pleaser mum fears the loss of her children's love. She's afraid to set boundaries, even though they create an atmosphere of comfort and respect. She equates discipline with division, and by depriving her children of rules she ends up missing out on the later-life friendship that's the [reward] of good parents.' The only thing you should be concerned about is making sure that your 'words and...thoughts' please God. In the end, His approval is the only thing that counts. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...My unfailing love for you will not be shaken...' Isaiah 54:10 NIV</p>
<p>Chinese missionary John Bentley distributed a book written by Max Lucado, entitled&amp;nbsp;<i>You Are Special</i>, to children who lived in a Chinese orphanage. In China, male children are favoured over female ones. Healthy babies outrank impaired ones. Indeed, children who cannot speak or hear stand little chance of a healthy, productive life. Every message of history and culture tells them, 'You don't matter.' The story in Lucado's book describes Punchinello, a wooden person in a village of wooden people. The villagers had the practice of sticking stars on achievers and dots on strugglers. Punchinello had so many dots that the people gave him dots for no reason at all. But when he met Eli, his maker, Eli affirmed him, telling him to disregard the opinions of others. 'I made you,' he explained, 'and I don't make mistakes.' Punchinello had never heard such words. When he did, his dots began to drop off. And when the children in the orphanage heard such words, their worlds began to change. John Bentley describes reading the story to these children and the incredible effect it had on each as they sat, glued to every word. 'When the idea came through in the reading that they were special, simply because they were made by a loving creator...every one started crying - including their teachers! It was wild.' Today open your Bible, get God's opinion of you and build your life on it; it's the only opinion that counts! '&quot;Though the mountains be shaken and the hills be removed, yet My unfailing love for you will not be shaken,&quot;...says the Lord.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Oh, that men would give thanks to the Lord...' Psalm 107:8 NKJV<br /><br /><p></p>
<p>The Psalmist writes, 'Oh, that men would give thanks to the Lord, for His goodness...' Notice the word 'would.' A thankful attitude is a choice you make regardless of the situation. You choose your attitude just like you choose the food you eat and the clothes you wear each day. And there's plenty to be grateful for. You say, 'Yes, but there's plenty to complain about too.' The point exactly - so you've a choice to make! Robinson Crusoe spent 27 years shipwrecked on an island. Here's part of his journal entry (paraphrased). Let's call his lists the Gripe list and the Gratitude list. Gripe: 'I'm stuck on this desert island without hope.' Gratitude: 'I wasn't drowned like the rest of my ship's company.' Gripe: 'I've no clothes.' Gratitude: 'I'm in a hot climate; if I had clothes I couldn't wear them.' Gripe: 'I've no way to protect myself from man or beast.' Gratitude: 'I see no wild beasts here to hurt me as I saw on the coast of Africa. What if I'd been shipwrecked there?' Gripe: 'I've nobody to talk to.' Gratitude: 'God sent the ship in near enough to the shore that I got out so many necessary things as will enable me to supply myself as long as I live.' That's powerful stuff! If you can grasp it and put it into practice, it'll keep you from becoming a member of the Old Testament wilderness club known as 'the murmurers'. Your attitude is simply the decision you make about how you're going to approach things. It isn't Disneyworld thinking to focus on the good things of life; it's wisdom!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['That...which we have heard...seen...touched...' 1 John 1:1 NIV<br /><br /><p>You can draw closer to the Lord if you really want to. You can have firsthand knowledge of Him. You don't have to settle for Sunday morning sound bites, secondhand information or a longdistance relationship. You can get 'up close and personal' with Him. John writes, 'That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked at and our hands have touched - this we proclaim concerning the Word of life.' Drawing closer to God calls for developing a greater awareness of His presence. This brings three great benefits: (1) <i>Friendship</i> No human being, no matter how wonderful, can be everything you need. But the Lord can. In Scripture He is described as a 'friend who sticks closer than a brother.' (Proverbs 18:24 NIV) He will stick by you through every season of life, the bad ones as well as the good ones. For decades the motto of the Marines has been 'Semper Fidelis,' which is Latin for 'Ever faithful.' Even when you're not faithful to God, He will be faithful to you. (2) <i>Compassion</i> As a young disciple, John wanted to call fire down from heaven on a town that refused overnight accommodation to Christ and His disciples (Luke 9:54). But after a lifetime of walking with Jesus he wrote, 'Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.' (1 John 4:8 NIV) (3) <i>Confidence</i> Whatever life throws at you, you can handle, confident in the strength of God. 'I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.' (Philippians 4:13 NKJV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother...' Genesis 2:24 NIV<br /><br /><p>You'll know you've succeeded as a parent when your children are able to leave you and go out and build a successful life on their own. You will never cut them off, but there comes a time when you must 'cut the apron strings' and let them stand on their own two feet. Remember, the children you are raising right now belonged to God before they belonged to you. 'The earth is the Lord's...and all who live in it.' (Psalm 24:1 NIV) You are a teacher, not an owner, and your opportunity to teach them is amazingly brief. Your children were born to 'leave', not stay. You can't control their ticking biological clock. Your job is to prepare them for leaving. For the next few days, let's talk about giving your child roots and wings. '<i>Roots</i>' Before fruit develops, roots must thrive. And healthy roots require healthy soil with the right elements for feeding and protecting plants. Roots also depend on attachment to the soil. There are two kinds of families. The first offers 'insecure attachment'. Their parentchild connection is ambiguous, ambivalent, indifferent or even neglectful, making kids feel emotionally unprotected, uncertain they're wanted and loved, though they desperately need both these things. Their children lack confidence, selfworth, emotional strength and the courage to take risks. The second offers 'secure attachment'. The parentchild connection is expressed and consistently reinforced. Even during necessary absences their children feel safe and securely attached. Such children become spiritually, socially and emotionally capable, with the selfworth and courage required to face the challenges life puts in their path.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother...' Genesis 2:24 NIV<br /><br /><p>On the journey from adolescence to adulthood, your children will experience insecurity, contradictions and mood swings. They will send you conflicting signals: needing closeness, yet distance; connection, yet independence, all at the same time. They will pull you in with one hand and push you away with the other. You must understand that your children still need to feel securely attached, even while they're distancing from you. When they push you away you must show maturity, remembering that it's not personal; it's just how they test their ability to become independent adults. Minutes, hours or days later they are your child again, wanting to be up close. It's the 'tugo'war' of parenting youngsters, and it will resolve itself the right way if you handle it with understanding. Above all, contain your hurt and anger. 'Fathers [mothers], do not...provoke [engage in contention, debate and strife] your children to anger [irritation, exasperation, embitterment].' (Ephesians 6:4 AMP) The worst outcome of frequent runins with your children is that it produces longterm discouragement in them. Long after the 'mopup', your child can 'lose heart' (Colossians 3:21 NAS), and have their 'spirit...broken.' (BBE) In some cases they give up trying altogether. In western cultures, girls hold onto the parentchild 'rope' longer than boys, generally distancing later and with less finality. Boys tend toward earlier, longerlasting distancing. When you deny your son or daughter the Godgiven need for gradual latitude, they'll disconnect farther and faster. Use wisdom, 'let out the rope' gradually and they'll learn adult skills and stay more closely connected. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother...' Genesis 2:24 NIV<br /><br /><p>The second gift you must give your child is '<i>wings</i>' They are born to fly, not stay in the nest. By becoming overly protective and stifling them in the name of &quot;responsible parenting&quot;, you'll end up losing them. Jesus said children are designed to leave and go out and build a home of their own. Their drive for freedom is Godgiven, not a sign of ingratitude, disrespect or rebellion. A good carpenter works with the grain, not against it. So what should you do? Before your child demands outright independence, teach them how to handle it wisely. Give them opportunities to prove their readiness, and as they demonstrate trustworthiness, increase their autonomy - and vice versa. Let them know that in life you don't inherit happiness, you earn it. Be flexible, but take charge. Let your child know they can't demand privileges like driving, dating and spending money - they have to prove themselves worthy. Help them see how they can earn increased autonomy, or lose it, and how they can earn it back. Make them responsible for their own freedom by letting them know that it's not a right or a gift, but a reward for showing maturity. A mother bird doesn't push her baby out of the nest until she knows it's ready to start flying. The gift of freedom to an unprepared child isn't 'wings', it's an invitation to catastrophe! Don't agree to autonomy until they've proven they can handle their agreedupon responsibility.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother...' Genesis 2:24 NIV<br /><br /><p>You can't always prevent your child from getting hurt. '...In this world you will have trouble...' (John 16:33 NIV) Either they'll get hurt and learn to deal with reality, or suffocate in your cocoon, never becoming mature - a hurt much sadder and much more painful and debilitating. What's involved in giving your child wings? (1) <i>Realise that without autonomy they</i><i>'</i><i>ll </i><i>never become healthy adults</i> This involves learning things like clear thinking, being responsible for their own decisions, learning from bad choices how to make better ones, being free to make mistakes and pay the price of learning, and experiencing what it means to grow up. (2) <i>Don</i><i>'</i><i>t treat their need for autonomy as evidence you</i><i>'</i><i>re failing as a parent</i>. Indeed, if they fail to distance, you should question your parenting style! Making them independent is Biblical and effective parenting. (3) <i>Don</i><i>'</i><i>t mistake t</i><i>heir distancing as a rejection of you.</i> It's not abandonment of you, it's advancement for them. It's not proof of ingratitude or selfishness and rebellion; it's their real-world opportunity to demonstrate your success as a parent. When they don't want to attend Uncle Bert's family reunion, don't tighten your grip to 'save the family from disintegrating'. The family relationship is meant to change and part of that is to disengage, like cells splitting off and multiplying. The Bible says we are to '...Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the earth.' (Genesis 9:1 NIV) They can't stay in the nest and fulfil their destiny. Release them, and then get a life of your own! That's your responsibility - not endless parenting. Let out the rope, trust God, and they'll be back to see their 'very cool' parents.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother...' Genesis 2:24 NIV<br /><br /><p>Healthy parenting calls for finding the right mix of autonomy with each of your children. Some children distance sooner, some later; some take small tentative steps, some leap confidently into the gap. There are no 'good' or 'bad' children when it comes to this, just more or less challenging ones. As a parent you discover by trial and error what works for you and your children. Criticising, controlling, threatening incarceration, preaching, shaming etc., are futile, counterproductive and a sign you have lost your grip. It will only increase their flight instinct, or make them feel insecure, as though no one is really at the helm. Pretending you have 'got it together' as a parent is a wellintentioned but costly game. Don't be intimidated by the idea of being honest and transparent with your children. It's less stressful for you both, and it's much more effective. Children know that they are imperfect - and they know you are too. So don't be afraid to say, 'I'm learning to parent growing children, like you're learning to be one. I need your help to be good at it, to discover what works for us both, and to help you be good at it too. Are you willing to be on the team and learn together?' That kind of honesty draws a positive response. It's also good rolemodelling, teaching them humility and cooperation. Coach and players should unite, focus on winning together and learning to improve, not on competing or dominating. Succeeding or failing as a family is all about learning and growing! </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['By your patience possess your souls.' Luke 21:19 NKJV<br /><br /><p>When God makes you wait for something longer than you want to, He's teaching you patience. Your emotions are like a wild horse - they need to be reined in. 'Patient endurance is what you need now, so that you will continue to do God's will. Then you will receive all that He has promised.' (Hebrews 10:36 NLT) Your impatience will just make you and everybody around you miserable, but it won't rush God. He works according to His own plan and timetable: '...In due season we shall reap...' (Galatians 6:9 KJV) 'Due season' is God's season, not yours. You're in a hurry, He isn't. He takes time to do things right. You may not know what He's doing, but He does. And that'll have to be good enough for you. God's timing seems to be His own business. He's never late, but He usually isn't early either. He takes every opportunity to develop in you the fruit of patience. But other fruits are being developed in you as well. There are several things that must arrive at the finish line at the same time in order for you to win the race. Developed potential, without character, doesn't glorify God. If you were to become a huge success and yet be arrogant and harsh with people, that wouldn't be pleasing to the Lord. So when you get ahead of yourself in one area, He gently but firmly blocks your progress in that area until the others catch up. You don't appreciate any of this while it's happening, it's later on you realise what a mess you'd have made if things had been done on your timetable instead of God's. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Anger resides in the lap of fools.' Ecclesiastes 7:9 NIV<br /><br /><p>The word 'anger' is just one letter short of the word 'danger.' When you lose control you risk losing other things as well, like the respect of others or the chance to find a constructive solution. Anger toward human suffering is not only appropriate; it's the catalyst for change. Paul writes, 'Be angry without sinning. Don't go to bed angry.' (Ephesians 4:26 GWT) There's a saying: 'Anger is the wind that blows out the lamp of the mind.' So: (1) <i>Before you react, take a walk</i> It burns off excess adrenaline and it's more effective than stewing. It also helps you to think more clearly and handle things in a way you won't regret. 'A quicktempered man does foolish things...' (Proverbs 14:17 NIV) (2) <i>Recognise the things you can</i><i>'</i><i>t control</i> You can't control other people's attitudes and actions, or unforeseen events such as cancelled flights and traffic jams. 'What should I do?' you ask. Count your blessings, particularly the fact that you have God, salvation, your health, your family, your job, and a car to get to it, etc. (3) <i>Be careful where you vent</i> It's one thing to be angry; it's another to 'sound off' at the wrong time. 'A fool gives full vent to his anger,11 but a wise man keeps himself under control.' (Proverbs 29:11 NIV) It's ok to share your feelings with those you trust and who are not the targets of your anger. But be careful, your words can come back and bite you! (4) <i>Keep your distance from angry people</i> The Bible says, '...do not associate with one easily angered.' (Proverbs 22:24 NIV) Anger, like joy and gratitude, is contagious, so keep your distance.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['My people have...forsaken...the...living water, and...dug...broken cisterns.' Jeremiah 2:13 NIV<br /><br /><p>It's easy to be content when things in life are going your way. But how often does that happen? The Bible says we are to practice being 'happy at any time in everything' (Philippians 4:12 NCV), because if you put your life on hold waiting for what you want to happen, you may be waiting a long time! Epicurus said, 'Don't spoil what you have, by desiring what you don't have. Remember that what you now have was the thing you once hoped for.' Three things constantly feed our discontentment: (1) <i>Greed</i>. When you dwell on what you don't have, you're not enjoying what God's already given you. Be satisfied! Setting goals is good, but stop focusing so hard on the end result and learn to rejoice in the Lord while you're on your way. (2) <i>Fear</i>. It wants you to run from something that's not chasing you. It's the enemy's way of (a) robbing you of peace and stability (b) tormenting you with the 'what ifs' (c) keeping you from trusting God. The Psalmist said, 'In God I trust; I will not be afraid. What can mortal man do to me?' (Psalm 56:4 NIV) (3) <i>Seeking satisfaction in the wrong places.</i> God said, 'My people have...forsaken...the...living water, and...dug...broken cisterns that cannot hold water.' It's said that we spend our first 50 years searching for security, and the rest of our lives looking for significance. But we don't have to. The hymn writer wrote, 'Now none but Christ can satisfy; no other name for me. There's love, life, and lasting joy, Lord Jesus found in Thee!' Are you searching for contentment? Try Jesus!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He will not forget how hard you have worked for Him...' Hebrews 6:10 NLT<br /><br /><p>Are you thinking, 'I do so much for others; now I just want a little appreciation in return'? But there doesn't seem to be any coming, so you feel unappreciated and taken for granted. Just two simple words, but oh how much they mean: 'Thank you!' Has it been a long time since you heard them? If so, understand this: others may fail to thank you, but your heavenly Father appreciates all that you do and all that you are. Your work may go uncelebrated, but it will not go unrewarded. God has put you exactly where He needs you. You are fulfilling His purpose every day. Once you accept that, you'll find joy and meaning in what you're doing. God is the reason - others are just the beneficiaries! Don't let someone else's response decide your level of joy. They may not notice, but God does. He observes every day and every detail of your life. 'God is not unjust. He will not forget how hard you have worked for Him and how you have shown your love to Him by caring for other believers, as you still do.' Paul writes, 'Whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord...' (Colossians 3:17 NIV) That's it - do it for Him! Why don't you pray this prayer: 'Lord, all that I do, I do for You. I know that You appreciate me; look at the blessings You've given me! So I will praise and honour You throughout this day with my thoughts, my words and my deeds. In Christ's name. Amen.'</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Above all...guard your heart...it is the wellspring of life.' Proverbs 4:23 NIV<br /><br /><p>Heart disease will kill you if you don't detect it and treat it in time. That is true -  physically and spiritually. It's why the Bible says, 'Above all...guard your heart, for it is the wellspring of life.' Wanting to look your best is commendable. It can enhance your sense of selfworth and improve your prospects in life. But it's a big mistake to dwell on your appearance and neglect your character. When all is said and done, '...Man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.' (1 Samuel 16:7 NIV) This is where the Bible comes into play. It's like a mirror; it shows you the condition of your heart at any given moment. So, how's your heart today? What kind of thoughts are you entertaining? Are you constantly comparing and resenting? Do you get easily upset? When you hear gossip do you silence it or spread it? Jesus said, 'Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.' (Matthew 5:8 KJV) In other words, when you start to see things God's way you'll act accordingly. If the water in the well is polluted it will make you sick. Indeed, if you drink enough, it can kill you. What's the point? Simply this: it's not enough to try to change your bad habits; you've got to go to the heart of your problem - which is the problem of your heart! The Psalmist realised this so he prayed, 'Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.' (Psalm 51:10 KJV) If you want God to prosper you, get your heart right.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...I consider everything a loss...compared to...' Philippians 3:8 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>Your dream will never be fulfilled unless you're willing to pay the price that comes with it. And that price is paid not once, but over a lifetime. First, <i>there</i><i>'</i><i>s the initial cost</i>. You will have to make personal and sometimes painful sacrifices. You may have to walk away from attractive options and valued relationships because they don't fit with God's plan for your life. Leaving things that have given you your security and your identity will require grit and grace that only God can provide. Paul's résumé included being '...of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews...a Pharisee.' (Philippians 3:5 NIV) Paul once had wealth and status. Scholars reckon that when he committed his life to Christ, as was customary, his friends and family would have held a funeral service and considered him 'dead' to them from that point forward. Paul's calling was to cover Asia with the Gospel and write half the New Testament. But great assignments call for great sacrifice. And Paul wasn't alone. 'By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh's daughter. He chose to be mistreated along with the people of God rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a short time. He regarded disgrace for the sake of Christ as of greater value than the treasures of Egypt, because he was looking ahead to his reward.' (Hebrews 11:24-26 NIV) So the questions are: Has God given you a dream? Do you have the faith and fortitude to fulfil it? Have you counted the cost and are you ready to pay it?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I have worked...been in prison...been flogged...' 2 Corinthians 11:23 NIV<br /><br /><p>Second, <i>there</i><i>'</i><i>s the ongoing cost</i> We all want what successful people have. The problem is we don't want to pay the price they paid initially, and continue to pay every day. Paul spells out the true story behind his success: '...I have worked much harder, been in prison more frequently, been flogged more severely, and been exposed to death again and again. Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one. Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked, I spent a night and a day in the open sea, I have been constantly on the move. I have been in danger from rivers, in danger from bandits, in danger from my own countrymen, in danger from Gentiles; in danger in the city, in danger in the country, in danger at sea; and in danger from false brothers. I have laboured and toiled and have often gone without sleep; I have known hunger and thirst and have often gone without food; I have been cold and naked. Besides everything else, I face daily the pressure of my concern for all the churches.' (2 Corinthians 11:2328 NIV) Most of us have a vague notion that someday we'll have to make sacrifices, but the price will have to be paid sooner than we think. Not expecting that, many of us become discouraged. Some of us table our dreams, putting them on hold. Others have abandoned them entirely. The question you must answer is: 'Twentyfive years from now, what will I wish I had done today?' That's the cost of a Godgiven dream.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I have suffered the loss of all things...' Philippians 3:8 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Stop and listen carefully to what some of the people around you are saying. Many of them express regret because they backed off from their dream of earlier years: a career not pursued, an opportunity left unseized, a relationship allowed to wither and die. Decades later, they come back to it and think more about it. But for some, it's too late. They can't achieve their dream at any price. For others, the dream is possible but the price is much higher. In his book, <i>Put Your D</i><i>ream to the Test</i> Dr. John Maxwell writes: 'Going after a dream is like climbing a mountain. We will never make it to the summit if we are carrying too much weight. As we enter each new phase of the climb, we face a decision. Do we take on more things to carry, lay down things that won't help us climb, exchange what we have for something else, or stop climbing altogether? Most people try to take too many things with them...when successful people climb, they let go of things or start changing them in order to reach a higher level...The payments required for reaching a dream never stop. The journey continues only if you keep paying the price. The higher you want to go, the more you must give up. The greater the price you pay, the greater the joy you feel when you finally reach your dream.' Someone said a task without a vision is drudgery. A vision without a task is daydreaming. But a task with a vision is the pathway to victory and achievement.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['My Presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.' Exodus 33:14 NIV<br /><br /><p>Unless you spend time in God's presence you will always have an underlying sense of insecurity. There are certain people we draw security from just by being around them; their presence and approach to life make us feel better. Likewise, when you need to be lifted and strengthened you must spend time with God. Being in His presence is like being in a room filled with perfume; you take the fragrance of it with you when you leave. Moses spent a great deal of time with God. He knew that without God's presence he wasn't worth two cents. Can you imagine being responsible for the daily care of two million people, getting them out of one country and into another - on foot? It's mindboggling. And as if that wasn't bad enough, the Israelites spent much of their time complaining about their lot in life and finding fault with Moses. When things went wrong, he was their favourite target. It was an ideal situation for losing your mind. But God told Moses, 'My Presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.' God can give you rest in the midst of trouble, and peace in the midst of conflict. That includes a difficult workplace, or a home that's in constant turmoil. God's presence can help you to show love in the face of mistreatment, and patience in times of stress. It can help you to bring positive change without a lot of words, and end up feeling good about the way you handled things. So spend time in God's presence today.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I try to find common ground...' 1 Corinthians 9:22 NLT<br /><br /><p>Tact is the knack of making a point without making an enemy. To win someone over, you must first do two things: (a) <i>understand them</i>; (b) <i>become comfortable with diversity</i>. Paul wrote, '...So I can bring them to Christ...I try to find common ground with everyone...' (1 Corinthians 9:2122 NLT) Paul wouldn't yield a millimetre when it came to the truth, but his strategy was always one of love. Whether he was speaking to Jews, Greeks, Romans or barbarians his message never varied. But his approach did. When people know you respect them you're more effective at helping them to change. Speaking to those who were willing to alienate someone over a fine point of theology, Paul writes, 'In Christ, there is no difference between [you]... You are all the same in Christ Jesus.' (Galatians 3:28 NCV) Just think, when the saints of the ages gather round God's throne to praise Him they will not only be from different continents and cultures, but different eras - the early church age and the space age. What a concert! But you won't enjoy it if you're so narrow that you only know one song, because they may not be singing that particular number over there. Some of God's choicest characters were culturally diverse, like Moses, an Israelite raised in an Egyptian household to prepare him for his destiny. Or Peter, who was prejudiced enough to think that God only blessed Jews until God set him straight saying, 'If I say someone's acceptable, don't you say they're not.' (Acts 10:15 paraphrased) Evidently Peter got the message, for he wrote later, 'Now that you have purified yourselves by obeying the truth...love one another deeply...' (1 Peter 1:22 NIV) So, learn to be tactful.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The sluggard craves and gets nothing, but the desires of the diligent are fully satisfied.' Proverbs 13:4 NIV<br /><br /><p>The word 'diligence' includes such qualities as hard work, honesty, persistence, and striving for excellence. The New Living Bible Translation puts it this way: 'Lazy people want much but get little, but those who work hard will prosper.' One expert says, 'Success doesn't come from being a hundred percent better than your competition, but from being one percent better in a hundred different ways.' Syndicated business columnist Dale Dauten says: 'If you want to be creative in your company, your career or your life, it all comes down to one easy step...the extra one. When you encounter a familiar plan, you just ask one question: &quot;What else could we do?&quot;' To succeed you'll have to do more - more than you may want, more than your competition, more than you think you're capable of. The poet William Arthur Ward said: 'I will do more than belong - I will participate. I will do more than care - I will help. I will do more than believe - I will practice. I will do more than be fair - I will be kind. I will do more than forgive - I will forget. I will do more than dream - I will work. I will do more than teach - I will inspire. I will do more than learn - I will enrich. I will do more than give - I will serve. I will do more than live - I will grow. I will do more than suffer - I will triumph.' You can't do whatever's easiest and still reach your goal. You must do more. You must do 'whatever it takes'.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He knew what was in a man.' John 2:25 NIV<br /><br /><p>Jesus saw the best in people and worked to bring it out. But He wasn't naïve; He understood human frailty. When people disappointed Him, He didn't retaliate in anger, or distance from them. What did He do? '...Many people saw the miraculous signs He was doing and believed in His name. But Jesus would not entrust Himself to them, for He knew all men. He did not need man's testimony about man, for He knew what was in a man.' (John 2:2325 NIV) Jesus constantly called people to a higher standard, but He understood that their best would still be imperfect. And you need to understand that about your loved ones too, and handle them accordingly. The perfect relationship, the perfect job, the perfect church and the perfect neighbourhood don't exist! God knows that, so He gave us instructions on how to deal with people who disappoint us: 'Bear (endure, carry) one another's burdens and troublesome moral faults, and in this way fulfil and observe...the law of Christ...' (Galatians 6:2 AMP) You say, 'What is the law of Christ?' Jesus said, 'I give you a new commandment...Just as I have loved you, so you too should love one another.' (John 13:34 AMP) To love as Jesus loved, you must love without condition and without pressure. It's easier to talk about how to treat the irritating people in your life than it is to do it. But the Lord never commands you to do something that He won't give you the grace to carry out. And the great thing is, in the process of carrying it out you become more like Him.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'My people will live in peaceful dwelling places...' Isaiah 32:18 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>Years ago stress was considered mostly a male problem, but not anymore. Women are experiencing the stress of pursuing perfection, looking a certain way, competing in the workplace, attempting to do it all, never saying no, and having no time for themselves. That's not how God wants you to live! 'The fruit of righteousness will be peace; the effect of righteousness will be quietness and confidence forever. My people will live in peaceful dwelling places, in secure homes, in undisturbed places of rest.' (Isaiah 32:17-18 NIV) So, (male or female) here are two practical suggestions for destressing: (1) <i>Allow yourself more time</i>. Since everything takes longer than you think, having enough time to complete the job reduces your anxiety greatly. Whenever you're under pressure, a good rule of thumb is to allow 20 percent more time than you think you'll need. (2) <i>Be content with less</i> A recent study of thousands of households found that those who maintained lifestyles beyond their means were more prone to stressrelated illnesses such as heart attack and depression. 'He who is greedy for gain troubles his own house...' (Proverbs 15:27 NKJV) You say, 'Does that mean God doesn't want me to get ahead in life?' No, He just wants you to keep your priorities straight and to learn to enjoy where you are, on your way to where you're going. If you're feeling stressed today, pray: 'Lord, I need to be renewed. This business of living has drained me. Thank You for ordaining quiet times and places of rest in the midst of hectic schedules. Help me always to put You first and to find my place of rest in You.'</p>

<title><![CDATA[Healing For Your Grief]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[healing-for-your-grief]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['He heals the brokenhearted...' Psalm 147:3 NIV<br /><br /><p>One of the most moving scenes in Scripture is Jesus weeping at the graveside of Lazarus. It's not that He was powerless to change the situation, which He did, but that He empathises with us in our time of loss. 'He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.' The Lord didn't promise to protect us from pain and loss, but to bring us through it. Perhaps these suggestions will help: (1) <i>Don</i><i>'</i><i>t isolate</i> Expand your 'family.' '...Better a neighbour than a brother far away.' (Proverbs 27:10 NIV) If you don't have family nearby, reach out to caring people who are close by. As part of a group you discover that you're not alone, that mourning isn't sickness or selfindulgence, and that sharing brings healing. (2) <i>Don</i><i>'</i><i>t deny your loss</i> 'The memory of the just is blessed...' (Proverbs 10:7 KJV) When you're around friends, don't hesitate to talk about your loss. When you do, you're saying it's ok for them to share their memories too. A burden shared is a burden lightened. (3) <i>Don</i><i>'</i><i>t try to do it all</i> 'There is a time to cry...' (Ecclesiastes 3:4 NCV) Because grief is draining, you'll need more rest than usual. So while your ability to function is reduced, let others help with the everyday stuff like cooking, cleaning and shopping until you feel stronger. (4) <i>Don</i><i>'</i><i>t neglect your legitimate needs</i> Respect your body by using the acronym D.E.E.R. (drink, eat, exercise, rest) to help you stay focused and set healthy boundaries. Nobody knows how you feel better than you, so give yourself permission to say, 'No thanks' or 'Some other time' without feeling guilty.</p>

<alias><![CDATA[covetousness-2]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['You shall not covet...' Exodus 20:17 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Why do we keep giving in to sinful desires? For two reasons: (1) <i>Because the new birth doesn</i><i>'</i><i>t automatically do away with the old nature</i> Like two cars approaching crossroads at the same time, your old and new natures are always on a collision course. (2) <i>Because if you dwell on a desire long enough, yielding is only a matter of time</i> Ever gone to your fridge when you weren't really hungry, but weren't really satisfied, sort of looking for something to grab you? As bad as that is, it's worse when you do it in life. It's like surfing the web of behaviour options, looking for something to make you happier than you are at that particular moment. When you covet something, you embellish and empower it, making it more attractive and accessible. A one-night stand? You say, 'Nobody will ever know.' The Bible says, 'Do not be deceived; God is not mocked: for whatever a man sows, that also will he reap.' (Galatians 6:7 NKJV) As surely as a seed produces a harvest, your decisions will have consequences. Covetousness just maximises the desire while minimising the danger. It's impossible to dwell on a desire for any length of time without rationalising a way to get it. Like starting the countdown on the space shuttle, it's just a matter of time before you get liftoff. So if you're dwelling on it, set the clock; yielding is inevitable. What's the answer? Change your focus! 'Those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.' (Romans 8:5 NKJV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['He gave them their request, but sent leanness into their soul.' Psalm 106:15 NKJV<br /><br /><p>See if you recognise this pattern. As slaves in Egypt the Israelites pray, 'God, get us out of here!' So He does. Then in the wilderness, on their way to the Promised Land they say, 'God, we're going to die out here. We were better off in Egypt. At least there, we had all the food we wanted.' So God sends bread from Heaven. He even delivers it to their door. It was a diet so perfect that '...there was not one feeble person among [them].' (Psalm 105:37 KJV) Did that make them happy? No! They said, 'We're tired of this stuff, we want some prime rib.' So God says ok, '[I'll] give you meat, and you will eat it...until it comes out of your nostrils and you loathe it...' (Numbers 11:1820 NIV) Covetousness angers God because it is rooted in pride that says, 'I deserve better,' and ingratitude that says, 'I want something other than what You've blessed me with.' The saying goes, 'Be careful what you wish for, you just might get it.' Because they thought something else could satisfy them in a way that God couldn't, 'He gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.' With God, you can be satisfied with very little. Without Him, all your acquisitions and accomplishments will leave you empty. What are you coveting? Putting your life on hold for? Continually begging God for? Nothing is essential but God. Material things can never take His place. What will it take for you to come to that settled place where the central desire of your life is, 'God, I just want more of You.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Be content with such things as you have...' Hebrews 13:5 NKJV<br /><br /><p>If your goals are Godcentred, He will help you to achieve them. But if you are asking Him for something just because your neighbour has it, you'll be disappointed. The Bible says, '...No good thing will He withhold from them that walk uprightly.' (Psalm 84:11 NAS) When God withholds something from you, trust Him; He knows what He's doing. God loves you too much to give you what you're not ready for, can't handle, doesn't fit into His plan for your life, or will end up draining your energies and maybe even destroying you. When you covet something, make it essential to your happiness, and beg God to give it to you, you're asking Him to replace Himself with something you consider more important. When you do this, God may allow you to experience the consequences Israel suffered. 'He gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.' (Psalm 106:15 NKJV) Don't reach the end of your life only to look back with regret on a shattered marriage, children who've gone astray, a blighted conscience or the pain of realising you missed out on God's best. Our problem is not that we don't want God; it's that we want God - plus - a house by the sea, an impressive career, a perfect spouse, or whatever catches our fancy. That's why Jesus said, '...Take heed and beware of covetousness, for one's life does not consist in the abundance of the things he possesses.' (Luke 12:15 NKJV) Life is not built on things, it's built on relationships. And the first relationship you need to work on is your relationship with God.</p>

<alias><![CDATA[how-to-experience-gods-grace]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Grace be unto you, and peace, from God...' 1 Corinthians 1:3 KJV<br /><br /><p>Several of Paul's epistles open with the words, 'Grace be unto you, and peace, from God.' That's because you cannot experience God's peace unless you first know how to receive His grace and walk in it. There are three things about grace you need to understand: (a) <i>it cannot be earned</i>; (b) <i>it is God doing for you what you cannot do for yourself</i>; (c) <i>it doesn</i><i>'</i><i>t kick in until you stop struggling and trying to do it in your own strength</i>. The Bible says, '...God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.' (James 4:6 NIV) The 'humble' are those who admit their total inability to succeed without God's help, but the 'proud' are always trying to take the credit. They like to think it's their ability that gets the job done, so they've difficulty asking God for grace, and even more difficulty receiving it. Peter writes, 'Grow in grace...' (2 Peter 3:18 KJV) You only learn to trust God - by doing it! You grow in grace by taking God at His Word, counting on His gracious provision for each day, and His intervention in situations that are difficult or impossible for you. There will never be a day when you don't need God's grace. And if you are willing to acknowledge you need it and receive it by faith, there will be no shortage of it. 'For out of His fullness (abundance) we have all received [all had a share and we were all supplied with] one grace after another and spiritual blessing upon spiritual blessing and even favour upon favour and gift [heaped] upon gift.' (John 1:16 AMP)</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...We will find grace to help us when we need it most.' Hebrews 4:16 NLT<br /><br /><p>The Bible says, 'Let us come boldly to the throne of our gracious God. There we will receive His mercy, and we will find grace to help us when we need it most.' Most of us grew up being told, 'If you want something you'll have to work for it.' But a strong work ethic can skew our thinking when it comes to receiving what God wants to freely give us. God is always pouring out His blessing, and as empty, thirsty vessels we must learn to open our hearts to what He offers. To 'get' implies to obtain by our own effort. To 'receive' implies to accept what's being freely and graciously offered. Jesus came to deliver us from struggling, not invite us into a new way of struggling under the banner of Christianity. We need to realise that all of God's blessings are given because of grace, and received by faith. Joyce Meyer writes: 'I was always trying to &quot;do&quot; something, and leaving God out of the loop. I tried to change myself, my husband and children, tried to get healed...even make my ministry grow... But God will never permit us to succeed without Him. If He did, we would take all the credit. Finally I learned to pray for what I needed and allowed God to provide it His way, in His timing. When I did, I entered into His rest.' But in order to live this way you must realise your importance to God, and then learn to count on His grace. The truth is; He is more than willing to help you if you'll only let go of your independent attitude.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...His compassions...are new every morning...' Lamentations 3:22-23 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>Are you going through a hard time at the moment? You're not alone! Things were so bad in Israel that there's a whole book in the Bible, attributed to Jeremiah, called Lamentations. In a positive-thinking, feel-good world, that's not exactly a best-selling title. Jeremiah describes God's people as a 'widow' and a 'slave,' and says, 'All her friends have dealt treacherously with her; they have become her enemies.' (Lamentations 1:2 NKJV) As you move through the book verse by verse, things just keep going from bad to worse as God's people reap what they have sown. Then suddenly in the middle of all his lamenting, when you think things can't get any worse, Jeremiah writes, 'Because of the Lord's great love we are not consumed, for His compassions never fail. They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness.' (Lamentations 3:22-23 NIV) Isn't that wonderful? God's love, compassion and faithfulness have been placed in an account that cannot be overdrawn, that you don't have to contribute to, and that'll last as long as you live. In a world that doesn't seem to care, where only the fittest survive, that's good to know. Next time somebody says to you, 'What's new?' tell them, 'God's love, compassion, and faithfulness.' The dictionary defines <i>compassion</i> as 'tenderness of heart that disposes a person to overlook injuries or to treat an offender better than he or she deserves.' So when you wake up each day, be like the lady who prayed, 'Lord, I'm glad Your mercies are new every morning, because I definitely used up all of yesterday's.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Stand here awhile, that I may announce to you the Word of God.' 1 Samuel 9:27 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Here's an ancient Scripture with a modern message: 'As they were going down to...the city, Samuel said to Saul... &quot;Stand here awhile, that I may announce to you the Word of God.&quot;' Today we are told that in order to succeed we must hit the floor running at a hundred kilometres an hour, and keep it up until we collapse in bed at night. And what's the downside to all this? Our walk with the Lord slows to a crawl, or stops altogether. Our busyness leads to spiritual barrenness. Being part of the chase can be exciting and rewarding, but it leaves little or no time for God. And you don't have to be in business. Look at mothers with small children: every minute consumed by little people who pull at you, scribble on your walls and walk mud all over your floor, then have the nerve to wake you up in the middle of the night. If that's happening to you, you need to say: 'Time out! I refuse to put my spiritual life on autopilot, mouthing meaningless prayers and leafing through a Bible I neither study nor live by. I'm going to pay whatever price it takes to walk with God.' Doing that will not be easy. You'll have to start saying no to certain things, and run the risk of displeasing people. But it's the only way you'll be at peace with God and be in a position to hear what He's saying to you. Nobody ever said the Christian walk is easy, but is anything in the world of more lasting importance or more rewarding?</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['He is not here, but is risen!' Luke 24:6 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Christ, the founder of Christianity, was the only man capable of making an appointment beyond the grave and turning up to keep it. Jesus told His disciples, 'After I have been raised, I will go before you to Galilee.' (Matthew 26:32 NKJV) And He did. If you visit the graves of those who founded the great religions of the world, you will find that they are still occupied. But if you visit the grave where they laid Jesus, you will find that it is empty and the words of the angels still echoing, 'He is not here, but is risen!' Those words turn every Christian burial into a celebration. Jesus promised, 'Because I live, you will live also.' Eventually you will die of something; the question is: how can you die right? There are two correct answers to that question: (1)<i> By preparing in advance.</i> It was a truly human tombstone that bore the inscription, 'I expected this, but not just yet.' Here's how you prepare for death. 'If you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.' (Romans 10:9 NKJV) (2)<i> By fulfilling your life</i><i>'</i><i>s assignment.</i> Jesus said, 'I have glorified You on earth. I have finished the work which You have given Me to do.' (John 17:4 NKJV) In the final audit you will stand before God and He will ask you, 'What did you do with the gifts I gave you? Did you fulfil your assignment on earth?' In that moment, nothing will be more important than how you answer that question.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?' Matthew 27:46 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Imagine having to stand on a stage and watch every sin you've ever committed replayed for the entire world to see - your secret addictions, your selfish motives, your angry outbursts, your critical attitudes and your jealous heart. How do you think you'd feel? Well, Jesus experienced much worse. The Bible says: 'He...bore our sins in His own body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live for righteousness - by whose stripes you were healed.' (1 Peter 2:24 NKJV) It's bad enough to die for sins you didn't commit, but imagine being forsaken by God! It's the same word Paul used when he wrote: 'Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world...' (2 Timothy 4:10 NKJV) Paul looked for Demas and couldn't find him. And on the cross, Jesus looked for His Father and couldn't find Him either. Does that mean the Psalmist was wrong when he wrote in Psalm 37:25 NIV: '...I have never seen the righteous forsaken...'? No, because at that moment Jesus was anything but righteous. When you look at Him hanging there you will see the gossiper, the liar, the cheater, the alcoholic, the porn addict, the child abuser, the murderer. Does it bother you to see His name linked with theirs? Well, Jesus did even more. He put Himself in their place - and yours. In a move that broke God's heart and gave us the gift of eternal life, He poured out His righteous judgment on His only Son. So when Jesus cried from the cross, 'My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?' He said it so that you would never have to. What wondrous love.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['We believe that Jesus died and rose again...' 1 Thessalonians 4:14 NIV<br /><br /><p>The word 'resurrection' means 'the standing up of the dead'. Most religions teach the concept of immortality, but only the Christian faith teaches bodily resurrection. 'If we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.' The patriarch Job, whose children all died tragically in a single day, asked, 'If a man dies shall he live again?...' (Job 14:14 NKJV) We ask this when death claims someone we love. So God gave Job, and us, an answer that dries our tears, heals our broken hearts and focuses us on something greater than this temporal life with all its troubles: 'For I know that my Redeemer lives, and He shall stand at last on the earth; and after my skin is destroyed, this I know, that in my flesh I shall see God, whom I shall see for myself, and my eyes shall behold, and not another. How my heart yearns within me!' (Job 19:2527 NKJV) The next time you see a butterfly soaring, stop and remind yourself, 'That's like my future!' No matter how you dress your body up, at best it will always be a caterpillar. But when it emerges from the cocoon of death and rises to meet the Lord in the air, it will take on His beauty and His likeness. '...The dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord. Therefore comfort one another with these words.' (1 Thessalonians 4:1618 NKJV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...Breath came into them, and they lived, and stood upon their feet...' Ezekiel 37:10 NKJV<br /><br /></p>
<p>Your hopes may be dead and your dreams buried, but God can breathe into them again. Ezekiel stood in a valley of dead, dry bones. That's about as bad as it gets! Right? Then something amazing happened. God said to the prophet, 'Prophesy...and say... &quot;Thus says the Lord God: 'Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe on these slain, that they may live.'&quot; So I prophesied as He commanded me, and breath came into them, and they lived, and stood upon their feet, an exceedingly great army.' (Ezekiel 37:910 NKJV) Any time you see a man or woman enjoying great success in God's Kingdom, there's a good chance they've been through the valley of devastation, hurt and rejection. It was after he had been thrown out of the city, stoned and left for dead, that Paul spoke of being taken up into the third heaven and experiencing things too wonderful to speak of on earth (2 Corinthians 12:24). It was after John was exiled to a penal colony in Patmos that he penned the words, '...I was in the Spirit, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet.' (Revelation 1:10 NIV) As a result, he wrote the book of Revelation. The Psalmist said, 'In the day of trouble ...my head will be exalted above the enemies who surround me...I will sing...to the Lord.' (Psalm 27:56 NIV) That's how you 'glory in tribulation' and are then able to look back and say, 'Thank you for the experience, Lord. Without it I'd never have got to know You like I do today.'</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['God has...given us...a sound mind.' 2 Timothy 1:7 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says, 'God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.' In order to improve your life you must change two things: (1) <i>Your thought processes</i> Gordon MacDonald says: 'People who are out of shape mentally usually fall victim to ideas and systems that are destructive to the human spirit... They have not taught themselves how to think, nor have they set themselves to the lifelong pursuit of the growth of the mind...so they grow dependent upon the thoughts and opinions of others. Rather than deal with ideas and issues, they reduce themselves to lives filled with rules, regulations and programmes.' The moment you think you know it all, you've merely stopped thinking. (2) <i>Your expectations</i> The story's told of a man who went to a fortune teller. She said to him, 'You'll be poor and miserable until you're fifty.' The man asked her, 'What will happen then?' She replied, 'Then you'll get used to it.' Be honest; how many successful people do you know who are apathetic and negative? None! Faith produces excitement, commitment, energy - characteristics that help you achieve success. If you'd like to possess these qualities then raise your expectation level and bring it into alignment with God's promises. '...Whatever things you ask when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you will have them.' (Mark 11:24 NKJV) Do you want to succeed where you've failed before? To become the person you always hoped to be? Don't start by changing your actions, start by changing your mind. Renew it daily with God's Word. Nothing you do will have as great an impact.</p>

<alias><![CDATA[covetousness-1]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Let your conduct be without covetousness...' Hebrews 13:5 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Covetousness begins with craving, and then evolves into conniving to get what you want. Achan, Ahab, Ananias and Sapphira were willing to steal, lie or kill to get what they wanted. 'Let your conduct be without covetousness; be content with such things as you have. For He Himself has said, &quot;I will never leave you nor forsake you.&quot;' This Scripture means that what you have in Christ is greater than whatever else you don't have! Covetousness is: (1) <i>Wanting status but not wanting to serve;</i><i> wanting control so that you can be at the centre; wanting wealth strictly for yourself; wanting praise from others</i>. (2) <i>Wanting the right things b</i><i>ut for the wrong reasons</i> '...If a man desires the position of a bishop, he desires a good work.' (1 Timothy 3:1 NKJV) Wanting to make an impact is a good thing, but you must want it for the right reasons. If you want it for personal recognition and power over others, that's covetousness. (3) <i>Wanting the right things but at the wrong time</i> A young couple says, 'We love each other. We're going to get married in three months. But we want to sleep together now.' They want the right thing for the right reason, but they want it at the wrong time. That's covetousness. (4) <i>Wanting the right things but in the wrong amount</i> Covetousness is wanting more than is required for your needs, and to fulfil God's purpose for your life. Understand this: More of anything other than God will never satisfy the longing for fulfilment He's placed within you. Only when you acknowledge that, will you find true and lasting happiness. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Wash your hands, you sinners...' James 4:8 NIV<br /><br /><p>James continues, '<i>Wash your hands, you sinners</i><i>.</i>' The moment you 'come near to God,' you become aware of your condition. Notice, God doesn't demand you wash your hands before He will respond to you! All your attempts at selfimprovement won't work. Why? Because His grace is the only basis on which He can relate to you (Ephesians 2:89). God points to your defeat zones not to condemn you, but to cleanse you. He knows that dirty hands enable Satan to accuse you before Him so He tells you to wash your hands, 'and do not give the devil a foothold.' (Ephesians 4:27 NIV) Once you've confessed your sins and been cleansed, you can look Satan in the eye and say, 'No ground; not even a millimetre!' James continues, '...Purify your hearts, you doubleminded.' (James 4:8 NIV) Your heart is like a hard drive; it's where you store things. 'It is with your heart that you believe...' (Romans 10:10 NIV) Your heart generates and stores your beliefs, constructive and destructive. Once you form a belief you begin to live it out. Add to this your doublemindedness - you know what's wrong, yet think you can get away with it. How can you overcome the enemy with a heart full of wrong beliefs and a double mind? Through 'turning over a new leaf'? No, you must get down before God and say, 'Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a steadfast spirit within me.' (Psalm 51:10 NKJV) When you pray that way, God will cleanse you, clothe you with power, and cause you to walk in victory.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['These trials will show that your faith is genuine...' 1 Peter 1:7 NLT<br /><br /><p>It is impossible to tell by looking at a person how much faith they have. Compare your faith to a covered bucket of water; you only discover how much is inside when somebody bumps it. Likewise, when life bumps you, you spill out what you are full of. Maybe you took a financial hit in the last few years: bump! What spilled out, fear or faith? Maybe you, or a loved one, received bad news from the doctor and you're going for tests: bump! What splashed over the side? Dreading the worst or trusting God for the best? People can't tell by looking at you how much faith you have, but they can tell by listening to you. In life, bumps are going to happen. You will be tested. And the purpose of the test is not just to reveal your faith, but to refine it. God doesn't test your faith in order to know how much you have, He already knows. No, He tests your faith so that you can know - and start strengthening it. Stop and consider the hardest thing that's going on in your life right now, then ask yourself, 'Is this situation decreasing my faith or increasing it?' The Bible says: 'These trials will show that your faith is genuine. It is being tested as fire tests and purifies gold - though your faith is far more precious than mere gold. So when your faith remains strong through many trials, it will bring you much praise and glory and honour on the day when Jesus Christ is revealed to the whole world.' (1 Peter 1:7 NLT)</p>

<alias><![CDATA[the-blessed-man-and-woman]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Blessed is the man who...' Psalm 1:1 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Here's a scriptural key to being blessed: 'Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly...But his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in His law he meditates day and night. He shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that brings forth its fruit in its season, whose leaf also shall not wither; and whatever he does shall prosper.' (Psalm 1:13 NKJV) A 'blessed' man or woman tends to stand out because their character is deeper, their ideas fresher, their spirit softer, their courage greater, their leadership better, their concerns wider, their compassion more genuine, and their convictions more concrete. They're joyful in spite of difficult circumstances, and show wisdom far beyond their years. And they are full of surprises; you think you have them boxed in, but they turn out to be unpredictable. When you're around them you feel slightly offbalance because you don't know what to expect next. Over time you realise that their ideas and actions can be trusted. Why? Because they have a spiritual root system that goes down to streams of living water. Consequently, what they put their hand to 'prospers'. And you can live this way. How? By setting your spiritual priorities in concrete. The arch enemy of spiritual growth is busyness, which is closely tied to something the Bible calls 'worldliness' - getting caught up with society's agenda to the neglect of walking with God. Whichever way you look at it, a key ingredient to prospering is - time. Not leftover time, not throwaway time, but quality time. Time for meditation; time for communication. Unhurried, uninterrupted time with God. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['We have this treasure in earthen vessels...' 2 Corinthians 4:7 NKJV<br /><br /><p>God has given you talents and He wants you to use them. They may lie dormant under layers of failure, fear or low selfesteem. You may be aware of them, yet not know how to put them to work. Maybe you've been going from relationship to relationship hoping to find someone who will acknowledge what's within you and draw it out. If so, read this: 'But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us.' Only the God who placed your talents within you knows where they're hidden and how to release them. Delayed destiny is the devil's delight. By not allowing God to develop your talents you play into Satan's hands, living far below your potential. The fact is; you have so much treasure buried within you that the enemy is out to steal it. You never have to wonder about Satan's motives. Jesus said he comes '...to steal, kill and destroy...' (John 10:10 TLB) You don't try to rob somebody unless they have something worth taking, right? Your talents may be raw and undeveloped, or buried under years of selfdoubt, unconfessed sin, bad habits, regret and despair. But God can take something that looks like nothing, and create something wonderful with it. Just think: He made the earth from nothing - so imagine what He can do when He has something to start with! Today get down on your knees and pray, 'Father, help me to recognise and maximise the talents You have placed within me, and use them for Your glory.' That's a prayer God will answer!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...Beware of...hypocrisy.' Luke 12:1 NKJV<br /><br /></p>
<p>The word 'hypocrisy' could be translated as 'hype'. And hype, no matter how religious it is, is only a charade. Jesus denounced it. Speaking about the religious leaders of His day, He said: '...Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. For there is nothing covered that will not be revealed, nor hidden that will not be known. Therefore whatever you have spoken in the dark will be heard in the light, and what you have spoken in the ear in inner rooms will be proclaimed on the housetops.' (Luke 12:1-3 NKJV) Why was Jesus so hard on hypocrites? Because hypocrisy accuses in others what it excuses in us, says one thing but does another, puts popularity above principle, loves admiration but cuts corners when it comes to integrity. Take Peter, for example. He preached that all people are equal in Christ, but he practised it selectively. And Paul confronted him on it. 'When Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he was clearly in the wrong. Before certain men came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles. But when they arrived, he began to draw back and separate himself from the Gentiles because he was afraid of those who belonged to the circumcision group. The other Jews joined him in his hypocrisy, so that by their hypocrisy even Barnabas was led astray. When I saw that they were not acting in line with the truth...I [spoke] to Peter in front of them all...' (Galatians 2:11-14 NIV) God understands your weaknesses and He will work with you on them, but He won't put up with your hypocrisy. So be real!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Come near to God and He will come near to you...' James 4:8 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>Resisting the devil is imperative, but it is not the endgame. This is: '<i>Come near to God and </i><i>H</i><i>e will</i><i> come near to you</i>.' Satan's goal is to drive a wedge between you and God, so how do you keep him from doing it? By closing the gap between you and God! Observe three things: (1) <i>Distancing from God is done unconsciously</i> You become preoccupied, selfcentred, or overcommitted. Before you know it, prayer is limited to grace said over meals, Biblereading to the pastor's sermon text, and worship to a Sunday morning interlude. '...Pay more careful attention, therefore, to what [you] have heard, so that [you] do not drift away.' (Hebrews 2:1 NIV) Distancing is a subtle drift, not a sudden dash. (2) <i>Distancing from God is dangerous</i> Satan's goal is to separate you from God and His blessing. Like a soldier in enemy territory who's cut off, you become an easy target. The Bible says, 'If one person falls, the other can reach out and help. But someone who falls alone is in real trouble.' (Ecclesiastes 4:10 NLT) (3) <i>Distancing from God is a choice</i>. But it's your choice, never God's! He says, '...I will never leave you, nor forsake you.' (Hebrews 13:5 NKJV) Whatever your circumstances, He remains faithful. 'When you pass through the waters...the fire...I am with you...' (Isaiah 43:2-5 NIV) What's God's part? 'He will come near to you.' Take one step in His direction and He will close the gap, embrace, secure, and enable you '...to stand against the wiles of the devil.' (Ephesians 6:11 NKJV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Judge nothing before the appointed time...' 1 Corinthians 4:5 NIV<br /><br /><p>Someone once quipped, 'Every footie team could use someone who knows how to play every position, is never off-side and never makes an error. The only problem is; it's hard to make him put down his burger and come out of the spectator stands!' All of us need the advice and input of others. But you should only consider the advice of a critic when: (1) You know you are valued by the one who criticises you. (2) The criticism is not tainted by his or her personal agenda. (3) The person is not naturally critical of everything. (4) The person will continue giving support after giving advice. (5) He or she has knowledge and success in the area of the criticism. What really hurts is the criticism of people who are important to you. It's hard to have your dream criticised by those you admire, love and respect. But if you want to achieve your dream, you'll have to learn how to pay that price too. On the other hand, Stacy Allison, the first American woman to reach the summit of Mount Everest, points out that there are times in your life when it's ok not to listen to what other people are saying. 'If I'd listened to other people I wouldn't have climbed Mount Everest.' If you have a Godgiven promise and purpose, and if your heart is right, then disregard unjustified criticism and stand on this Scripture: 'Judge nothing before the appointed time; wait till the Lord comes. He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and will expose the motives of men's hearts. At that time each will receive his praise from God.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Jesus...touched him...' Mark 1:41 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Myra Brooks Welch wrote: 'It was battered and scarred and the auctioneer thought it hardly worth his while to waste much time on the old violin, so he held it up with a smile. &quot;What am I bid for this old violin? Who'll start the bidding for me? A dollar, a dollar, who'll make it two? Two dollars, and who'll make it three? Three dollars once, three dollars twice, going for three,&quot; but no; from the back of the room a greyhaired man came forward and picked up the bow. Then sweeping the dust from the old violin, and tightening up all the strings, he played a melody pure and sweet, as sweet as the angels sing. The music ceased and the auctioneer, with a voice that was quiet and low, said, &quot;What am I bid for the old violin?&quot; and he held it up with the bow. &quot;A thousand dollars, and who'll make it two? Two thousand, and who'll make it three? Three thousand once, three thousand twice, going, and gone,&quot; said he. The people cheered, but some of them said, &quot;We do not quite understand. What changed its worth?&quot; Then came the reply, &quot;The touch of the Master's hand.&quot; And many a man with his life out of tune, battered and scarred with sin, is auctioned cheap to a thoughtless crowd, much like the old violin. A mess of pottage, a glass of wine, a game, and he shuffles along: going once, going twice, he's going and almost gone. But the Master comes, and the thoughtless crowd never can quite understand, the worth of the soul, and the change that's wrought, by the touch of the Master's hand.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Teach me to do Your will, for You are my God...' Psalm 143:10 NIV<br /><br /><p>When God promises you something and it doesn't happen right away, it's easy to get impatient, start doubting Him and think He needs you to go to work and make it happen. Abraham did that. God promised him children '...as numerous as the stars...' (Genesis 22:17 NIV) Tired of waiting, he took matters into his own hands and fathered Ishmael with his wife's maidservant, Hagar. And that's when his troubles began in earnest. Now, God loved Ishmael and had great plans for him, but Abraham had to let go of him in order to fulfil God's will. It was one of the most painful experiences of Abraham's life. So: (1) <i>Refuse to let the </i><i>e</i><i>nemy send anything into your life that will undermine what you have been waiting and praying for</i>. (2) <i>Be careful who you take advice from</i>. Fathering Ishmael was a 'good idea' Abraham's wife Sarah had. (3) <i>Because you are willing to take responsibility for your actions, it doesn</i><i>'</i><i>t mean that there won</i><i>'</i><i>t be consequences</i>, longlasting ones! Be careful where you lie down; getting up again may not be as easy as you think. (4) <i>There are things you can give u</i><i>p effortlessly, and other things that will take every </i><i>last bit </i><i>of grace you have</i>. And it's especially hard to give up something you're attached to and see yourself reflected in, like a job you love, a house you're living in, or a relationship you're tied to. But when you've gone as far as you can with your 'Ishmael' and you're ready to see God's promise fulfilled in your life, you must be willing to let it go. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Mark...is profitable to me for the ministry.' 2 Timothy 4:11 KJV<br /><br /><p>Paul, who demanded 100 per cent commitment from himself and those he worked with, was angry with Mark for wanting to take a break. Paul and Barnabas split up over Mark's return. But later, after reconsidering the whole thing, Paul gave Mark a second chance, saying, 'He is profitable to me for the ministry.' God sees potential in people, even flawed people, and we must too. When we believe in people and encourage them, they can move from the loss column to the profit column. Many years ago in a manufacturing town in Scotland, a young lady gathered a class of street kids to teach them God's Word. To keep them coming back, the superintendent bought each of them a new suit. But after a few weeks Bob, the most unpromising boy in the class, was missing. When she went looking for him she found him with his clothes torn and dirty. So the superintendent bought him another suit and invited him back again. After a few weeks he dropped out of Sunday school once more. Disgusted, the teacher wanted to give up on him. But the superintendent said, 'I'll buy him a third suit if he will promise to attend regularly.' Bob did. He kept coming, committed his life to Christ and studied for the ministry. That discouraged, forlorn, ragged, runaway boy was Robert Morrison, the great missionary to China who translated the Bible into the Chinese language and opened the Kingdom of Heaven to countless millions who live there. So, who are you thinking of giving up on? Don't do it! Give them, and God, another chance!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Be self-controlled and alert...' 1 Peter 5:8 NIV <br /><br /></p>
<p>When nations decide to end a conflict, their leaders sign treaties that allow for the restoration of peaceful relations between them. Christ's death and resurrection defeated Satan fairly and squarely. Then Christ the victor '...ascended up on high, [and] He led captivity captive...' (Ephesians 4:8 KJV) He was welcomed back in Heaven as conqueror. But here on earth, no treaty was ever signed between Satan and God's people. You are still his target. He continues to be a thief who comes to '...steal, kill and destroy...' (John 10:10 TLB) He still '...prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.' (1 Peter 5:8 NIV) But Christ's victory on the cross has positioned you to walk in daily triumph over Satan. However, winning your personal war with the Accuser isn't a matter of brains or brawn; it's a spiritual battle and you can only win it by employing God's strategies for victory. For the next few days let's look at them: '<i>Be self-</i><i>controlled and alert</i>...' (1 Peter 5:8 NIV) Being 'selfcontrolled' implies staying in charge of your emotions, thoughts, words, decisions and actions. It requires taking responsibility for your own life; not allowing people, circumstances or the devil to take the steering wheel from your hands and usurp your Power of Attorney to gain control. Being 'alert' means being conscious of your weaknesses and Satan's corresponding ploys. You can't afford to coast, run on autopilot, or go with the flow. Being alert exposes Satan's welllaid strategies, enabling you to stop him dead in his tracks.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Submit yourselves therefore to God...' James 4:7 KJV<br /><br /></p>
<p>Being '<i>self-</i><i>controlled and alert</i>' to Satan's strategies empowers you to be proactive in your personal war with him (1 Peter 5:8 NIV). But your next step is crucial. The art of war follows set rules of engagement. If you're losing more than winning, then you may have omitted this vital rule: 'Submit yourselves therefore to God.' Salvation doesn't enrol you in a club for the religious elite; it enlists you in the army of the Lord. And this war isn't just about you - it's also about your King, His rulership and authority, and who acknowledges it. Kingdom power is only given by the King to His subjects. To win this battle you must recognise your King and submit to Him. The Roman centurion who met Christ understood this. 'I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, &quot;Go,&quot; and he goes; and that one, &quot;Come,&quot;' and he comes...' (Luke 7:8 NIV) He recognised that he, like Jesus, got his power by submitting to authority. Submitting yourself to Jesus is what gives you the power to battle Satan successfully. Don't hurl yourself into the battle. Instead, recognise Christ's authority and submit to it because it's the submitted life that overcomes. At the point of your temptation, seize the moment and surrender yourself to Jesus, the King of kings, who said, '...All authority has been given to Me in Heaven and on earth.' (Matthew 28:18 NKJV) Under His authority you discover that victory over Satan comes, '...&quot;Not by [human] might nor by [human] power, but by My Spirit,&quot; says the Lord of hosts.' (Zechariah 4:6 NKJV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...Resist the devil...he will flee from you.' James 4:7 KJV<br /><br /></p>
<p>Once you become self-controlled, alert, and submitted to God, your next step must be to: '<i>Resist the devil...he will flee from you</i>' When you are properly aligned with Jesus, His power and authority are behind you and at your disposal. Then when you act or speak you do so, not on your own, but as His representative. Think about it this way; when a police officer orders you to stop because you're driving too fast, the entire force of the law comes into operation. If you refuse to stop you are taking on the local constabulary, the police service and the magistrates court, bringing down the full weight of their combined authority on your head. As long as that policeman is aligned with and submitted to those who are over him when he speaks and acts - they speak and act through him. Are you getting the idea? In God's Kingdom the submitted life represents the King. So when you speak and act according to God's will, He speaks and acts through you. Even Satan cannot break this chain of command! Nor can he withstand it. 'Behold, I give you the authority...over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you.' (Luke 10:19 NKJV) When you are submitted to God you can resist the devil as Jesus did when He said, 'Away from Me, Satan! For it is written: &quot;Worship the Lord your God, and serve Him only.&quot; Then the devil left Him.' (Matthew 4:1011 NIV) And when you speak those same words to the devil, '...he will flee from you.' (James 4:7 KJV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...A man reaps what he sows.' Galatians 6:7 NIV<br /><br /><p>It's said, 'Yard by yard life is hard, inch by inch life's a cinch!' For their life to go right, your children must learn to think right. So teach them to ask: (1) '<i>What are my options in this situation?</i>' But do it with the right attitude. If your face is like thunder when you talk to them, they'll run for cover. Brainstorm with them, writing down every option that's offered. Tell them that no answers are wrong and no idea will be judged as silly; all suggestions are accepted and valued. You're priming their creative pump, encouraging them to think for themselves. (2) '<i>What benefits come from each option?</i>' The goal is not to coerce them, but for them to discover and embrace the truth for themselves. And that comes through patience, not pressure. Ask them to list which benefits seem most important to them. (3) '<i>What negative consequences come from each option?</i>' Children can be brutally honest. That's ok; it's just part of learning God's causeandeffect law of sowing and reaping. Indeed, many adult regrets could have been avoided by following this law. Don't preach or rant about how terrible the consequences are. Teach them to question themselves, 'Am I willing to accept the consequences? How would they change my life?' (4) '<i>Wha</i><i>t personal values are involved in this decision?</i>' Valuesbased decisions call us to the high road rather than the path of least resistance. Suggest some godly values as primers, such as truthfulness, trustworthiness, loyalty, responsibility, compassion, friendship, selfdenial, courage, honour, faith etc. Break it down small for younger children, but don't miss your opportunity.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Your thoughts...are the source of true life.' Proverbs 4:23 CEV<br /><br /><p>Teach your child to ask themselves these two questions: (1) '<i>How will I feel afterwards?</i>' What outlasts our decisions are the subsequent feelings of selfrespect versus shame, and positive selfworth versus negative selfworth. Our actions ultimately become history, but our thoughts about them continue to shape our future. 'Carefully guard your thoughts because they are the source of true life.' Children with selfrespect are much less likely to indulge in promiscuous sex, drugs, drinking, antisocial and illegal behaviours. Selfrespect and selfworth are internal standards which we are loathed to violate. Giving in to selfish choices is like abandoning the moral core of our being - the sacred soul God gave us. (2) '<i>How will the people I value feel about me after this decision?</i>' The trust and respect of others is always needed to succeed. Reputation trumps money, even in the secular marketplace. 'Choose a good reputation over great riches; being held in high esteem is better than silver or gold.' (Proverbs 22:1 NLT) Poor decisionmaking can earn us a reputation that'll haunt our prospects indefinitely. 'A person who plans (chooses) evil will get a reputation as a troublemaker.' (Proverbs 24:8 NLT) When you get a negative reputation, it's hard to recover from it (Proverbs 25:10). The shortterm benefits of making poor decisions lead to longterm losses and regrets. The person God blesses must '...exercise selfcontrol, live wisely, and have a good reputation...' (1 Timothy 3:2 NLT) </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['... [There is] a time to be silent and a time to speak.' Ecclesiastes 3:7 NAS<br /><br /><p>Teach your child to ask: (1) '<i>Is this the best time to make this decision?</i>' Decisions made in haste are often regretted. 'There is a time to be silent and a time to speak.' Poor decisions are situationally driven, caused by momentary stress, peer pressure, mood swings and temporary emotions like loneliness etc. When the situation changes, our feelings change and our decisions often look doubtful. Can the decision be made later, reducing or eliminating the risk? Pressuring children often increases their desperation and leads to premature decisions, but assuring them that time is on their side lowers both their reactivity and the likelihood of future regret. Helping them see that God '...has made everything appropriate in its time...' (Ecclesiastes 3:11 NAS) offers them space to think wisely about their options, allowing for God's guidance. (2) '<i>If I were advising a friend (John or Susie), would I suggest they take this same option?</i>' Shifting perspective often broadens the perceptions of our options. When emotionally influenced, our children often narrow their perspective, excluding many important possibilities. Often adults press logical, rational thinking on them, meeting resistance. But by bringing 'John' or 'Susie' into the equation we open their perspective up. And one more thought: it's beneficial to 'debrief' with your child, helping them to evaluate the effectiveness of their decisionmaking process. Talk through how they handled the situation. Ask, 'How do you feel about that result?' If they're pleased, compliment them; if not, say, 'I'm sorry about that. Any idea what you'll change next time?' Instead of judging their failure, reward their success.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['For this child I prayed, and the Lord has granted me my petition...' 1 Samuel 1:27 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Every terrorist was once a child. So was every missionary. The difference between them is often the influence of a parent. Samuel the prophet led the nation of Israel for 40 years and guided it through a crucial time of transition, but who was the dominant influence in his life? His mother! Listen, 'Therefore Ihave lent him to the Lord; as long as he lives he shall be lent to the Lord...' (1 Samuel 1:28 NKJV) While you have your children, hold them, love them, care for them and empower them but understand that you are a steward, not an owner. Your children belong to God, not you! Some day they will grow up and leave. Make sure that when they do they have a spiritual anchor because life will give them lots of storms. Never underestimate the power of a parent pleading with God on behalf of a child. Who knows how many prayers are being answered right now because of the faithful pondering of a mother 10 or 20 years ago? If what you are doing in this fastpaced society is taking you away from prayer time for your children; you're doing too much! There is nothing more special, more precious, than the time a parent spends interceding with God on behalf of a child. It's not too late for the child who brought you tears. Think of Jesus' mother who had to watch her son crucified but also had the joy of seeing Him raised from the dead. You may go to your grave wondering if your prayers will ever be answered but don't stop praying. Why? Because when mothers pray, God listens!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'You desire truth in the inward parts...' Psalm 51:6 NKJV<br /><br /></p>
<p>The Bible says, '...Nor was any deceit in [Christ's] mouth.' (Isaiah 53:9 NIV) And if God has His way with us, none will be found in ours either. God doesn't seek to minimise our deception, but to eliminate it altogether. He is blunt about dishonesty. 'No one who is dishonest will live in My house...' (Psalm 101:7 NCV) Paul lists the types of people who will not inherit the Kingdom of God - those who sin sexually, worship idols, get drunk, rob people, and - lie about others (1 Corinthians 6:910). 'You mean my fibbing and flattering stir the same heavenly anger as adultery and aggravated assault?' Apparently so. God views fudging on income tax in the same way as He views kneeling before idols. 'Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord, But those who deal truthfully are His delight.' (Proverbs 12:22 NKJV) Why the tough stance? Because dishonesty is absolutely contrary to the character of God (Hebrews 6:18). It's not that God won't lie, or has chosen not to lie, but that He cannot lie. A dog can't fly, a bird can't bark, and God can't lie. When He makes a covenant, He keeps it. When He makes a statement, He means it. When He proclaims the truth, we can believe it. Even, 'if we are not faithful, [God] remains faithful, because He cannot be false to Himself.' (2 Timothy 2:13 GNT) With God, the truth is not a grey area, it's black and white. So if you're serious about walking with Him and pleasing Him, you must commit to 'the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.'</p>

<title><![CDATA[Shrink Your Fears]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[shrink-your-fears]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['When I am afraid, I will trust in you.' Psalm 56:3 NIV<br /><br /><p>Mary loved being a homemaker. She'd been married for thirty years to John, a successful businessman. Because John had always taken care of things, Mary had learned never to take risks. As a result, her biggest fear was that she'd be left alone one day. Sometimes she would tell her friends, 'I hope I go before John because I don't think I could handle things by myself.' But when John became ill, Mary was placed in the position of caring for him, plus having to make all the decisions for them both. It was nervewracking at first. But once she put her trust in God and decided to take charge, she made an interesting discovery: security doesn't lie in having things, but in handling them! She found that facing her fears was easy compared to the years she'd spent feeling inadequate, helpless and dependent. Facing your fears is always easier than living with helplessness. In fact, when you let fear stop you, you end up living with feelings of dread and helplessness that are a hundred times worse than if you had just faced your fears and moved forward. The truth is, if you tell yourself often enough that you can't do something, you will be unable to do it - even though you have the talent, time, resources, strategy and friends to accomplish it. Only those who say they can, do. Saying you believe in yourself and the God who lives within you may not guarantee your success, but saying you don't will guarantee your failure. So today, face your fears head on, and watch them shrink.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...If you would believe you would see the glory of God.' John 11:40 NKJV<br /><br /><p>In the story of Jesus raising Lazarus from the dead, you'll notice three important principles: (1) <i>Mary and Martha had a close relationship wit</i><i>h Jesus before the crisis arose</i>. When Jesus came to town, He stayed at their home and ate at their table. They were givers, not takers. You can't refuse to give God a minute of your time, an ounce of your energy or a cent of your money, then when trouble comes, say, 'Lord, why did You let this happen?' Jesus said, 'If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you.' (John 15:7 NKJV) (2) <i>Having a relationship with Jesus doesn</i><i>'</i><i>t mean you won</i><i>'</i><i>t have troub</i><i>le</i> But it does mean that you can go to Him with confidence in times of trouble. Yes, you must pay attention to your career and your family, but you must also pay attention to the most important relationship of all - the one you have with the Lord. '...If our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God and receive from Him anything we ask, because we obey His commands and do what pleases Him.' (1 John 3:2122 NIV) (3) <i>When you bring Jesus into the situation, He will change it</i> Lazarus was already dead and buried by the time Jesus got there. Humanly speaking, it was hopeless. But in moments like these God asks you, '...Is there anything too hard for Me?' (Jeremiah 32:27 NKJV) If your answer is 'No, Lord,' then your problem becomes an opportunity for Him to demonstrate His love and care for you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Approved and acceptable and in right relationship with Him...' 2 Corinthians 5:21 AMP<br /><br /><p>The world tells us that our value is connected to our 'doing'. Growing up, we're constantly compared. When asked why we weren't doing as well as our brother or sister, we felt we were doing our best and we had no answer. So we resolved to try harder, but no matter how hard we tried, someone still wasn't satisfied. We were still getting the message, 'Something's wrong with you.' This leaves us burned out, confused and turned off. It drives many of us into counselling, when all we need is the assurance of God's unconditional love! Your wrong behaviours won't be changed until you know you're loved by God apart from what you do. And that's what Jesus made possible through the cross. Why is this important to believe? Because until you know who you are in Christ, you'll stumble along believing that your acceptance with God is performancebased. Your acceptance with God <i>is</i> based on performance, but not yours - Christ's! Jesus loves you unconditionally and is committed to working with you. And the best part is, He doesn't condemn you while He's doing it! He understands your temperament, your struggles, and even the faulty foundation upon which you've based your selfworth. He not only understands - He cares. Once you enter into a personal relationship with Christ He begins a process of relieving your pain, revealing your true value, and releasing your gifts. Bit by bit, He restores everything Satan has stolen from you. And while all this is happening, you are positioned securely 'in Christ'. Therefore you're always acceptable to Him. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I, Tertius, the one writing this letter for Paul, send my greetings...' Romans 16:22 NLT<br /><br /><p>Paul surrounded himself with people who were willing to lay down their lives for him (Romans 16:34). Some of them are virtually unknown. Ever heard of Tertius? He recorded Paul's thoughts so we could read them. We all know about Timothy, but do you know about Gaius? '...He is my host and also serves as host to the whole church...' (Romans 16:23 NLT) Many served in the shadows so Paul could work in the limelight. Sadly, when some leaders arrive at the top, they spend their time trying to push others off it. They play 'king of the hill' because of immaturity, insecurity and competitiveness. That may work for a while, but it doesn't last long. When your goal is to knock others down, your time and energy is spent watching out for people you think would do the same to you. It's a miserable way to live, and it's no fun for those who have to work with you. Jules Ormont said, 'A great leader never sets himself above his followers except in carrying responsibilities.' If you're in a leadership position, don't rely on your title to convince people to follow you. Build relationships. Win people over. When you don't love people, you're only a few steps away from manipulating them. When that happens, you'll have a high turnover. A few years ago the three great tenors - José Carreras, Plácido Domingo, and Luciano Pavarotti - were performing together. When a reporter tried to find out if there was any rivalry among the superstars, Domingo said, 'No, you can't be rivals when you're together making music.' </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Search me, O God, and know my heart; test me...' Psalm 139:23 NLT<br /><br /><p>In his <i>Pogo</i> cartoon strip, Walt Kelly said, 'We have met the enemy, and he is us.' The hardest person in the world to lead will always be yourself. Human nature seems to endow us with the ability to size up everybody except ourselves. After having a victorious Goliath experience, followed by a devastating Bathsheba experience, the Psalmist wrote, 'Search me, O God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts. Point out anything in me that offends You, and lead me along the path of everlasting life.' (Psalm 139:2324 NLT) That's a prayer you need to pray every day because we all have two problems. What are they? (1) <i>We don</i><i>'</i><i>t see ourselves as we see others</i> If we don't look at ourselves honestly and realistically, we will never understand where our personal difficulties lie. And if we can't see them, we won't be able to lead ourselves effectively. It's said that Frederick the Great of Prussia met an old man walking ramrod straight in the opposite direction. 'Who are you?' Frederick asked. 'I am a king,' replied the old man. Frederick laughed. 'Over what kingdom do you reign?' Proudly the old man replied, 'Over myself.' (2) <i>We are harder on others than we are on ourselves</i> We judge others according to their actions, while we tend to judge ourselves according to our intentions. When we do the wrong thing, we let ourselves off the hook because we believe our motives were good. And the problem is; we are usually willing to do that over and over before requiring ourselves to change!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The heart of the discerning acquires knowledge; the ears of the wise seek it out.' Proverbs 18:15 NIV<br /><br /><p>The story's told of two men out hunting, when one of them falls to the ground. He doesn't seem to be breathing and his eyes are rolled back in his head. The other man whips out his mobile phone and calls 000. Frantically, he tells the operator, 'Robert is dead! What can I do?' The operator says, 'Just take it easy. First let's make sure he's dead.' There is silence, and then a shot is heard. The guy's voice comes back on the line and says, 'Ok, he's dead, now what?' When you are under pressure you can fail to hear what's being communicated, and the results can be fatal. So: (1) <i>In order to lead people you must first understand them</i> You must have insight into the human heart. Sensitivity toward the hopes and dreams of people is essential for connecting with people and motivating them. (2) <i>Listening can keep problems from escalating</i> Good leaders are attentive to small issues. They pay attention to their intuition. Not only do they listen to what's being said, they also hear what's not being said. They are secure enough to ask for honest feedback, and not to become defensive when they receive it. (3) <i>Listening establishes trust</i> Dr. David Burns, Adjunct Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at the Stanford University School of Medicine, said, 'The biggest mistake you can make in trying to talk convincingly is to put your highest priority in expressing your own ideas and feelings. What people really want is to be listened to, respected, and understood. The moment they are, they become more motivated to understand your point of view.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Listen...and I will give you some advice...' Exodus 18:19 NIV<br /><br /><p>As a leader, it's your job to see that things get done. But as the workload grows you will have to find people with talents equal to the task; otherwise you will stop growing. So what keeps us from seeking out the right people and delegating the right tasks to them? (1) <i>Past hurts</i>: Somebody let us down so we're reluctant to trust anybody. (2) <i>Pride</i>: We don't want to share the credit with others. (3) <i>Perfectionism</i>: We are not willing to be put at risk while people with potential learn on the job, so our vision bottlenecks and everything gets bogged down. Moses had this problem with Israel. Here's how he solved it: 'Moses' fatherin-law replied, &quot;What you are doing is not good. You and these people who come to you will only wear yourselves out. The work is too heavy for you; you cannot handle it alone. Listen now to me and I will give you some advice...You must be the people's representative before God and bring their disputes to Him...But select capable men from all the people...and appoint them as officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens. Have them serve as judges for the people at all times, but have them bring every difficult case to you; the simple cases they can decide themselves. That will make your load lighter, because they will share it with you. If you do this...you will be able to stand the strain, and all these people will go home satisfied.&quot; Moses listened to his fatherinlaw and did everything he said.' (Exodus 18:1724 NIV) If you want to be a good leader, follow Moses' example!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Every morning, I tell you what I need, and I wait for your answer.' Psalm 5:3 NCV<br /><br /><p>It takes time, but eventually sheep grow familiar with the voice of their shepherd and learn to trust him for everything they need. So how can you become equally familiar with the voice of God? Here are a few ideas: (1) <i>Give God your waking thoughts</i> With your head on your pillow and your eyes still closed, offer God the first seconds of your day. Say, 'Thank You for a night's rest. Today I belong to You.' CS Lewis wrote: 'The moment you wake up each morning...all your wishes and hopes for the day rush at you like wild animals. And the first job each morning consists in shoving them all back; in listening to that other voice, taking that other point of view, letting that other, larger, stronger, quieter life come flowing in.' (2) <i>Give God your waiting thoughts</i> The mature married couple has learned the treasure of shared silence; they don't need to fill the air with constant chatter. Just being together is sufficient. Try being silent with God. 'Be still, and know that I am God...' (Psalm 46:10 NIV) Awareness of God is the result of stillness before God. Jesus prayed, 'That [they] may be one, Father, just as You are in Me and I am in You. May they also be in Us so that the world may believe...' (John 17:21 NIV) When are you most deeply aware of Christ's presence 'in you' as He promised? To what degree have you consciously invited Him to be more and more at home in your heart? How has your practice of intimacy with God developed in the last few years?</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Be still, and know that I am God...' Psalm 46:10 NIV<br /><br /><p>Give God your whispering thoughts. Throughout the centuries, Christians have learned the value of brief sentence prayers. These are prayers that can be whispered anywhere, in any setting. Frank Laubach sought unbroken communion with God by asking Him questions. Every two or three minutes he would pray, 'Am I in Your will, Lord? Am I pleasing You, Lord?' Imagine considering every moment as a potential time of communion with God. By the time your life is over, you will have spent six months at traffic lights, eight months opening junk mail, a year and a half looking for lost stuff, and a whopping five years standing waiting in various queues. Why don't you give these moments to God? By giving Him your whispering thoughts, the common becomes uncommon. Simple phrases such as 'Thank You, Father,' or 'I stand on Your Word,' or 'My desire is to please You,' can turn a commute into a pilgrimage. You needn't leave your office or kneel in your kitchen. Just pray where you are. Let the kitchen become a cathedral and the classroom a chapel. Give God your waning thoughts. At the end of the day, let your mind settle on Him. Conclude the day as you began it - talking to God. Thank Him for the good parts. Question Him about the hard parts. Seek His mercy. Seek His strength. As you close your eyes, take assurance in the promise, 'He who watches over [you] will neither slumber nor sleep.' (Psalm 121:4 NIV) If you fall asleep as you pray, don't worry. What better place to doze off than in the arms of your Father?</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...Choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve...' Joshua 24:15 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>Good decision-making is the key to a happy life. But good decision-making is not a skill some of us are naturally blessed with, while poor decision-making is a handicap others seem to be born with. Courage, education or the ageing process don't automatically produce better decision-makers. Spending time with good decision-makers is wise, but it doesn't necessarily rub off on you. And the earlier you teach this skill to your children, the better (Proverbs 22:6). So teach your children the following principles: (1) <i>The consequences you get are the result of the choices you make</i>. Let your children know it's not their circumstances, but decisions they make about them, that govern their lives. You may think your children know this, but they don't. Their 'wiring problem' makes 'cause and effect' difficult to connect until their brain reaches late adolescence. Asking, 'What were you thinking about?' will just invite the famous shoulder shrug and blank stare. They're not stupid - they just need guidance. (2) <i>You will always have options</i> Children commonly feel powerless and hopeless when reacting to negative circumstances. They tend to be 'either/or' thinkers, concluding that things are either all good or all bad. Teach them 'both/and' thinking, because things can be bad yet you can choose to make good decisions about them. 'Either/or' thinking frequently produces children who become pessimistic, disempowered, easily manipulated, depressed adults. Knowing they always have good options prevents circumstances from dictating their lives.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...I have learned how to be content with whatever I have.' Philippians 4:11 NLT<br /><br /><p>If money guaranteed happiness, wouldn't the rich be happier than everybody else? Studies show that often they're not. Happy people don't follow money, they follow their God-given passion. In <i>What Happy People Know</i>, Dr Dan Baker writes: 'The man in front of me seemed to have it all: money, freedom, friends and family. But he didn't have the one thing he wanted most - happiness. His home life would horrify most people - alienated kids, a wife who resented his obsession with work, no time to kick back.' What was this man's biggest concern? Keeping what he had! Maybe you're reading this, thinking, 'Yeah, but that doesn't apply to me. In his situation I know I could be happy!' No, money can't buy happiness; regardless of how much you have, it's never enough. Fear will always whisper, 'Unless you get more you won't be secure.' So what's the secret of happiness? Paul writes: 'For I have learned how to be content with whatever I have. I know how to live on almost nothing or with everything. I have learned the secret of living in every situation, whether it is with a full stomach or empty, with plenty or little. For I can do everything through Christ, who gives me strength.' (Philippians 4:11-13 NLT) When you pursue God's purpose for your life, money is secondary. Your real status symbols are salvation, spiritual growth, a secure home, special friends, and the satisfaction of doing what God called you to do. Watchman Nee said, 'I have never met a soul who has set out to satisfy the Lord, and has not been satisfied himself.'</p>

<alias><![CDATA[learning-to-walk-by-faith-2]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!' Mark 9:24 NIV<br /><br /><p>Here is another question to consider: What is 'walking by sight' (2 Corinthians 5:7)? It's living your life based on how things look to the natural eye. It's deciding and acting in accord with your perceptions and circumstances, rather than God's Word. It's being dictated to by your feelings and thoughts. Your thoughts and feelings are - yours! Examine them. Don't let them hijack you. Use your spirit-controlled temperament to bring them under control. Too often we are sandwiched between faith and doubt, in a 'Catch-22' between what our transformed spirit says and what our carnal mind says. One day a distraught father brought his son to Jesus for healing. Jesus told him, '...Everything is possible for one who believes.' (Mark 9:23 NIV) At that point the boy's father said, 'I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!' At times we experience both faith and doubt. This man was honest about his doubts, yet Jesus still worked a miracle for him. If he had needed correcting, Jesus would have corrected him. If his faith was not genuine, the Lord would have known it. But Jesus accepted his declaration of faith, despite his doubts. There are three lessons here for us: (1) Don't be afraid to acknowledge your doubts. (2) Don't let your doubts overrule your faith. God's Word in the matter is God's will for you; stand on it. (3) Hand your doubts over to the Lord and say, 'I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!' How long does it take to learn to walk by faith? A lifetime!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Faith comes from hearing the message...through the Word...' Romans 10:17 NIV<br /><br /><p>What does it mean to 'walk by faith...' (2 Corinthians 5:7 NAS)? It's radically different from walking by sight, reason, emotion or intellect. It calls you to live above these things. It enables you to enter the realm of supernatural possibilities because Jesus said, 'All things are possible to one who believes.' (Mark 9:23 ESV) Here are some Scriptural principles about faith that will help you: (1) It is not rooted in human effort. Self-confidence and intellectual acumen don't qualify. Optimism, good luck and social connections don't qualify. Learning religious formulas won't do it either. (2) It's rooted in God's unlimited power and unchanging Word. 'Faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the Word.' The Word of God, received and residing within you, continuously produces faith within you. No teeth-gritting super-effort is required; you simply decide to believe what God says and respond to it. (3) Walking by faith calls for action. 'Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by my deeds.' (James 2:18 NIV) Until you act, your faith is useless. 'In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.' (James 2:17 NIV) The moment you act your faith springs to life, inviting God to move on your behalf. Today He's waiting for you to act so that He can respond to you. Even if you don't feel like it, ask yourself, 'What would my first step of faith be if I really felt like taking action?' Do it! You'll be walking by faith and reaping the rewards! (Hebrews 11:6)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I make known the end from the beginning...' Isaiah 46:10 NIV<br /><br /><p>You are not a mistake your parents made in the heat of passion. What your parents did may have been illegitimate, but you are not. You may wonder: 'God, is it possible that You have a reason for my conception? Am I called to do something great in life? Is there something so unique to my personality, so connected to my life experiences, so relative to my sphere of influence, so dependent upon my colour and culture, so necessary to my needs and shortcomings that nobody can do it exactly the way You want it done but me?' Yes. God says, 'I make known the end from the beginning...My purpose will stand.' You are going to succeed because God has already determined your destiny. Before God establishes the procedure, He decides the purpose. When a builder is confused he refers back to the blueprint and checks with the architect. God is the architect and builder of your life. He never gets confused about what He's planned or how it's to be built. When He builds something, it's built for maximum efficiency and optimal performance. We think, 'Lord, why are You holding me back while others get to go forward? Why is it taking so long for my breakthrough to come?' God responds, 'What does the blueprint say?' God is building a solid foundation under you so that you'll be able to handle the pressures that accompany His blessing, and go through the storms of life without being moved or shaken. Anything that's made well is made slowly. Anything that's worth having is worth fighting for.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Open my eyes, that I may see...' Psalm 119:18 NKJV<br /><br /><p>To succeed in life: (1) <i>You must refuse to settle for yesterday</i><i>'</i><i>s accomplishments</i> If what you did yesterday still looks big to you today, you probably haven't done enough today. Paul celebrated his accomplishments, but he focused on what God had for him in the future: '...Forgetting the past and looking forward to what lies ahead, I press on...' (Philippians 3:1314 NLT) (2) <i>You must refuse to sit around waiting for tomorrow</i><i>'</i><i>s opportunities</i> Between the great things we can't do and the little things we won't do, the danger is that we'll do nothing. The world is blessed most by those who do things, not by those who merely talk about doing them. (3) <i>You must refuse to let your beginning dictate your end</i>. George Washington Carver spent his early years shuffled between foster homes until, it is thought, Maria Watkins, a washerwoman, found him asleep in her barn. She didn't just take him in; she took him to church and introduced him to Jesus. When he eventually left her home, he took with him the Bible she'd given him. Maria left her mark on his life, and George left his mark on the world. This father of modern agriculture was a friend to three presidents as well as Henry Ford and Gandhi. He is credited with over three hundred different inventions. And the remarkable thing is, despite his disadvantages, he never became bitter or spent so much as a moment getting even. Instead, he went into his lab every morning and prayed, 'Open my eyes that I may see.' How could God fail to bless someone with such an attitude? </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Some people have entertained angels without knowing it.' Hebrews 13:2 NIV <br /><br /><p>When we talk about angels operating among us, the spiritually unenlightened think it's just religious sentiment. That's because they allow their intellect to neutralise their faith. Notice: (1) <i>Angels ha</i><i>ve a long history among us</i> An angel shut the mouths of lions for Daniel. An angel went before Israel's army guaranteeing their victory. An angel showed up in a storm to let Paul know that he'd survive a shipwreck. An angel opened prison doors for Peter, saving his life on the eve of his execution. (2) <i>Angels protect us in times of danger</i> 'For He will command His angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways.' (Psalm 91:11 NIV) And when you consider some of your 'ways', don't you realise just how much you need protection? Your early cancer detection, or your narrow escape - those were more than just lucky breaks. Angels even watch over our children. Jesus said, 'See that you do not look down on one of these little ones. For I tell you that their angels... always see the face of My Father in Heaven.' (Matthew 18:10 NIV) Now you know why kids survive things that make parents go weak at the knees. (3) <i>Angels help us in times of need</i> 'Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?' (Hebrews 1:14 NIV) So, has God done away with His secret service? Are they sitting on their hands claiming Jobseekers Allowance somewhere in Heaven? No, they're still working hard. You may not be able to see them with your natural eyes, but the benefits they bring surround you every day.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...with these we shall be content.' 1 Timothy 6:8 NAS<br /><br /><p>Contentment isn't something you find at a particular destination, it's something you practice every day on your way to it. And even if you miss the right path from time to time, you still enjoy the scenery along the detour. Paul said, 'Not that I speak in regard to need, for I have learned in whatever state I am, to be content.' (Philippians 4:11 NKJV) Paul learned not to let what he didn't have, overshadow what he did. How do you find contentment? By doing these three things: (1) <em>Seek it</em> Make it a daily choice. Come to the place where you believe that having more materially, won't make you happier. Sometimes contentment calls for simplifying your life. Benjamin Franklin said, 'Contentment makes poor men rich, and discontent makes rich men poor.' (2) <em>Say it</em> Cultivate the ability to say, 'I have enough.' Push back from life's table and say, 'I've had enough.' Stand with the surprise bonus in your hand considering what you might buy, and say, 'I have enough, Lord. How can I use this for You?' (3) <em>Settle it</em> '...If riches increase, do not set your heart upon them.' (Psalm 62:10 NAS) If all the grains of sand on all the beaches of the world represented eternity, you could say that one grain represents your lifespan. Now think: You are over here grinding your one grain day and night to get everything you can out of it, while ignoring all the beaches of eternity that God has in store for you. Not very clever, is it? To be content, focus on eternity. Let enough be enough. Let your lifestyle be Biblicallybased; make it eternally focused!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...What do you think about...Christ?...' Matthew 22:42 NKJV<br /><br /><p>One day Jesus took Peter, James and John up to the top of a mountain. We read: '...Moses and Elijah appeared and began talking with Jesus...Peter...blurted out, &quot;Master...Let's make three shelters as memorials - one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.&quot;' (Luke 9:3033 NLT) Peter's thinking was wrong. Three shrines would have made Moses and Elijah equal with Jesus. Nobody is equal with Jesus! He is wholly, solely, fully, thoroughly and altogether God. When God spoke from Heaven that day, Moses the lawgiver, Elijah the prophet, Peter the preacher, James the apostle and John the revelator were all present. But God didn't say, 'Listen to them.' No, He said, '...This is my beloved Son: hear Him.' (Luke 9:35 KJV) Jesus knew exactly who He was. When His accusers shouted, 'You claim you are the Son of God,' ...He replied, 'Yes...' (Luke 22:70 TLB) He actually said, '...He who has seen Me has seen the Father...' (John 14:9 NKJV) Then He blew their minds by predicting both His death and His resurrection (John 10:18). Let's be clear about this: you can discount Jesus as a fraud or worship Him as God, but don't call Him just another historic figure. CS Lewis said, 'A man who said the...things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He'd either be a lunatic...or the devil... You can spit at Him, kill Him...or fall at His feet and call Him Lord, but let's not come up with patronising nonsense about His being a great human teacher.' So, what do you think about Christ? Is He the Lord of your life? He wants to be.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...You are My servant; I have chosen you...' Isaiah 41:9 NIV<br /><br /><p>Have you ever wondered how animal trainers used to control a fivetonne elephant and keep it from running away? They did it by controlling the animal's thinking. When a baby elephant was being trained, a rope was put around its leg and then tied to a wooden post secured in the ground. The elephant, which was not yet very strong, pulled at the rope but was unable to break it or to pull up the post. Eventually it gave up. From that point forward when the elephant's leg was secured it believed it couldn't get away - even though it was fully capable of escaping, and had been for a long time. It remembered its struggle. That's one reason it's said, 'Elephants never forget.' And we are like that too. Our thinking limits us, just as an elephant's does. Usually it's because of fear. The truth is fear can steal your dreams. You may be afraid of failure. You may be afraid of rejection. You may not want to make a fool of yourself. You may be afraid of trying because you believe you can't succeed. If you give in to these thoughts and believe that you can't achieve your dream, you'll be right - and therefore unable to achieve your dream. Often what we fear has no connection to reality. But here's the good news: Fear can be overcome. The first step to overcoming it is to believe God when He says about you: '...You are My servant; I have chosen you...do not fear, for I am with you...I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with My righteous right hand.' (Isaiah 41:910 NIV)</p>

(Habakkuk 2:4; Romans 1:17; Galatians 3:11 NKJV) This is not a suggestion for theological debate; it's His will for your life. Clearly, God has made faith the only way to live! No alternative is offered. 'Without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to Him must believe that He exists and that He rewards those who earnestly seek Him.' (Hebrews 11:6 NIV) Let's take a moment and consider some questions arising from this life-transforming truth: (1) Who are 'the just'? Paul writes, 'Know that a person is not justified by observing the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. So we, too, have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith...' (Galatians 2:16 NIV) Justification (just-as-if-I'd-never-sinned) can't be earned, it's a free gift that comes by faith. If you have placed your trust in Christ then you are fully accepted in God's eyes. How good is that? (2) What is 'walking'? Paul says, 'We walk by faith and not by sight.' Walking requires that you get up and start moving. You can't just sit around aimlessly, waiting for the rapture. Walking involves: <em>Motivation</em> - you're moved by a purpose. <em>Direction</em> - you've chosen a destination, a goal to reach. <em>Motion </em>- you're committed to mobilising your energy and resources in the pursuit of your God-given destination and purpose. To walk by faith you must be engaged in consistent, forward movement intended to bring you into God's destiny for your life.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He has commanded us to love one another...' 2 John 1:6 NLT<br /><br /><p>Each morning pray: 'Lord, whether or not I get anything else done, help me to spend this day loving You and loving others, because that's what Your Word says life is all about.' If you do that, you'll treat those around you more graciously. And people will notice it. You'll start winning in areas where you've lost. The more time you give to someone, the more you reveal their importance to you. It's not enough to tell them they're important, you must prove it by investing in them. The best way to spell love is T-I-M-E. Love is not what you think or feel about others; no, it's how much you give of yourself to them. Men in particular struggle with this. They say, 'I don't understand my wife and children. I provide everything they need. What more could they want?' They want <em>you</em>! They want your attention! Love concentrates so intently on another that it forgets itself. This kind of attention says, 'I value you enough to give you my most precious asset - my time.' Why is now the best time to express your love? Because you don't know how long you'll have the opportunity to do so. Circumstances change, people die, children grow up. The truth is, you've no guarantee of tomorrow. If you want to express your love, you'd better do it now. So, who do you need to start spending more time with? What do you need to cut out of your schedule to make that possible? The best use of life is love, the best expression of love is time, and the best time to love is now.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...Approved and acceptable and in right relationship with Him....' 2 Corinthians 5:21 AMP<br /><br /></p>
<p>God loves and accepts you as much on your bad days as He does on your good ones. In a performance - based society, that's easy to forget. But you mustn't! God's acceptance is based on your standing in Christ, not the state of your life at a given time. 'For our sake He made Christ [virtually] to be sin who knew no sin, so that in and through Him we might become [endued with, viewed as being in, and examples of] the righteousness of God [what we ought to be, approved and acceptable and in right relationship with Him, by His (not our) goodness].' (2 Corinthians 5:21 AMP) Think of the cross as a trading post. There God took every sin you'd ever commit and laid it upon Jesus. And the moment you place your trust in Christ, God takes all of Christ's righteousness and wraps you up in it. From that point on, He sees you only one way - in Christ. How liberating! Liberating, because now you realise that your worth isn't based on what you do but on who you are in relationship to Christ. God actually assigned value to you by allowing Jesus to die for you. 'But I can't believe that God doesn't care about what I do.' You're right! And your rewards in Heaven will be based on your stewardship here on earth. God wants you to do good works, but He doesn't want you to depend on them for salvation; He wants you to do them out of love for Him. Once you understand your position, who you are in Christ, you begin doing the right things for the right reasons.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...bring Me an offering...' Exodus 25:2 NKJV<br /><br /><p>When it came time to build the Old Testament tabernacle, God said to Moses, 'See to it that you make them according to the pattern which was shown you.' (Exodus 25:40 NKJV) Whether you're building a relationship, a career, a business or a ministry, it will always require several elements: Sacrifice - the building of the tabernacle begins with these words: 'Speak to the children of Israel, that they bring Me an offering. From everyone who gives it willingly with his heart you shall take My offering.' Question: why would a God who is rich enough to pave His streets with gold, ask you for an offering? Because only when you have a personal investment in something will you give it your full attention, treasure it, prioritise it and protect it. Pastor, ask the Lord for the plan, then ask the people for the money, not vice versa. Paul wrote about the generosity of the Christians in Macedonia: 'They are being tested by many troubles, and they are very poor. But they are also filled with abundant joy, which has overflowed in rich generosity. For I can testify that they gave not only what they could afford, but far more and they did it of their own free will. They begged us again and again for the privilege of sharing...They even did more than we had hoped, for their first action was to give themselves to the Lord and to us, just as God wanted them to do.' (2 Corinthians 8:2-5 NLT) So, are you willing to sacrifice?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Make everything according to the pattern I have shown you...' Exodus 25:40 NLT<br /><br /><p>The second element that marked the building of the Old Testament tabernacle was excellence. God condemns perfectionism because it stifles our creativity and robs us of all sense of progress. And Jesus condemned those who gave to impress others. 'When you do a charitable deed, do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory from men. Assuredly, I say to you, they have their reward.' (Matthew 6:2 NKJV) But if you think this means you can just offer God anything you feel like, you're sorely mistaken. When it comes to serving, God wants you to aspire to excellence. God said to Moses: 'And this is the offering which you shall take from them: gold, silver, and bronze... And let them make Me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them. According to all that I show you, that is, the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of all its furnishings, just so you shall make it.' (Exodus 25:3-9 NKJV) Why did God ask for gold? Because He wanted the best not anything sloppy or second-rate. Guess where Luke records Jesus sat when He went to church. Beside the treasury, watching people give.  'Then a poor widow came by and dropped in two small coins. I tell you the truth, Jesus said, this poor widow has given more than all the rest of them. For they have given a tiny part of their surplus, but she, poor as she is, has given everything she has.' (Luke 21:2-4 NLT) So, give God your best!</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Go into all the world and preach...' Mark 16:15 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The third element in the building of the tabernacle was equal access. The word 'tabernacle' means <i>tent of meeting</i>. It's where God met and interacted with His people. So He positioned it in the middle of the camp, surrounded by each of the twelve tribes. Everybody had to be able to stand in the door of their tent and see God at work. Why? Because God dwelt and worked in the midst of all twelve tribes! There's an important lesson here for us. God doesn't see a white church or a black church or a yellow church or a brown church. Jesus said, '...I will build My church...' (Matthew 16:18 NIV) We have been called to provide everybody, regardless of culture, colour or creed, with equal access to God through Christ. There's a cute story about two children playing church when one says to the other, 'What abomination does your family belong to?' When God shows us a great truth or specific revelation we must share it, not put a fence around it. The last thing Jesus said to His disciples was, 'Go into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature.' And what did they do? 'They went out and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them and confirming the word through the accompanying signs...' (Mark 16:20 NKJV) Just because your church has a certain theology and worship style doesn't mean you get to ride first class while others travel in the guards' van. No, when God makes someone a member of His redeemed family, you must treat them as your brother and sister. So try to remember that!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I will give you...right desires...' Ezekiel 36:26 TLB<br /><br /><p><i>T</i><i>he Millionaire Next Door</i> is a bestselling book about two people living on the same street, in comparable homes, working at similar jobs. But by age fifty, one is financially secure while the other is drowning in debt. The problem isn't money; it's unwillingness to defer gratification. We want what we want now! Many times we associate happiness with spending, so when we feel down we go shopping. Think about it: When you got your last bonus or tax refund, was your first thought, 'What can I buy?' Be honest! Paul says, 'Do not conform to...this [world's value system]...be transformed by...renewing your mind...' (Romans 12:2 NIV) When it comes to money, you must ask God to give you 'right desires'. Robert Orben said, 'Every day I...read the Forbes magazine list of the richest people in America. If my name isn't on it, I get up and go to work!' The Bible says, 'Do not despise...small beginnings...' (Zechariah 4:10 NLT) Big things are a culmination of small ones. So: Give God the first tenth of your income, save ten percent, and live on the rest (Proverbs 3:9). As your earnings grow, invest 50 percent of the increase in a 'financial freedom account'. Once you stop spending every penny you earn and start saving, an interesting dynamic comes into play. The act of disciplining yourself to save even modest amounts will empower you financially, spiritually and emotionally. Abraham Heschel said, 'Self-respect is the root of discipline. Your sense of dignity grows with the ability to say no to yourself.' In addition to helping you achieve financial freedom, self-control enriches every area of your life.</p>

Do you feel lost in unfamiliar territory, uncertain as to what your next move should be? God uses such times to get your attention, call you back to Himself and encourage you to lean on Him, your unfailing source of strength and wisdom. Stop trying to figure everything out by yourself! God says, 'Call to Me and I will answer you and tell you...things you do not know.' Take your problem to the Lord and ask Him for a solution; He won't disappoint you. '...The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.' (James 5:16 NIV) Fourth, <i>learn the power of patience</i>. When the Holy Spirit gives you direction and puts a goal or dream in your heart, it's easy to be quick on the trigger and want it to happen overnight. Timing is crucial. And it's under God's control, not yours! Waiting for God's timing isn't wasting time, it's essential in developing two qualities you need - faith and hope. 'But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently.' (Romans 8:25 NIV) While you are learning patience, God is at work arranging things on your behalf, and also producing Christ-like qualities in you. The Psalmist said that his hope was in God. What's your hope in? Good luck? The economy? The doctor's prognosis? As long as your hope is in anything other than God's unfailing love and goodness, you'll wrestle with uncertainty. What's the answer? '...Their hearts are steadfast, trusting in the Lord.' (Psalm 112:7 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...It is [God] who gives you the ability to produce wealth...' Deuteronomy 8:18 NIV<br /><br /><p>The story of Elijah being fed by the ravens teaches us that God can take care of us in a bad economy (1 Kings 17:1-7). The story of Joseph teaches us that when we follow God's plan, we will have all that we need to get us through hard times (Genesis 41:37-57). One of the dangers of living in a materialistic society is that you feel 'entitled' to things, even when you can't afford them. To overcome financial anxiety you must practise fiscal discipline. God doesn't bless recklessness. You can't go into debt, then pray that God will get you out of it. Sometimes He does. But if you don't learn from your mistakes you'll just keep repeating them. A popular radio show in Atlanta, USA is hosted by a man called Clark Howard. He begins every programme by saying, 'Spend less, save more, and don't get ripped off.' He talks about banks that charge extortionate rates for credit cards, and tells people to live within their means. 'But I'm used to a certain lifestyle,' you say. Get unused to it! If you want peace of mind, learn the art of contentment. Does contentment mean you can't have ambition? No, it means delaying gratification and enjoying where you are, on your way to where you're going. It means learning to live by these words: 'I know how to live on almost nothing or with everything. I have learned the secret of living in every situation, whether it is with a full stomach or empty, with plenty or little. For I can do everything through Christ, who gives me strength.' (Philippians 4:12-13 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I am the Lord...who teaches you to profit...' Isaiah 48:17 NAS<br /><br /><p>The best way to overcome financial anxiety is by trusting God to meet all your needs. You say, 'That's nice, but what does God know about my business?' More than you think! He's the CEO of the whole world. When it comes to successful systems, nobody knows more than He does. He created the universe in precise order. He asks Job: 'Can you lead forth a constellation in its season...?' (Job 38:32 NAS) If one star could move even just a little out of orbit without His permission, the whole thing would dissolve into cosmic chaos. Yet when He needs to move a star, He can do it like He did for the wise men that first Christmas. Wall Street could learn a thing or two from Him! Here's part of His résumé: 'I am the Lord your God, who teaches you to profit, Who leads you in the way you should go.' (Isaiah 48:17 NAS) If you want to become more profitable, go into partnership with God. Does that mean you can just stay home from work, go fishing, and God will pay your mortgage? No, God doesn't reward laziness and inefficiency! The story's told of a pastor who stopped by to admire the garden of one of his parishioners. 'Isn't God's handiwork wonderful?' he said. The parishioner thought about it for a moment and then replied, 'Yeah, but you should have seen it when God had it all by Himself.' Understand this: (1) You've got to get up and go to work. (2) You've got to consult God before you make decisions. (3) You've got to honour God with your tithes and offerings (Malachi 3:8-12). (4) When you've done your best, you've got to trust God with the rest.</p>

<alias><![CDATA[living-fearlessly-2]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Do not fear, for I am with you...' Isaiah 41:10 NIV<br /><br /><p>The words 'fear not' appear in the Bible all the way from Genesis to Revelation. Why is that? Because God understands that fear is not only our biggest enemy but our constant companion, and He wants to help us overcome it. Our comfort zones constrain us, imprisoning us in a thought system of our own devising. They are patrolled by sentries - negative thoughts and unexamined fears - that keep us firmly behind bars. But the good news is, because fears are feelings, the faulty ones can be removed by faith in God, and you can become free from them. Does this mean you can live totally free from fear? No, writer Michael Ignatieff says: 'Living fearlessly is not the same thing as never being afraid. It's good to be afraid occasionally. Fear is a great teacher. What's not good is living in fear, allowing fear to dictate your choices, allowing fear to define who you are. Living fearlessly means standing up to fear, taking its measure, refusing to let it shape and define your life. Living fearlessly means taking risks, taking gambles, not playing it safe. It means refusing to take 'no' for an answer when you are sure that the answer should have been 'yes'. It means refusing to settle for less than what you are due, what is yours by right, what is yours by the sweat of your labour and your effort.' And let's add - what God has promised and planned for you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I will uphold you with My...right hand.' Isaiah 41:10 NIV<br /><br /><p>When you know that what you're doing is in sync with God's will, you can be confident He will provide what you need and fight for you. God told His people, 'When you go to war against your enemies and see horses and chariots and an army greater than yours, do not be afraid of them, because the Lord your God, who brought you up out of Egypt, will be with you.' (Deuteronomy 20:1 NIV) Then God added something else: '...Is any man afraid or fainthearted? Let him go home so that his brothers will not become disheartened too.' (Deuteronomy 20:8 NIV) God knows that when you allow fear to rule your heart, it's fatal, not only for you, but to those around you. Playwright David Mamet wrote: 'On June 5th, 1944, thousands of American paratroopers jumped into Normandy. Four men refused to jump. Can anyone imagine the rest of these men's lives? What prodigies of selfexcuse, rationale or repression they must have had to employ. Their lives, in effect, ended the day they refused to leave that plane...We all die in the end, but there's no reason to die in the middle.' You don't overcome fear overnight. But gradually, day by day, you can get it by the scruff of the neck and bring it under control. '...the people who know their God shall be strong, and carry out great exploits.' (Daniel 11:32 NKJV) The word 'know' means 'to be in relationship with, or to be intimate with.' Want to overcome your fears? Spend time in God's Word. Prioritise your prayer life. Get to <i>know</i> God better. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['But we all...are changed...by the Spirit of the Lord.' 2 Corinthians 3:18 KJV<br /><br /><p>Jesus asked the question, 'Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?' (Matthew 7:3 NIV) Expecting more out of people than they're able to give will hurt your relationships, not help them. People need the freedom to be who they are. That doesn't mean they don't need or want to change. But nobody appreciates being given the message, even subtly, that they must change in order to be loved and accepted. We're more likely to change for those who are willing to accept us with our shortcomings, than for those who demand we live by their rules. One thing is certain: God won't change the people we're trying to change until we adopt a 'hands off' policy. We must get out of His way and let Him work! Even when we think we're hiding our disapproval, people still feel it. It's in our voice and body language. Prayer, not pressure, is the greatest agent for change. If we truly love people we'll pray for them and allow God to work on them His way, on His schedule, and for His glory. Many of those who irritate us are simply being themselves; their personality just doesn't mesh with ours. Sometimes we want them to change when we need to change. Often the things we require in other people are already available for us to enjoy, if we'll just stop judging them. For change to be lasting, it must come from the inside out. And only the Spirit of God can bring that kind of change. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Who are you...?' John 1:22 NKJV<br /><br /><p>When asked, 'Who are you?' John the Baptist replied, '...The voice of one crying in the wilderness: Make straight the way of the Lord...' (John 1:23 NKJV) After listening to John for a while, his disciples left him to follow Christ. And that was ok with John, because he knew what he was called to do. Do you? You can only go on for so long 'trying things.' At some point you've got to discover what God's called you to do and give yourself fully to it. Apparently Paul wasn't a particularly great speaker: 'I came to you...timid and trembling...my message and my preaching were very plain...' (1 Corinthians 2:34 NLT) But what Paul lacked as a speaker, he more than compensated for as a writer. He wrote the inspired word that enabled others to preach! Something so powerful was released through Paul's writings that, even when they threw him in jail, he didn't ask for a lawyer or a gourmet meal because he was tired of prison food. No, he wanted paper so that he could keep writing. In fact, Paul wrote all the way to the end of his life. And because he did, lives are still being changed today. What a legacy! And all because one man discovered his calling and devoted himself to it. So the question is: Have you discovered your calling and devoted yourself to it? George Bernard Shaw wrote: 'Life is no brief candle to me. It is a sort of splendid torch which I get to hold for a moment, and I want to make it burn as brightly as possible before turning it over to future generations.' </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He faced all of the same testings we do...' Hebrews 4:15 NLT<br /><br /><p>The Lord understands what you are going through today because He has been where you are. The Bible says: 'This High Priest of ours understands our weaknesses, for he faced all of the same testings we do...So let us come boldly to the throne of our gracious God. There we will receive mercy, and we will find grace to help us when we need it most.' (Hebrews 4:15-16 NLT) That means: (1) <i>Jesus understands your family problems</i> He had a family of His own. And on one occasion they said, '...He's out of His mind...' (Mark 3:21 NLT) (2) <i>Jesus understands when you feel overwhelmed</i> 'Then Jesus said, &quot;Let's go off by ourselves to a quiet place and rest awhile.&quot; He said this because there were so many people coming and going that Jesus and His apostles didn't even have time to eat.' (Mark 6:31 NLT) Jesus not only dealt with onthejob pressures, He had to organise, train and correct His own followers, including a group of uneducated fishermen, a bigot, and a despised tax collector. (3) <i>Jesus unde</i><i>rstands when you feel rejected</i> The town He grew up in had no use for Him: 'He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him.' (John 1:11 NKJV) When Philip said, 'We have found the one whom Moses wrote about... He is Jesus...from Nazareth,' Nathaniel replied, 'Can anything good come from Nazareth?'(John 1:45 GNT) And Jesus' family tree was nothing to write home about either. Rahab was a prostitute, Jacob was a crook, David was an adulterer - to name just a few. Yes, Jesus understands. He knows where you're at today and He's able to help you. So talk to Him!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He faced all of the same testings we do...' Hebrews 4:15 NLT<br /><br /><p>Are you disappointed in people? Jesus understands, because in the final analysis, those He loved and counted on let Him down. Judas, His treasurer, sold Him out, and then sealed the deal with a kiss. Even in His darkest hour, Gethsemane, His closest disciples, Peter, James and John, couldn't stay awake and pray with Him for an hour (Matthew 26:40). Are you tired of all the demands? Jesus understands. 'A vast crowd brought to him people who were lame, blind, crippled, those who couldn't speak, and many others. They laid them before Jesus, and He healed them all.' (Matthew 15:30 NLT) You say, 'But if Jesus was God how could He get tired?' Because He was both God and man. He had to be God in order to save us, and man in order to die for us. '...Jesus, tired from the long walk, sat wearily beside the well about noontime.' (John 4:6 NLT) Have you been falsely accused? Jesus understands. They accused Him of being '...a glutton and a drunkard.' (Matthew 11:19 NLT) Up until the time of His death they were still trying '...to find something false...so they could kill Him.' (Matthew 26:59 NCV) And Jesus said, '...The servant is not greater than his lord...' (John 15:20 KJV) When you decide to follow Jesus, you're signing up for a life of advancement - and adversity! So why did Jesus go through these things? 'Since He Himself has gone through suffering...He is able to help us...' (Hebrews 2:18 NLT) He walked the path you're on today so that you could go to Him knowing He understands, and that He is able to help.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Give all your worries...to God, for He cares about you.' 1 Peter 5:7 NLT<br /><br /><p>Think about the things you worried about last year, or even last week. How many came to pass? Statistically, 10 percent at most! And did all your worrying make them better or worse? And what about the physical and emotional toll that worry is taking on you? Dr. Charles Mayo, founder of the famous Mayo Clinic, said, 'Worry negatively affects the circulation, the heart, the glands, and the whole nervous system. It profoundly affects your health. I have never known a person who died from overwork, but many who died from worry.' So when are you going to face up to the fact that you worry too much, and do something about it? 'What can I do?' you ask. The Bible says, 'Give all your worries and cares to God, for He cares about you.' By committing each day to the Lord, you are trusting Him to go before you and work things out for the best. It's the only way to live! Worry doesn't work. It's like a rocking chair; it will give you something to do and keep you going, but it won't get you anywhere! Life is too big for any of us to handle alone. So when worry comes to prey on your mind, attack it with the promises of God. Go ahead, bring your fears to God and watch them shrivel and die: '...God's peace, which goes beyond anything we can imagine, will guard your thoughts and emotions through Christ Jesus.' (Philippians 4:7 GWT) George Müller said, 'The beginning of anxiety is the end of faith, and the beginning of true faith is the end of anxiety.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Pray in the Spirit at all times and on every occasion...' Ephesians 6:18 NLT <br /><br /><p>In August 1806, five Williams College students met in a field for one of their twiceweekly prayer meetings when a thunderstorm drove them to take refuge in a nearby haystack. Continuing in prayer, Samuel John Mills shared his burden that Christianity should be sent abroad, and the group prayed that American missions would spread Christianity through the east. The haystack prayer meeting held in Williamstown, Massachusetts, is viewed by many scholars as the spark that ignited American support for world missions. In 1808, the haystack prayer group and other Williams students formed 'The Brethren,' a society organised to effect, through its members, a mission to the unsaved. Within a few years they inspired the founding of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM). Several of the students, including Adoniram Judson, went to Asia as missionaries (the first foreign missionaries sent from America in 1812). Samuel John Mills stayed stateside to recruit others, and helped organise the American Bible Society and the United Foreign Missionary Society. In its fifty years, ABCFM sent out over 1,250 missionaries. In 1961, the American Board merged to form the United Church Board for World Missions (UCBWM). After 150 years, the American Board had sent out nearly 5,000 missionaries to 34 different fields. And it all began with five young men praying in a haystack! Nothing can take the place of prayer - not money, not programmes. The truth is, we can do great things after we pray, but we cannot do great things until we pray. So the word for you today is, 'Let us pray.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['In his heart a man plans his course, but the Lord determines his steps.' Proverbs 16:9 NIV<br /><br /><p>Remember needing a road atlas when you took a trip? Now you just program your destination into the car's GPS and it tells you where and when to turn, how far to the next petrol station, and when you'll arrive. No guessing, confusion and wrong decisions; just choose the shortest or fastest route and it will get you there. As a follower of Christ you have a divine GPS, which is the Holy Spirit. He chooses the route and the timing, and guarantees that you'll get to your destination. By listening to Him you learn four valuable lessons. Let's look at them: First, <em>learn to depend on God rather than yourself</em>. Assuming you know all the twists and turns of life makes you act without consulting God. Samson believed he'd 'figured how the system worked'. When Delilah sold him out and the Philistines bound him with ropes, he thought he'd handle things the way he always did: '...I will do as before and shake myself free. But he didn't realise the Lord had left him.' (Judges 16:20 NLT) Living victoriously means living in total dependence on God, not yourself. Jesus said, '...Without Me you can do nothing.' (John 15:5 NKJV) Second, <em>change your perspective</em>. You may not always look where you're going, but you will always end up going where you're looking! Your perspective determines your choices and direction in life. After paying dearly for following his lower impulses, David changed his perspective and prayed, 'My eyes are fixed on You...Lord...' (Psalm 141:8 NIV) You should pray that too.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Lord, &quot;Increase our faith.&quot;' Luke 17:5 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Why do we experience so much doubt? (1) <i>Because doubt satisfies our need for self</i><i>protection</i> We don't like to be wrong, to get hurt, or to fail, so our subconscious reasoning says, 'It's easier not to trust, to lower my expectations so I won't be disappointed.' But you are disappointed, aren't you? Why? Because of your doubt. (2) <i>Because doubting comes easily</i> We don't wake up in the morning and say to ourselves, 'Today I'm going to doubt God.' No, doubt moves into a vacuum; it takes over when we don't do the right things. '...Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.' (Romans 10:17 NKJV) If you don't keep your mind filled with God's Word; you'll be constantly assailed by doubts. (3) <i>Because doubters are easy to find</i>. Sometimes the people around us dwell on all the obstacles and difficulties, opening the door to doubt. And once that stream starts flowing, you get carried along with it. (4) <i>Because doubting is contagious</i> Doubt is easier to catch than the common cold, and its carriers are words. The Bible says, 'You are trapped by your own words.' (Proverbs 6:2 CEV) The words you speak (and listen to) will either build you up or tear you down, increase your faith or decrease it. For example, 'What will I do?' versus, 'In God's strength I can handle it.' Or, 'It's awful' versus, 'It's a learning experience.' Or, 'I see no way out' versus 'It's not too big for God.' Words are powerful things. They determine your outlook and approach to life. So in order to move from doubt to faith you must start eliminating unscriptural words from your life! </p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Great persecution broke out...and all...were scattered...' Acts 8:1 NIV<br /><br /><p>Jesus never intended for His disciples to get comfortable in Jerusalem and stay there. He told them, '...Forgiveness of sins will be preached in [My] name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.' (Luke 24:47 NIV) They were only supposed to remain in Jerusalem long enough to be infused with power, then take the Gospel to the world. But they '...returned to Jerusalem...and...stayed continually at the temple, praising God.' (Luke 24:5253 NIV) Now it's ok to wait on God for directions and the power to carry them out, but not to keep repeating some earlier experience you've had. Jesus said, 'You will receive power...and you will be My witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all of Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.' (Acts 1:8 NIV) So how did God get them out of their comfort zone? By lighting a fire under them! '...Great persecution broke out against the church at Jerusalem, and...those who had been scattered preached the Word wherever they went.' (Acts 8:14 NIV) We all believe the Gospel must be preached to every nation, but few of us want to leave home and take it to them. We're willing to pray, and even pay, as long as we get to stay. But when God has a mission for you, He will do whatever it takes to get you moving. Before He will let you miss out on your destiny, He will permit trouble to uproot you. You can't freezeframe the past or relive it. And you can't keep God's blessing to yourself. When God lights a fire under you, He's saying; 'It's time for you to move!'</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['The Lord said...&quot;Go on before the people...&quot;' Exodus 17:5 KJV<br /><br /><p>To be a good leader you must do these two things: (1) <i>Spend time with the people</i> For four hundred years the children of Israel had been leaderless. As a result, they had no identity or selfworth. Actually, they had a slave mentality. So Moses often walked amongst them, because sheep gain confidence by smelling the shepherd's scent and rubbing up against him. Getting the idea? If you're afraid to get close to people, maybe it's because you've too much to hide - like pride or insecurity or weakness. Only when people feel truly valued will they value you and follow you. (2) <i>Get out ahead of the people</i> How do you know when it's time to move to new territory? '...The people murmured against Moses...' (Exodus 17:3 KJV) That's because there was no water where they were, and thirsty sheep always complain. When the murmuring starts, you may have spent too long socialising. It's time for transition. 'The Lord said to Moses, &quot;Go on before the people...strike the rock, and water will come out of it.&quot;' (Exodus 17:56 NKJV) When you stop trying to fit in, and get out ahead of them, God will give you supernatural resources equal to the challenge you're facing. No vision is permanently stopped by lack of finances, but by a lack of faith and courage, and an unwillingness to step out and take risks. When you do, you'll discover that God can '...supply all your need according to His riches in glory...' (Philippians 4:19 NKJV) According to what? His riches! And they are available when you're willing to get out of your comfort zone and act boldly. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you...' Matthew 28:20 NKJV<br /><br /><p>If God has called you to be a teacher in the church, here are three principles you need to live by: (1) <i>Before you feed others, feed yourself</i> Don't just go to the Bible for something to say, go for something to eat. Jeremiah said, 'Your words were found, and I ate them; and Your Word was to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart...' (Jeremiah 15:16 NKJV) People know when you're saying things that are not a reality in your own life. It's what Dr. John Maxwell refers to as 'The law of the lid.' Nothing rises higher than its leadership! (2) <i>L</i><i>ove people, but don</i><i>'</i><i>t cling to them</i> They are God's people, not yours! Your assignment to them is for a reason and for a season; when it's complete, release them into God's care. Then get a life, and centre it on Christ. (3) <i>Truth is timeless, but methods </i><i>are temporary</i> What got you to where you are won't necessarily get you to where you need to be. To be 'called' means you'll always be moving from something, toward something. If what you're doing isn't working, seek God for fresh instructions. If your goal is to fit comfortably within the framework of where you started and make no waves, you'll never enjoy what God has for you further down the road. You can't pray for growth and resist change. Do you know why Jesus healed blind people in different ways? So we'd never be able to say, 'This is the only way.' Acknowledging that keeps you sharp, keeps you humble, and keeps you credible as a leader. </p>

<title><![CDATA[Believe God for Your Healing]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[believe-god-for-your-healing]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...I am the Lord, who heals you.' Exodus 15:26 NIV<br /><br /><p>In the Bible, one of the names God chooses to be called by is <i>Jehovah Rapha</i>, which means 'I am the Lord who heals.' Now, if God calls Himself the healer, then you have the right to believe what He says and expect that, given an opportunity, He will perform His role competently. After all, His credibility depends on living up to His name. The Psalmist said, '...Your promises are backed by all the honour of Your name.' (Psalm 138:2 NLT) Has God changed? No; He says, '...I am the Lord AllPowerful, and I never change.' (Malachi 3:6 CEV) And Jesus, who is God, is '...the same yesterday and today and forever.' (Hebrews 13:8 NIV) What He was, He still is. What He did, He still does. So, when you or a loved one is sick, do these two things: (1) <i>Pray, in faith believing</i> A 'good faith' deal requires that both parties trust each other's word. Their trust is a rational decision of their will, not their emotions. Faith is your will deciding that God will keep the promise He has made to you. It's refusing to be ambivalent by saying, 'If only I felt more positive.' No business could survive such ambiguity. Jesus spelled it out clearly: '...All things for which you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and they will be granted you.' (Mark 11:24 NAS) (2) <i>Look for faith</i><i>partners who will pray with you</i> '...Pray for each other so that you may be healed...' (James 5:16 NLT) '...If two of you agree...concerning anything you ask, My Father in Heaven will do it for you.' (Matthew 18:19 NLT)</p>

<title><![CDATA[Confront Them - in Love!]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[confront-them-in-love]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Speaking the truth in love...' Ephesians 4:15 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Sometimes love requires confronting people. But it must be done in the right way, and only over the right issues. If you spend your life correcting people you'll finish up with no credibility, and no friends. At what point should you confront somebody? Only when you've answered these questions: (a) Is it important? If it involves a destructive habit, an abusive behaviour, a major doctrinal error, or a situation that could hurt them, it's important - get involved. (b) Is it chronic? If you observe the same thing happening over and over, it doesn't have to be big to get your love in gear. (c) Have you earned the right to speak? If a casual acquaintance does something unwise, it's probably none of your business. But if someone close to you does it, it's both appropriate and loving to say, 'That will hurt you.' Paul points out four things about love in 1 Corinthians 13:45 NIV: (1) 'It is not rude.' It doesn't use the aggressive, heavyhanded approach. (2) 'It is not selfseeking.' It forgets about the need to be accepted, and makes sure that what the other person hears is filtered only by kindness. It refuses to walk away having spoken half the truth. (3) 'It is not easily angered.' When you confront someone in love, don't be upset if you get an angry response such as, 'Who are you to tell me?' The right medicine doesn't taste good, but it heals. (4) 'It keeps no record of wrongs.' When you have been hurt, it's critical that you deal with it and put it behind you. Only then can you confront someone for their own good. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Lift your eyes and look to the heavens...' Isaiah 40:26 NIV<br /><br /><p>Wernher von Braun, the first director of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Centre, who's known as 'the father of the American space programme,' stated in a published article in May 1974: 'One cannot be exposed to the law and order of the universe without concluding that there must be a design and purpose behind it all...The better we understand the intricacies of the universe...the more reason we have found to marvel at the inherent design upon which it is based...To be forced to believe only one conclusion - that everything in the universe happened by chance - would violate the very objectivity of science itself...What random process could produce the brains of a man or the system of the human eye?...They [evolutionists] challenge science to prove the existence of God. But must we really light a candle to see the sun?...They say they cannot visualise a designer. Well, can a physicist visualise an electron? What strange rationale makes some physicists accept the inconceivable electron as real, while refusing to accept the reality of a designer on the ground that they cannot conceive Him?' This devotional you are reading was not the result of an explosion in a printing press. No, if there's a book, then there must be a publisher. If there's a building, then there must be an architect and builder. If there's a work of art, then there must be an artist. 'Lift your eyes and look to the heavens: Who created all these? He who brings out the starry host one by one, and calls them each by name. Because of His great power and mighty strength, not one of them is missing.' </p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...we belong to each other...' Ephesians 4:25 NLT<br /><br /><p>In the first chapters of Genesis we read, 'And God saw that it was good.' The first reference to something being 'not good' was when God said, 'It is not good for the man to be alone...' (Genesis 2:18 NIV) Adam was enjoying a great relationship with God, but because he didn't have a human companion, God said it wasn't a good thing. God designed you with two voids. One is a void only He Himself can fill. The other is a void only the right people can fill. And you can't fill either void with things like jobs, houses, cars or money. You say, 'What should I do?' (1) <i>Keep your eyes open</i> Today one in five relationships begins on the Internet. But there's a builtin danger there; you can be anybody you want to be on the internet, yet not be known and loved for the person you really are. Furthermore, loneliness can blind you to your own true needs and another person's lack of character. (2) <i>Pray about it</i> When Eliezer, Abraham's servant, was sent to find a wife for Isaac he prayed, 'O Lord...give me success today...' (Genesis 24:42 NIV) And God did. Isaac and Rebekah became one of the great love stories of the Bible. (3) <i>Reach out to others</i> That may mean taking down the wall you've been hiding behind and building a bridge. The Bible says, 'Do not be interested only in your own life...be interested in...others.' (Philippians 2:4 NCV) There are no perfect relationships, or riskfree ones. It's in finding an unmet need and pouring yourself into it that you conquer loneliness and discover a new joy in living.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Parents are the pride of their children.' Proverbs 17:6 NIV<br /><br /><p>Your child is already in the process of becoming the kind of person he or she is eventually going to be. So, to bring them up right and to make them proud of you, live by these six principles: (1) <i>Assure them of your love</i> They need to know your love is given, and it will never be withdrawn because of their appearance, achievements or actions. Let them know they are loved for who they are, and that their worth in your eyes is never in question. (2) <i>Build strong character and godly values</i> 'Direct your children onto the right path, and when they are older, they will not leave it.' (Proverbs 22:6 NLT) (3) <i>Establish clear boundaries</i> And be consistent in maintaining them. Do children like rules? No. But your first goal is not to make your child happy, it's to teach them responsibility. Happiness will follow. (4) <i>Help them to discover thei</i><i>r potential</i> That means listening, observing, and once their talents are identified, helping to develop them. 'We have different gifts, according to the grace given us...' (Romans 12:6 NIV) (5) <i>Don</i><i>'</i><i>t try to duplicate yourself through them</i> God gave each of your children their own unique makeup and personality. So don't try to make them something that God and the rest of us don't need one more of. (6) <i>Encourage them to pursue their life</i><i>'</i><i>s vision</i> '...Your young men [and women] shall see visions.' (Joel 2:28 KJV) Don't pour cold water on the fire of their enthusiasm, fan it. Get out of the critic's seat and become their greatest supporter. If you do, you will make them proud of you. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Let us...love one another...' 1 John 4:7 NLT<br /><br /><p>Love is slow to suspect but quick to trust; slow to condemn but quick to justify; slow to offend but quick to defend; slow to expose but quick to shield; slow to reprimand but quick to empathise; slow to belittle but quick to appreciate; slow to demand but quick to give; slow to provoke but quick to help; slow to resent but quick to forgive. Jerry Cook talks about a church where the people make the following pledge to each other: 'I'll never knowingly say or do anything to hurt you. I'll always, in every circumstance, seek to help and support you. If you're down and I can lift you, I'll do that. If you need something and I have it, I'll share it with you. If I need to, I'll give it to you. No matter what I find out about you, no matter what happens in the future - either good or bad - my commitment to you will never change. And there's nothing you can do about it.' 1 Corinthians 13:7 NKJV says love: (1) 'Believes all things.' When someone you care about is called into question, love says, 'That's not the kind of person they are; that's not what they meant.' (2) 'Hopes all things.' Love sees people not just as they are, but as they can be through God's grace. And if you let Him, God will download that kind of love into your heart. (3) 'Endures all things.' The Greek word for 'endure' is a military term. It means driving a stake into the ground. It's like saying, 'I'll stand my ground in loving you.' Today, take the love that God has given to you, and give it to others. </p>

<alias><![CDATA[the-call-to-leadership-1]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Rise and stand on your feet...' Acts 26:16 NKJV<br /><br /><p>If God has called you to leadership, you'll be unfulfilled in any other role. God told Paul, 'Rise and stand on your feet; for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to make you a minister...' Notice what the call to leadership requires: (1) <i>Competence</i> You must recognise your gifts, and then channel your energies into where you're most likely to succeed. That means acknowledging your limitations and helping equip others to fill them. To do that, you must be secure. (2) <i>Courage</i> Scott Peck said, 'The best decision makers are those who are willing to suffer the most over their decisions but still retain their ability to be decisive.' Good leaders are not necessarily the cleverest or most creative people, they're just the ones with the courage to step out and go first. So, '...be strong and very courageous.' (Joshua 1:7 NKJV) (3) <i>Clarity</i> Your life's vision may come at once, but the steps are revealed over time. Don't allow a lack of answers to leave you paralysed. Be clear about your goal, even though you're not certain as to the details. (4) <i>Coaching</i> Without a good coach you'll never be as good as you could be. If you're hoping to learn everything from personal experience, all the best; you'll have to outlive Methuselah! (5) <i>Character</i> You can lead without character, but you can't be a leader worth following. Character provides the moral authority to bring together the people and resources needed to get the job done. Your talent has the potential to take you places where your character can't sustain you. That thought should keep you on your knees. </p>

<title><![CDATA[Dealing With Temptation]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[dealing-with-temptation]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...When you are tempted, He will...provide a way out...' 1 Corinthians 10:13 NIV <br /><br /><p>Temptation brings with it feelings of guilt. As a result we get discouraged and think, 'If I were a better Christian I wouldn't have such thoughts. I've prayed, over and over. Why doesn't God just take it away?' Temptation never goes away! Prayer doesn't remove it, prayer just drives you closer to God and He gives you power over it. 'Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.' (James 4:7 NIV) The Bible says, 'The temptations in your life are no different from what others experience. And God is faithful. He will not allow the temptation to be more than you can stand...He will show you a way out so...you can endure.' (1 Corinthians 10:13 NLT) When you're tempted you never have to wonder what the right thing to do is. God makes His will clear in Scripture and He's given us His Spirit to convict, guide and empower us. Plus, we can '...approach the throne of grace with confidence...and find grace to help us in our time of need.' (Hebrews 4:16 NIV) Richard Blackaby writes: 'It is a...mistake not to take temptation seriously... Many who have succumbed...thought they were strong enough to resist...When wickedness surrounds you, never assume you're immune...remove [yourself] from temptation's way...' 'Put away the evil from among you.' (Deuteronomy 22:21 NKJV) Keep any form of temptation out of your home, your relationships and your mind by maintaining your love relationship with God and recognising you're powerless to resist in your own strength. When Joseph was tempted to commit adultery he fled (Genesis 39:12). Darkness and light can't coexist. Run from the darkness to the light!</p>

<alias><![CDATA[turn-your-weakness-into-a-weapon]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'I know it is all for Christ's good...' 2 Corinthians 12:10 NLT</p>
<p>Speaking of his 'thorn', Paul writes: 'Three different times I begged the Lord to take it away. Each time He said, &amp;quot;My gracious favour is all you need. My power works best in your weakness.&amp;quot; So now I am glad to boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may work through me. Since I know it is all for Christ's good, I am quite content with my weaknesses... For when I am weak, then I am strong.' (2 Corinthians 12:8-10 NLT) Paul learned how to turn his weakness into a weapon by allowing it to drive him closer to God. And that's a lesson you must learn too. The NLT Bible paraphrases Christ's first beatitude: 'God blesses those who are poor and realise their need for Him, for the Kingdom of Heaven is theirs.' (Matthew 5:3) Now, you can't just accept your character flaws and areas of defeat and say, 'Well, I guess that's just the way I am.' No, you must confront each area of weakness, confess it, and 'let Christ take over'. You will always struggle with one thing or another. Paul recognised this: '...But this precious treasure - this light and power that now shine within us - is held in perishable containers, that is, in our weak bodies. So everyone can see that our glorious power is from God and is not our own.' (2 Corinthians 4:7 NLT) Like common pottery, fragile, flawed and easily broken, God will use you as you surrender and allow Him to work through you.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Search me, O God, and know my heart...' Psalm 139:23 NIV<br /><br /><p>When you live an unexamined life - it shows! One pastor writes: 'I've read many Christian authors who say that if Christ's followers aren't growing, it's because they don't make a habit of evaluating their lives... Those authors were describing me. I was always on the go, never looking deeply inside... I never did the kind of reflection that leads to growth, and I was paying the price - committing the same stupid sins over and over, living with the same heavy load of guilt. So I made a difficult decision: I decided that each day I would try to honestly assess my soul's condition. I would look inside myself and write down what I saw... Feeling awkward and embarrassed, I started to write. &quot;God, here are some areas of failure in my life. They aren't going away, so I might as well take a look at them.&quot; Or, &quot;Here's a relationship or habit I'm concerned about. It's not good and I don't know how to improve it.&quot; ...After writing a paragraph or two I would reflect on what I had written.' There are benefits to keeping a spiritual diary of your walk with God that you can't get any other way: (1) It forces you to slow down and examine the effectiveness of what you're doing. (2) It frees you to ask, 'Why am I doing this? How do I really feel about it? What is God saying to me?' (3) By writing even a page a day, in one year you will have a 365-day record of prayers answered and lessons learned!</p>

<alias><![CDATA[set-boundaries-4]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'I can do all things...' Philippians 4:13 NKJV<br /><br /></p>
<p><em>Flexible boundaries</em>: Rigid boundaries cause you to shut other people out and live unprepared and ill-equipped for the give-and-take that healthy relationships require. Permeable boundaries leave you defenceless against 'users' who feel entitled to manipulate you and who expect to be taken care of at your expense. But flexible boundary people are competent for living their own life, yet with a balanced and healthy interest in others. They can be generous in sharing their time, compassion and resources, without becoming overly responsible, or betraying their God-given duty to be the unique person He made them, just to please others. They say, 'I can be in a relationship with you, without giving up being me!' They don't let you violate their boundaries, and they know how to keep from violating yours. Unlike rigid people, they bend and adjust as circumstances require, without becoming overwhelmed, defensive, resentful, blaming or reactive. In tough situations they roll with the punches, stay focused and draw on a well of inner strength which God provides. Paul was such a person: 'I've learned the secret of being content in any and every situation... I can do all this through Him who gives me strength.' (Philippians 4:12-13 NIV) People and circumstances don't control them; they flex, and let God take charge. They are helpful, but they don't feel guilty because they can't 'fix' everybody. Their boundaries enable them to adjust to circumstances. They practise the principle, 'Bear one another's burdens...' (Galatians 6:2 NKJV), without over-functioning or being responsible for others.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['God has surely listened and has heard my prayer.' Psalm 66:19 NIV<br /><br /><p>The Psalmist wrote: 'If I had cherished sin in my heart, the Lord would not have listened; but God has surely listened and has heard my prayer.' (Psalm 66:18-19 NIV) The character flaws you are working on, and your tendency to stumble from time to time, don't disqualify you from God's blessing. The sin you 'cherish' does that. In prayer the <em>first</em> thing God will want to talk to you about is usually the thing you want to talk to Him about - namely, the sin you don't want to let go of. It will actually keep you from the place of prayer. When Adam sinned he hid from God, saying, 'I heard Your voice...and I was afraid because I was naked...' (Genesis 3:10 NKJV) Billy Graham said: 'The Christian should have an appetite for prayer. He should want to pray. One does not have to force food upon a healthy child. Exercise, good circulation, health and labour demand food for sustenance. So it is with those who are spiritually healthy. They have an appetite for the Word of God and for prayer... A little girl committed a certain offence and when her mother discovered it she began to question her daughter. Immediately the child lost her smile and a cloud darkened her face as she said, &quot;Mother, I don't feel like talking.&quot; So it is with us when our fellowship with God is broken by sin in our lives. We do not feel like talking to Him.' So, if <em>you</em> don't feel like praying today, it's probably a good indication that you need to.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed.' Luke 5:16 NIV<br /><br /><p>Habits are powerful things. We form our habits, then our habits form us. So this year are you going to stop talking about it, and make it a habit to spend time with God in prayer each day? If your desire is to be like Jesus, you must begin to pray regularly, for He 'often withdrew to lonely places and prayed.' Don't let the word 'lonely' intimidate you. Once you cultivate an awareness of God's presence, you'll prefer His company to that of anybody else. Don't let the word 'withdrew' intimidate you. Just shut off your TV, your computer and your mobile phone and you'll make a wonderful discovery: '...You will show me the path of life; in Your presence is fullness of joy; at Your right hand are pleasures forevermore.' (Psalm 16:11 NKJV) John Wesley said, 'I have so much to do that I must spend several hours in prayer before I am able to do it.' Martin Luther said, 'Prayer is the most important thing in my life. If I should neglect prayer for a single day, I should lose a great deal of the fire of faith.' Willian Walford wrote: 'Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer, that calls me from a world of care. And bids me at my Father's throne, make all my wants and wishes known. In seasons of distress and grief my soul has often found relief, and often escaped the tempter's snare, by thy return, sweet hour of prayer.' When the disciples asked Jesus about prayer, He began by saying, '<i>When</i> you pray...' (Matthew 6:9 NCV) He assumed they'd have a regular time for prayer. Could He assume that about you?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Good news...for all the people.' Luke 2:10 NIV<br /><br /><p>For many people Christmas is a sad time. Author Jon Walker writes: 'I'm sitting in a fast food restaurant observing a young girl celebrating an early Christmas with her mother. Her presents are spread out across the booth and she just said, I miss you, Mommy. I miss you too, baby, her mother says. Beyond the booth...a woman casually but carefully watches them. Using my journalist's eye, I put it all together. The watching woman is a social worker supervising a structured visit for a mother and child who are doing their best to celebrate Christmas...a few minutes later foster parents arrive and take the little girl home. The mother leaves alone. There's a darker side to Christmas we rarely acknowledge. We create this fantasy that seldom matches reality, even in the best of homes...many Christmas memories are full of tension, not tinsel...the holidays are just another excuse for Mummy to get drunk, or Daddy to be with his new family...yet another reminder that the one we love is far away or perhaps never coming back...The suicide rate is extraordinarily high in December, depression as common as <i>Joy to the World</i>, more people hurt at Christmas than we initially imagine. For those tired of the hollow hope and false fantasies of Christmas, the good news is, <i>God is with us</i>.' Jesus came to earth to 'bring...good news...for all the people', and regardless of your situation Christmas is the best gift you'll ever get, because: (1) It's the costliest you'll ever receive because it cost Jesus His life. (2) It's the only gift that lasts forever. (3) It's one you can enjoy for the rest of your life.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Where is He who has been born...?' Matthew 2:2 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Matthew records: 'Now after Jesus was born...wise men from the East came to Jerusalem, saying, 'Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the East and have come to worship Him...when...they saw the young Child with Mary His mother, [they] fell down and worshipped Him.' (Matthew 2:1-11) Because of the International Date Line you can fly from America on December 24th and arrive in Australia on December 26th, missing Christmas Day altogether. But you can also stay home and miss it, end up exhausted, broke, glad it's over, and not experience the joy it brings. Don't let that happen to you. Try something different. Before you dive into gift giving, partying or watching parades and sport on television, gather your loved ones around and read them the Christmas story. Your children will never forget it. They might even make it a tradition they carry on with their children too: (1) Tell them that whether you are rich like the wise men or poor like the shepherds, Jesus loves you. Your social status makes no difference; He values you as you are. (2) Tell them that when Jesus came, He never left. His Word says, '...I will never leave you nor forsake you. So we may boldly say: The Lord is my helper...' (Hebrews 13:5-6 NKJV) (3) Tell them every prophecy concerning Christ's first coming came to pass, and that the prophecies in the Bible concerning His second coming are being fulfilled right now. So if they're wise they'll seek Him, surrender to Him, serve Him and be ready when He comes.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...We are labourers together...' 1 Corinthians 3:9 KJV<br /><br /><p>A cartoon shows an executive sitting forlornly behind a big desk. Standing meekly on the other side of the desk is a man dressed in work clothes who says, 'If it's any comfort to you, it's lonely at the bottom too.' The truth is, you'll meet lonely people at the top, on the bottom, and in the middle. Loneliness is not a positional problem, it's a relational one. The Bible says, 'A man who has friends must himself be friendly.' (Proverbs 18:24 NKJV) The saying, 'It's lonely at the top', was never made by a great leader. Stop for a moment and think about that. If you're all alone, nobody is following you. And if nobody is following you, you're not really leading. What kind of leader would leave everyone behind? An ineffective one. An insecure one. A dysfunctional one. Effective leadership is about lifting people, not elevating yourself. And to lift people you must get close to them. As a leader you must always remember these three things: (1) To have credibility, you must make it to the top. Many folks are willing to give you advice on things they have never experienced, but credibility comes from paying the price to achieve personal success. (2) To have respect, you must acknowledge that you didn't get to the top by yourself. Sir Edmund Hillary climbed Mount Everest because he had the right team. You need one too. (3) To have fulfilment, you must take others to the top with you. 'We are labourers together.' True success is shared success, and it only happens when you're willing to invest in the lives of others.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...in humility consider others better than yourselves...' Philippians 2:3 NIV<br /><br /><p>Frances Green was an elderly lady living on a pension. Every year she sent a dollar to the Republican National Convention. One day she received an invitation to meet President Reagan. Not realising the RSVP should include a generous donation, she scraped up every cent she had and took a four-day train ride across America. She slept sitting up because she couldn't afford a sleeper. When she arrived at the White House and found her name wasn't on the guest list, she was heartbroken. Overhearing her story, a Ford Motor executive contacted a presidential aide and got clearance to give Frances a tour and introduce her to the president the next day. But the following morning there was a military uprising overseas and the president was in high-level meetings. When Frances showed up at the White House the executive showed her around and walked her past the Oval Office hoping she'd at least get a glimpse of the president. As they passed he looked up, stood up from his desk and announced, 'Frances! Those darn computers fouled up again! If I'd known you were coming I'd have come out to get you myself!' The little woman from California had nothing to give the president that day, but there was something he could give , so he made time in his busy schedule. Paul says, '...humility consider others better than yourselves.' In other words, be willing to play second fiddle. Remind yourself that God sees, God evaluates, and God rewards. So, today go out of your way to help somebody.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['The...years of abundance...came to an end.' Genesis 41:53 NIV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says: 'Joseph stored up huge quantities of grain...The seven years of abundance in Egypt came to an end, and the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in all other lands, but in the whole land of Egypt there was food.' (Genesis 41:49-54 NIV) In his book <i>Surviving Financial Meltdown</i>, Ron Blue teaches us some valuable principles for achieving financial security: (1) Think long-term. The longer term your perspective, the better financial decisions you'll make. Set goals in writing for the future. Invest for the long term and worry less about short-term ups and downs in your investment portfolio. (2) Spend less than you earn. To accomplish this you need to know what you're earning and what you're spending. Make a spending plan (or, if we dare use that loathed term, a budget). Monitor how you're doing. Develop the self-control to avoid overspending. If you consistently spend less than you earn over a long period of time, you will do well financially. (3) Maintain emergency savings. A reserve set aside will help you ride out the surprises life throws at you. You must spend less than you earn to build savings. Savings will then help you avoid debt. These principles work together. (4) Minimise the use of debt. Debt increases risk. It may allow you to do more and have more now, but it will reduce your ability to have more in the future. These four financial principles are so simple that they may easily be overlooked, yet they've stood the test of time.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Catch...the little foxes that spoil the vines...' Song of Solomon 2:15 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Michelangelo once sculpted a figure out of marble while a friend watched. Later his friend went away on business and when he returned he said, 'I see you haven't worked on your sculpture.' The great artist replied, 'I've been working constantly on it since you left.' His friend asked, 'How's that possible?' Michelangelo replied, 'I've softened a line here, straightened the lip there, defined the muscles more clearly, polished this and sharpened that.' His friend said, 'But those are trifles!' Michelangelo replied, 'Trifles they may be, but trifles make perfection, and perfection is no trifle!' Solomon writes, 'Catch...the little foxes that spoil the vines, for our vines have tender grapes.' One Bible teacher put it this way: 'Small things that seem unimportant can spoil tender grapes, like a relationship, a career, or a life dedicated to Christ. How many marriages fail because spouses paid no attention to the little things? How many athletes lost competitions because of tiny missteps? Many of us can see the big picture of our lives and our relationship with God, but we neglect the details necessary for bringing it all into focus. We must attend to trifles if we hope to succeed. As we act faithfully in the little things God will bless us with greater opportunities. We'll develop the faithfulness and obedience to conquer the great issues in life.' Only when you're faithful in small things will God entrust you with greater things (Matthew 25:21). So, what 'little foxes' do you need to catch today? Little resentments, little habits, little areas of dishonesty? Nip them in the bud. Deal with them, and watch how it changes your life.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...God...will...make a way of escape...' 1 Corinthians 10:13 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Look at the last part of this verse: '[God] will...make a way of escape, that you may be able to bear it.' Before the Army sends you into battle it first sends you to boot camp. You're up at dawn running kilometres with a heavy backpack, climbing over barricades, crawling through mud with the sounds of gunfire all around you, taking orders from authority figures you don't like, who make you do stuff you don't want to do. But when you pass the test you get to wear the uniform and fight for your country. Now with that picture in mind, reread these words: 'But with the temptation will also make a way of escape, that you may be able to bear it.' The Living Bible says, '...So that you can bear up patiently against it.' God is looking for people who are able to bear up under training, then go out and win the battle with the enemy. For every problem, God has a solution. But it may not be the solution you have in mind! Satan's strategy is to defeat you by wearing you down, so winning is not a matter of escape but of endurance. Tenacious faith and commitment is one of the great themes of Scripture. It's also the secret of victory. When their prison doors miraculously opened, Paul and Silas realised that God's plan for them was not to escape but to stay there and win the jailer and his family to Christ. Sometimes God's 'way of escape' is to keep you where you are and use you to bring glory to His name.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear...' 1 Corinthians 10:13 NIV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says, 'He will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear.' You have been tempered for the test! Like tempered steel or glass, certain additives have been placed within you to increase your ability to stand up to the pressures life will throw at you. The fact that you've been exposed to this level of testing is a sign that God has given you the grace to handle it. He's not going to let you escape this trial, because He's equipped you to deal with it. So stop feeling sorry for yourself, or giving up, or saying you can't take it anymore.</p>
<p>Not everybody in a gym can handle the same level of weight because each is at a different stage of development. But the trainer knows. He will push you to your limit, but he will never add one weight more than you can carry. God is a good trainer and He's working according to a plan. He not only knows the right technique, He knows how much weight needs to be added in order to get you to the next stage of development. He will let you strain, shake and sweat, but He won't let you break. While you are focused on temporary stuff like getting a better house or car or job, He has something entirely different in mind: 'We...are being transformed into His likeness with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord...' (2 Corinthians 3:18 NIV) Once you understand this and line up your will with God's will, you'll begin to appreciate what He's doing and cooperate with Him.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...But God is faithful...' 1 Corinthians 10:13 KJV<br /><br /><p>Here's a promise you can stand on when your world has been shaken: 'But God is faithful.' Jesus said, 'Heaven and earth shall pass away: but My words shall not pass away.' (Luke 21:33 NIV) In a world of uncertainty you can sing, 'On Christ the solid rock I stand, all other ground is sinking sand.' Your job, your health, your relationships and your investments are all 'sinking sand'. But God's faithfulness is as solid as a rock. He will be faithful to you in the delivery room, in the operating room, in the nursing home, in the unemployment line, in the criminal proceedings, and during marriage counselling. The Psalmist wrote: 'I would have lost heart, unless I had believed that I would see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living. Wait on the Lord; be of good courage, and He shall strengthen your heart...' (Psalm 27:13-14 NKJV) Focusing on God's faithfulness will keep you from falling apart, giving up, having a nervous breakdown or losing your mind. Be honest; hasn't God been better to you than you've been to Him? Hasn't He been faithful when you've been unfaithful, and consistent when you've been inconsistent? 'The gifts and calling of God are irrevocable.' (Romans 11:29 NKJV) When God gives you a gift, He doesn't take it back. When He makes you a promise, He won't break it. Even when Abraham died, God remembered His promise and blessed his children down through the generations. Why is this important to know? Because when you begin to see God's faithfulness to you, it will make you want to be faithful to Him.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...But such as is common to man...' 1 Corinthians 10:13 NAS<br /><br /><p>The Bible says your struggle is not unique, it's 'common to man'. Your secret is not really a secret, it's just a secret shared by others who are equally afraid to talk. The only time we tend to be honest is when we're in trouble. As long as we think we can manage our dysfunction, we don't talk about it. You are not the only one who got married and then wanted a divorce, or lost control and lashed out, or quit a job and now doesn't have a job to go to. This is important to know, because it takes away your feeling of isolation and enables you to overcome self-pity. It also helps you to say, 'If others made it, then by God's grace I can too.' Perhaps you wonder if God is judging you, or the devil is attacking you, or if you did something to bring it on yourself. No, it's just part of life's journey! You'll notice in Scripture that God doesn't whitewash His heroes. He doesn't exempt the people He uses from struggle and sorrow. 'These things happened to them as examples and were written down as warnings for us...' (1 Corinthians 10:11 NIV) Every age and every stage of life brings a different test, and a different level of testing. You can't pray away the tests of life, or quote Scripture and make them disappear. God never promised you a trouble-free trip to Heaven. Jesus said, 'I have told you these things, so that in Me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.' (John 16:33 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['No temptation has overtaken you...' 1 Corinthians 10:13 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Paul writes, 'No temptation has overtaken you but such as is common to [mankind].' Notice the word 'overtaken'. Suddenly you're 'overtaken' by a set of circumstances you didn't create, don't want, and don't know how to get out of. Understand this: You don't pick the test, the test picks you! You don't get to choose who breaks your heart, or who gets on your nerves, or who lets you down. When you first held your child you didn't think that one day you'd be down at a detention centre trying to get them released. You couldn't have known that a routine checkup would have you in the hospital fighting a life-threatening illness. Maybe your problem is so personal and embarrassing that you're afraid to even discuss it with anybody. So you walk the floor at night praying, 'Lord, get me out of this or I'm finished!' Even Paul wrote, '...We despaired...of life.' (2 Corinthians 1:8 NAS) When you've been 'overtaken' by a situation you learn three things: (1) <i>Don't judge others</i>. The Bible says, 'Every man is...drawn away by his own lust, and enticed.' (James 1:14 KJV) When you don't know what somebody's been through or the circumstances which have conditioned them, be quiet. If you have to talk about it, talk to God! (2) <i>Don't tell your troubles to the wrong people</i>. Look for people who will share your burden, not spread your problem. (3) <i>Bring it to Jesus</i>. 'Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.' (Hebrews 4:16 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I have seen God face to face, yet my life has been spared.' Genesis 32:30 NLT<br /><br /><p>The Bible says Satan works 'day and night' building a case against you (Revelation 12:10). But with God's Word '...in your mouth and...heart...' (Romans 10:8 NCV) you can overcome him. When Satan says give up, God says stay the course (Matthew 5:11-12). When Satan tells you to look out for number one, God says put the other guy first (Philippians 2:3-4). When Satan says it's ok to hold grudges, God says forgive as often as it takes (Matthew 6:14-15). When Satan says get even, God says be a peacemaker (Romans 12:18-19). When Satan tells you to take all the credit, God says glorify Jesus (John 17:5). When Satan says clean up the outside and people won't notice the inside, God says He looks at your heart (1 Samuel 16:7). When Satan says you're ugly, God says you're '...wonderfully made...' (Psalm 139:14 NKJV). When Satan says you're alone and nobody understands you, God says He'll never leave you and that He has plans for your life (Deuteronomy 31:6 and Jeremiah 29:11). David said, 'I know You are pleased with me...You have not let my enemies triumph over me. You have preserved my life...' (Psalm 41:11-12 NLT) The devil will play any card, and if that first one doesn't work he'll try the childhood memories trick, or he'll dredge up your past sins and remind you of all the broken promises and dreams. Jacob said, 'I have seen God face to face, yet my life has been spared.' Bottom line: God has a plan for your life; otherwise you wouldn't be here!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I...contend with all the energy Christ so powerfully works in me.' Colossians 1:29 NIV<br /><br /><p>You say, 'Since serving successfully is a joint effort requiring cooperation with others who will often disagree with me, what's God's alternative to people-pleasing?' Paul answers, 'Whatever you do or say, do it as a representative of the Lord Jesus...' (Colossians 3:17 NLT) You represent the Lord Jesus! You are His servant and  alone is qualified to judge your service. And it gets better; you are '...God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.' (Ephesians 2:10 NIV) Regardless of people's opinions, God created you for a specific field of service. So celebrate your calling and embrace your destiny. When you do that, it takes the stress out of serving God. You are called by God, and all of Heaven's resources are available to you. 'God is working in you, giving you the desire and the power to do what pleases Him.' (Philippians 2:13 NLT) God is your source of wisdom and capability, so trust Him to carry the concerns of your ministry or career. 'I...contend with all the energy Christ so powerfully works in me.' Yes, there's some labour and struggle required, but you are never the sole proprietor. The energy is His, and it's working continually in you. You are the glove and He's the hand that fills it, controls and activates it. So relax, and just stay connected to Him. He will '...equip you with all you need for doing His will...[and] produce in you...every good thing that is pleasing to Him...' (Hebrews 13:21 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['But Paul shook the snake off into the fire...' Acts 28:5 NIV<br /><br /><p>The story's told of a farmer whose mule fell into a well. Since he had no way to get him out, he decided to bury him there. He got a truckload of dirt and dumped it on top of the mule. But instead of lying down under it, the mule started kicking and snorting until he worked his way to the top of it. This continued all afternoon. Truckload after truckload, the mule just kept shaking it off and stepping on top of it. Finally when the dirt reached the top of the well the mule just snorted and walked away, a dirtier but a wiser mule. What was intended to bury him, just brought him out on top. On his way to Rome Paul was shipwrecked on an island. As he was gathering firewood a snake attached itself to his arm. What did he do? The Bible says he just 'shook it off.' There's an important lesson for you in those two stories. You can either dwell on the past, or shake it off and move toward the future God has planned for you. Paul, a man with a past, writes about '...Forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forward to those things which are ahead.' (Philippians 3:13 NKJV) Now, Paul didn't forget his past, he just shook it off and kept going. You say, 'But I've failed so badly.' The Bible says, '...[He] will not remember your sins.' (Isaiah 43:25 NAS) Sometimes forgiveness requires a healing process, but until you make the decision to forgive yourself and others, and 'shake it off', the process can't even begin.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Bearing with one another...' Colossians 3:13 NAS<br /><br /><p>Have you ever been in a discount store where merchandise is labelled 'seconds' or 'purchase as is'? They don't tell you where the flaw is. And once you buy it you can't return it. Well, in case you haven't noticed, we all live in the 'as is' department. Stop and think about the people in your life. They're a mixed bag of strengths and weaknesses, virtues and vices, right? If you're looking for perfection, you're in the wrong store. What's the point? It's this: The <i>only</i> way to have a successful relationship with someone is to love and accept them 'as is'. Don't buy into the myth that most people are 'normal' except the ones in <i>your</i> life. Based on that idea, relationships are an endless quest to fix others, control them, or pretend they are something they're not. Thomas Merton said, 'Love is the will to let those we love be perfectly themselves, the resolution not to twist them to fit our own image. Otherwise we love only the reflection of ourselves we see in them.' A hallmark of spiritual maturity is acknowledging that nobody is perfect, and committing to love them in spite of it. Paul writes: 'Be gentle and forbearing with one another and, if one has a difference (a grievance or complaint) against another, readily pardoning each other; even as the Lord has [freely] forgiven you, so you must also [forgive].' (Colossians 3:13 AMP) To love someone 'as is' means to focus on their areas of strength and support them in their areas of struggle. 'What about their flaws?' you say. '...Love covers a multitude of sins.' (1 Peter 4:8 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He knelt down...three times [a] day, and prayed...' Daniel 6:10 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Peter, whom God used to help build the church, and John, whom God used to write the book of Revelation, made time in their daily schedule for prayer. 'Peter and John went up together to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour.' (Acts 3:1 NKJV) The apostle Paul, who wrote much of the New Testament, said, 'Never stop praying.' (1 Thessalonians 5:17 NLT) Daniel's habit of praying was so well-known that his enemies used it to trap him. '...He knelt down on his knees three times [a] day, and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as was his custom since early days. Then these men assembled and found Daniel praying...' (Daniel 6:10-11 NKJV) End of story? No, Daniel's prayers shut the mouths of lions and caused a heathen king to say: 'Men must tremble and fear before the God of Daniel. For He is the living God...His kingdom is the one which shall not be destroyed...He delivers and rescues, and He works signs and wonders in Heaven and on earth, Who has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions. So...Daniel prospered...' (Daniel 6:26-28 NKJV) The Psalmist wrote: 'He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.' (Psalm 91:1 NKJV) Identify your 'prayer place' and begin to use it regularly. You will grow to love it, and eventually it will become an important place in your life. The power of prayer defies calculation. Nothing lies beyond the reach of prayer, except that which lies outside the will of God.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...like a city with broken-down walls.' Proverbs 25:28 NLT<br /><br /></p>
<p><em>Permeable boundaries</em>. Well-adjusted people find the right balance which allows them to invite others into their personal space without allowing infiltration, manipulation or domination. They know how to say &quot;yes&quot; to what's healthy and &quot;no&quot; to what's not. Permeable boundary people, on the other hand, allow others to permeate their lives at will, siphon off their time and energy, dictate their options, and deprive them of other important relationships. Unable to say &quot;no&quot;, they permit others to make them feel guilty, obligated, uncaring, or even unchristian if they withhold what's demanded. They inconvenience themselves, their families and their friendships to facilitate the endless demands of the seemingly helpless, disempowered, irresponsible user, believing they are being kind and helpful. The helper's toll is immense, often leading to emotional, physical, social and spiritual overload, while the helpee feels increasingly dependent, irresponsible and entitled - not appreciating, and sometimes even resenting, the helper's efforts. Permeable boundary people are unaware that their 'open' sign is always illuminated, attracting a deluge of other people's needs they feel personally responsible for. They carry the weight of much that's wrong in the world, feeling exhausted, anxious, inadequate and guilty, taking it personally that they can't do more and fix things. And it leaves them feeling 'used'. 'A person without self-control is like a city with broken-down walls.' Understand this: You can't take charge of your own life while you're overwhelmed feeling responsible for other people's lives. Set some boundaries, and live the life God gave you to live!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...Its parts should have equal concern for each other.' 1 Corinthians 12:25 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>When you buy a house, you need clearly marked boundary lines to let you know what's yours and what's not. Good boundaries make good neighbours. The Bible says, 'Seldom set foot in your neighbour's house - too much of you, and you will be hated.' (Proverbs 25:17 NIV) So, how close is too close? Let's look at three kinds of boundaries we establish between ourselves and others. <em>Rigid boundaries</em>. These are designed to keep others at arms' length and protect your private, self-absorbed world. Without saying a word, your attitude says: 'Keep out, trespassers will be prosecuted!' Why do we create such boundaries? Fear! We fear being known, controlled, hurt, or feeling inadequate and inferior. And our rigidity prevents intimacy. Our unwillingness to be vulnerable or to compromise leaves us defensive, isolated and lonely. Closeness and intimacy are things we long for, yet fear and avoid. We think, 'You can't hurt me if I keep you at a safe distance.' But it doesn't work. God designed us to share life's victories and defeats, not to live in isolation. We are to '...have equal concern for each other. If one part [person] suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honoured, every part rejoices with it.' (1 Corinthians 12:25-26 NIV) Rigid boundaries rob you of life-enriching relationships. 'So what's the answer?' you ask. Reach out! You were created to give to others, and to receive what they have to give back to you. In giving you are fulfilled, and in receiving you are made complete. Anything less is just existing.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'All you need to say is simply Yes or No...' Matthew 5:37 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>When does 'a good thing' become 'too much'? Can I help you, without hurting me? Can we share our lives, without me giving up mine? When do you truly need my help? When do I need to let go, and let you and God handle it? Finding the balance between 'enough' and 'too much' in relationships is a constant challenge and isn't easy. Especially when your role tends to be 'all things, at all times, to all people,' and theirs is 'I'm helpless, you owe me, take care of me'; when you have no &quot;no&quot; and they have no &quot;yes&quot;. Needing to be needed by needy people who always want someone to take care of them puts the needy person in the driver's seat - and puts you over the edge. They are never happy, whatever you do. So you do more to make them feel happier and yourself feel less guilty, and you end up in a double bind. They resent you for not giving enough, and you resent them for not appreciating what you give. Yet neither of you knows how to break the cycle. So the relationship becomes what counsellors call a 'more-of-the-same' tangle where both parties resent and devalue the other, feeling stuck in a life-dominating trap you both fear to jettison. Marriages, families, friendships, workplaces, churches and social groups get trapped in this 'victim-rescuer' pattern where needy people and fixers become trapped in a mutual dance they both 'love to hate' but won't stop doing! Recognise yourself? If so, you're moving toward a healthier, less toxic relationship.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Pure...religion before God...is this...' James 1:27 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Jesus said about every act of kindness you show toward someone who's hurting or in need: '...You did it to Me.' (Matthew 25:40 NKJV) Wow! Maybe next time you're too busy to show concern, that'll make you stop and think. In answer to the question, 'What must I do to inherit eternal life?' Jesus told one man, '...Sell what you have and give it to the poor...[then] follow Me.' (Matthew 19:21 NKJV) This man could have blessed many others, and even been numbered among Christ's disciples, but it didn't happen because he was self-focused. Jesus told another story about a rich man who died and went to hell. Now, he didn't go there because he was rich. The only sin he was charged with was selfishness. He allowed a poor man to sit on his doorstep with wounds untended, his body ill-clad, his stomach empty, and did nothing about it (Luke 16:19-31). On the other hand, Zacchaeus, who overcharged others in order to enrich himself, saw the folly of his ways, renounced selfishness and made a decision to follow Jesus (Luke 19:1-10). The story's told of an angel visiting a wealthy man who happened to be on his deathbed. After the man listed all the things he'd like to take to Heaven with him, the angel informed him, 'You can only take what you have given away.' Don't wait until the eve of your departure to give; experience the joy and reward of it - now. 'Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their trouble.' So today, practise pure religion!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...Son...all that I have is yours.' Luke 15:31 NKJV<br /><br /></p>
<p>In the parable of the prodigal son Jesus is talking to two different groups: regular people, and religious leaders who complain that Jesus 'receives sinners'. (Luke 15:2 NKJV) We all know the story. The Prodigal Son 'blew it' and ended up in a pigsty. Later, when he returned home, his father threw a big party. But his older brother wouldn't attend. Here was his reason: '...These many years I have been serving you...yet you never gave me a young goat that I might make merry with my friends. But as soon as this son of yours came, who has devoured your livelihood with harlots, you killed the fatted calf for him. And [his father] said to him, Son...all that I have is yours.' (Luke 15:29-31 NKJV) It's the kind of thing you hear in church from people who lift themselves up by putting others down. Both sons spent time in the pigsty: one in the pigsty of rebellion, the other in the pigsty of resentment. One came home to a welcome, the other stayed home and wallowed in self-righteousness. Because of his judgmentalism, the older son ended up losing more than the younger son: (1) He forfeited the joy of knowing how much he was loved by his father. (2) As the oldest son he was entitled to twice as much of his father's estate, yet he wasn't able to enjoy a moment of it. (3) His younger brother was lost and hurting. What an opportunity to forgive, show grace, help to restore him and have a life-enriching relationship with him. But he forfeited it all because he was judgmental. Don't be an older brother!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Epaphroditus...ministered to my need.' Philippians 2:25 NKJV<br /><br /><p>When people are hurting, they need your support until they can get back on their feet again. Medical researchers have developed a bone-bonding compound that illustrates this. It looks like toothpaste. Once injected into the body it hardens in ten minutes. In twelve hours it reaches the compression strength of natural bone. A study in the journal, <i>Science</i>, found the compound virtually identical to natural bone crystals. It so closely resembles real bone that the body doesn't reject it. Weeks after being injected into the body, the cement is replaced by real bone. According to the Associated Press, clinical trials 'show the material has allowed patients to discard casts early - or altogether - and to resume walking more quickly and with less pain.' Epaphroditus is introduced by Paul as '...my brother, fellow worker, and fellow soldier...and the one who ministered to my need...Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness, and hold such men in esteem; because for the work of Christ he came close to death, not regarding his life, to supply what was lacking in your service toward me.' (Philippians 2:25-30 NKJV) You ask, 'What was Paul lacking?' Encouragement! And who brought it? 'Epaphroditus, a brother, a worker, and a soldier.' Epaphroditus worked side by side with Paul and he fought for him. What an asset he was! We look for such people in times of crisis because they lift us. So today ask God to make you an encourager whose words and actions bring comfort and support to others. There is no greater calling!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake...' Matthew 5:10 NKJV<br /><br /><p>In Yellowstone National Park there's an interesting tree called a Lodgepole pine. Its cones can hang on for years before falling off. Even then they remain tightly closed. They open only when they are in contact with intense heat. Whenever forest fires are raging and all the trees are being destroyed, the heat opens these particular pine cones. As a result, they are the first to assist nature in repopulating the forest. Jesus said to His disciples: 'Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.' There's potential in each of us that's only released when we're under pressure or in a fiery trial. Job discovered this when God permitted Satan to test him. Job lost everything he had, including his children. And to add insult to injury, he was forced to endure the scorn of his wife and friends because of his unwavering faith. When it was over, Job - who got back twice as much as he lost - prayed, 'I have heard of You by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye sees You.' (Job 42:5 NKJV) It's one thing to <i>hear</i> how God works based on somebody else's experience, it's another to <i>see</i> it first hand when you're wondering, 'What did I do to deserve this?' or asking, 'If God's really there, why am I here?' Why? (1) Because it's in the fire that you discover new aspects of God's care and character. (2) What turns worthless carbon into diamonds? Heat! Pressure! (3) In the fire you discover that when others abandon you, God remains faithful.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Blessed are the peacemakers...' Matthew 5:9 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The story's told of two blokes who were arguing about religion. One of them finally shouted, 'Ok, you serve God your way and I'll serve Him <i>His</i> way!' When we make our opinions a precondition for loving one another, we end up alienating one another. Much of what we fight about doesn't matter. Jesus said, 'By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.' (John 13:35 NKJV) It's not enough to love peace, you've got to become a peacemaker. When a fight erupted in the New Testament church over eating certain foods, Paul stepped in: 'Let us stop passing judgment on one another. Instead, make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in the way of a brother or sister. I am convinced, being fully persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself. But if anyone regards something as unclean, then for that person it is unclean. If your brother or sister is distressed because of what you eat, you are no longer acting in love. Do not by your eating destroy someone for whom Christ died. Therefore do not let what you know is good to be spoken of as evil. For the Kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit, because anyone who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and receives human approval. Let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification...So whatever you believe about these things keep between yourself and God...' (Romans 14:13-22 NIV) So, be a peacemaker!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Blessed are the pure in heart...' Matthew 5:8 NKJV<br /><br /></p>
<p>Make your heart 'a controlled environment', because what happens there determines how you respond to life. When it comes to people, pastimes and pursuits, don't open yourself to anything that has the potential to take you captive, or to make you cynical and cold-hearted. If you do, you'll shut yourself off from God's blessing. In his book <em>The Applause of Heaven</em>, Max Lucado writes: 'The countryside was flat and predictable...that's why the thing stood out on the horizon like a science-fiction city... a refinery. The function of that maze of machinery is defined by its name. A refinery takes whatever comes in and purifies it, so that it's ready to go out. It does for petroleum what your heart should do for you - removes the bad and utilises the good... Jesus said, &quot;The good man brings good things out of the good stored in his heart...&quot; (Luke 6:45 NIV) So here are some questions you need to ask yourself, &quot;When I'm criticised or ignored do I bite back, or bite my tongue? When I'm on overload do I blow my top, or stay cool? When I hear gossip do I entertain it, silence it or spread it? When somebody offends me do I harbour a grudge, or choose to forgive? It all depends on the condition of your heart.&quot;' When your heart has been purified you'll begin to see God in people, places and situations you never noticed Him at work in before. Knowing firsthand the dangers of spiritual heart disease, the Psalmist wrote: 'Create in me a clean heart, O God...' (Psalm 51:10 NLT) If you need a spiritual catharsis, spend time in the presence of God.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.' Matthew 5:7 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Hurting your enemy puts you below them; taking revenge makes you even with them; forgiving sets you above them. The Bible says, '...Never take revenge. Leave that to...God...' (Romans 12:19 NLT) Revenge is not sweet; it leaves a bitter taste. It keeps you in such a constant stew that you're not able to enjoy God's blessing. Don't let that happen to you. Instead choose to: (1)<i> Forgive and forget.</i> Unforgiveness just keeps you on the treadmill of resentment. Why's it so important to you to make others wrong and yourself right? If you're right but miserable, what good is it? Listen to Christ's words: 'If you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.' (Matthew 6:14 NKJV) Charles Spurgeon said, 'When you bury a mad dog don't leave his tail above the ground.' So forgive, bury it and move on. (2)<i> Deal with the roots of your anger.</i> Sometimes the source of our anger is hidden from us; we are 'acting out' the unresolved hurts within us. Exaggerated anger is often displaced anger. Instead of dealing with the person who hurt us, we vent our wrath on those closest to us. Ask God to show you where the real issue lies, then deal with it. (3)<i> Take back your power.</i> Mercy heals, but unforgiveness makes you a perpetual victim. Plus, while you're obsessing over the event and planning your payback, the other person is out enjoying life. God has promised you justice, so leave it in His hands. In fact, the only people you should consider getting even with are those who've helped you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness...' Matthew 5:6 NKJV<br /><br /><p>This beatitude corrects two mistakes we make when it comes to salvation. The first: that it's all about believing. The second: that it's all about behaving. Actually, it's about both<i>.</i> The new birth brings: (1)<i> A position of righteousness.</i> If you stacked up all your good works until they were as big as a mountain, you'd still come up short of the payment required to get into Heaven. That's true before you become a Christian, and it's true after you become one. If you saw the movie <i>The Passion of the Christ</i> and thought, 'Why did He have to die such a death?' here's the answer: 'God made Him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God.' (2 Corinthians 5:21 NIV) The moment you accept Jesus as your Saviour you become 'righteous' in God's eyes. Awesome! (2)<i> A condition of righteousness.</i> '...Count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God...' (Romans 6:11 NIV) Salvation is not just a position of righteousness you hold before God, but a condition of righteousness you live out before others every day. How do you do that? By valuing God's will more than your own (Proverbs 3:5). By seeking to display the character qualities of Christ as described in Scripture: '...Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control...' (Galatians 5:22-23 NAS) You say, 'That's a tall order!' Yes, but we are not left to do it alone: '...As the Spirit of the Lord works within us, we become more and more like Him.' (2 Corinthians 3:18 TLB)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Blessed are the meek...' Matthew 5:5 NKJV<br /><br /><p>In our macho world, meekness is often mistaken for weakness. But Jesus' definition of meekness pictures a powerful, majestic stallion that has been brought into submission. It hasn't lost any of its stamina. It's just that, whereas it once had a strong will of its own, it now yields to the will of another. The breaking process is complete; now it responds to the tug on the reins. Meekness involves: (1)<i> Sensitivity to God.</i> In a good marriage two people often understand each other's needs without a word needing to be spoken. The time they've spent together makes them aware of the things that enrich and the things that offend, and their devotion to one another makes their marriage a top priority. And it's the same in your relationship with God. (2)<i> Surrender to God's will.</i> The key to breaking stubborn habits is not fighting them in your own strength. That only keeps your focus on the problem, intensifying its power. Changing your focus and submitting to God moment by moment is the key to winning, whether it's a problem or a hang-up. 'Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think of anything as being from ourselves, but our sufficiency is from God.' (2 Corinthians 3:5 NKJV) (3)<i> Submission to God's purposes.</i> To understand the difference between submission and selfishness you must ponder these words: 'So they come to you as people do, they sit before you as My people, and they hear your words, but they do not do them; for with their mouth they show much love, but their hearts pursue their own gain.' (Ezekiel 33:31 NKJV) Think about it.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Blessed are those who mourn...' Matthew 5:4 NKJV<br /><br /></p>
<p>Jesus said, 'Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.' Grief is the price we pay for love. Henri Nouwen wrote: 'We wonder when grief hits hard, &quot;Why did this happen?&quot; Was it to remind us of the brevity...of life? Was it to deepen the faith of those who carry on?' It's hard to answer &quot;yes&quot; when everything seems dark. The most important thing to us at that moment is to be relieved of the pain. But when we move through adversity rather than avoid it, we greet it differently. We become willing to let it teach us. Like Joseph, we see how God can use it for some larger end. Ultimately, mourning means facing what wounds us in the presence of the only one who can heal us. The Bible says, '...Weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning.' (Psalm 30:5 NKJV) Your morning will come; God has promised it! Your grief will ease with time. The fact that you're willing to embrace the pain, rather than try to escape it, guarantees that. It's not that you'll forget, it's that you'll remember differently; with more gratitude and less grief. This beatitude answers two questions: (1)<em> What happens to those who die in the Lord?</em> 'Let not your heart be troubled... In my Father's house are many mansions... I go to prepare a place for you...that where I am, there you may be also.' (John 14:1-3 NKJV) (2)<em> What about those of us who must go on living?</em> '...The...God of all comfort...comforts us...that we may be able to comfort those who are in any trouble...' (2 Corinthians 1:3-4 NKJV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Blessed are the poor in spirit...' Matthew 5:3 NKJV<br /><br /><p>For the next few days let's look at the Beatitudes (what our attitudes should be). Jesus said, 'Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.' Now, He wasn't saying He's against you having money, He was saying He's against money having you. He will actually prosper you so that you can finance and fulfil His purposes in the earth. But He doesn't measure the size of your faith by the size of your bank balance. In one of His parables Jesus called a wealthy man a 'fool'. That wasn't because the man was rich, it was because he wasn't 'rich toward God.' (Luke 12:21 NKJV) John D. Rockefeller once said: 'I've made many millions but they brought me no real happiness. I'd barter them all for the days I sat on an office stool in Cleveland and counted myself rich on three dollars a week.' Having more money may give you social status, but serving God gives you Kingdom-significance. Big difference! So keep your focus on what matters and live for what lasts. Each winter in Kemi, Finland, you can visit a sprawling ice castle that features a theatre, a playground, an art gallery and a chapel. The castle walls are 4 metres high and stretch for over 500 metres. The chapel is a popular wedding venue and the theatre can seat 3,000 people. In it rock concerts, musicals, modern dance and opera recitals have been held. The problem is, its upkeep costs millions of dollars and, each year, it all melts in the spring. Are you getting the idea? Focus on what lasts, not on what doesn't.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Loose him, and let him go.' John 11:44 KJV<br /><br /><p>When Jesus stood at his friend's grave and said, 'Lazarus, come forth,' His friend, who'd been dead for four days, shuffled out, still bound from head to toe in grave clothes. His grave clothes didn't just fall off the minute Jesus spoke to him. No, he needed someone to 'loose him, and let him go'. There's an important lesson here. When you accept Christ, He changes you from the inside out. But certain experiences in your past can slow you down, keep you bound spiritually, and determine how you see yourself. And while the Holy Spirit does the initial work, transformation is a process - one that needs the help of others. It doesn't happen overnight, it takes time. The Bible says, 'If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.' (2 Corinthians 5:17 NKJV) You're 'becoming'! When Jesus saves you, it's like emerging from the tomb wrapped in the grave clothes of your past. What are those grave clothes? Negative influences and thought patterns, low self-esteem, old habits, destructive relationships etc. That's why God sends people to love you, help liberate you and release you into your potential. It's important that you identify these people and build your life around them. It's also why you need to develop an intimate relationship with God through prayer and Bible reading. Through His Word, you get a true picture of how He views you. Through prayer, you get to know His heart and begin seeing yourself through His eyes. When that happens, you begin to live redeemed, released and redirected.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Am I trying to please people?...' Galatians 1:10 NCV<br /><br /><p>Whether we are ordained ministers or lay people, we aren't exempt from stress. A deadly combination of traits, seen frequently in those serving God, produces inferiority and perfectionism - traits that make us obsessive-compulsive performers who think we're inadequate and that our service is never satisfactory. As a result we become: (a) <i>Over-responsible</i>: We think we must do everything ourselves. (b) <i>Irresponsible</i>: We think nothing we do is acceptable so we shouldn't tackle anything. (c) <i>Uncertain</i>: Vacillating between (a) and (b), we feel like losers either way we go. Understand this: it's the stress we generate, not the demands of the service, that wears on us. And nothing stresses us like people-pleasing! Paul says, 'Am I trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a servant of Christ,' because he'd previously lived for people's acceptance. Now he found himself unable to be an effective servant of Christ and still worry about people's opinions. People-pleasing must not be your motivation for serving, because: (1) It won't work. Every vote you capture loses you others. (2) It makes you attempt the impossible. The more you fail to please people, the harder you try. So you get caught in a cycle of pressure, failure and discouragement. (3) You become the source of your strength. Jesus avoided this exhausting lifestyle. '...The Son can do nothing by Himself. He does only what He sees the Father doing...' (John 5:19 NLT) Only when God is your source, do your stress levels go down!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.' Philippians 3:12 NIV<br /> <br />Paul didn't measure his progress by the pace of the runner in the lane next to him. He said, in essence, 'I'm running according to the drumbeat I hear on the inside, not the outside. I will support and encourage you, but I will never compete with you. My goal is to recognise and maximise what God has put within me. I'm not chasing you, I'm chasing .' When the crowd started singing, 'Saul has killed his thousands but David has killed his tens of thousands,' Saul couldn't handle it and he lashed out at David. There will always be somebody who has more education than you, preaches better than you, or makes more money than you. So shake it off and be yourself! The Bible says, 'He who walks with wise men will be wise...' (Proverbs 13:20 NKJV) Your future success is predicated on your ability and willingness to walk in the company of greatness and be inspired by it rather than frustrated by it. Saul's competitiveness ultimately destroyed him, and it will destroy you too. Faced with his successor, David, Saul tried to kill him. Faced with his successor, Timothy, Paul did all he could to build him up. Listen to Paul, 'Therefore I remind you to stir up the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands.' (2 Timothy 1:6 NKJV) Does Paul sound jealous? No. Do you know why? He tells us, 'I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course...' (2 Timothy 4:7 KJV) The only course you can run and win is the course God has given you!<br /><br /> <br />SoulFood: Gen 7-9, John 18:1-11, Ps 148:7-14, Pr 29:16-21</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'But God has revealed [it] to us by his Spirit...' 1 Corinthians 2:10 NIV<br /> <br /><br />Paul writes, 'No eye has seen, no ear has heard...no human mind has conceived the things God has prepared for those who love Him.' (1 Corinthians 2:9 NIV) You say, 'But that's all in the future!' No; read on: 'But God has revealed [it] to us by his Spirit.' Others may inspire and instruct you, but you must go to God in order to find out what He's called you to be and then align yourself with it. God told the prophet Habakkuk, '...Write the vision and make it plain...that he may run who reads it.' (Habakkuk 2:2 NKJV) It's ok to admire somebody else's vision and be inspired by them, but you must receive your own vision from God and run with it. Only when you do that, can you live to the fullest. God wants you to run according to what He has shown you, not what somebody else says. Stop taking your cues from people. Go to God! Some of us are forty, or fifty, or sixty years old and we're still not happy with what we are. We're frustrated and frantic because we've never found that feeling of contentment. The problem is we've made it our goal to become something God never meant us to be. You must go to God, like a house to a builder, and say, 'Lord, what building materials have You put within me? How much weight can I bear? What is my purpose? Who should I be? Show me Your plan at every age and every stage.' You are the question, is the answer. And as long as you know who is who, you'll always make progress in the journey of life.<br /><br /><br />SoulFood: Matt 14:22-33, 1 Kings 3:4-28</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'All your words are true; all your righteous laws are eternal.' Psalm 119:160 NIV<br /> <br />A publishing house advertised: Ten books to read before you die. And the Bible didn't make the list! Amazing; it's one book you should read! When Ann Shorb replaced her favourite cookbook with a 'New and Updated' version, she said: 'It wasn't the same. It had been adapted for...convenience...' Ann goes on to say: 'It seems like a lot of people are trying to do the same thing with some of God's recipes.They're trying to adapt them to make them more convenient, more time saving and easier to follow.' God's Word never changes. The results of sin are the same: 'The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ...' (Romans 6:23 NKJV) God's plan for salvation hasn't changed:'By grace you have been saved through faith...not of works, lest anyone should boast.' (Ephesians 2:8-9 NKJV) His method for finding guidance is still:'The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul. The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple; The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart; The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.' (Psalm 19:7-8 NKJV) His solution for anger is the same: 'Rest in the Lord...Cease from anger, and forsake wrath...it only causes harm.' (Psalm 37:7-8 NKJV) To find peace we still should: 'Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known...and the peace of God...will guard your hearts and minds...' (Philippians 4:6-7 NKJV) The Psalmist said, 'All your words are true; all your righteous laws are eternal.' Bottom line: you can't 'new and improved' God's Book!<br /><br /><br />Gen. 10-12, Jn. 18:12-24, Ps. 150, Prov. 29:22-27</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He who abides in Me...bears much fruit...' John 15:5 NKJV<br />&amp;nbsp;<br />Some people view the Christian life as a bed of roses, others see it as a battlefield. The first group says, 'If I've enough faith, I'll never be sick, broke or have problems.' The second group says, 'I have more troubles than Job.' The truth is, your faith level is revealed by hard times. When your back is to the wall financially you need faith to believe that God is Jehovah Jireh, the Lord who provides. When you're battling illness you need faith to believe He's Jehovah Rapha, the great physician who promises to heal. Jesus said, 'He who abides in Me...bears much fruit.' Notice, the blessing comes from 'abiding' and staying close to the Lord. Getting excited about fruit before you've learned to sow seed means you end up serving God for what He does, instead of who He to you. And here's another thought: Don't use your faith to belittle others. Just because you have graduated, don't burn down the school! Remember the tests you didn't do so well in? But God brought you through, didn't He? And He will bring them through too! Yes, the Christian life is a battlefield. And the level of attack is determined by the size of your God-given assignment and the rewards that await you beyond it. So in that sense, Satan's attack is a compliment. The truth lies in the middle. You will be regularly pruned for greater fruitfulness. But that's when it's even more important to abide. So don't give up, and don't collapse, for beyond this test you'll have a testimony to God's goodness.<br /><br /><br />SoulFood: Gen 13-16, John 18:25-40, Ps 105:1-7, Pr 30:1-4<br />&amp;nbsp;<br /><span style=&quot;font-size: 8pt;&quot;>The Word for Today is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2012<img src=&quot;http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;amp;track=48211&amp;amp;www=blog&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;0&quot; /> </span>

<introtext><![CDATA['There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit.' 1 Corinthians 12:4 NIV<br /><br /><p>No matter how good you are, you'll never be good at being somebody else. Don't fall into the trap of trying to live up to the reputation of another person. The new husband says to his wife, 'My mother makes better fried chicken than this.' The wife retorts, 'Then tell your mother to come over here and cook you some.' If you want your wife to shine in the kitchen, compliment her. Don't compare her with somebody else. Unhealthy comparisons hurt relationships! The Psalmist writes about the successful person who 'is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season...' (Psalm 1:3 NIV) A wise fruit grower understands three things about his trees: (1) Apple trees are only capable of producing apples. (2) Apple trees only produce apples in certain seasons. (3) It is a mistake to pick your apples too early. When the daughter of a well-known preacher was introduced on a Christian television network, she received invitations from several churches to come and speak. But her father said, 'No, leave her alone. I won't allow the system to eat her up and begin to compare her unfavourably with her father or mother or somebody else she can never be. I want her to be herself.' What great counsel and insight! Paul writes, '...That we...might be for the praise of His glory.' (Ephesians 1:12 NIV) When you understand <i>who</i> you are and  God created you to be - <i>being yourself</i> brings glory to God! You can say, 'Lord, I'm thankful for who You made me; I've finished complaining or wishing I could be somebody else.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Godliness with contentment is great gain.' 1 Timothy 6:6 NIV<br /><br />
<p>Paul writes, 'Godliness with contentment is great gain.' This word 'gain' doesn't mean increase, but profit. There's a difference. Profit is what you have left when the transaction is over. Paul meant that when everything is said and done, you must feel good about being yourself. You must be able to say, 'I would rather be a great sergeant than a poor general.'</p>
<p>Only when you've followed well, can you lead well. If you're praying for a certain position or promotion, check your motives. Sometimes what we call faith is really just ambition, because we haven't come to the place where we're comfortable with the role God has given us. King Saul's undoing was his ego. He couldn't stand somebody else doing it better than he did. Many of us have a wrong concept of what being 'blessed' looks like. We have seen God's blessing in someone else's life, so we think that to be like them is to be blessed. And no matter what God gives us, we are never happy because we're not like them. We are asking God for something but we don't know what it is, what it looks like, or when we have it. And if you don't know you have it, you won't know when you lose it. When you keep comparing yourself to somebody else you make that person an idol in your life. Tear that idol down! Ask God for a dream of your own. Stand on your own two feet. Be who God created you to be. Even though God has more in store for you, praise Him for what He's given you right now.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God made it grow.' 1 Corinthians 3:6 NIV<br /><br />
<p>Unhealthy comparison is a sign of spiritual immaturity. Here's what Paul wrote to the Corinthians: 'Brothers, I could not address you as spiritual but as worldly - mere infants in Christ. I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready for it. Indeed, you are still not ready. You are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and quarrelling among you, are you not worldly? Are you not acting like mere men? For when one says, I follow Paul, and another, I follow Apollos, are you not mere men? What, after all, is Apollos? And what is Paul? Only servants, through whom you came to believe - as the Lord has assigned to each his task. I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God made it grow. So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow. The man who plants and the man who waters have one purpose, and each will be rewarded according to his own labour.' (1 Corinthians 3:1-8 NIV) Understanding your gifts and your God-given  purpose frees you from the need to measure yourself by the runner in the next lane, or someone playing a different position on the team. When you understand this, your sense of inadequacy will be healed and you'll be able to enjoy and complement others. You'll also be able to help liberate your children from sibling rivalry and show them that success is not about being like somebody else, but about being the best you can be, and  God made you to be.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['He fashions their hearts individually...' Psalm 33:15 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Your prayer style should be consistent with the way God designed you. Yes, you can learn from people who are more experienced in prayer than you are, but you need to be careful not to make them your standard, or become a 'clone'. It's wrong to force yourself to do what others do, if you are not comfortable with it in your spirit. Don't try to keep up with someone else, or copy their prayer style. And don't feel compelled to work every prayer principle you have ever learned, every time you pray. Most of us are afraid not to be like everyone else. We are more comfortable following specified rules than daring to follow the leading of God's Spirit. When we follow man-made rules, we please people. But when we step out in faith and follow God's Spirit, we please Him. You don't need to feel pressured to pray a certain way, or for a certain length of time, or to focus on specific things because other people are doing so. 'Untie the boat from the dock,' so to speak, and let the tide of God's Spirit take you wherever He wills. When you are in control, you know what will happen next. But when you let God's Spirit take the lead, you are in for a lot of surprises in life. Wonderful surprises! You need to be determined to be yourself, and refuse to spend your life feeling guilty because you're not like somebody else. The Bible says, 'He fashions their hearts individually.' So when it comes to prayer, the word for you today is, 'Be yourself'.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...They measure themselves by themselves...' 2 Corinthians 10:12 NIV<br /><br />
<p>A certain level of competitiveness is good. You need it. When children enter a spelling contest they study harder and learn more because they're going to compete. They know their academic prowess is about to be challenged and they get ready for it because we like to win. But when your competitiveness makes you feel 'less than', or 'better than' another person, it's gone too far. Paul writes: '...When they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they are not wise. We, however, will not boast beyond proper limits, but will confine our boasting to the sphere of service God...has assigned to us.' (2 Corinthians 10:12-13 NIV) To evaluate your success accurately you must first understand your God-given purpose. When you play on a team your position determines your purpose. Attackers and defenders have different skills, but to win, the team needs both. The defender who keeps the opposing team from scoring is just as valuable as the attacker who scores. One may get more applause than the other, but victory belongs to them all. When you keep comparing yourself with others you're denied a sense of accomplishment, because you've made the benchmark to be like somebody else. No, they are playing a different position. They have a different purpose. They have a different skill set designed to fulfil the role God has given them. God gives you everything you need for the position you play and the purpose you have. What a liberating truth! And God, who gave others the ability to excel at what they do, will do the same for you when you learn to focus on Him, not them.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Jesus...spent the night praying...' Luke 6:12 NIV<br /><br /><p>One of the dangers of being involved in God's work is that you can go for weeks, or even months, without praying. In a survey of a thousand pastors, half acknowledged that they often went for long periods without taking time to pray. They didn't have a personal prayer life beyond their function in church. Amazingly, they had preached entire sermons on the topic, yet they themselves didn't practise it. Can you relate? Jesus arose before dawn and spent hours in prayer. He even prayed all night. And it showed. His incredible success flowed out of the rich relationship He had with His Father. He made deposits every morning so that He could make withdrawals all day long. Joyce Meyer writes: 'I have gone from labouring and striving to pray for five minutes every few days to enjoying - and actually personally needing and wanting - beginning my day with prayer, then to praying throughout the day as things come to my heart, and finally ending my day communicating with the Lord as I fall asleep. I have moved from a sporadic, irregular prayer life to regular times of prayer that are disciplined without being legalistic. Where I once thought I was fulfilling an obligation to God by praying, I now realise that I absolutely cannot survive a day and be satisfied...if I do not pray. I realise that prayer is a great privilege, not a duty. I no longer approach God in fear, wondering if He will really hear me and send an answer to my prayers. I now approach Him boldly, as His Word teaches me to do, and with great expectation.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Evening [and] morning...He hears my voice.' Psalm 55:17 NIV<br /><br /><p>God is far too creative to insist that every person interacts with Him in exactly the same way. He designed each of us differently. There are prayer principles that apply to all of us, but God leads each of us as individuals. We are all at different places in our walk with Him, we are all at different levels of spiritual maturity, we all have different types of experiences in prayer. Yes, we need to learn the fundamentals of prayer. But then we need to move beyond intellectual knowledge about how to pray, and take those principles to the Lord and say: 'Teach me to apply this to my life, in my situation, to my heart. Show me how this idea is supposed to work for me. God, I'm depending on You to teach me to pray, to make me effective in prayer, to make my relationship with You through prayer the richest, most rewarding aspect of my life.' When you say, 'Lord, teach me to pray,' you're asking Him to teach you to pray in a distinctly personal way, and to enable your prayers to be easy, natural expressions of who you are. You need to go before God just the way you are, and give Him the pleasure of enjoying the company of the 'original' that He made you to be. You need to approach Him with your own strengths, weaknesses, uniqueness and everything else that so wonderfully distinguishes you from everyone else. God enjoys meeting you where you are, developing a personal relationship with you, and helping you grow to become everything He wants you to be.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...This work had been done with the help of our God.' Nehemiah 6:16 NIV<br /><br /><p>After scoring a goal for his team, a big, rugged AFL player started dancing and beating his chest as if to say, 'Look at me, I'm the greatest.' Then the opposing team gained possession of the ball and their centre kicked a goal from outside the 50. But unlike his opponent, the centre offered up a quick 'Thank You, God' before turning to celebrate with his team. Now meet another team player, Nehemiah, the king's royal cupbearer. When he heard about Jerusalem's broken-down walls, he set aside his own problems and focused on the nation's. Nehemiah was so burdened for the city where his forefathers were buried that he '...wept...mourned...and prayed before...God...' (Nehemiah 1:4 NIV) He remembered his roots, and reminded God of His covenant with His people by, in essence, praying: 'I know who You are, God, and I know who  are. Your people have rejected You, but we're coming back and You can give us success.' God honoured Nehemiah's prayers and Jerusalem's walls were rebuilt in 52 days, causing the enemy nations who heard to lose 'their self-confidence, because they realised this work had been done with the help of our God.' When God looks for a leader, He knows the kind of man and woman He can count on. He knows that a leader who's a team player can turn weakness into strength, obstacles into stepping stones, and disaster into triumph. You may not see yourself as a leader per se, but people watch you every day. The question is, do they know who you are following? And that it's about Him - not you?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...She was made straight, and glorified God.' Luke 13:13 NKJV<br /><br /><p>One day Jesus healed a woman in the synagogue who'd been crippled for 18 years. As a result, two things happened: first, she rejoiced like anybody would who'd been set free from an 18 year illness. Second, some churchgoers condemned Jesus for healing her on the Sabbath day. What a scene; while she was glorifying God over here, they were arguing the fine points of doctrine over there. So what did she do? She just kept praising God! She didn't stop to explain herself or try to convince her critics, because she knew their minds were already made up and weren't open to change. You don't have to defend yourself because the Lord is your defender. Plus, when you've been through difficult times you can't afford to mess around with people's moods and attitudes. If you do, your defensiveness can make you vulnerable to the enemy. This woman protected herself by entering into defensive praise, and you must do that too! Don't get pulled into arguments. When you quit defending yourself, you open a door for the Lord to fight for you. This woman built a wall of protection around herself. She could easily have fallen into negative thinking, but she didn't. Can you imagine what would have happened if she'd stopped rejoicing and started debating? If argument had gotten through the door, this whole scene would have ended in a fight. But instead she decided to just keep praising God - and you should too!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Because you say so, I will...' Luke 5:5 NIV<br /><br /><p>'[Jesus] said to Simon: Put out into deep water, and let down the nets for a catch. Simon answered, Master, we've worked hard all night and haven't caught anything. But because you say so, I will... When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break.' (Luke 5:4-6 NIV) Notice two principles in this story: (1) God will use failure to get your attention.Peter was tired, empty-handed and disappointed when Jesus spoke to him. And He will speak to you through a rocky marriage, a child you're about to give up on, or a job that seems too hard. He doesn't want you to run from your problems, He wants you to learn from them; to discover the difference He can make in your situation when you invite Him into it. (2) God can take you back to the place of failure and give you success. We assume that because we weren't successful at something, it wasn't God's will. But often the truth is that we failed because we relied on our own strength instead of His. When Jesus spoke, the fish responded. The Bible says: '...They caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break. So they signalled their partners in the other boat to come and help them and they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink.' (Luke 5:6-7 NIV) God is not limited by your circumstances, He's only limited by your unbelief. When you obey Him, you'll discover He has a level of abundance in mind that will exceed all your expectations.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Let us strip off every weight that slows us down.' Hebrews 12:1 NLT<br /><br /><p>The Bible says, 'Let us strip off every weight that slows us down...And let us run with endurance the race God has set before us.' God has given you the two things needed to run and win your race in life: time and energy. And you can't afford to waste them. Why do we have such a hard time saying no? Two of the most common reasons are: (1) Fear of rejection. Ultimately, you must ask yourself this question: 'Whose approval am I seeking, God's or people's?' (2) Fear of missing out on good opportunities.We assume that whenever opportunity knocks, we must answer the door and say 'yes' to whatever's standing there. That's a mistake. Opportunity doesn't equal obligation. There will always be more opportunities than there is time to pursue them. So you must choose your opportunities prayerfully and wisely. Jim Collins, author of the book <i>Good to Great</i> writes: 'Most of us lead busy but undisciplined lives. We have ever expanding 'to do' lists, trying to build momentum by doing, doing, doing. But it rarely works. Those who built the good to great companies made as much use of 'stop doing' lists, as 'to do' lists. They displayed a remarkable discipline to unplug from all sorts of extraneous junk and channel their resources into only one or a few areas.' In his groundbreaking book, <i>Focus: The Future of Your Company Depends on It</i>, Al Ries adds, 'Great leaders, in spite of a multitude of distractions, know how to keep things focused. They know how to inspire and motivate their followers to keep pushing the main chance. They don't let side-issues overwhelm them.' So stay focused!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.' 1 Samuel 18:7 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Instead of celebrating David's victory over Goliath with those who sang 'David [has slain] his ten thousands', Saul became jealous. As a result, he opened himself to 'an evil spirit'. (1 Samuel 18:10 NIV) There are three lessons here: (1) Those who help you today, may hurt you tomorrow.So what should you do? When Saul threw spears, David refused to throw them back. Instead he forgave, prayed for Saul, and positioned himself to be promoted. It's not easy, but it's a winning strategy. 'You have heard that it was said, Love your neighbour and hate your enemy. But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in Heaven...' (Matthew 5:43-45 NIV) (2) Those who love you today, may loathe you tomorrow.God says, '...I have loved you with an everlasting love...' (Jeremiah 31:3 NIV) All other sources of love are subject to change. You can marry someone who resents you for being what you are, and you end up thinking, 'You chose me because I'm outspoken; now you don't like me because I speak out,' or 'You liked me because I was quiet; now you say I'm boring.' You feel betrayed when people invite you, then fight you. But God will be faithful to you! (3) While others speak well of you, some will resent you. , David didn't sing, 'Saul killed a thousand, but I killed ten thousand.' You can understand why that would irritate others. But David didn't boast about his success. Sometimes those who congratulate you can create enemies for you. That's because some people can't celebrate anyone other than themselves.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>‘…Stay within the [boundaries] of the work which God has set for [you]...’ 2 Corinthians 10:13 GNT</p>
<p>Nobody is good at everything, and nobody is called to do everything. God has given each of us clearly defined roles in life. Paul understood that his job wasn’t to accomplish everything or try to please everyone, but to focus on what God had called and equipped him to do: ‘Our goal is to stay within the limits of the work which God has set for us.’ Only as you do that will you be successful, as God defines success. Satan will try to rob you of the joy of serving by getting you to compare yourself with others, or getting you to conform to the expectations of others. Don’t fall into his trap! You’ll always find someone who seems to be doing a better job than you, and you’ll become discouraged. Or you’ll find someone who doesn’t seem to be as successful as you, and you’ll become conceited. Either way, you lose out. ‘Pay careful attention to your own work, for then you will get the satisfaction of a job well done, and you won’t need to compare yourself to anyone else.’ (Galatians 6:4 NLT) There will always be people who don’t understand your God–given role in life or agree with you. That’s ok; don’t let it break your stride! ‘Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who does not need to be ashamed...’ (2 Timothy 2:15 NIV) ‘Encourage and rebuke with all authority. Do not let anyone despise you.’ (Titus 2:15 NIV) John Bunyan, author of the Christian classic, Pilgrim’s Progress, wrote: ‘If my life is fruitless it doesn’t matter who praises me. And if my life is fruitful it doesn’t matter who criticises me.’ So, just do what God’s called you to do!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Know the state of your flocks...' Proverbs 27:23 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Sheep and cattle have to be handled differently. Sheep require tending. They need clear boundaries for their own protection, not to mention the shepherd's potential loss if they are devoured by a wolf or fall off a cliff. Cattle do just fine when they're given good grazing land and left alone. What's the point? To fulfil your dream, you must 'know' the people you work with. Whether they're partners or patrons, bosses or colleagues, clients or constituents, customers or critics, people need to be identified and managed according to their talents and their temperament. So what kind of people belong on your team? John Maxwell writes: 'Some people have a dream but no team - their dream is impossible. Some people have a dream but a bad team - their dream is a nightmare. Some people have a dream and are building a team - their dream has potential. Some people have a dream and a great team - their dream is inevitable.' Moses needed Joshua; Naomi needed Ruth. The idea of the self-made person is a myth. Whether they acknowledge it or not, all successful people had help along the way. Only when you can admit that you need help will you begin looking for it. And that's a crucial step in achieving success. The next steps are knowing people's strengths, communicating your vision to them in such a way that they buy into it, bringing out the best in them and rewarding them. Chris Hodges says, 'A dream is a compelling vision you see in your heart, that's too big to accomplish without the help of others.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...If [you]...overdrive them...[they] will die.' Genesis 33:13 KJV<br /><br /><p>After being reconciled with his long-estranged brother Esau, Jacob agreed to accompany him back home for a celebration. Esau, who was a fast-tracker, said, '...Let us go...' (Genesis 33:12 NKJV) But Jacob said, '...You go on ahead!...' He explained to his brother, '...The children are weak, and the flocks and herds which are nursing are with me...if the men should drive them hard...the flock will die...I will lead on slowly at a pace...the livestock...and the children, are able to endure...' (Genesis 33:13-14 NKJV) Jacob had great insight. He understood that if you push too hard and take on too much you can lose not only your business, but your family. There's an important lesson here. In your quest to achieve, stay in balance! There must be a time for work and a time for rest; a time for your career and a time for your relationships. The words, 'To love and to cherish', mean you are married to your spouse, not your job! When it comes to your home life, your character and your spiritual walk, evolution is not the natural order. What you leave unattended deteriorates. Dr. John Maxwell shared the following prayer with his friends at one birthday party: 'Lord, as I grow older I think I want to be known as...thoughtful rather than gifted, loving versus quick or bright, gentle over being powerful, a listener more than a great communicator, available rather than a hard worker, sacrificial instead of successful, reliable not famous, content more than driven, self-controlled rather than exciting, generous instead of rich, compassionate more than competent.' And that's a prayer we should pray too!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...They could not dwell together.' Genesis 13:6 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Abraham and Lot started out together in business. Then a problem arose: '...Their possessions were so great that they could not dwell together. And there was strife between the herdsmen...' (Genesis 13:6-7 NKJV) So Abraham said, 'Please separate from me. If you take the left, then I will go to the right...' (Genesis 13:9 NKJV) There's an important lesson here: just because somebody belonged in your early life, doesn't mean they're supposed to make the whole journey with you. When memories of the early days of working with somebody are wonderful, it's difficult to face the truth that those days are gone and will never return. Does that mean you are right and they are wrong? No, it just means you each have different destinies. If you don't understand that, people who were once the wind beneath your wings can become a weight that drags you down. Sometimes you outgrow a person's gifting and capacity, and no matter how much you try to help or improve them they won't get any better. When that happens your prospects are diminished and your momentum suffers. Some of the people you want in your life shouldn't be in it because they don't share your passion; they have a different calling. If you learn this sooner rather than later, you'll save yourself untold heartache. The story's told of a man who left this message on his answering machine: 'I'm not available right now. I'm making some changes in my life. Please leave a message after the beep. If I don't return your call, you are one of the changes.'</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...This is the victory that has overcome the world, even our faith.' 1 John 5:4 NIV<br /><br /><p>When your health, your finances or family are at risk, you suddenly realise how fragile life is. Today you may be living on the sunny side of the street, but if you live long enough adversity will come knocking on your door. When it does, you'll discover that things like power, possessions and popularity won't sustain you. If power could do it, Joseph Stalin wouldn't have been afraid to go to sleep at night or been so paranoid that he appointed a soldier to guard his teabags. If possessions could do it, fear wouldn't have caused billionaire Howard Hughes to live like a hermit and die alone. If popularity could do it, John Lennon's biographers wouldn't have described him as a fearful man who slept with the lights on and was terrified of germs. Earthly supports can only sustain you so long. Courage for living comes from a deep abiding trust in God, whose Word says, 'This is the victory that has overcome the world, even our faith.' But faith is only as valuable as the thing it's placed in, and our faith is in a God who never fails! David said, 'Through You we push back our enemies; through Your name we trample our foes.' (Psalm 44:5 NIV) Jesus said, 'I have given you authority to...overcome all the power of the enemy...' (Luke 10:19 NIV) Paul said, 'Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?...No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us.' (Romans 8:35-37 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Lord, teach us to pray...' Luke 11:1 NKJV<br /><br />
<p>In his book, <em>Christ in the School of Prayer</em>, Andrew Murray writes: 'None can teach like Jesus...therefore we call on Him, Lord, teach us to pray. A pupil needs a teacher who knows his work, who has the gift of teaching, who in patience and love will descend to the pupil's needs. Blest be God! Jesus is all this and much more...Jesus loves to teach us how to pray.' If you: (a) are not sure God is really listening when you talk to Him; (b) don't understand why some prayers seem to go unanswered; (c) wonder if you are praying 'right' or generally feel frustrated in prayer; (d) are eager to know what to do to feel more connected with God and gain confidence that your prayers really do make a difference, say, 'Lord, teach me to pray.' Although there are principles of prayer that apply to everyone, God will lead each of us individually. He wants to take you just the way you are, and help you discover your own rhythm of prayer; to develop a style of prayer that maximises your relationship with Him. He wants prayer to be an easy, natural, life-giving way of communicating as you share your heart with Him and allow Him to share His heart with you. Prayer is so simple; it's nothing more than talking to God and taking time to listen to what He has to say to you. God has a personalised prayer plan for you, a way for you to communicate most effectively with Him. So begin by saying, 'Lord, teach me to pray.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I have found the piece [of silver] which I lost!' Luke 15:9 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Christ's next parable was about a piece of lost silver: 'What woman, having ten silver coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp, sweep the house, and search carefully until she finds it? And when she has found it, she calls her friends and neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found the piece which I lost.' (Luke 15:8-9 NKJV) Notice, this piece of silver, which was an inanimate object, didn't know it was lost so it had no concern. Observe two things here: (1) It was lost by the very person who was supposed to care for it. (2) It was lost, even though it was in the house. This is a picture of those who sit in church every Sunday morning trusting in personal reformation, church affiliation, family connections or good works to save them. What did this woman do? She lit a lamp, swept the house and searched for it until she found it. That's what Bible-based, Christ-centred preaching does. Whatever stands in the way of people coming to Christ must be swept out. Let's light the lamp of God's Word. Let's preach the only message that can save people from their sins: '...The Gospel...is the power of God to salvation for everyone who believes...' (Romans 1:16 NKJV) This woman probably had garments to be mended, cattle to be tended and water to be drawn. But all of that took a back seat. What's needed in the church today is the lamp to illuminate, the broom to sweep clean, and a commitment that refuses to stop until those who are lost in God's house are found and saved.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Motives are weighed by the Lord.' Proverbs 16:2 NIV<br /><br />
<p>Henry Blackaby tells the story of a very self-righteous man who prayed: 'Lord, there's something wrong. I read the Bible, pray regularly, attend church faithfully and always give to charity, yet I don't have much. My brother doesn't do any of these things, yet he's got tons of money. How come you've given him so much and me so little?' After a pause, a voice said, 'Because you're a sanctimonious pain in the neck!' The Bible says, '...God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.' (James 4:6 NKJV) God looks at your heart's intent; He judges your motives. You can sit in church with a heart that's far from God. The Israelites did (Isaiah 1:10-17). You can help the needy and still be greedy. Judas did (John 12:4-8 NIV). You can proclaim your love for Jesus yet be influenced by the devil. Peter did (Matthew 26:31-35 NIV). You can make sacrifices yet still be living in disobedience. King Saul did (1 Samuel 13:7-14 NIV). You can pray with the wrong motives. Some people in the New Testament church did (James 4:3 NIV). You can even be a pastor who loves crowds but has no time for individuals. Check your heart! The Good Shepherd left His 99 sheep to look for the one who was lost. Then He carried it home on His shoulders, rejoicing. 'Motives are weighed by the Lord.' God sees your heart. Everything you do must be motivated by love for Him and for others. So look beyond your actions to what lies behind them. Ask God to show you what He  sees.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Do not follow the crowd...' Exodus 23:2 NIV<br /><br /><p>Mark D. Roberts writes: 'In junior high, a boy named Andrew...was the classic nerd: overweight...thick glasses...skin so white it seemed he'd never been outside. One day some of the boys began teasing Andrew and making fun of his appearance...I saw the pain in his eyes and knew I should tell the other guys to knock it off. But I saw an opportunity to be aligned with the in-crowd. So I joined in...adding my taunts as Andrew began to cry... In my heart I knew I'd done a terrible thing... Sometimes the temptation to follow the crowd is almost more than we can bear. We crave acceptance to such an extent that we do what we know is wrong so others will like us. This is true not only for insecure junior high boys, but for just about everybody. It's hard to stand up to the crowd.' Jesus wasn't ruled by people's opinions. Even His critics acknowledged, '...We know you are a man of integrity... You aren't swayed by [others]...' (Matthew 22:16 NIV) When you know who you are in Christ it frees you from the need to impress. Paul writes, 'Don't let the world...squeeze you into its own mould...let God re-mould your minds...so that you may prove in practice that the plan of God for you is good...' (Romans 12:2 PHPS) As painful as it is to be criticised, it's far worse to give up the course God has for you just for acceptance. At some point you must ask, 'How much am I willing to lose in order to be accepted?' Can you take the pressure? Will you be like Nehemiah who said, '...I am carrying on a great project and cannot go down...' (Nehemiah 6:3 NIV)</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...You will understand later' John 13:7 NCV<br /><br /><p>What's amazing about Christ's love is not that He knows and forgives all your past sins, but that He knows and has decided to forgive your future ones too. On the eve of His crucifixion Jesus washed His disciples' feet, saying, 'You will understand later.' He knew they were about to perform the vilest act of their lives, deserting Him. By morning they would bow their heads in shame and look down at their feet in disgust. And when they did, He wanted them to remember that He'd washed their feet. Remarkable. He provided mercy before they needed it and forgave their sin before they even committed it. Deeply moved and compelled by His love, all but one of them would go out and preach the Gospel and lay down their lives for Him. Paul writes, 'For the love of Christ compels us...' (2 Corinthians 5:14 NKJV) Christ's love for you is: (a) the only constant that never changes in a constantly changing world; (b) the thing that will draw you back to Him each time you fail; (c) the driving force that will cause you to want to give Him your all. '...The blood of Jesus, God's Son, cleanses us from every sin.' (1 John 1:7 NCV) The truth is we are always being cleansed by the blood of Jesus. The cleansing is not a promise for the future but a reality in the present. Let a speck of dust fall on the soul of a saint, and it is washed away. Jesus still cleanses His disciples' feet. He still washes away our sins. That knowledge should motivate you to live for Him like nothing else will.</p>
