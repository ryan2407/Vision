<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...REJOICE THAT YOUR NAMES ARE WRITTEN IN HEAVEN.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 10:20 NIV</span><br>Unless we're careful, looking good can become more important to us than doing good. For example, when others 'big us up' for how much we've helped them, it feels good, doesn't it? The disciples were like that too. When Jesus sent them on their first mission, they '...returned with joy and said, &quot;Lord, even the demons submit to us&quot;' (Luke 10:17 NIV). Jesus encouraged them, but He also warned them, 'Do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you...rejoice that your names are written in heaven.' God doesn't want us doing the right things for the wrong reasons! Listen: '...for the Lord is a God who knows, and by Him deeds are weighed' (1 Samuel 2:3 NIV).

Jesus taught about a secret life. Listen: 'Be careful! When you do good things, don't do them in front of people to be seen by them...' (Matthew 6:1 NCV). Practicing a secret life brings freedom to those of us who are trapped by the desire 'to be seen.' It enables us to give up on the whole business of 'image management.' What's that? Trying to impress others and con them into thinking that our life is in better shape than it really is. The desert fathers who lived hundreds of years ago in lonely sandy monasteries, had a saying about the practice of secrecy 'If you want to keep the fire hot, you must not open the door to the furnace too often.' 

Why not find some secret time with God to stoke up your furnace today?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...YOU WEREN'T LYING TO US BUT TO GOD!</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;> ACTS 5:4 NLT</span><br>A very honest pastor writes, 'Numerous Sundays I've preached a message that deeply moved the members of my congregation. But ironically I &quot;prepared&quot; by arguing with my wife on the way to church, or making life miserable for my children. Years of practice came to my rescue and I easily morphed into &quot;The Pastor,&quot; becoming instantly compassionate, holy and spiritual. I was faking because feeling needed, respected and wanted, can become as great a motivation as love for Christ.' So, how can you keep it real?

The Apostle Peter had to deal with a couple of fakers in the early church.  He said to them: 'You weren't lying to us but God'. This couple had twisted motives and it cost them dearly. They saw other Christians selling their land to help the poor and thought it was a great idea - in theory!  However, when they did the same they withheld part of the money and then lied about it. 

They wanted to 'look the part.' Be careful! Being the centre of attention can quickly become addictive! It can also disqualify you in God's eyes! As we finish today highlight these 2 verses in your bible: a) '...the Lord searches every heart and understands every motive behind the thoughts. If you seek him, he will be found by you...' (1 Chronicles 28:9 NIV) b) 'I the Lord search the heart and examine the mind, to reward a man according to his conduct, according to what his deeds deserve' (Jeremiah 17:10 NIV).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I CARE VERY LITTLE IF I AM JUDGED BY YOU...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>I CORINTHIANS 4:3 NIV</span><br>Many of us suffer from 'approval addiction'. The symptoms are: living as a slave to what others think; getting easily hurt by what they say; trying to impress important people and a nagging sense of 'I'm not good enough'.  Like all addicts we'll go to any lengths for a 'fix'.

One pastor writes: 'Years ago I wanted to lead a certain ministry. When I wasn't chosen I became angry. Of course I didn't show it. That's not to say I didn't love God. I just wanted to serve me more than Him! By saying no, God was correcting a destructive attitude that would destroy any real ministry I might have later. When you represent God so visibly, it's nearly impossible for anyone to detect that you're a fake...except God.'

Imagine being liberated from the need to impress, your self-esteem no longer resting on someone else noticing how smart or attractive you are. Imagine being able to actually feel love toward someone who expresses disapproval of you.

Henri Nouwen writes, 'Many of my daily preoccupations suggest that I belong more to the world [than to God]. A little criticism makes me angry... a little praise raises my spirits... often I am like a small boat on the ocean, completely at the mercy of the waves.'

Paul writes, 'I care very little if I am judged by you...It is the Lord who judges me' 

(1 Corinthians 4:3-4 NIV). Imagine caring about criticism 'very little'. It's not only possible, with God's help and a bit of hard work - it's attainable!

<title><![CDATA[ Convictions v Impulses]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...STAY CLOSE TO ANYTHING THAT MAKES YOU WANT TO DO RIGHT...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 TIMOTHY 2:22 TLB</span><br>Things we know deep down to be true are called 'convictions'.  The feelings that prompt us to do certain things because it feels good are called 'impulses'. We get into trouble when our convictions and our impulses collide. When everything's going our way it's not difficult to live by our convictions. But 'where the rubber hits the road,' is when those inner convictions demand something that'll be painful or costly! Impulsive people just do whatever their mood tells them to do.  People with conviction do what's right, no matter how they feel about it. Your convictions will help you act scripturally, and act consistently - and 9 times out of 10 your feelings will follow on. Convictions don't need to involve anything dramatic; they just steer the choices you make every day.  Convictions are the foundation of your character which is built like a wall, one brick at a time.

 Live by your convictions every day; and you'll have few regrets. This involves: a) thinking regularly about your life and forming opinions b) constantly measuring those opinions against God's Word and whenever it's appropriate, bringing them into line with it.

Nice guys may appear to finish last, but usually it's because they're running a different race. Running that race involves pausing regularly to examine your life and to pray, 'Search me, O God, and know my heart: test me, and know my anxious thoughts. See if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting' (Psalm 139:23-24 NIV)

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>DON'T LIVE...UNTHINKINGLY...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 5:17 TM</span><br>Here are three quick ideas to live by each day: 

1) be thankful!  Happiness is not about getting what you want, it's about enjoying what you've got! So keep your perspective and be thankful every day. Rudyard Kipling (not the bloke who makes little cakes, but the bloke who wrote Jungle Book) - anyway - he said, 'Do not pay too much attention to fame, power or money. Some day you will meet a person who cares for none of these, then you will know how poor you are'

2) resist jealousy! When you see your mates getting new clothes, new trainers, new mobile phones, does something stir inside you to want the same? Deep down you know that stuff doesn't mean anything. Anyway their parents might earn twice as yours, or they may be in debt up to their eyeballs. Be content to be you - an amazing, original child of God

3) give, give, give! Money's like manure: if you let it pile up it stinks, if you spread it around it helps things grow! Jesus said, '...From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded...' (Luke 12:48 NIV).  He means the more dosh you have the bigger responsibility you have to use it for his glory. How you use your money will be one of the biggest issues you'll face on Judgment Day. Think about that before you hand over that pound at the Lotto counter!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...I TELL YOU, NOW IS THE TIME OF GOD'S FAVOUR....</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS  6:2 NIV</span><br>When he wrote his second letter to the church in the city of Corinth, the apostle Paul took time to let them know that a special heavenly grace, or 'favour' was available to them. This favour would help them cope with life's challenges.  If you're trusting Jesus that same Favour Of God is for you too.  You are blessed and have been given good things to enjoy.  Don't listen to the devil's lie that you've no purpose, no power and no potential. If you believe that you'll have such low self-esteem that you won't believe God has blessed you in any way, or that you have any real possibility for success in life.

Understand this: no matter how great your accomplishments are to date, you don't have a thing outside of the FOG. Your blessings have been made possible only because the Lord is on your side. Listen: 'for the Lord God is a sun and a shield; the Lord bestows favour and honour; no good thing does he withhold from those whose walk is blameless' (Psalm 84:11 NIV) The writer of this Psalm understood that true fulfilment is a gift to God's children - enabled by the Favour of God. Do you understand that too? If you don't, you are at higher risk of being caught out by the devil's lies, plots and attacks.  As a Christian you're always going to be a target!  But the devil will find it hard to see you through the FOG!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...SAVE THEM...SHOW MERCY, MIXED WITH FEAR...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JUDE 1:23 NIV</span><br>When someone you know gets caught up in a situation that has the power to hurt or destroy them, what should you do? Jude says, 'Save them... show mercy, mixed with fear.' The word save is taken from a Greek word, meaning, 'to take immediate, decisive action.' The word fear is also taken from a Greek word, meaning 'a strong dose of respect for something that's life-threatening, dangerous or alarming.' Jude lets us know how dangerous saving people can be; in the same passage he says 'snatch others from the fire'. This is not a game.  You must be careful that you keep yourself from harm in the process.  

There is a responsibility on every Christian to do whatever they can to bring the misguided or the rebellious to the place of safety. We don't have a choice; we must act fast, act decisively and keep up our efforts until we are certain that they are back in safe territory again.

So, the word for you today is, 'take action - now!' As you get involved your healthy fear will keep you close to Jesus and stop you doing anything stupid which might damage your own faith.  Pray for wisdom then do everything you can to rescue that one who's caught in a web of deceit. Why don't you pray this prayer: 'Lord help me to know exactly what to say and do. Give me your inspiration and Your courage to say what needs to be said. Help me to love them enough to speak the truth to them. Use me as an agent of mercy to reach them as soon as possible. In Jesus' name, Amen.'

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>BLESSED ARE THOSE WHO MOURN, FOR THEY WILL BE COMFORTED.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 5:4 NIV</span><br>The Word 4U 2Day is committed to helping you through the ups and downs of life.  That means sometimes talking about stuff that other people don't - like death.  You might not have had to deal with it yet - but everyone does sooner or later.  Lifestyle coach Zig Ziglar knows the score. 'The longest 24 hours of my life were those right after my daughter's death. When making her funeral arrangements I had to listen to a salesman who was an incessant talker, and who told me thirty times that he wasn't a salesman. Twice I had to leave the room; I simply couldn't handle him.

'The night before, half asleep and half awake, I kept thinking my daughter was wondering when her daddy was coming to get her. The next morning I took a walk, praying and crying the whole way. When I returned the Lord spoke to me in such a distinct way: &quot;She's fine. She's with me, and you're going to be fine too. I'm all you need. Keep walking. Keep talking. Keep praying. Keep crying.&quot;'

Jesus said, 'Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.' Grieving lets you accept your emotions as they arise, to express your pain and move beyond it. Although grief is an experience that can't be avoided, you don't have to go through it alone. Listen: 'Do not be afraid...I will be with you. When you go through rivers of difficulty, you will not drown! When you walk through the fire...the flames will not consume you. For...you are precious to me. . .I love you' (Isaiah 43:1-4 NLT). Your joy will return - God promises it!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE APOSTLES SAID TO THE LORD, &quot;INCREASE OUR FAITH.&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 17:5 NIV</span><br>Sidney Holland, former Prime Minister of New Zealand, said, 'Faith draws the poison from every grief, takes the sting from every loss, and quenches the fire of every pain; and only faith can do it.'

The great inspirer Henri Nouwen said that our greatest challenge as disciples is, 'to recognize and believe that unexpected events are not just disturbing interruptions... but the way in which God moulds our hearts and prepares us.' The deeper your faith in God, the greater its potential to carry you through the rough times. Faith in Christ alone, gives us assurance not only for this life but for heaven beyond.  When you die - what then? John Maxwell who writes stacks of books on leadership remembers the funeral of Jane Chapman, wife of his good friend Tom. During the service the following poem was read: 'I am standing on the seashore. A ship appears, spreads her white sails to the morning breeze and starts for the ocean. She is an object of beauty and I stand watching her till at last she fades away on the horizon. Somebody at my side quietly says, &quot;She is gone.&quot; Gone where? Gone from my vision, that is all; she is just as large as when I saw her last. The diminished size and loss of sight is in me, not her; and just at the moment when someone at my side says &quot;She is gone,&quot; there are others who are watching her coming, and voices take up the joyful shout, &quot;Here she comes!'''

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>COME NEAR TO GOD AND HE WILL COME NEAR TO YOU...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JAMES 4:8 NIV</span><br>Christian leader John Bisagno says, 'Faith is at the heart of life. You go to a doctor whose name you cannot pronounce, he gives you a prescription you cannot read, you take it to a pharmacist you don't know, he gives you medication you don't understand - and you take it.' That's faith!

What could be worse than not having faith in God? When something good happens, who would you give thanks to? When something bad happens, who would you run to?

 If you wait until you can explain God, you'll never turn to Him. F.B. Mayer before he went to be with the Lord said, 'Unbelief puts our circumstances between us and God. But faith puts God between us and our circumstances.' Who wouldn't like to have the Creator of the universe helping them!

'But I haven't got a Christian family.  None of my friends are particularly interested in God. How do I find faith?' A famous old preacher called DL Moody said, 'I prayed for faith and thought that some day it would come down and strike me like lightning, but faith did not seem to come. Then one day I read the tenth chapter of Romans, &quot;Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.&quot; I closed my Bible and prayed for faith. Then I opened my Bible and began to study - and faith has been growing ever since.'

You might still be a bit stuck, thinking, 'But I don't know how to pray.' Just kneel and say, 'Jesus, I accept You as my friend, AND my boss too.' Go ahead, do it now - it's a prayer you'll never regret!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WE HAVE THIS HOPE AS AN ANCHOR FOR THE SOUL...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HEBREWS 6:19 NIV</span><br>You may not have thought about it much before but your life is a direct result of the things you believe deep down inside.  These basic ideas are called values.  They function as:

1) your anchor. Without values you're adrift like a boat on the sea without an anchor. Any storm can take you under, any current can carry you off to places you don't want to go. But with Godly values, you've an anchor that holds you steady, even when the sea of life gets really choppy. The Bible says, 'we have this hope as an anchor for the soul...' (Hebrews 6:19)

2) your compass. Seasons change. Relationships change. Circumstances change. Goals change. But values don't! Like a compass they are 100% reliable, always pointing toward the magnetic north. Is living this way easy? No! The people around you might take the Mickey when you 'walk by faith.' But people without Christian values won't understand your devotion to God. Those whose values are different from yours will try to convince you to lower your standards. Don't do it!  One day those people will get a shock, as Dr. James Dobson says, 'All of a sudden you realize that the ladder you've been climbing is leaning against the wrong wall.' Make sure that doesn't happen to you by ensuring Jesus is always at the centre of your life values.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...WHERE YOUR TREASURE IS, THERE YOUR HEART WILL BE ALSO.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 6:21 NIV</span><br>Have you ever said, 'When I have a lot of money, I'll be more generous'?  Yeah - right!  Who are you trying to kid?  

A big income doesn't mean you have a big heart! Well over 100 years ago Henry Ward Beecher warned that prosperity could actually make us less likely to give: 'Watch, lest prosperity destroy generosity.' You may know that the United States is the most prosperous country in the world, and is enjoying the most prosperous time in its history. But did you know that only 2.5 percent of their income goes to charity; that's lower than it was during the Great Depression of the 1930's!

If you desire to become a more generous person, don't wait for your income to change, change your heart! Find a way to give every day, however small. Be on the lookout for people or projects that are in need. They're all around you. Listen to this description of Jesus: 'When He saw the crowds, He had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd' 

(Matthew 9:36 NIV). Jesus is our ultimate example of a life of generosity - not because he had fat wads of cash to give away but because he recognised needs and helped out personally.  Generosity shows how we feel about people - people loved and valued by God; People for whom Christ died!  So, are you living selfishly or generously? What are you doing for, or giving to, the people in your world?  How you answer that question is the measure of your generosity!

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>LISTEN FOR GOD'S VOICE...HE'S THE ONE WHO WILL KEEP YOU ON TRACK.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 3:6 TM</span><br>Do you ever get tired of waiting for God? Are you ever tempted to just do what 'feels right'?  Careful!  Looking for a short-cut can take your life in the wrong direction.  Only God knows your final destination.

After the prophet Samuel selected David to be king, he had to hide for 7 long years while King Saul wrecked Israel's future. Then one of those 'short-cuts' showed up. One of David's soldiers discovered Saul defenceless and asleep in his tent, so he came to David and told him, 'God has delivered your enemy into your hand...let me strike him...' (1 Samuel 26:8 NAS).

What an opportunity! Get rid of the man who wants to kill you. Come out of hiding and claim your throne. After all, you're already chosen to be King! It all made sense except for one thing - it wasn't part of God's plan. As much as David wanted to rule Israel he knew that to succeed he must do it God's way, according to God's timetable, or else he would lose God's blessing and approval.

When David's mate offered to kill Saul he really thought he'd be doing the right thing. But well-meaning friends can give you advice that conflicts with God's plan. That's when it can be so tempting to listen to them, what they say might have a certain logic.

 Never let anyone, however well-intentioned, persuade you to do what you know is not God's plan for you. Instead, 'Listen for God's voice...He's the one who will keep you on track.'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...WRITE DOWN THE REVELATION...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HABAKKUK 2:2 NIV</span><br>As you've been growing up you might have noticed life getting more complicated.  Suddenly you're having to deal with stuff that just wasn't even an issue a year or two ago.  It's so easy to get confused.  One of the best ways to prevent that is to keep track day by day.  Get a secret notebook to scribble down what God's teaching you about life.  You don't need a diary of who said what to who...but you do need a record of things you can't afford to forget!

 Writing helps clarify what's really important in your life. Famous rappers like Eminem and Jay-Z never go anywhere without a pencil and a pad; their lyrics express the way they relate to the world around them.  It's nothing new; listen: 'At the Lord's direction, Moses kept a written record of their progress...' (Numbers 33:2 NLT). Your life is a journey, and a journey deserves a journal. So, why don't you take a time out each day and begin playing around with words to describe your spiritual journey. And don't just write about the bad stuff. Problems are easy to get caught up in. Think about your vision in life, what's happening in your character; you're a living testimony.  Every page in your notebook will take on a personality and soon you'll feel like it's your travelling companion.

Whilst reaching out to God for the answers to difficult questions, the prophet heard God say, '...write down the revelation and make it plain...' (Habakkuk 2:2 NIV)  You can't afford to get confused by all the mad stuff going on around you.  What you write will help you work things out and then you'll be able to share your God-given wisdom with your mates!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...HE WILL BE OUR GUIDE EVEN TO THE END.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 48:14 NIV</span><br>So, how can we be guided by the Holy Spirit?

1) by continually asking. You can develop the habit of asking in all sorts of situations.  In any place at any time if you feel you need some direction - if you need to make the right decision or say the right thing - just ask 

2) by paying attention and following instructions. What use is guidance if you're not willing to follow it? Imagine opening a new bank account - with a 'hole in the wall' cash card.  When the letter containing the PIN number arrived through the post would you just bin it before even opening it?  Who in their right mind would just turn up at the cash point and expect to guess the right number?  When that envelope arrived you'd tear it open and spend the next half hour memorising those 4 digits.  But you wouldn't stop there either - you'd get down to the bank and use it!  So do the same with the things the Holy Spirit communicates to you

3) overcoming your doubts. Has the phrase 'God's given me a 'word'...' been over-used and abused?  You bet.  But that doesn't mean you can't use it! If you sense the Holy Spirit speaking to you, through a scripture you read, or a picture in your mind or a feeling in your heart - claim it.  The truth is you'll soon get lost spiritually if you deny the voice of the Holy Spirit.  However mind-blowing your 'word' sounds, share it with a Christian mate, someone who knows their Bible and can help you unpack it.

God really can - and does - speak to us.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...HE WILL BE OUR GUIDE EVEN TO THE END.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 48:14 NIV</span><br>The Bible promises that God will be your guide.  That doesn't mean:

1) only in a crisis. We give little thought to spiritual guidance until we face something major like: what subjects to take, whether to go out with him/her, what Saturday job to apply for...often what we want isn't guidance it's a short-cut.  The key to knowing whether you really want God's guidance is by asking, 'How often do I seek it when I'm not facing a crisis?'

2) so you can feel important. God once spoke to a donkey (Num 22). Now, what if the donkey got on an ego trip and considered itself an exalted spiritual class, above all the other animals? How daft would that be?

3) laziness. One man said he decided not to chase a certain job on the grounds that it would be a sign of God's will if he got it without trying. So, does that mean whatever happens as a result of our laziness is God's will? That's like sitting in the middle of the motorway saying, 'If I don't get run over by a car, I'll know it's God's doing and not me acting in the flesh'

4) avoiding risk. Sometimes we don't really want to follow Jesus, we want safety! Being a disciple can be scary - and lonely! But the paths He leads us on help us develop good judgment, and make good choices.  Sometimes our faith-risks become faith-failures but God wants mature children, not robots. His purpose in guidance isn't just to get us to perform the right actions, but to become the right kind of people.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...HE WILL BE OUR GUIDE EVEN TO THE END.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 48:14 NIV</span><br>Even though we live in quite a godless society it's still quite common to hear talk about prayer. Praying crops up in pop songs, it pops up and in statements the Prime Minister makes. But when Christians talk about God speaking to them, suddenly they're 'weird'.  Why? Shouldn't God speak to His children?

Down the centuries Christians have described these holy conversations in different ways.  John Calvin described God's guidance as 'the inner testimony of the Holy Spirit.' An ancient dude called Ignatius called it 'movements of the soul - thoughts, feelings, or desires...given to us by God.' These may come as realising our sin, being amazed at God's love, or the desire to do something really good.  They're essential for every Christian life.

To hear from God you must be open to Him. And desperate for Him! During a rough time in Jacob's life God appeared to him in a dream, saying, 'I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go...' (Genesis 28:15 NIV). When Jacob woke up the next morning he said, 'Surely the Lord is in this place, and I was not aware of it' (Genesis 28:16 NIV). 'Not aware,' do those words describe you?

As you read these words your thoughts are being guided by a writer. Don't you think God can do the same, only better? Absolutely, God can speak into your heart and mind in all sorts of creative ways. Look what happened to Samuel when he was a boy. God spoke to him one night in the temple, but he didn't know it was God speaking. He needed the help of Eli the priest to learn to recognise God's voice. When he did, his life changed dramatically - and yours will too!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...TEAR DOWN YOUR FATHER'S ALTAR TO BAAL...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JUDGES 6:25 NIV</span><br>Famous writer Mark Twain said he spent a lot of money tracing his family tree, then twice as much trying to keep it a secret!  When it comes to your upbringing or your family's past, you might not have had the best start.  Stuff may have happened which really shouldn't have.  But nobody can wind back the clock.  You can't do much except learn from it.  But you can do a lot about your future!  

Your parents may have belonged to a generation that thought God was dead but you know He's alive and kicking.  Instead of stumbling in the darkness of the world's ideas you can walk in the light of the gospel  - and take your family with you! Gideon was a lad who grew up in Israel before the times of hero Kings like David.  His family had totally lost the plot and were worshipping a false god called 'Baal'. One night God told him, '...Tear down your father's altar... Then build a proper kind of altar to the Lord...' (Judges 6:25-26 NIV) Was that easy? Not likely - everyone in the village was into the Baal stuff too.  In fact they wanted to kill him when they found out he smashed the altar.  But Gideon trusted God and ended up changing everything!  

So, who's going to change your family dynamics? If not you, who? If not now, when? Gideon discovered that when you work with God, He works with you. So, with God's help you can change the dynamics in your family - starting with yourself first!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>AS A DOG RETURNS TO ITS VOMIT, SO A FOOL REPEATS HIS FOLLY.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 26:11 NIV</span><br>EDITORS NOTE: Hasn’t Ian Henderson done a great job of bringing April’s Word 4U 2Day to us?! He’s really got to grips with the original material supplied by Bob and Debbie and given it a really fresh twist. So, as it’s the last day of this edition we’ve let him rip with one of his own stories… ENJOY!!! 

‘I remember how shocked and shaken I was when, as a small boy, I first saw my dog being sick. I remember running to my Mum to tell her what happened. Then I got totally confused when I came back into the room where it had happened to find all the vomit had disappeared! About half an hour later, my dog was sick again but this time I decided to stay in the room to find out what kind of magic spell made the vomit vanish! What I saw was the most disgusting thing I had ever clapped my innocent eyes on, he was eating the sick!!! I ended up shouting at my dog, ‘NO WONDER YOUR BREATH SMELLS’. 
For humans nothing makes us feel more sick than seeing and smelling sick, but dogs don’t have this repulsion, they just think - ‘Oh great I get to eat lunch-twice!’  How can humans and dogs feel so incredibly differently? It would be hard to imagine anything so stupid, horrible or disgusting than what I saw my dog do. 
Yet King Solomon used this image to describe what we can be like when we go back to the same sinful habits, wrong thinking and selfish ways. God hates sin like humans hate sick. God pleads with us to stay away from this gross stuff, which like dogs, we just love returning to, time and time again. People say, ‘If something feels good it can’t be bad.’ But if my dog can be SO wrong about vomit, I guess I can be wrong about some of the things I don’t have a problem with but God hates. What do you think?

<title><![CDATA[How do you see God?]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Come boldly to...our gracious God</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Hebrews 4:16 NLT</span><br>Nothing is more important than how you see God, the picture you have of Him in your mind. That, and that alone, will determine how you approach Him, not only in times of need but every time. 
As long as you see God as the teacher who blasts at you in lessons and whose tests you can never pass, or a parent who always tells you off and never encourages you, you won’t ‘come boldly’ to God, because ‘boldly’ means having bags of confidence and optimism. You probably won’t come to God at all if you just think he’s gonna give you a hard time! 
But check this out: ‘That is why we have a great High Priest who has gone to heaven, Jesus the Son of God. Let us cling to him and never stop trusting him. This High Priest of ours understands our weaknesses, for he faced all of the same temptations we do, yet he did not sin. So let us come boldly to the throne of our gracious God. There we will receive his mercy, and we will find grace to help us when we need it.’ (Hebrews 4:14-16 NLT) Have you ever got your head round this whole High Priest thing? Basically, the High Priest stood in front of God in the temple in place of the people. God would accept his offerings and respond with blessings on the land. This is now the job that Jesus does, every minute of every day, in the real temple – heaven’s throne room! Is that part of your picture of God? It should be.
As we close today let’s move beyond how you see God and think about how God sees you. God’s feelings for you are very personal. Listen to this. In A Gentle Thunder, top bloke Max Lucado writes, ‘If God had a refrigerator, your picture would be on it. If he had a wallet, your photo would be in it. He sends you flowers every spring and a sunrise every morning. Whenever you want to talk, He’ll listen. He can live anywhere in the universe, but he chose your heart. And what about that Christmas gift He sent you at Bethlehem? Not to mention that Friday at Calvary. Face it, He’s crazy about you!’

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>How precious...to realize that You are thinking of me constantly!...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 139:17 TLB</span><br>To: My best mate, my dear child, my faithful servant
SUBJECT: You’re on my mind!
I knew you before time began. I even know how many hairs on your head! Like parent, like child; you’re created in my image. Not only have I got plans for you, I’ve also given you the talents to fulfil them. And what I give nobody else can take away. But don’t neglect them; remember to use them and stir them up everyday. 
Be in no doubt that I have started a good work in you and I’m going to finish it. I always wrap up what I get started. My commitment to you never ends. 
Sure, in life stuff gets tough and I know sometimes you feel battered and bruised but here’s something to get giddy about; I’ve robbed satan of his power to hurt you, and the world of its power to destroy you. When you’re in trouble, I’ve got your back! Give me your hassles and troubles and I’ll keep you going. When you are stressed out or weighed down, lean on Me. I’ll be your Rock, your Fortress, your Deliverer and your Strength. Even though you fall from time to time you won’t be destroyed because I’m holding you.
But don’t listen to people who act like they are allergic to me and won’t come near me or those who diss me! Buzz off my Word - the Bible and drink it in and you will be like a massive tree growing by a river, strong and fruitful. 
God  ;-)
ps I’d love to hear back from you, see you at my place on Sunday!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>DON’T THINK ONLY ABOUT YOUR OWN AFFAIRS…BE INTERESTED IN OTHERS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PHILIPPIANS 2:4 NLT</span><br>It’s too easy to ‘think only about your own affairs.’ But God says, ‘Be interested in others.’ Here are five ways to do that:
1) give them a push! Barnabas became known as a great encourager because he ‘…encouraged the believers…’ (Acts 11:23 NLT). Remember when your mum or dad used to push you on a swing? Eventually you’d start that funny pumping with your legs and start swinging by yourself; you just needed a little help to get going. Even a flashing a smile to someone who looks down can boost them up. Job said, ‘When they were discouraged, I smiled… My look of approval was precious to them’ (Job 29:24 NLT).
2) honour your word! The Bible says, ‘In the last days…men shall be…truce-breakers’ (2 Timothy 3:1-3 KJV). But you don’t have to be one of them! If you say you’ll do it, do it! Character is measured by action not words, so be someone whose word has meaning.
3) hold your tongue! Always say less than you think. Remember, ‘A fool vents all his feelings…a wise man holds them back’ (Proverbs 29:11 NKJ). And since how you speak is as important as what you say, always be kind and with no attitude.
4) be cheerful! Solomon said, ‘A cheerful heart brings a smile…a sad heart makes it hard to get through the day’ (Proverbs 15:13 TM). Don’t dump your problems and disappointments on others, take them to God in prayer.
5) show genuine interest! The Bible says, ‘Laugh…when they’re happy; share tears when they’re down’ (Romans 12:15-16 TM). But you can only do that by taking the time to find out what’s going on in their world.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...YOU TURN DARKNESS TO LIGHT.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 SAMUEL 22:29 CEV</span><br>Since the world is continually revolving, it means whenever the sun’s shining in one half of the world, its dark in another. While one person’s experiencing midnight, another’s happy because daybreak has finally arrived. Same time – just different locations. So when you’re having a Tough time in life – ‘a night time’ experience, if you can just hold on a little longer things will change. That’s a guarantee! The same way you rotated into the darkness you’ll rotate out of it again. God will ‘turn your darkness into light’ if only you’ll keep trusting Him.
In Genesis, while Adam was sleeping, God reached in, performed some very clever surgery and made Eve. At midnight, while the other prisoners slept, Paul and Silas prayed and sang praises to God in their jail cell and He delivered them. When Peter was locked in the inner prison, at midnight God sent an angel to get him out. When Jesus was crucified the earth was plunged into darkness. But on Easter morning the light came on – forever!
Paul says, ‘We walk by faith, not by sight,’ (2 Corinthians 5:7 NKJ). You’ve got to expect some night time experiences. The ‘dark room’ is where He develops you into the image of Christ. Sticking it out just gives you the qualifications to walk out into the daylight – having earned the right to be there!
Our ‘night vision’ is faith that is stubborn, radical and never gives up. When it’s backed into a corner it stands its ground and declares, ‘It hard to imagine things getting worse than they are now, but I believe God.’ That’s the kind of faith that gets results!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>GOD CALLED THE...EVENING AND...MORNING...DAY.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 1:5 NIV</span><br>Notice how God counts the days during creation. He doesn’t say, ‘The morning and the evening were the first day.’ No, the Bible says, ‘God called…the evening and the morning…day.’ God specializes in bringing light out of darkness, day out of night; you just have to get through one to get to the other!  The Bible says in Exodus that God, ‘Sent a…wind that blew all night until there was dry land…and the Israelites walked through’(Exodus 14:21-22 CEV). Cool! God worked in the darkness!
David said, ‘Weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning’ (Psalm 30:5 NKJ). Ever got early and watched the sunrise? There would be no big deal if it was always light!  The dawn is always more brilliant because the darkness comes first, just as your progress with God is all the more remarkable when painted against a backdrop of pain, challenge and breakthrough. Often when you hear someone ‘bigging God up’ and talking about a great experience of God’s power and love, the chances are you’re seeing somebody who’s been through a dark night, who has been having a rough time. Whenever they finally can say ‘look at what amazing thing God has done’ it’s because they’ve spent time weeping before God.
Paul says, ‘Let us hold fast…hope without wavering…He who promised is faithful’ (Hebrews 10:23 NKJ). Trusting God is more than just wishful thinking; it’s knowing that if He said it – He’ll do it; that He doesn’t just control creation, He also controls your circumstances – so don’t be blind, have some faith – switch on your Night Vision. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>GOD SAID, ‘LET THERE BE LIGHT’…AND IT WAS SO.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 1:14</span><br>Anytime God blesses you, get ready for the complainers who think He should have blessed them instead (or at least as much)! When a dispute arose about which tribe should lead the Israelites, God told Moses to have each tribal leader write his name on his walking stick and place it overnight in the big tent thing they called the ‘Tabernacle’. Then God said, ‘The man I have chosen…buds will grow on his walking stick! Then…this complaining will stop’ (Numbers 17:5 TLB). Imagine, an old stick with no roots or sap, blossoming in the dark! You might think when your life is dark and times are tough nothing good can happen, but faith has nothing to do with the laws of nature, faith is supernatural and it flourishes in dark times! 
Hardship doesn’t stop God’s plans, He has chosen to use you to make the world a better place and make Him famous in the process. It’s going to happen, believe it! There’s a stage at which you don’t even know you’ve been chosen; only God knows. He told Jeremiah ‘Before I shaped you in the womb, I knew all about you…’ (Jeremiah 1:5 TM). Before you were a bleep on a monitor, God had plans for you. You didn’t die on the operating table or in that car accident because His hand was on you. And He didn’t choose you because you’re such a wonderful person! No, He chooses, ‘What the world thinks is unimportant…so…no one can boast’ (1 Corinthians 1:28-29 NCV).
When God created the heavens and earth the Bible says, ‘…darkness covered the face of the deep…’ (Genesis 1:2 NRS). But as soon as God said, ‘Let there be light’…it was so. And today God can still bring light out of your darkness and hope out of your despair. He’s not freaked out by the darkness – it’s where He does some of His best work!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...YOU ARE A SLAVE TO WHATEVER CONTROLS YOU.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 PETER 2:19 NLT</span><br>‘I’m your constant companion, your greatest helper or heaviest hassle. I push you onward or drag you down. I’m at your command. Half the things you do you can give to me and I’ll do them quickly and correctly. I’m easily controlled – but you must be firm with me. Show me exactly what you want done and after a few lessons I’ll do it automatically. Those who are great, I made great. Those who are failures, I made failures. I’m not a machine, although I work with the precision of one, plus the intelligence of a person. Take me, train me, be firm with me and I’ll place the world at your feet. But be easy with me and I’ll destroy you. Who am I? My name is Habit!’
God’s Word - the Bible says, ‘You are a slave to whatever controls you.’ Sinful habits rob you of the good things God has planned for you. Habits are subtle. You get lulled into thinking ‘It won’t hurt to miss my prayer time this once,’ or, ‘I’ll buy it and find the money to pay for it later,’ or ‘I’ll just go into this chat room, what harm will it do?’ What harm? Plenty! Give Satan an inch and he’ll take a mile! 
God knows every habit you’re struggling with today and He’s made a way of escape – an exit strategy. What is it? Turning from temptation and running to the arms of Jesus, the One Who can help you overcome anything you face, big or small – and let’s face it, we do trip over small things more often than big things right? Listen, you really can break this if you will fix your eyes on Jesus.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...CHRIST IN YOU, THE HOPE OF GLORY.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>COLOSSIANS 1:27 NIV</span><br>Niccolo Paganini, one of the greatest violinists of all time, was about to perform to a full house. As he walked on stage to a standing ovation something felt very wrong. Suddenly he realized he had somebody else’s violin. Horrified, but knowing he’d no other choice he began to play – and gave the performance of his life. Afterwards he reflected, ‘Before today I thought the music was in the violin; today I learned that the music’s in me!’
Now this should blow your head off: Christ lives in you – and brings all of His power and resources with Him! So any time you’ve a problem, you can face it in the power of the crucified, death busting, risen and victorious Lord who lives within you.
Following Jesus and being his disciple isn’t about understanding deep ‘theological issues’, going to church or even learning the Bible off by heart. Paul says, ‘I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me’ (Galatians 2:20 NIV). There’s a big difference between living a Christian life, and allowing Christ to live His life through you. Jesus wants to reveal Himself to those around you – by working through you! For that to happen you must learn to spend time with Him because like they say, you ‘become like the company you keep.’ Staying sensitive to the prods from the His Spirit, knowing His will by living in His Word, always comes down to a battle of priorities. What’s more in important TV or prayer, bible or blasting aliens on your X-Box? And you’ll fight that battle of priorities every day!
So, when others see how you respond to problems (and opportunities), do they see Jesus? Can they see the difference His presence makes in your daily life? If not, it’s time for change!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I WAS AFRAID AND...HID YOUR TALENT.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 25:25 NKJV</span><br>Jesus told this story about three men who received money from their boss. Two of the guys invested and used the cash wisely and doubled it; the third was afraid to take a risk so he buried his. When the boss came looking to see what profits he had, the third guy said, ‘I was afraid, and…hid your money in the ground.’ His boss was furious. ‘That's a terrible way to live! It's criminal to live cautiously …The least you could have done would have been to invest the sum with the bankers… I would have gotten a little interest. Take the thousand and give it to the one who risked the most. And get rid of this “play-it-safe” who won't go out on a limb, (Matthew 25:25-29 TM).
God expects you to use all that He has given you and not hide those gifts and talents! Part of fulfilling your destiny in life is the decision to take some risks to make the most of the opportunities you’ve been entrusted with. Avoiding risks or living out of the fear of what others will think is a bad move - in fact it’s a bigger risk than the risk you’re afraid of, because one day you will have to explain to ‘your boss’ (God) why you bottled out! 
Why does Jesus come down so hard on this issue? Because our loss isn’t the only one suffered. Our loved ones, our mates and those around us also lose out when we don’t pursue our dreams. There’s a domino effect; others get cheated out of the greatness lying unused within us.
But it’s not too late. God loves us. Like Lazarus being called out of the grave, Jesus calls each of us today to step over our fear, take risks in obedience to faith, and experience the fullness of who God made us to be. Go for it! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>AND GRIEVE NOT THE HOLY SPIRIT...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 4:30 NIV</span><br>When Paul wrote this letter to his mates he wrote in Greek. The word ‘grieve’ comes from the Greek word ‘lupete’ (loo-petee). It means pain a husband or a wife feels who’s just discovered that the love of their life has been unfaithful to them. That’s got to be a very serious kind of pain.
Your relationship with the Holy Spirit is so important! If you don’t believe it, try living a day without Him. Just as someone in love constantly thinks about and longs to be with the one they love, so the Holy Spirit comforts us, protects us, guides us, strengthens us, desires to be close to us and wants to reveal Himself to us. But when we act like the world, talk like the world and respond like the world, we cause the Holy Spirit to experience the pain of betrayal.
We need to realize how precious the Holy Spirit is in our lives and honour Him by making sure we live lives of commitment. If our behaviour’s been out of order we just need to tell God about it, confess our sin and receive His forgiveness and be made clean through the blood of Jesus so that we can be sorted with God again. 
So, before you rush out into another hectic day, stop and pray, ‘Holy Spirit is there anything in my life which causes you grief? If there is, reveal it to me so that I can deal with it. Forgive me for allowing my attitudes and actions to dishonour You. Starting today, I want to live every moment with the intent to please You and never cause You grief again. In Jesus name – Amen.’

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...MAN LOOKS ON THE OUTWARD APPEARANCE, BUT THE LORD LOOKS AT THE HEART.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 SAMUEL 16:7 NIV</span><br>Right now the people in your life may not recognize your potential or think you’re very important, but God does. Remember when David was young? Others saw a shepherd boy but God saw a king! If you follow the story though, before David could become king he had to overcome two pretty major obstacles. 
Obstacle 1) His own family’s failure to recognize him! When Samuel came looking for a king amongst Jesse’s sons, David was left out! Why? Because he was the youngest? Because the other brothers were more mature? Because they were stronger? Because they had more GCSEs? (Goat-herders Certificate in Shepherd Education) 
Obstacle 2) Samuel the prophet’s failure to recognize him! When Samuel saw the oldest brother, Eliab, a general in King Saul’s army, he thought: ‘…Surely the Lord’s anointed stands here’ (1 Samuel 16:6 NIV). But God set Samuel straight: ‘Man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.’
David’s dilemma’s a common one: many of us don’t believe in ourselves because we’re not recognized or encouraged by others. Maybe you’ve got big dreams for your life but you feel the pressure to just do what your parents want you to do. Or maybe you’ve have been told you can never be anything good so you don’t even bother to dream.  If so, it’s time to: a) find out who you are b) pray that God will open your eyes and put someone in your life who’ll confirm what God’s placed within you.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE SPIRIT...DECIDES WHICH GIFTS TO GIVE...EACH OF US.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 CORINTHIANS 12:11 CEV</span><br>God is 100% good and God is 100% fair. But being good doesn’t mean we all get what we want and being fair doesn’t mean we all get treated the exactly same! No question, every person deserves equal treatment in terms of kindness, love and respect. But we don’t all have the same abilities or the same jobs to do because God ‘is the one who gave these gifts to the church’ (Ephesians 4:11 NLT). 
Parents love their kids, but those kids don’t all have the same talents and abilities, right? God doesn’t show us all the same things in the secret place of prayer or give us all the same gifts when we make ourselves available to him. 1 Corinthians 12:11 says, ‘The Spirit…decides which gifts to give to each of us.’ And God never, ever, makes mistakes! 
Even among his own disciples Jesus had what you could call ‘A’ and ‘B’ teams; and He used both. One team He took with Him up a mountain where they met holy prophet dudes Moses and Elijah (check Matthew 17 again), the other team He sent into the city to work. When Peter, James and John went up the mountain with Jesus they may have experienced things the others couldn’t have handled – Peter was certainly having a hard time taking it all in! But that’s what THEY needed to do the job that God was setting up for THEM.
Notice something important: Jesus didn’t try to take everybody up the mountain so that nobody would feel left out, He did what He knew was right! If you feel that someone else is more ‘gifted’ or ‘used more’. Don’t stress, Jesus knows what is right, what is right for them and right for you. He has got gifts and plans sorted for you. Just trust Him.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I BROUGHT HIM TO YOUR DISCIPLES, AND THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO CURE HIM.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 17:16 AMP</span><br>Ever notice that whenever some people are in trouble it’s never their fault... their youth leader didn’t help out enough, their mates let them down, or it’s their family, their looks, their background, or some other excuse. It can even be God’s fault?! It’s hard to admit you stuck your own hand in the fire! Or almost drowned by jumping in headfirst when you can’t swim!
When this man approached Jesus he said, ‘My son…frequently falls into…fire and… water…I brought him to YOUR disciples, and they were not able to cure him.’ (Matthew 17:15-16 AMP) He never once said, ‘Maybe he inherited this problem from me.’ Or, ‘Perhaps if I’d brought him up differently.’ No, he just dumped the responsibility to the disciples, who were in training themselves. Understand this: you can’t deal with the problem until you stop trying to deal out the blame!
When the disciples asked Jesus, [Why couldn’t we do it?] (Matthew 17:19), it’s like asking ‘Why isn’t my life going as planned?’ Jesus replied, ‘Because your faith is too small’ (Matthew 17:20 NCV). Often you need the kind of faith that makes you seem a little weird, that doesn’t need other people’s approval and doesn’t care whether or not you fit in. This is the kind of faith that made Noah say, ‘Even if nobody else in my generation believes, I’m going to build this boat because God said so.’  Paul said, ‘…Having done all…stand [on what God has told you]’ (Ephesians 6:13 NKJV), because ultimately, trusting God’s Word is the only thing that works.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>MY SON...FREQUENTLY FALLS INTO THE FIRE AND...WATER.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 17:15 AMP</span><br>The dad who came to Jesus in this story had asked everyone - including Jesus’ mates, to help him. In the end only Jesus could sort out the problem. This man’s little boy was caught in a cycle of self-destruction where he ‘frequently [fell] into the fire and…water.’ You know what? Anytime you keep making the same mistakes, falling into the same traps, jumping into the same dodgy relationships, getting hooked on the same habits, it’s time to take your problem to Jesus!
A clever bloke called Henry Van Dyke says, ‘As long as habit and routine dictate your pattern of living, new dimensions of the soul will not emerge.’ Our habits are like machines; time and time again they turn out the same product;  the same person with the same problems. Changing or breaking a habit needs a new way of thinking and doing things. And that requires coming to Jesus and through his power in your life developing a strong relationship with God!
In the Old Testament book of Deuteronomy, chapter 7 verses 1-2, God told His people to destroy their enemies; otherwise their enemies would eventually destroy them. They were going to have to start fighting more aggressively than they’d ever done before because they were fighting for their survival and the survival of their families.  And when He tells you it’s time to declare war on self-destructive and bad habits, don’t say, ‘But everybody’s doing it!’ Or, ‘It’s no big deal.’  We need to lose that attitude! Its keeps us tied up and stop us from enjoying the freedom that Jesus gives us. Why not pray today: ‘Lord, show me the root of this problem, and how to deal with it. I’m ready for positive change in my life today.’

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...IF YOU HAVE FAITH AS A MUSTARD SEED, YOU WILL SAY TO THIS MOUNTAIN,</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 17:20 NKJV</span><br>Remember that faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we can’t see (Hebrews 11:1 NIV). It’s knowing that nothing is impossible for God. When you’re battling a ‘mountain’ of sickness, loneliness or depression or something has gone wrong - it’s easy to have self-defeating thoughts. ‘Things always go wrong for me,!’ ‘Why is my life so rubbish?’ ‘I can’t do anything right’.  Also, because we live in a ‘…faithless and perverse generation…’ (Matthew 17:17 KJV) it means constantly fighting the neggy attitudes of our culture, the media, and even our mates, ‘God can’t do anything!’ ‘What’s the point in praying’ Unless you recognize this it can wear you down, diluting and polluting your faith. That’s why you need to feed your faith daily on God’s Word - the bible.
Check what Jesus says in today’s verse. He isn’t chatting about a mountain you came across years ago, or some future issue. No. He said, ‘Say to THIS mountain.’ He wants you to exercise your faith today! Listen again: ‘If you have faith as a mustard seed…nothing shall be impossible.’ A mustard seed’s so tiny, it can get stuck between your teeth! Yet the Bible says that although it’s ‘…the least of all seeds…’ under the right conditions it can grow into a tree big enough for the birds to nest in (see Matthew 13:32 NKJV).
God-given faith is like a sleeping giant within each of us. When it awakens, miracles happen. If you’ve got just one atom of faith left, you have what you need to hack it and win! But this kind of faith only works when your attitude and words match your faith; there’s no point trying to have faith but moaning about how everything is going wrong. The enemy doesn’t want you to know that, because when you do, you won’t just think about what’s happening – you’ll think about what’s possible!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>MAKE DISCIPLES OF ALL...NATIONS...TEACHING THEM TO OBSERVE ALL...I COMMANDED YOU.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 28:19-20 NASB</span><br>If Jesus’ only goal on earth was to die for sin, why didn’t He go directly from His Baptism to the cross? Because for the next three years His plan was to plant the seeds of leadership in the lives of those who’d ultimately carry His message to the rest of the world. Because of what Jesus taught, His disciples were making a difference and turning the world upside down long after He’d departed. 
Today you need to know that Jesus wants you to learn the same lessons He taught His mates face to face.  The Gospels are His training manuals - packed with real life examples of the hardcore training course Jesus set those who spent every day talking, sleeping, eating and travelling with Him, so they didn’t miss an opportunity to learn about their mission and the methods needed to fulfil it. 
When the work experience and training was over Jesus gave them a job - ‘Make disciples of all…nations…teaching them to observe all…I commanded you.’ And do you know what? We’ve got the same job and to ensure that you’re able to get on with it He wants you to use the gifts He’s given you! It’s hard to imagine now, when you’re young, but just as we can read about how Jesus’ mates got on with it and became history makers maybe future generations will hear stories about what you did for God! That way when it’s their turn they can pray with confidence, ‘God, you’ve done impossible things in the past and You can still do them today.’

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>JONATHAN MADE A...VOW TO BE DAVID</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>S FRIEND.' 1 SAMUEL 18:3 NLT</span><br>From Day One, Jonathan and David were on a collision course – Jonathan as the rightful heir to the throne of his father, King Saul of Israel, and David who’d been called by God to become King after Saul. These two had everything to lose by becoming friends because ultimately only one of them could become King. So were they suspicious and jealous of one another? No, because neither was interested in promoting himself! In fact, ‘Jonathan made a…vow to be David’s friend…by giving him his robe, tunic, sword, bow and belt.’ He risked his life to help David, despite his Dad’s saying that Jonathan would never be King or have a kingdom as long as David was alive (see 1 Samuel 20:31 NIV). Likewise, David kept putting his life on the line fighting the Philistines to help Saul and Jonathan keep their kingdom. 
A true friend is ‘there for you,’ even when they’d rather be somewhere else. Oprah Winfrey - the queen of the daytime TV chatshows says, ‘Lots of people want to ride with you in the limo, but what you want is someone who’ll take the bus with you when the limo breaks down!’ Real friendship is about being more concerned with the other person’s well being than about your own. The Bible says, ‘…Friends love through all kinds of weather…’ (Proverbs 17:17 TM). So, when was the last time you thanked God for the real friends in your life? What is it that separates them from the pack and makes them so special? Be sure to notice and big them up them at every opportunity. And if you need a friend, try being one!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>BRING ALL THE TITHES INTO THE STOREHOUSE...TRY IT!</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MALACHI 3:10 NLT</span><br>A pastor received the following letter from a couple in his church: ‘We were behind with our rent and car payments. We had $40,000 in debt, no food in the fridge and we’d just started a construction business. So when you challenged us to tithe as part of our Christian commitment we thought, “How can we give what we don’t have?” Nevertheless we decided to go ahead and honour God by giving Him the first tenth of our income.
‘The very first week we met a contractor who asked us to build a house, with more to follow. Now we no longer questioned how we’d fulfil our commitment to God; in fact, we increased our giving! And if the story ended there it would still be a good one. But you can’t out-give God! Through a series of divinely orchestrated events we went from being renters to homeowners. Today we’re enjoying financial blessing. And even though this story’s all about trusting God, on reflection we’re still trying to answer one question: ‘What exactly was it we sacrificed?’
We can all find a million excuses about why we shouldn’t regularly give God at least 10 percent of our money. You might only get an allowance or a few spare quid from a Saturday job but beware of developing tight fists, thinking your money is all yours because you earned it all by yourself. Anytime you struggle to give God what’s rightfully His, it’s because you’ve become more attached to the gift than the Giver. Talk to your youth leader about how your money can be used by God to help others. And check out what God says, ‘Bring all the tithes into the storehouse…I will open the windows of heaven [and] pour out a blessing…you won’t have… room to take it in. Try it! Let me prove it to you.’ Ready to take Him up on that challenge today?

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>[WE]...GAIN...WISDOM FROM THOSE WHO HAVE LIVED A LONG TIME.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOB 12:12 CEV</span><br>You can learn a lot from those who have lived a long time.  So check out what one elderly lady says and try and work out how you can learn from her life!
 ‘One benefit of living so long, is sharing what I’ve learned. So make my day by letting me share three secrets that can make your life better:
1) time is precious, don’t waste it! After my husband died I was staying with friends. One evening they started arguing and eventually stopped speaking. I know arguments happen; my husband and I had several… But at that moment I understood like never before that the time we have TOGETHER is precious. Don’t waste it bickering about things that won’t matter when your loved one, your family or friends have gone. Do everything you can to live in harmony and show your love. Why? Because no matter how long you have together, it’s never enough.
2) you’re making memories, make them good ones! Looking back I thank God for so many unforgettable moments. The day my husband died we kissed (as we always did when we parted), at noon. By 5.30 pm he was dead. I’ve always been glad about that final kiss. Create memories – not regrets!
3) it’s not what happens, it’s how you respond that counts! Every day holds new challenges that’ll test your love and resolve. You have the power through Christ to make each test an occasion for growth. Life’s full of seemingly unpleasant events. Try to handle them in such a way that when you’re old you’ll look back and say, ‘I thank You God for that experience; it helped me grow.’’ ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>SEEK HIS WILL... AND HE WILL DIRECT YOUR PATHS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 3:6 NLT</span><br>There's nothing like a few boring boyfriends or grim girlfriends to make sure you wait for Mr/Miss right - not just go for Mr/Miss right now!  Being selective and not just asking out the next person who gives you a smile might limit your options, but does mean that the next 'Brad' wannabe doesn't just turn out to be the Pitts! Despite what the teen magazines say there is no sure fire way of knowing if the NEXT one will be THE one but here are five questions you should ask yourself:

1) What's my first impression? And I'm not just talking about if you can spot their spots- what are they like? What kind of parties do they enjoy? Do they get drunk? Smoke?  Swear? Do drugs? This kind of information can save you untold heartache. People say don't judge a book by its cover, but, until you really get to know somebody, what else can you go by?

2) How well do I know them? Isn't it wiser to go out with somebody you've known for a while, instead of a stranger? 

3) How do they talk about others? Nothing's worse than a bloke who brags about his previous conquests or a girl who constantly criticizes and moans about her ex? Would you trust them with your reputation - or your heart?

4) Are your values the same? Opposites may attract, but that's not a good rule when it comes to values. You need to know that your date's a committed Christian who walks the talk. What kind of standards do they have about things like money, morals and movies? 

5) Do they keep their promises? In previous relationships did they flirt and cheat, or remain loyal? A promise-breaker usually becomes a heart-breaker! God says, When you 'seek His will...He will direct your paths,' so pray about these five things before you start going out with someone.

<title><![CDATA[Keeping the faith]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...I HAVE KEPT THE FAITH.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 TIMOTHY 4:7 NASB</span><br>Jesus said, ‘…In this world you will have trouble…’ (John 16:33 NCV). He wasn’t joking, was He! Ever noticed how your life is never short of challenges and difficulties which test your faith?
Daniel was the victim of a major sting operation. Knowing he prayed regularly, his enemies persuaded King Darius that all prayers should only be made to the King. The big headed Darius loved that idea! But Daniel kept praying to the true God three times every day – in front of an open window, where everyone could see him. That’s hardcore!  When the king heard, he threw Daniel into a pit full of hungry lions. But next morning when Daniels enemies went in to collect his bones he was still there, ‘Alright guys, how ya doin’? Kinda cool in here with the lions innit!’ The King found out in no time and announced, ‘…Daniel’s God is the living God…’ (Daniel 6:26 NCV). Daniel’s mates, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego refused to worship the king’s idols. Even when warned to ‘Bow or burn’ they said, ‘The God we serve is able to…rescue us… if he doesn't...We still wouldn't serve your gods…’ (Daniel 3:17-18 NIV). And because they ‘kept the faith’ God delivered them – and promoted them!
All these guys would’ve been inspired by the story of David facing down Goliath but refusing to trust in the king’s armour. Why was that? Listen to what he said: ‘…I cannot go with these; for I am not used to them’ (1 Samuel 17:39 NCV). So what did he go with?  ‘…I come to you in the name of the Lord’ (1 Samuel 17:45 NCV) and the rest is history! Now, chances are you’ll never find yourself in a lion’s den, a fiery furnace, or facing a giant – although some days it’ll feel like it! But when you’re under attack: a) pray and claim God’s power b) keep the faith c) go ‘in the name of the Lord.’]]></introtext>

<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE STONE WALLS REMAIN[ED], UNTIL THE SLINGERS SURROUNDED AND ATTACKED.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 KINGS 3:25 NRS</span><br>In the Old Testament ‘The Slingers’ were guys who went around blocking other people’s wells by throwing stones and dirt into them, threatening their very survival. When Bible talk about this bunch of dodgy dudes it says: ‘They stopped up all the springs. . .Only Kir Hareseth was left… but men…with slings surrounded…and attacked it as well’ (2 Kings 3:25 NIV).
Now, chances are you know some slingers, or worse, you’ve suffered at their hands. They are the people who seem to be out to get you, the bully at school, the back stabbing ‘friend’. The easiest thing to do when others fight dirty can be to chuck some dirt yourself. So if you started the slinging or just feel like finishing it- check out what the bible says: ‘...If you stop making trouble for others…then your light will shine in the darkness [you’ll begin to get attention from and have influence with the right people]…The Lord will always lead you [you’ll suddenly begin to make the right moves]. He will satisfy your needs in dry lands [He’ll give you success in the most unlikely places and in spite of the obstacles] and give strength to your bones [cause you to live a long and healthy life]’ (Isaiah 58:9-11 NCV). Now that sounds like a good deal!!
So, don’t be a ‘Slinger.’ Guard your thoughts because they become your words. Guard your words because they become your actions. Guard your actions because they become your character. And guard your character. Why? Because it determines your destiny!

<title><![CDATA[The ‘Anger Test’]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>DON’T SIN BY LETTING ANGER…CONTROL…YOU.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 4:26 NLT</span><br>Uncontrolled anger is like jumping into a Ferrari, putting your foot down, then discovering the brakes don’t work. The Bible says, ‘Don’t sin by letting anger…control…you...[it] gives a…foothold to the Devil.’ Did you get that? Uncontrolled anger opens the door to satan then it’s all down hill from there! So before you say something you’ll regret or can’t take back, ask yourself:
1) is my anger appropriate? Sometimes it is when we see injustice or evil around us. But let’s be honest, how often is your anger caused by others or God being mistreated and how often is it because you’ve not got something the way you wanted or you’ve let yourself over react to the words or moods of others. ‘Healthy anger’ is controlled and pushes us to pray and look for change not freak out and sulk! ‘The mind controlled by the Spirit is life and peace’ (Romans 8:6 NIV). A controlled response and a gracious response is a Christ-like response. It always wins!
2) is it really worth dragging other people into? ‘You won’t believe what they just done!’  we’ve all said it. Anger often draws in those around you because it’s only human to take sides. Dragging others in is usually a way to feed our own ego by getting people to agree with us and make us feel better about our own bad behaviour. Leave it out! 
3) is the relief I’ll get from mouthing off, worth the mountain of hassle afterwards? The Bible says, ‘A gentle answer turns away wrath…harsh words stir up…anger’ (Proverbs 15:1 NLT). By sounding off, you usually end up making a ranting speech that you end up regretting! By its very nature anger encourages exaggeration. It makes you say things you can’t take back. Long after you’ve moved on, its words maintain their power to wound and divide. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...ANYONE WHO WANTS...COME AND DRINK OF THE WATER OF LIFE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>REVELATION 22:17 NLT</span><br>How long can you hold out? That’s what the Babylonians were asking as they encircled Jerusalem. Nebuchadnezzar, the Babylonian king, had cut off their food and other essential supplies. So how long could they survive? A month passed, then two, then an entire year, still they held out.
The secret of the city’s survival lay in a hidden water supply which came from a spring outside the city walls. King Hezekiah had cut a 1,777-foot tunnel through solid rock. From there, water passed under the city walls to a reservoir inside called the Pool of Siloam. Without it God’s people would’ve gone down in defeat.
There’s a lesson here for us. To live victoriously you must: a) be able to identify your life’s true source b) draw daily from it c) protect it. If your security, your strength, your self-worth or your strategies for living come from any source other than God, you’re vulnerable and could get battered! Everything you need comes from God, so protect that relationship, nurture it coz it’ll always be the focal point of satan’s attack. A day without God’s Word isn’t a slip, its set up for failure! Prayerless-ness isn’t carelessness, its craziness or arrogance! Maybe at times you’ve thought - ‘Well, I don’t pray much and I’m doing okay. So it doesn’t matter ‘Maybe you haven’t reached your hour of testing yet. When it comes, and it will, what will your source be? Remember the lesson of the secret well in Jerusalem!  Answer this: ‘If you can do it without God, is it even of God?’ If it’s not, it’ll go up in smoke (See 1 Corinthians 3:13 NIV). So, stay connected to your source!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>PAUL AND SILAS...WERE PRAYING AND SINGING...AND THE OTHER PRISONERS HEARD THEM.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ACTS 16:25 NIV</span><br>Being locked up in a Roman prison was a nightmare!. Offenders were stripped, whipped and locked into chains. Their blood-soaked clothing wasn’t even changed in the dead of winter! And the ‘inner cells’ (v.24) where Paul and Silas were imprisoned were the worst. Lack of water, cramped conditions, and the stink of toilets (if that’s what you could call them) made sleep impossible and waking miserable. Prisoners there routinely begged for death while some even committed suicide. 
But after Paul and Silas were ‘beaten, and…thrown into prison…[they] were praying and singing…and the other prisoners were listening.’ The Message Bible says, ‘The other prisoners  couldn’t believe their ears.’ Talk about impact! Paul’s attitude impressed them before his religious beliefs did. Anybody can sing in church, including hypocrites. But praise in prison – now that’s something else! How did they do it? Perspective! It’s not what you’ve lost but what you’ve got left that counts! Paul didn’t just sing in prison, he wrote some of his best stuff. Listen: ‘…everything happening to me in this jail only serves to make Christ more accurately known, regardless of whether I live or die. They didn’t shut me up; they gave me a pulpit! Alive, I’m Christ’s messenger, dead I’m his bounty. Life versus even more life! I can’t lose’ (Philippians 1:20-21 TM). Wow! What are his enemies going to do about a man like this? He’s beyond their threats! His strength comes from within. Speaking out faith – it’ll make an impact every time!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...YOU MEANT EVIL AGAINST ME; BUT GOD MEANT IT FOR GOOD.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 50:20 NKJV</span><br>In spite of the fact that Joseph was betrayed by his brothers, sold into slavery, wrongly accused of rape by Potiphar’s wife and banged up in prison for many years, he could say: ‘You meant evil against me; but God meant it for good.’ Has something happened in your life, which was a nightmare at the time, but later you realized was necessary? If you hadn’t been through certain things or handled certain situations then you wouldn’t be ready for the blessings you’re enjoying now, right? It’s when you see the hand of God in stuff that you begin to understand that what the devil intended for your destruction, God used for your development.
To be ‘more than a conqueror’ (check out Romans 8:37 NIV) means you can stand up and say: ‘It took everything I’ve been through to make me who I am and to teach me what I know. So I choose to be better, not bitter. I trust the faithfulness of God more than ever. If faith doesn’t move the mountain, and shift this problem, faith will give me strength to hack it until tomorrow. And if it’s not gone by tomorrow I’ll still believe that God is able to sort it– and trust Him until He does.’
Big up God because each step of your life is being sorted by Him (see Psalm 37:23). He hasn’t taken His eye or His hand off you, not even for a single moment. When you get through this hard time you’ll realize that ‘the worst thing that could have happened’ was something that God has used to help you.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...THEIR SINS...WILL I REMEMBER NO MORE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HEBREWS 8:12 KJV</span><br>Do you ever get on a guilt-trip about your past? If so, check this out: ‘Their sins…will I remember no more.’ Does that mean God’s a bit of a goldfish with a three second memory? No way, He chooses not to remember your sins! And when you choose otherwise you question His forgiveness, allow the enemy to diss you, and you’re robbed of the confidence you need to pray for and receive what God has got in store for you. 
When you relive your past failures in your head you not only keep them alive - you give them power. Just as nobody knows when a dormant volcano will erupt, you can’t predict when an unresolved issue will resurface turning your words into hot coals and your behaviour into a blaze of destruction. Only by forgiving yourself, and others, can you truly break the hold the past has over you and be able to get on with your life.
Shame is not a blessing; it’s a weight Jesus carried for you on the cross. Dump it on the floor and 
walk away. You have the right to do that because God’s promise is, ‘He has taken our sins from 
us as far as the east is from the west.’ (Psalm 103:12 NCV). Next time you’re reminded of something bad in your past and you start feeling guilty about it just picture in your mind the empty cross of Jesus. That’s where your baggage belongs. Jesus has dealt with it once and for all. There’s only one person who wants you to remember your past and that’s the devil because:  
a) he hopes you don’t know the truth b) he fears your future c) he wants to rob you of God’s best. So what do you do? Point him to the cross, tell him and your self that it’s a done deal, and keep moving forward!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I WAS GIVEN...A HANDICAP.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 12:7 TM</span><br>Okay this might sound like a physics exam question, but imagine large four steel rings. The first can support up to 80 Kg, the second 60 Kg, the third 40 Kg and the fourth 20 Kg. Linked together what’s the greatest weight the chain can support? Two-hundred Kg? No! A chain is only as strong as its weakest link, so the answer’s 20!
And it’s the same with us; we’re as vulnerable as our weakest areas. That’s why we generally try to excuse or ignore them. But that’s dangerous, because you start thinking you can handle everything alone. Paul was a brainy guy and wrote about a third of the new testament, but before he met Jesus he was just a guy who thought he knew best but in fact was just a religious nutter! Despite his great ability, he had to learn to rely on God, and that meant being honest about his weaknesses. Check out what he said: ‘…therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may rest on me’ (2 Corinthians 12:9 NIV). Hindrances, handicaps and hurdles are God’s gifts to the self-sufficient and self-sorted!  He won’t allow you to use your weakness as a crutch or a kop-out, He wants to use them to keep you dependent on Him.
So Paul writes: ‘I was given…a handicap to keep me in constant touch with my limitations’ (2 Corinthians 12:7 TM). God will keep us in touch with our limitations and weaknesses. Why? To embarrass us? No, to empower us so we can do His will, His way, in His strength! Every thing that God does in your life is designed to increase your dependence on Him. Listen: ‘Yours is the Kingdom, and the power and the glory, forever, Amen’ (Matthew 6:13 NKJ). It’s all about Him – not us!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>TO WIN...YOU MUST DENY YOURSELVES...THINGS THAT...KEEP YOU FROM DOING YOUR BEST.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 CORINTHIANS 9:25 TLB</span><br>An agency once created an ad for a Rolls Royce that said: ‘At 60 mph  the loudest noise in the new Rolls-Royce is the electric clock.’ When they ran the ad by a Rolls executive he smiled and said, ‘I suppose we’ve got to do something about that clock!’  Never stop trying to do it better!
The moment we start believing we’re successful enough or smart enough to put our feet up and stop trying, we’re in trouble. We’ve set a ceiling on our potential! The Bible says: ‘Do you know a hardworking man? He shall be successful and stand before kings’ (Proverbs 22:29 TLB).  Who are your ‘kings’? Your footy team’s coach? Your science teacher? If you work hard you’ll get noticed.
The successful people in sports, film, music, business- whatever you see yourself doing - are always ones who’ll show up early, stay late, go the extra mile and keep asking, ‘Is there a better way?’
A young man once asked Henry Ford, the geezer who invented Ford cars, ‘How can I make a name for myself and be successful?’ Ford replied, ‘Decide what you want then stick with it. Never deviate from your course no matter how long it takes or how rough the road, until you’ve accomplished your purpose.’ Everybody wants what successful people have, they just don’t want to do what successful people do to get it! Successful people don’t quit! No matter how many times they fall, they get back up and start again. Paul J. Meyer, a big business bod, says, ‘Ninety-nine percent of those who fail are not actually defeated. They simply quit.’ So, refuse to quit. Oh, and one more thing: ‘Commit your work to the Lord and then your plans will succeed’ (Proverbs 16:3 NLT).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...DO NOT LET YOUR HEARTS BE TROUBLED AND DO NOT BE AFRAID.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 14:27 NIV</span><br>You can learn to control what goes on in your mind! How? By filling it with God's Word! Have you ever heard the phrase 'you are what you eat' ?  In the Bible Jesus refers to himself as the bread of life.  For us to have a healthy mind we need to feed on the right stuff, getting a daily dose of the bread of life.

Jesus had a go at His disciples because they freaked out in the storm (Mark 4:40NIV).They didn't trust Jesus who stayed peaceful.  He was asleep in the back of the boat. Where are you today? Resting with Jesus in the back or panicking with the others up front? Worry takes over when you forget two things: 
1) what God's told you! Listen: '...Let us go over to the other side' (Mark 4:35 NIV). Jesus words were so powerful that no wave could stop them getting across that water. And anytime you're doing what God's told you to do, you can't go under either!

2) who's with you in the boat? They thought they knew Jesus pretty well but before the night was over they were asking, '...Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him' (Mark 4:41 NIV). God's allowed the storm you're going through to show you that: a) you don't have a problem He can't solve b) you may be powerless but He's not c) you're not alone; He's with you d) through this experience you'll come to know Him better.

Jesus said, 'Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid,' because the only power worry has over you - is the power you give it!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...IN REPENTANCE AND REST IS YOUR SALVATION...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ISAIAH 30:15 NIV</span><br>When you're totally drained in every way and you feel out of control, confused by other people's expectations, it's easy to become numb to what you really feel inside.  Your decisions are all over the place because you're being tricked by all sorts of emotions.  For example, if you're really tired you become more likely to snap at someone or react in a way unlike the real you.  When we get exhausted we stop communicating and sometimes we end up doing an ostrich impression, burying our heads in the sand, hoping it will all go away!

So what's the answer? God said, 'In repentance and rest is your salvation'.  In other words, for fast effective relief - stop! Instead of pushing, struggling to keep going, stop and talk to God about what's happening. Rather than feeling overwhelmed, and weighed down by how hard your situation is get God involved by praying:

'Lord, help me keep my mind fixed on You. During this time of busyness and stress help me to get my priorities in step with Your will, to think Your thoughts and focus my heart on your love for me. Your Word says You've planned peace for me. Because you rescue and protect me I will not let myself be worried or afraid. Thank You Jesus for helping me stay peaceful today'.

God didn't design you to be numb, he designed you to be sensitive.  If you feel you're getting out of balance come back to this prayer again and again.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>JESUS SAID, &quot;LETS GET AWAY...FOR A WHILE AND REST.&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MARK 6:31 NLT</span><br>There are two kinds of 'tired.' One type of tired is like clouds before a shower, the other is like clouds that appear before a tornado. One's temporary and normal. It comes from a job well done and after a period of rest you bounce back. The other's a chronic inner fatigue that accumulates over months and is sometimes hard to spot. In fact, it's masked by crazy amounts of activity and compulsive behaviour: a) you can't relax over a meal or with mates b) you keep checking and rechecking your messages and emails c) your desk's  piled high with post-it notes and 'to do' lists d) you never manage to take a day off to chill e) any break you get ends up totally hectic f) you can't sleep g) any free time you have is spent in 'escapist behaviour' like eating, drinking, spending or watching TV.

Wayne Muller who runs an organisation called 'Bread for the Journey' which helps the poor, also writes books.  In one he says,  'Because we don't rest, we lose our way. Poisoned by the belief that good things come only through unceasing determination and tireless effort...for want of rest our lives are in danger.' 

While you're busy working hard and looking important you can feel lost in a crowd and miss

.the voice of the One who wants you to find your rest in Him. Sure God expects you to work hard, but not to the point that you're sick and your relationships suffer.  If you relate to this today Jesus is saying, 'Let's get away...for a while and rest.' So stop what you're doing, take a break and spend some time with Him.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...ABSOLUTELY NOTHING CAN GET BETWEEN US AND GODS LOVE...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 8:39 TM</span><br>Feel like you don't measure up? Listen: 'With God on our side like this, how can we lose? If God didn't hesitate to put everything on the line for us...is there anything else He wouldn't gladly...do for us? And who would dare pick a fight with God by messing with one of His children? When Christ chose you, you became His property and He will defend you.  He died for us - He was raised to life for us - is in the presence of God at this very moment sticking up for us. Do you think anyone is going to be able to drive a wedge between us and Christ's love for us? No way! Not trouble, not hard times, not hatred, not hunger. Not homelessness, not bullying threats, not back-stabbing, not even the worst sins listed in the Bible...none of this stuff can separate us from God .'I'm absolutely convinced that nothing - nothing living or dead, angelic or demonic, today or tomorrow, high or low, thinkable or unthinkable - absolutely nothing can get between us and God's love' (Romans 8:31-39 TM).

Imagine being loved like that - by God! No matter how rubbish you feel, you can't shut off or in any way stop the flow of His love for you. Nothing can change the way He feels about you. Nothing can alter the fact that He's going to go on loving you no matter what you do or say. Never forget that because only God's love will heal your emotions, build you up and help you realise you are worth so much. God's love will also get you on your feet and get you involved in the world affecting other people's lives. That's because His big plan is that everyone in the world should have the chance to feel His loving arms around them too.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...YOU ARE LOOKING FOR JESUS...WHO HAS BEEN CRUCIFIED.  HE HAS RISEN FROM THE DEAD; HE IS NOT HERE...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MARK 16:6 NCV</span><br>Imagine if you had been one of Jesus' disciples.  Day One: Friday, you had watched Him being brutally killed in front of your eyes, and now Day Three: Sunday you're standing outside His empty tomb having a chat with an angel who tells you that Jesus 'has risen from the dead'.

All of a sudden things Jesus had said to you before, start to make sense, 'the Son of Man must suffer many things...that He must be killed and after three days rise again' (Mark 8:31 NIV).

You realise that this was supposed to happen; that actually this was the reason Jesus had been put on the earth. His death was part of God's plan to free mankind.

When Jesus died He made it possible for us to have a relationship with God, but when he came back to life it showed everyone that death was no longer in charge '...it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him' (Acts 2:24 NIV). Death and dying no longer had the last word; Jesus now has the last word.

If you belong to Jesus nothing can snatch you out of His hand.  Before Jesus died and came back to life our sentence was one of death because of our bad ways; but now if we follow Jesus our sentence is life. Listen to what Jesus said, 'I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full!' (John 10:10 NIV).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>OUR ONLY GOAL IS TO PLEASE GOD....</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 5:9 NCV</span><br>Before an aircraft takes off the steward tells you that if the plane gets into trouble you should put on your own oxygen mask before attempting to help others with theirs. That makes sense. Unless you get enough oxygen, how can you help anybody else?

Are you getting the time you need with God? If not, it's time you chilled a bit and started taking care of yourself before you burn out. You can't travel quietly through life hoping other people will see how hectic your life is and give you a break. Say something, or they'll just keep giving you more stuff to deal with!  Freedom from stress comes when you let go, and let God!. Overloaded people grind to a halt when they're handling more than they should.

You're like a plane; if you carry too much baggage you won't get off the ground. If you are motivated by the need to please or impress, you'll take on too much and in the end fail to reach the heights God planned for you, or crash because you ignored your limitations.

Everything that comes your way isn't always your problem to solve!  Many times Jesus left the crowd to be alone with the Father. Did He get criticism for it? Yes! Did He enjoy chatting to the Father? Yes! And you need to prioritise too!  What is the right thing to focus on now?  People don't always recognise what we need, but God knows exactly what we need when we need it.  Here's a tip: carry what you can, learn when to say 'enough,' then let rip and fly!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...JESUS SAID &quot;IT IS FINISHED&quot;, WITH THAT HE BOWED HIS HEAD AND GAVE UP HIS SPIRIT</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 19:30 NIV</span><br>Have you ever spoken to an artist about their painting?  The first thing they always seem to say is: 'it isn't really finished'.  They can instantly see in the picture room for improvement or an adjustment they wish they could make, even when it is sold or hung on a wall.  They look at the work through critical eyes roaming the canvas to see how they could have made it better.

When God looks at what was accomplished through the cross He lets His eyes look it over but sees no flaw or half done task.  He sees something that is perfect and complete.

Listen, when Jesus leaned out from the cross, lifted His head to the dark sky and said 'It is finished' He wasn't just talking about the pain He had to endure. There was a much deeper meaning. Jesus knew that His death opened the door for people to be able to have a relationship with God if they wanted to.  Isn't that amazing?  There is a doorway open in front of you today and if you step through it you'll begin an awesome adventure getting to know your creator and His plan for your life.  The Bible says '...see, I have placed before you an open door that no one can shut...' (Revelation 3:8 NIV).

So over this Easter weekend don't get sucked into focussing on how much chocolate you can eat, but take a moment from munching and thank God for Jesus, who opened the door for you to a new life that will last for ever.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>FOR I PROMISED YOU AS A PURE BRIDE TO ONE HUSBAND, CHRIST.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 11:2 NLT</span><br>Why is it so important that we stick close to Jesus? Because everything we do reflects on Him. We're His reps! He gets the credit each time we stick our neck out to say or do something good that we wouldn't normally say and do. We totally big him up when we humble ourselves and choose his way instead of our own. Our lives tell a great story of His grace when we love our enemies and those who hate us, hurt us or reject us. Unfortunately He also gets a bad name when we act like everyone else in the world and get drunk, swear or diss other people.

A single person only has their own reputation to worry about - what they say and do reflects only on themselves. But if you were married, your actions, or what you said would reflect on your partner too.  No man wants his wife running around town slagging people off, writing bad cheques, getting drunk in the local bars or flirting with other blokes.  He doesn't expect that from her 'cause she loves him and wouldn't want to do anything to hurt him, or their relationship.

We have been reserved for someone who is totally perfect.  He has a good reputation.  His character is faultless, His strength and courage are unmatched, His love for us is beyond imagination. He is Jesus! So, if we are reserved we no longer live for ourselves - but for Him! Why? Because how we live each day reflects on Him!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>FOR I PROMISED YOU AS A PURE BRIDE TO ONE HUSBAND, CHRIST.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 11:2 NLT</span><br>OK, so the guys might find this hard to visualise, but you have been set apart for God like a bride is set apart for her husband!  In the Bible the church is called 'the bride' (John 3:29 NIV) and as part of the church we should want to look our best and be totally pure in our lives, ready for when Jesus returns. We can look at the church today and say that it isn't a very attractive bride; in fact she looks a bit of a minger, half dressed and not very prepared for the 'big day' but even if that is true God is still totally in love with her. 

You wouldn't marry someone you didn't know so we need to get to know Jesus - what makes Him happy, what makes Him sad, but most of all we need to get to know His voice.  How?  

a) by reading the Bible we can get to know about His promises, Jesus said '...have you not read what God said to you?' (Matthew 22:31 NIV) b) when we worship we make a connection with His heart. '...since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful and worship God (Hebrews 12:28 NIV) c) when we pray He reveals His plan, purpose and path for our lives. '...we constantly pray for you that our God may count you worthy of his calling and that by his power he may fulfil every good purpose of yours and every act prompted by your faith' (2 Thessalonians 1:11 NIV)

Your relationship with Jesus is the ultimate adventure but just like a bride and groom make vows to each other, we have a vow to Him for life!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>ALL YOUR CHILDREN WILL BE TAUGHT BY THE LORD, AND THEY WILL HAVE MUCH PEACE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ISAIAH 54:13 NCV</span><br>Eighty-five percent of all children brought up by praying parents develop a strong personal faith - before age 13. But if your parents aren't Christians don't worry, 'cause the Bible teaches us that the Lord will teach us.  The world is a tough place to grow up in and the media constantly bombards us with what they say we should look like or what we should behave like.  But what do we allow to guide us and frame our lives?  A pop star who can sing but has loads of emotional baggage, or Jesus who tells us to come to Him. 'come to Me all you who are weary and burdened...I will give you rest' (Matthew 11:28 NIV)?

He deals with all our baggage and then goes on to say 'learn from Me...you will find rest' (Matthew 11:29 NIV) How amazing is that?  The most powerful person in the whole universe wants to sit down and teach you all about Himself and how to get through each day with their highs and lows.  But not only that, He promises us a special touch called 'an anointing' when we spend time chilling in His presence.  The apostle John says 'As for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you...his anointing teaches you about all things' (I John 2:27NIV). So in all the busyness of life, stop, sit down and let the Holy Spirit teach you in life!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...WE GIVE YOU ONLY WHAT YOU HAVE ALREADY GIVEN US.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 CHRONICLES 29:14 NLT</span><br>When it comes to the bling, always keep three things in mind:

1) God owns everything! Your name may be on the account, but don't get any wrong ideas. Listen: 'We give you only what you have already given us' (1 Chronicals 29:14 NLT). So when God tells you to help out a mate or give to charity, don't say: 'I'll think about it,' 'cause every time we obey, there's a blessing waiting 

2) God is your source! Remember, every good thing you have comes from Him! It's okay to have money, just don't trust in it. Paul says, 'Trust [only] in...God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy' (1Timothy 6:17 KJV)

3) get His opinion before you spend His money.  Remember you're blessed so that you can be a blessing.  When it came to giving Jesus was the man!  Listen: 'They gave not only what they could afford, but far more...their first action was to dedicate themselves to the Lord and...whatever direction God might give them through us' (2 Corinthians 8:3-5 NLT)  When God has access to your heart He'll have access to your cash!  True financial freedom comes when giving no longer threatens your security, because you know that God's the supplier of your every need!  Listen: 'Give and it will be given to you.  A good measure, pressed down shaken together and running over...' (Luke 6:38 NIV).  Jesus understood the importance of giving, not just money, but our time and our energy. You can also bless the socks off those around you, if today you'll look for creative ways to give.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WE WOULD HAVE COME...BUT SATAN HINDERED US.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 THESSALONIANS 2:18 KJV</span><br>Are you chasing something you believe is God's destiny for you, yet one obstacle after another seems to keep you from getting to it? You're not alone! The Apostle Paul experienced this too. The word 'hindered' is from a Greek word used to describe a road so rough and full of pot-holes that it was impassable. Ever been down a road like that, only to have to turn around, go back and find another route to get to where you wanted to go?

But the same Greek word (enkopto for you boffins) was also used in an athletic sense; it describes a moment when one runner comes along side another and literally elbows him out of the race. Clearly Paul understood the devil's tactics; not only will he put obstacles in your way, he'll also try to elbow you out of the race. So, this word hindered means 'a track so bumpy that it stops you from going where you need to go, or an unprovoked attack that elbows you off course'.

If this describes where you're at today, don't worry, the story isn't over! In time a way opened up for Paul to get to where he needed to be - and it'll open up for you too! The devil never has the last word on anything, and that goes for the situation you're in now. Regardless of what he's tried to do, remember, all that God has promised you will happen, if you just keep trusting Him with all your heart. He will never let you down.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>ALL OVER THE WORLD THE GOSPEL IS BEARING FRUIT.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>COLOSSIANS 1:6 NIV</span><br>We saw yesterday how many Christians try to justify how little they've grown by saying: 'God hasn't called me to be fruitful, just faithful'.  But God expects both! Being 'fruitful' involves going and telling people about Jesus.  Being 'faithful' means accomplishing as much as possible with the resources and talents He's given you. That's why comparing yourself to others is a mistake. Success isn't being the one that does the best job of looking holy; it's producing as much fruit as possible, given your gifts, your opportunities and your potential. God doesn't expect you to produce more fruit than anyone in the history of the universe, ever, but He does expect you to produce all that you can with His help. In the course of your life that will be more than you can imagine. It is possible to work really hard and get results but if you're not trusting God for more than you can produce by yourself then where's the faith?  And if what you're doing doesn't require any faith then you're not being faithful!

Are we being faithful to God's Word if we keep our mouths shut when someone asks us what we believe? Don't get religious, stuck in your ways and missing the life.  If our own agendas become more important than the people around us we run the risk of the fruit in our lives getting old and rotten and becoming totally undesirable to our mates and neighbours.  We want people to 'taste and see that the Lord is good...' (Psalm 34:8 NIV).  And they can only do that when they cross paths with someone who is always full of 'God fruit'.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...ALL OVER THE WORLD THIS GOSPEL IS BEARING FRUIT AND GROWING...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>COLOSSIANS 1:6 NIV</span><br>Some Christians say: 'All God expects of us is faithfulness!' Wrong! He expects faithfulness - and fruitfulness! Fruitfulness is a major theme of the New Testament and it doesn't refer to apples and oranges:

1) God said: '...I chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit - fruit that will last...' (John 15:16 NIV). God wants to see lasting results from what you do in life

2) 'This is to my Father's glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples' (John 15:8 NIV). A life full of God and following what He says is good evidence that we're going the right direction 

3) 'We pray... that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and may please him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work' (Colossians 1:10 NIV). Our ultimate goal should be to totally please Jesus with our lives.

The nation of Israel lost the plot for a while because they were unfaithful with being fruitful. Listen: 'The kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who produce its fruit' (Matthew 21:43 NIV). Sometimes we do the same thing and get side-tracked by our own agenda for life and ignore what God is asking us to do. Because we have become self-satisfied and self-absorbed we stop bearing good fruit.

The word fruit is used about 55 times in the New Testament and refers to: a) repentance (Matthew 3:8 NIV) b) practicing the truth (Matthew 7:16-21 NIV) c) answered prayer (John 15:7-8 NIV) d) giving to God (Romans 15:26-28 NIV) e) winning the lost (Romans 1:13 NIV). The truth is God wants us to be faithful - and fruitful! As long as there are people who don't know Jesus we need to keep on living a life that tastes juicy and fresh to others.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...YOUR NAME WILL NO LONGER BE JACOB, BUT ISRAEL</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 32:28 NIV</span><br>The name Jacob means 'trickster.' Imagine wearing that label, knowing each time someone called your name they believed only the worst about you. And Jacob was true to his name. He tricked his uncle Laban out of his flocks and his older brother Esau out of his inheritance.

Then something changed. Alone in the dark of night, Jacob had a God encounter.  Listen: 'So Jacob was left alone; and a man wrestled with him till daybreak...the man said, &quot;Let me go, for it is daybreak.&quot; Jacob replied, &quot;I will not let you go unless you bless me.&quot; The man asked him, &quot;What is your name?&quot; &quot;Jacob&quot; he answered... The man said, &quot;Your name will no longer be Jacob but Israel because you have struggled with God and with men and have overcome&quot;' (Genesis 32:24 &amp; 26-28 NIV).

Check this out: you may have done what they say you've done - but that doesn't mean you're who they say you are! Spend time with God and He'll tell you who you are! Read the Bible and through his word He'll reveal your identity and what He wants you to do. He'll show you that you're: a) born to win and not fail (Deuteronomy 28:13 NIV) b) part of a chosen generation (1Peter 2:9 NIV) c) more than a conqueror (Romans 8:37 NIV) d)  loved with an everlasting love (Jeremiah 31:3 NIV) e) a treasure (Exodus 19:5 NIV) f) the citizen of a holy nation (Exodus 19:6 NIV). God only knows what makes you tick.  Only he knows you inside out!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THIS IS MY BELOVED SON, IN WHOM I AM WELL PLEASED.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 3:17 NKJ</span><br>When Jesus stepped into the River Jordan to be dunked by John the Baptist, He was stepping into the bull's eye of God's destiny for His life. Have you ever stopped to think that when Jesus walked into those waters they were murky with the sins of mankind? When John baptised people it represented their sins being washed away and owning up to their need of forgiveness for all the wrong stuff they'd done.

Now you might think: 'How gross! Jesus is wading into sin.' But Jesus did it to fulfil the purpose of God - forgiveness for you and me. Jesus was exactly where God wanted Him to be, doing precisely what God wanted Him to do. BULL'S EYE! That's why God announced, 'This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased.'

Don't expect God to speak up for you or cause others to see you for who you really are, until you're willing to follow Him all the way into the position He's got for you. And that may mean stepping into some muddy waters! But when you do you won't have to speak up for yourself, fight for yourself or demand anything of others. God will fight your corner for you and win!  He'll help you when it's hard, and encourage you all the way. You won't have to grope for the right answer or wonder if something's right or wrong for you. God will give you the ability and resources you need. Why? Because you're in the bull's eye, right where He wants you to be, doing what He wants you to do!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...GOD HADN</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>T YET SENT RAIN ON EARTH NOR WAS THERE ANYONE AROU</span><br>At the beginning of creation God caused a mist to come up from the earth and water the ground. Up till then there'd been no rain. Why? Because there wasn't anyone around to work the ground.'  What can we learn from this? Well, for starters, there are some things God has planned to do, has the resources for doing and wants to do that He won't do till we get into the place where we can take what He longs to give.

Amazing gifts are in God's hands; abilities and talents to help the world around us; the solution to our pain, or the peace when we're afraid.  But God can't give to us if our hands are closed.  You may be experiencing a 'mist,' in your life, but you know God has something more for you! You have a 'God itch', a frustration that makes you say, 'Why am I no further along?' Rather than blaming the people in your life or the circumstances around you, you need to stop, look up and ask: 'Lord, are You waiting for me to get into the right place?' When you ask that question expect Him to answer. When He does do what He asks, even if it means rearranging your priorities, busting out of your comfort zone, and breaking old bad habits. There is always a cost to have what He wants you to have. What does God want you to have? Not a mist, but a massive downpour of blessings to refresh you right to your roots!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>BLESS THOSE WHO CURSE YOU, PRAY FOR THOSE WHO MISTREAT YOU.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 6:28 NIV</span><br>Real forgiveness means praying for them to be blessed!   Are you serious? Totally! Real forgiveness is hard because: a) it goes against how we might feel b) nobody else might ever know that we forgave the offence c) It's tough to see God bless the one who hurt us in answer to our prayers, and as if they'd never done a thing wrong.

A Christian leader hundreds of years ago called John Calvin said that to pray like this is 'exceedingly difficult' and even that's an understatement!  Job's suffering didn't stop until he prayed for his so-called 'mates' who had really hurt him with their words (see Job 42:10 NIV). When we start to pray this way we become more like Jesus who said: 'Love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute you; that you may be the children of your Father in heaven' (Matthew 5:44-45 NKJ).

If you're saying: 'How can anybody live that way?' look at the life - and death - of a guy called Stephen in Acts 7.  While the religious nutters were murdering him he prayed, 'Lord, do not hold this sin against them' (Acts 7:60 NIV). God helps us to forgive in the toughest situations. So if you're asking, 'How can I know I'm walking in real forgiveness?' The answer is: a) you won't blab b) you won't intimidate c) you won't guilt-trip d) you'll let keep their self respect e) you'll free them from future complications f) you'll do it for life g) you'll pray for them to be blessed.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...AND HE REASSURED THEM...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 50:21 NIV</span><br>Real forgiveness is a life-long commitment. Seventeen years after being reunited with his long-lost son Joseph, Jacob dies, and Joseph's brothers suddenly panic! Listen: 'When Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead they said, 'What if Joseph holds a grudge against us and pays us back for all the wrongs we did to him?'' (Genesis 50:15 NIV). So they made up a story and sent a message to Joseph saying: 'Your father left these instructions before he died...forgive your brothers the sins and wrongs they committed in treating you badly' (Genesis 50:16-17 NIV). Now if their dad had really said this he wouldn't have told Joseph's brothers, he'd have spoken to Joseph face to face before he died. He wouldn't have died worrying that Joseph would hit out in revenge.  When Joseph heard that his brothers doubted his forgiveness, he cried and told them: '...don't be afraid. I will provide for you and your children. And he reassured them and spoke kindly to them...' (Genesis 50:19-21 NIV). Notice the words 'he reassured them.'

Real forgiveness is a life-long commitment! You must practice it every day until you die. No one ever said it would be easy. If Jesus had waited until His enemies repented, He'd never have prayed, 'Father, forgive them, they do not know what they are doing' (Luke 23:34 NIV). Sure, it's easier to forgive when someone's acknowledged their wrong, but if that's what you're waiting for you could be waiting a long time.  What you don't forgive plays like a scratched CD, skipping over the hurt again and again.  So make a choice.  Change the track and forgive.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>HURRY BACK TO MY FATHER. TELL HIM &quot;YOUR SON JOSEPH SAYS...&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 45:9 TM</span><br>Real forgiveness frees people from future complications.   Not only did Joseph forgive his brothers, he anticipated their worst nightmare - having to go back to tell their father what they'd done to him 22 years before. But Joseph is a step ahead of them; he tells them what to say - and what not to say! Joseph knew that practicing real forgiveness doesn't mean hurting others in the process! 'It would have been right for them to confess what they'd done to their father,' you say. Really? Wouldn't that have given the old man an even bigger problem - struggling with regret over his lost years with Joseph, not to mention having to fight bitterness toward his other sons? Joseph was wise. And it made his brothers respect him.

There's a difference between confessing and 'dumping!' Hearts have been broken and lives totally messed up because someone tried to make themselves feel better by dumping the details of their guilt on somebody who couldn't handle them! God is amazing at dealing with guilt - as we confess it, he takes it all and gets rid of it. When David had slept with Bathsheba and was feeling the sharp end of the consequences he wrote: 'Against you [God], you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight...' (Psalm 51:4 NIV). When you consider that God knows all about your failures and mistakes yet promises to keep them a closely guarded secret, it should: a) make you really thankful b) help you to keep your mouth shut c) make you refuse to hold onto anybody else's mistakes or failures as blackmail material.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>IT WAS GOD WHO SENT ME HERE NOT YOU...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 45:8 NLT</span><br>Real forgiveness lets them keep their self-respect! Joseph's brothers listen in amazement as he says, 'It was God who sent me here not you.' Is he serious? 'God did it?' This takes forgiveness to a new level! God's forgiveness is awesome! With full knowledge of our past mistakes and our present struggles, He covers us with grace. And He expects us to do the same for others. You can make a friend for life if you resist the temptation to rub their nose in their mistake.

If you allow God's forgiveness to work in your heart and you start to speak good stuff about the person who offended you, where there was bitterness and anger you'll start to see peace and love in your actions and words towards them.  God's forgiveness operating in our lives and relationships is like a good medicine; it will heal a broken heart completely.

We're able to forgive because: a) we remember the stuff we've been forgiven by God b) we believe that God has given us the ability to forgive c) we see God's hand at work in the bigger picture of our life and relationships d) when we come through it we're wiser, stronger and more like Jesus.

So in our story Joseph wasn't being condescending or patronizing; and he wasn't thinking, 'I'll be admired for being so forgiving.' No, during his years in prison God had operated on his heart and changed his attitude. So when he said, '...you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good...' (Genesis 50:20 NASB), Joseph meant it. That is real forgiveness!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>DON</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>T BE ANGRY WITH YOURSELVES FOR SELLING ME.' GENESI</span><br>Real forgiveness won't involve a guilt-trip! Imagine their guilt as Joseph's brothers stood before him! But Joseph said: 'Don't be...angry with yourselves...It was to save lives that God sent me ahead of you' (Genesis 45:5 NIV).  Why do we guilt-trip others? Because we forget so easily the grace God gave us when we didn't have a leg to stand on.

If we forgive it helps those who hurt you to forgive themselves for what they did.  Paul found it hard to forgive himself: '...I attacked the church...' (Galatians 1:13 NCV). After imprisoning and beheading Christians he now preaches to them. And who's in the audience? The widows! The orphans!

Apparently the ancient Persians punished murderers by strapping the victim to their back. It dragged them down, reminded them of what they'd done, the smell of it drove others away and eventually it would kill them. Nothing's heavier than guilt. It will: a) drag you down and make you miserable b) cause you to leave a bad smell wherever you go. Even your mates will get fed up and say, 'Get over it' c) it can mess up new friendships, 'cause you're always looking at your past mistakes, worried that you'll do it all again d) make you feel rubbish about yourself.  Cut it loose! Cry if you need to, but when the grieving is over, bury it and move on. That's what real forgiveness does for others!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...THEY WERE VERY AFRAID OF HIM. SO JOSEPH SAID TO THEM, &quot;COME CLOSE TO ME.&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 45:3-4 NCV</span><br>Real forgiveness won't involve intimidation! Why? Because the Bible says, 'There is no fear in love...' (1John 4:18 NIV). Even though he holds their lives in his hands, Joseph approaches his brothers in tears of compassion. Notice, he didn't do six things we usually do when someone hurts us: a) keep them at a distance b) remind them he was right and they were wrong c) enjoy watching them terrified in his presence d) gloat at their failure e) demand that they recognise his success f) say 'I told you so!' 

Joseph acted in a way that showed he wanted to be loved, not feared. He wanted restoration, not getting your own back. He understood that the long-term benefits of forgiveness far outweigh the short-term satisfaction of revenge. Bottom line: Joseph understood that by forgiving and letting go, he was setting himself free to be blessed!

And isn't this how God deals with us? Listen: 'For you did not receive a spirit that makes you...fear, but you received the Spirit of son-ship. And by him we cry, &quot;Abba, Father&quot;' (Romans 8:15 NIV). The word Abba simply means, 'Daddy.' That rocks! God doesn't bring up our past. He doesn't keep us at arms length because of our imperfections. No, He wants us to know that we can come to Him at any time, crawl up into His lap, feel secure in His everlasting arms and call Him 'Daddy'. And that's the kind of love and forgiveness God wants us to show to others - a love that doesn't want them to feel afraid in our presence!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...LEAVE! CLEAR OUT - EVERYONE LEAVE!</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 45:1 (TM)</span><br>Twenty-two years after betraying him and selling him into slavery, Joseph's brothers stand before him. And now he's The Man!  Prime Minister of Egypt! How's he going to handle this one? What would you have done? For the next few days let's look at the life of Joseph and find seven ways to know you're walking in real forgiveness.

Real forgiveness won't blab! Why did Joseph make everyone leave the room except his brothers? To make sure no one would ever know what they'd done! Joseph didn't tell - and God doesn't tell either. Listen: '...You'll sink our sins to the bottom of the ocean' (Micah 7:19 TM). God has enough dirt on each of us to bury us, but He won't tell. So why do we? To punish! Listen: '...Perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment...' (1John 4:18 NIV). What are we afraid of? That they'll get away with it. We want them punished, so we tell on them. And when we do, two things happen:

1) we step on God's turf! God says, '...I will punish those who do wrong, I will repay them...' (Romans 12:19 NCV). Only God knows what caused them to do it, whether they've truly repented, and how much they've changed 

2) we set the standard for our own judgment! Listen: 'You will be judged in the same way that you judge others...' (Matthew 7:2 NCV). Can you live with that? If not, then carefully read these words: 'Be kind and loving to each other, and forgive each other just as God forgave you in Christ' (Ephesians 4:32 NCV).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING AGAINST SOMEONE, FORGIVE...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Mark 11:25 TM</span><br>Before discussing what forgiveness is, here's what it's not:

1) approval! Jesus forgave the woman caught in adultery, but He didn't approve of what she'd done.  Listen: '...Go, and sin no more' (John 8:11 KJV)

2) excusing! Why do we say 'no problem - its fine', when it's not!

3) pardoning! This is a legal term meaning, 'to get off the hook.' It's not your business to deal with someone who has offended you, its God's business

4) denying! Only when we get out of denial land and let God go to work on our hearts, can we truly forgive

5) forgetting! Don't fool yourself.  You're not a goldfish with a three second memory. Like God, we make a choice not to remember the way we were hurt.

In a book called 'Total Forgiveness',  top Christian teacher RT Kendall writes: 'It's no spiritual victory to think we are forgiving, when we are only avoiding facing up to their wrong behaviour. We are saying 'I want to forgive them, but I don't think I could if they actually did what it seems they did.' So we postpone recognizing the true offence to keep from experiencing the pain. Total forgiveness is painful. It hurts when we kiss revenge goodbye. It hurts to think the person is getting away with what they did and that nobody else will ever find out. But when we know fully what they did, and accept in our hearts that they'll be blessed without any consequences [imposed by us], we cross over into the spiritual realm. We begin to be a little more like Jesus, to change into the image of Christ.'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>YOU MADE MY WHOLE BEING. YOU FORMED ME IN MY MOTHER</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>S BODY.' PSALM 139:13 NCV</span><br>Being a mum is one of the toughest jobs on the planet so we need to give respect to those who are in that role.  'BIG UP' ALL THE MAMMAS!!!

The name 'mum' may provoke a totally different set of feelings in one person to another.  Maybe your mum has been amazing, totally supportive and loving.  But not everyone's had that experience.  Some have mums who are poorly and need a lot of looking after, some never see theirs or maybe have a mum that's there some days and not others.  Whatever kind of family you're from, listen up...

We often hear people talk about God having a father's heart but He also has the love and compassion of a mother for her children too.  He has always been there, through your pain, happiness and tears.  He has never taken his eyes off you.  The Bible also describes the way    there is protection and care [under the wings of God] (Psalm 91:4 NIV)  Whether your experience of a mum was good or bad, God knows and wants to heal any hurt or disappointment and show you how much He rates you.

For many of us our mums have been a major influence on our lives.  They've taught us, told us off, read us stories and comforted us, but most of all loved us even when we messed up.  Can you see any similarities to God?

A mother's instinct is to protect, and the same goes for God.  Whatever your experience let Him love on you today.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>FLESH GIVES BIRTH TO FLESH, BUT...SPIRIT GIVES BIRTH TO SPIRIT.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 3:6 NIV</span><br>If you want to see God's promise fulfilled in your life, don't rush things - or you might run ahead of God and make a mistake.  God forgives our mistakes, but often there are consequences all 'cause you couldn't wait. Be sure that your plans are God inspired. Don't try to make a 'self' idea work. God gave His promise to Isaac, not Ishmael. Why? Because Isaac was the result of God's plan, done God's way, in God's time.

Jesus said, 'Flesh gives birth to flesh, but...Spirit gives birth to spirit.' Everything that's in you comes from one of two sources; the flesh (a.k.a me, myself and I) or the Spirit (a.k.a God) Today make a choice to choose the God source 'cause it will equal a God result. God doesn't need help to bless you; He can do it all by Himself. That's why, whenever Satan attacks, you need to remind him 'Who' you belong to and that you didn't begin this project, God did, so He'll make sure you finish it. What God begins, He finishes!

If God is dealing with the yuck in your life, let him.  Don't get in His way. Like rescuing a drowning man who's frantically trying to save himself, until you stop splashing around God can't get hold of you. Give it up! Try less and trust more! The Bible says, '...He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion...' (Philippians 1:6 NIV). So relax and stop flapping!

(P.S. its Mother's Day tomorrow - are you all set to give your mum a brilliant day to remember for years!)

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...I KEEP WORKING TOWARDS THAT DAY WHEN I WILL FINALLY BE ALL THAT CHRIST...WANTS ME TO BE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PHILIPPIANS 3:12 TLB</span><br>What you focus your heart on will determine how you spend your time and energy. It takes as much time to life a boring life, as a totally rewarding one. The human brain has 2-billion megabytes of capacity, which means you have loads of potential for learning and growth.  But potential is only what could be.  If you want your potential to become reality you need to start exercising your gifts.

In Proverbs 29:18 we read: 'Where there is no vision the people perish...' (KJV). Dissatisfaction doesn't come from having nothing to do but a lack of direction. Too many of us are living a half life 'cause we've settled for less than God intended.

Your life experience is determined by your vision - and the effort you're willing to put into fulfilling it. So take that list we discussed yesterday and add a list of the areas in which you'd like to grow, then focus on the three most important. And don't get discouraged if it doesn't happen over night. Remember, the really great things achieved in human history all took time.

Paul said, '...I keep working towards the day when I will finally be all that Christ...wants me to be' (Philippians 3:12 TLB). Notice, it's a process; you have to work at it! Some days it'll feel like two steps forward and three steps back, but don't give up. It's better to die for something than live for nothing. And unless you try something beyond what you already know, you won't grow. So, what're you waiting for? Life? It's waiting for you; get moving!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...GOD SAID...&quot;BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY...&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 1:28 NKJ</span><br>It's miserable trying to live a lifestyle that doesn't suit you. It's like walking in shoes that don't fit. So today, tomorrow and over the weekend, ask yourself: What am I good at? What do I enjoy doing most? What am I passionate about? Take a few minutes on your own and list five times in your life when you felt a) good about yourself b) happy while doing something c) excited talking to somebody. This list will tell you loads about your purpose?

If you weren't bothered about having a phat wad of cash when you're older what would you do with your life?  Is that what you should be working towards now?  What can you do to help yourself get to your goal?  Maybe choose a subject at school or take up a hobby that will equip you to do the job.  Look at the lives of those who've succeeded in this area. Who do you admire for the way they've applied their talents? How are you like them? What can you learn from them? It's a good idea to write down your vision and if you don't feel like you have a vision ask God to give you one, 'cause He wants you to get the most out of your life.  Jesus said 'I came to give life - life in all its fullness' (John 10:10 NCV).  Life is a journey and the ultimate destination is heaven.  The way to get there is through the gate 'I am the gate' (John 10:7 NIV). Once we get through the gate we follow the path which the Bible shines on, 'your Word is a...light to my path' (Psalm 119:105 NIV).  We can get the most out of life if we can keep on the right path, with the right companions, making the right choices along our way!

When you die what would you like to be remembered for?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>LET US NOT GIVE UP MEETING TOGETHER, AS SOME ARE IN THE HABIT OF DOING...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HEBREWS 10:25 NIV.</span><br>Why do we stay away from church when we're having a hard time? a) we're embarrassed because people will see that we're not super perfect and we're having a hard time b) we're ashamed because we're still struggling with certain problems c) we're fed up because it looks like everyone else is getting it right.

Don't let discouragement keep you away from hanging out with your spiritual family! You need their love and support, to hear them say, 'keep going, mate, God's on your side'. Listen: 'Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing' (Hebrews 10:25 NIV).  The moment you feel like hiding your head in the sand and avoiding everyone; do the opposite. 

Check this out: if satan can isolate you from other Christians at the time when you need them most, he can rob you of God's blessing! You can stay at home, read your Bible, listen to your favourite Christian band, but surrounded by your spiritual family you'll get answers, experience joy, and receive encouragement you can't find anywhere else. Church is the last place the devil wants you to go when you're feeling low. He knows if you go you'll be touched by the presence of the Lord and be able to crawl out of the hole he's scared you into.

The people you spend time with affect the person you are going to become, so when you're having a rough time don't go to people who drag you down, go to people who are gonna build you up and encourage you to 'not give up'!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>BLESSED IS THE MAN WHO TRUSTS IN THE LORD, WHOSE CONFIDENCE IS IN HIM.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JEREMIAH 17:7 NIV</span><br>To succeed at whatever God wants you to do, you have to learn to be confident; not self-confident, but confident in Christ. Listen to Paul: 'I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me' (Philippians 4:13 NKJ). Jesus said, '...without me, you can do nothing' (John 15:5 NKJ). It seems to take forever for us to get this. Most of our struggling and frustration comes from the wrong confidence. Paul says, '...we do not put trust in ourselves...' (Philippians 3:3 NCV). He's not saying we are not supposed to trust anyone. He's saying if we give others or ourselves the trust that should be given to God, we won't succeed. He won't let us!

OK.  Let's go through this one more time.  Today, you can face your challenges with confidence, but first and foremost it must be confidence in God. He totally wants you to succeed!  You might get it wrong, but if you trust God He'll take your mistakes and turn them to work for your good and His glory (Romans 8:28 NIV).

Sometimes our confidence is shaken when hard stuff happens, especially if it goes on for ages. When this happens we must learn to do what David did: '...David found strength in the Lord his God' (1 Samuel 30:6 NCV). When David had no one else to believe in him, he put his confidence in God. He also believed that God would work in him and through him. One lady writes: 'The Lord told me that if I didn't believe in myself, I really didn't believe in Him. He said, &quot;I am in you, but I can only do through you, what you believe Me for.&quot;'

<title><![CDATA[Six types of prayer 2)]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>LONG BEFORE DAYLIGHT, HE GOT UP AND...PRAYED...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MARK 1:35 AMP</span><br>Let's finish off this month by looking at the rest of those six different types of prayer:

4) the prayer of intercession. Listen to this: 'I looked for a man...who would...stand before me in the gap on behalf of the land' (Ezekiel 22:30 NIV). To intercede means: 'to stand in the gap' for someone else. If there's a hole in that person's relationship with God due to a particular sin, you have the privilege of placing yourself in that hole to pray for them. 'The gap' is the distance between what is - and what can be

5) the prayer of release. Listen: 'Give all your worries and cares to God, for he cares about what happens to you' (1Peter 5:7 NLT). As long as you keep trying to control everything your stress level will just keep climbing. But when you learn to hand things over to God, you'll wonder why you spent even a single day worrying

6) the prayer of availability. The apostle Paul encourages us, '...offer yourselves to God...' (Romans 6:13 NIV). That's like signing your name on a blank cheque. It's saying, 'Here I am, I want my life to please you.  I hope I like what You choose, but even if I don't I'll do it anyway; I'll live out your plans, not mine.' Everyday, all over the world, great things happen through the lives at people who have become available to God. Today let God do the work that needs to be done in you, so that He can do the work that He desires to do through you.

<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>PRAY...IN THE SPIRIT AT ALL TIMES WITH ALL KINDS OF PRAYERS...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 6:18 NCV</span><br>Let's look at six different types of prayer; three today and three tomorrow:

1) the prayer of agreement! Listen: 'If two of you...agree about anything you ask for, it will be done for you by my Father' (Matthew 18:19 NIV). When you're up against something too big to handle alone, find a prayer partner and agree in prayer with them. This doesn't mean being a pain in the neck 99% of the time then deciding to agree because you're desperate. A prayer of agreement is part of a lifestyle of harmony with the people around you

2) the prayer of faith! Be confident when you ask God to meet your needs. Jesus said, '...Whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.' (Mark 11:24 NIV). If we'd stop trying to pray impressive sounding prayers we'd be a lot better off. Length, loudness or fancy long words all miss the point; it's the trust in our heart, towards God, that gets through!

3) the prayer of thanks! When our requests outweigh our worship it says something about us. Self-centred people demand a lot but appreciate very little. God won't allow us to enjoy the fullness of all He's planned for us until we become thankful for what we've already got. Praying with thanks is like switching your prayer-connection to Broadband! Listen: '...Pray and ask God for everything you need, always giving thanks' (Philippians 4:6 NCV). Powerful living comes through thanksgiving. We can 'pray continually' (1Thessalonians 5:17) by thanking God all day long for His favour, mercy, kindness, grace, and goodness.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...THE SECRET IS CHRIST HIMSELF, WHO IS IN YOU.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>COLOSSIANS 1:27 NCV</span><br>As a Christian it's really important to remember that the Virgin birth isn't for Christmas, it's for everyday. All those carols you were singing just a few weeks ago should live in your mind all year round. The miraculous way God chose to bring Jesus into the world, by being born of Mary,  illustrates how close God wants to get to us! In a sense, God's asking you the same question He asked Mary, 'Are you willing to let me in?'

Notice, Jesus told the disciples, '...I am in you' (John 14:20 NCV). Paul prayed, 'That Christ may dwell in your hearts' (Ephesians. 3:17 NIV). John said, 'Those who obey...live in him, and he in them' (1John 3:24 NIV). Again Paul wrote, 'The secret is Christ himself, who is in you.' And also, '...It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me...' (Galatians 2:20 NKJV). Jesus promised, '...If any one...opens the door, I will come in...' (Revelation. 3:20 NIV). Are you getting the idea? All He looks for is an open heart.

In the Old Testament God was with Adam and Eve in the Garden. He was with Abraham and called him His friend. But none of them had the privilege you have, He's in you. That's where He wants to be. He wants to be seen through what you say, and how you live. 

And since He's living in you, you have full access to His awesome power! It's a massive force within. That's why Paul says '...I depend on Christ's mighty power that works within me' (Colossians 1:29 NLT). Have you been living off your own energy reserves lately? Have you started trying to make up your own answers to life's riddles? Don't do that, instead remember, 'The secret is Christ Himself, who is in you.'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...STAND YOUR GROUND...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 6:13 NIV</span><br>Not everybody in the world has got the physical strength of heavyweight wrestler The Rock, or the guts of Olympic boxing hero Amir Khan, or a big noisy gob like Pink. So what do you do when problems come your way that seem big or scary or just outrageous? You take the apostle Paul's advice, you put on God's armour and 'stand your ground.' In Romans 14:4 NIV Paul says '...he will stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand.'  He's talking there about the way God makes His awesome power, the power that raised Jesus from the dead, available to you in the situations you face in life. You might feel like you're right in the firing line at the moment but protected by God's armour and filled with His strength you will stand for as long as it takes and not give in. 

So today when trouble or temptations show up you just remember to say, gently but firmly, 'Because Jesus lives in me I will stand my ground.' You can stand, until the shaking stops, until you feel peace again, until the wave of loneliness is gone, until that relationship is restored, until that debt is paid, until the tempter quits trying to topple you and trap you. 

Check out the arrangement we have with God: We do the standing, He does the strengthening! Paul said, 'Christ gives me the strength to face anything.' (Philippians 4:13 CEV) God's strength is not a 'limited time offer' either. He'll strengthen you again and again and again. Every time you face a difficult challenge, every time a memory comes back to haunt you, every time you're reminded of your shady past, every time you face a tough decision. 

There are lots of ways to get from God the strength you need to stand up against the devil's twisted schemes. You can pray, you can praise, and you can get into His Word with an intensity you've never had before. The fact is, today, you can stand, if you really want to!

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WE HAVE ONE WHO SPEAKS TO THE FATHER IN OUR DEFENCE--JESUS CHRIST</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 JOHN 2:1 NIV</span><br>On those days when you wonder how God can even stand you, never mind love you, remember these words, '...we have one who speaks to the Father in our defence - Jesus Christ'. When your thought life deserves an 18 certificate and your actions aren't far behind, listen: 'Jesus... is permanent. He's there from now to eternity to save everyone who comes to God through him, always on the job to speak up for them' (Hebrews 7:24-25 TM).  It works like this; when you sin, either accidentally or deliberately, you deserve to be punished for it. The only thing you can do is call your Super-Lawyer (i.e. pray!). Jesus then takes up the case, 'Father, this one's come to me, pleading &quot;Guilty as charged&quot;. I'm gonna cover this one with the shadow of the cross, with my own blood. We don't need to take the matter any further.'

This thing about blood is a bit weird if you think about it. But it makes perfect sense when you know where it comes from - the promise God made to His chosen people back in the Old Testament. There was a sacred box called the 'Ark of the Covenant', made in the time of Moses. It contained the law, carved onto slabs of stone. The head priest would pour lamb's blood onto the lid of the box everyday. It symbolised God looking at the law through the life of the sacrifice. And it was a glimpse of what Jesus would ultimately do for us; He would sacrifice His life, allow  His own blood to pour out, so that when we break God's law He would see that the wrong things we've done have been covered by His Son's own life. 

If you're wondering why God continues to love you and accept you it's because you have a Super-Lawyer. He represents your case and He takes your punishment! That's why the Bible says, 'Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.' (Hebrews 4:16 NIV) You can come to God any and everyday and receive an amazing loving welcome because of Jesus. Isn't that cool!?!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>HOW DO YOU KNOW ME?...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 1:48 NIV</span><br>Early in the New Testament we meet Peter and Andrew. Noticeably, they aren't standing under a sign saying 'QUEUE HERE FOR EXTREME LIFE-CHANGE'. Jesus just turns up, interrupts their work and says, ''...follow me...and I will make you fishers of men.' At once they left their nets and followed him.' (Matthew 4:19 - 20 NIV) 

Their mates James and John had it coming too, 'They were in a boat with their father Zebedee... Jesus called them, and immediately they left the boat and their father...' (Matthew 4: 21 - 22 NIV) Jesus pulled the same stunt on them, but they had the added problem of having to make their decision right in front of their dad. Their personal loyalties were challenged by Jesus from Day One. 

Levi (Matthew) was having another good day, surrounded by his cash, raking it in with the help of the Romans. He was on a right cushy number!  'Jesus... saw a tax collector by the name of Levi sitting at his tax booth. '&quot;Follow me,&quot; Jesus said to him, and Levi got up, left everything and followed him.' (Luke 5:27 - 29 NIV)

Then we meet Phil - keen as mustard! But his brother Nathanael was different. 

'Philip found Nathanael and told him, &quot;We have found the one... Jesus of Nazareth,&quot;...

&quot;Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?&quot; Nathanael asked... When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said of him, &quot;Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is nothing false.&quot; &quot;How do you know me?&quot; Nathanael asked.  Jesus answered, &quot;I saw you while you were still under the fig-tree before Philip called you.&quot;'  (John 1: 43-50 NIV)

Here we see Jesus beginning to break his own recruitment policy. Until this point it seemed like Jesus preferred head-hunting his staff to picking them up from the Dole Office. Peter, Andrew, James, John, Levi, Philip - all busy guys with great enthusiasm. Jesus doesn't appear keen on calling people who are sitting around doing nothing, until Nathanael. Then we see Jesus calling a cynical, confrontational layabout. Nat is the example of God's ability to find potential in the most unlikely of places. No-one is too busy or too lazy for Jesus to call.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...ALL THOSE LINED UP IN CONVOY BEHIND GOD'S HOLY SPIRIT, THEY'RE GOD'S KIDS'</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 8:14 STREET</span><br>Did you see the invasion of Iraq on TV? Not all the cheesy speeches by the politicians? or the bombs dropping on the houses and all that messy stuff. Did you pay attention to the way the army was organised? Did you see the way that the trucks and the tanks travelled really fast from the border to Baghdad in great long lines? That's called a 'CONVOY'. The driver of the vehicle in front has to know the way because everyone else is following. He will communicate to all the other vehicles about how well the journey's going and when they are due to reach their destination. This is an amazing picture of what it means to be led by the Holy Spirit. It means being able to follow precise instructions, and shows us why staying on the right track is really important to Christians. There are many dangers in life when we take a detour from the Holy Spirit's convoy. Also, if we do drop out of formation, we'll miss out on all the action at the destination He's leading us to. 

If you want to live this way, God will give you the grace day by day to do it! Just pray: 'Lord, this week I want to learn to follow You, not just in some things but in every thing. Help me to understand where you're heading and what you're communicating. In Jesus name, Amen.' Once you've prayed that prayer, get in the convoy, follow the leader and head on into the action zone!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>GOD CREATED HUMAN BEINGS IN HIS IMAGE...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 1:27 NCV</span><br>Since we're created in the image of God, we've a built-in drive to create. That doesn't mean we all go around like space cadets in baggy dungarees covered in paint splodges. An artistic or creative temperament can be expressed in loads of ways. Consider the famous golfer Tiger Woods: his level of concentration, the stylish way he swings the club and hits the little white ball and sends it sailing over traps and hazards on to the green and into the hole. He really takes pleasure in doing it because every time he hits that ball he's creating a new moment in his life that has never existed before. No two shots are ever the same. He's also discovered a way to get paid for what he loves. That's quite unusual, but check this out - when you find that thing you'd do for free, you've probably found your destiny.

Creating is a process of giving birth. It may seem obvious that songwriters and artists, poets and actors, are birthing their dreams, but so is any one of us who discovers our creative destiny; the calling God gives through a mix of unique gifts. You may be starting a new club at school, writing a computer program, inventing a new trick on your skateboard, or designing new fashions for you and your mates. All these things flow out of who you are because God is the most creative force in the universe and you are made, 'in His image'. 

Let today be a day when you CREATE. When you go to bed tonight will you be able to think to yourself, 'In this universe tonight something totally unique exists that didn't exist yesterday, because I created it!'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE LORD IS CLOSE TO THE BROKENHEARTED...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 34:18 NIV</span><br>When you've lost someone you love there's no quick fix. The only way out, is through. One woman said after her husband has passed away, 'I'd no idea grieving involved so many 'firsts,' my first night alone, the first time I attended church alone, my first anniversary alone. And when I didn't think things could get worse, I find myself facing the holidays alone; I'd give anything to boycott them.' The Bible says, 'The Lord is close to the broken-hearted.' He uses the support of loving friends and family, plus the passage of time, to help us heal. And here are some other options you've got:

1) thinking ahead. When you miss somebody, there's no 'right' or 'wrong' way to handle special times like birthdays and Christmas but you can be prepared for them. Some people decide to do something totally different instead of trying to keep up the old traditions. Do what feels best to you

2) letting your church family help. Going it alone usually means going nowhere, so reach out to your Christian friends. Ask them to pray with and for you. Remember, others won't know what you need unless you tell them

3) tapping into God's strength. Grief is so draining, so ask God to protect you from being consumed by it, to strengthen you when you're feeling down. The Bible says, 'He gives strength to the weary...those who hope in the Lord...renew their strength' (Isaiah 40:29, 31 NIV)

4) don't expect too much too soon. Have reasonable expectations about what you can handle. Treat yourself like you'd treat your best friend - by being kind to yourself.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>JESUS CRIED.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 11:35 NCV</span><br>Emptiness, disbelief, exhaustion, confusion, depression and anger are all part of the grieving process. C M Parkes says, 'Grief is the price we pay for love.' The only people who escape grief are those who've never really loved.

In John, Chapter 11, when Jesus arrived on the scene, Lazarus was dead and Martha was upset because she felt he should've got there sooner. She wanted to know, 'Why, Lord?' It's the question we all ask. And what was His response? The Bible says that sitting down among the mourners, 'Jesus cried.' And when He did, He made it okay for us to cry too!

How do we mourn? Melody Beattie, who writes books with great titles like 'Stop being mean to yourself!' describes grieving like this, 'We do it awkwardly, imperfectly, with resistance, anger and attempts to negotiate. We flounder through kicking and screaming until we reach that peaceful state called acceptance.' Tears don't represent a lack of faith, they just mean we're human. The One who gave you love is always with you, He understands sorrow and loss - that's why He gave you tears!

Jesus said, 'I am the resurrection and the life...' (John 11:25 NIV), so when He spoke that day Lazarus had to respond to the 'Lord of...the dead and the living' (Romans 14:9 NIV). In fact, if Jesus hadn't called Lazarus by name, it's likely that every corpse in the cemetery would have arisen when He spoke! The Bible's full of this sort of good news: 'He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain...' (Revelation 21:4 NIV). That's talking about when Jesus comes again. Until then, though we're not like 'others who have no hope' (1Thessalonians 4:13 NKJV). That's because we know how the story ends!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...MARY HAS CHOSEN WHAT IS BETTER...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 10:42 NIV</span><br>If you read this story you'll see that Martha's worried about something good - having Jesus over for dinner. Her aim is to please Him, to make him feel comfortable by putting a nice hot meal in his belly. So far, so good. But she makes a common mistake, one a lot of us make - her work becomes more important than her Lord. She totally forgets that the meal is supposed to honour Jesus, Doh! Sound familiar?

Listen to her: 'Lord, don't you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself? Tell her to help me!' And what did Jesus say to her? 'Martha, Martha...you are worried and upset about many things, but only one thing is needed. Mary has chosen what is better' (Luke 10:40-42 NIV). And what had Mary chosen? Intimacy before activity. We shouldn't give Martha too much of a hard time though because it's actually a really difficult balance to get right.

This story could also apply to anyone who loves Jesus, whatever kind of work they're involved in. It's amazing how many people reach the point of burnout because they've neglected their relationship with God. Oh, they never intended to; it's just that they've learned to get by on their own and haven't been forced to rely on Him. Or they've maybe filed God in their diary under 'Sunday', as if He's just another appointment. Understand this: until you establish an intimate relationship with Jesus as the foundation of your life, you'll struggle with finding your true purpose, enjoying the results of your work, and experiencing '...God's peace which is so great we cannot understand it...' (Philippians 4:7 NCV).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...WE ARE LIKE CLAY, AND YOU ARE THE POTTER...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ISAIAH 64: 8 NCV</span><br>God loves you just the way you are, but He loves you too much to leave you that way! His goal for you is to grow, change and begin to reflect the life of Jesus more and more. That means you aren't stuck with all the current creases and wrinkles in your personality. You don't have to spend the rest of your life with your hiccups and hang-ups. You're changeable! You've got real possibilities! Even if you've worried every day of your life, you don't have to worry for the rest of your life. So what if you were brought up in a narrow-minded community full of prejudice? You don't have to die there! You think you're really shy and you'll never be able to lead anybody to Jesus - God used shy people in the Bible to turn the destiny of whole nations!!!

Where did we get the idea we can't change? What's the source of comments like, 'I'm so disorganised,' or 'I just can't help shooting my mouth off.' Would we make those statements about our body? 'It's just my nature to have a broken leg; I can't do anything about it.' Of course not! If our body malfunctions we find help. Shouldn't we do the same with our soul the home of our sour attitudes and our selfish ness? Isaiah writes: 'We are like clay, and you are the potter.' God does not consult your past to determine your future. Like the potter, He can take you, shape you and make you into something beautiful and useful all at the same time. In 'Just Like Jesus', Max Lucado writes: 'God can no more leave your life unchanged than a mother can leave her child's tear untouched.' Do you get it now?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>BUILD YOURSELVES UP.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JUDE 1:20 NCV</span><br>There are two kinds of people who won't understand your need to take care of yourself: religious nutters who never stop trying to measure up to all sorts of severe rules and regulations, and serve-a-holics who sacrifice themselves and their families on the altar of endless church activity thinking that's the only way to please God. Clearly some of Jesus' disciples felt that way. When the woman poured the expensive oil on Jesus they were well narked. How come? Had they never read, 'He makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters, he restores my soul...you anoint my head with oil...' (Psalm 23:2,3&amp;5 NIV). In Bible times oil was used to soothe, massage and refresh, especially after a hard day or a long journey in the hot sun. 'So God thinks it's okay to take a break?' Absolutely! But serve-a-holics who need to be needed keep thinking: 'This oil might have been sold and given to the poor.' Their belief system is, 'Others matter - I don't!'

Get this: when you take care of other people but not yourself, you: a) become spiritually and emotionally drained b) get fed up because your needs go unrecognised and unmet c) end up looking for what you need in all the wrong places. That's what drove tough guy Samson to Delilah's house. She gave him a place to relax and let down his hair and then in no time at all, totally wrecked his life. Be really, really careful that when you're feeling weak and vulnerable you don't accept the dodgy stuff the world offers to make you 'feel better'. Today, make sure you take care of yourself spiritually, physically and emotionally!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...BUILD YOURSELVES UP...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JUDE 1:20 NCV</span><br>Matthew writes about the incident in Jesus' life when he was sitting down having a meal and a woman came and poured a really expensive conditioner on his hair. The disciples went ballistic, '&quot;Why waste that perfume? It could have been sold for a great deal of money&quot;...Jesus said, &quot;Why are you troubling this woman? She did an excellent thing for me&quot;' (Matthew 26:8-10 NCV). Learn from Jesus! Sometimes even though it might make you feel a bit self-conscious, let people pour blessing on you! This isn't self-indulgence it's just what we need from time to time to restore our depleted energy. You'll never reach the finish line if you don't. 

Generally people treat you like you treat yourself. So start treating yourself better! It's totally bizarre that those who are great at helping other people can be pants at helping themselves. It's as if they don't know how.

How can you fulfil the great command to 'love your neighbour as yourself,' (in the Bible nine times!) if you haven't a clue how to love and take care of yourself? Have you become secretly fed up with all the responsibilities and needs dumped on you? Don't be. Just adjust the balance a bit, so that your own needs don't get forgotten at the bottom of a pile of other people's stuff. Don't be scared to show God the list of things you need today; inspiration, cash love, sleep - a holiday! Ask God because the Word 4 U 2day is - 'Allow the perfume you pour on others, to be poured on you!'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>GIVE THANKS TO THE GOD OF HEAVEN. HIS LOVE ENDURES FOR EVER</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 136:26 NIV</span><br>The year is 279AD, you're in Rome and you've just met the love of your life. The sun is shining, the birds are tweeting and you're skipping along until you stop, dead in your tracks. You've just remembered, marriage has been banned - all the single men are being packed off to the army, now what? 

There was one priest called Valentine. He loved God and he knew that marriage was from God, He'd been secretly marrying couples anyway. On February 14th he was caught and executed - leaving a love note for the jailer's daughter before he died.  Since then lovers have been exchanging notes, cards and gifts on this day and so it's become known as Valentine's day. So how about you? Did the postman pull a muscle trying to squeeze your vast mountain of cards through the letterbox, or was it as expected, no secret admirers and the one person you thought may at least spend 50p on a card forgot or thought you 'weren't bothered about that sort of thing?!'   

Before you get too depressed, or excited, remember one thing - God loves you and reckons you are amazing. 'Huh, little consolation' you're thinking? Well Jesus did more than send you a poxy WH Smith card with a cheesy rhyme. How's this for a Valentine's message? 'I love you so much that I will give my life so that if you believe in me you won't die but live forever' Now that's true love! God loves you so much that he actually let his Son Jesus give up His life for you. And now, you can be free to spend all eternity with him!

Try to spend some time today thinking about Jesus' passion for you, the ultimate act of love. Remember that there is no greater love than that - you can't possibly be anymore loved, by anyone. God IS love, true love comes from him and through him and by him. On this day when love is celebrated, remember to tell him just how much you love him too.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>EXAMINE YOURSELVES...TEST YOURSELVES...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 13:5 NIV</span><br>Too many of us live random lives - and it shows! One Christian leader says, 'I was reading authors who were saying that if Christ's followers don't grow, it's because they don't make a habit of evaluating their lives. Those authors were describing me. I was always on the go, never looking deeply inside. I never did the kind of reflection that leads to growth and I was paying the price - committing the same stupid sins over and over, living with the same heavy load of guilt. So I made a difficult decision: I decided that each day I would try to honestly assess my soul's condition. I would look inside myself and write down what I saw. Feeling awkward and embarrassed, I started to write. 'God, here are some areas of failure in my life. They aren't going away so I might as well take a look at them.' Or, 'Here's a relationship or habit I'm concerned about. It's not good and I don't know how to improve it.' After writing a paragraph or two I would reflect on what I had written.'

This guy basically started keeping a 'soul-journal'. Maybe you should do that too:

1) it would make you slow down and examine the effectiveness of what you're doing 

2) it would free you to ask: 'Why am I doing this? How do I really feel about it? What's God saying to me?' 

3) by writing even a page a day, in one year you'll have a phat 365-day record of prayers answered, lessons learned and vision for the future!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>LET THE PEACE THAT CHRIST GIVES CONTROL YOUR THINKING...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>COLOSSIANS 3:15 NCV</span><br>The first thing you lose when you step outside God's plan for you is your peace. Often peace is all God will give you to let you know whether you're inside or outside of His plan. So if you don't have peace today, listen up: 'Don't worry about anything; instead pray about everything; tell God your needs and don't forget to thank him for His answers. If you do you will experience God's peace, which is far more wonderful than the human mind can understand. His peace will keep your thoughts and your hearts quiet and at rest...' (Philippians 4:6-7 TLB). 

Notice the words, 'Don't worry...instead pray.' Prayer is where an amazing exchange happens, you hand over your worries and he hands over His peace. Peter writes: 'Give all your worries to Him, because He cares about you.'(1Peter 5:7-9 NLT) Peter also goes on to say, 'The devil, your enemy, goes around like a roaring lion looking for someone to eat. Refuse to give in to him, by standing strong in your faith.' (1 Peter 5:8-9 NCV)

Unless you resist the devil he'll start chewing away at your peace bit by bit.  Whenever you're tempted to worry, stop and ask yourself, 'If I give in to these negative emotions what will the result be?' Doesn't the Bible say that you '...have the mind of Christ.'? (1 Corinthians 2:16 NIV) Well then, that means you're smarter than your enemy! Each time he starts sniffing around with his bad breath just stand on God's Word!

Have a peaceful day today!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WHEN YOU LIE TO OTHERS, YOU END UP LYING TO YOURSELF.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 4:25 TM</span><br>Go all the way back in history, right back to Genesis, and you'll see that telling the truth has never been something humans have been good at! Paul says, 'When you lie to others you end up lying to yourself.' Telling the truth sounds simple but it takes commitment on three levels:

1) every word: Words make or break trust in a relationship. For example, when somebody denies taking someone else's stuff without asking, and hides it away, inevitably there's trouble. But when each person wants to '...know the whole truth and tell it in love...' (Ephesians 4:15 TM), the relationship becomes stronger.

2) every action. The Bible says, 'Unless you are faithful in small matters, you won't be faithful in large ones. If you cheat even a little, you won't be honest with greater responsibilities' (Luke 16:10 NLT). You become known as a person of integrity by doing what you've promised. If you make a commitment to do something, get on with it - even if it costs you or it's inconvenient. 

3) every situation. Why make such a big deal about telling the truth all the time? Isn't nine times out of ten good enough? When you are selective with the truth you: a) end up losing your respect from your mates; b) live with the fear of being found out, which makes you insecure; c) have to worry about what you said, to who; d) start getting paranoid because you think everyone else is making stuff up as well!

So today, and everyday, tell the truth!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>MIRIAM BEGAN TO TALK AGAINST MOSES... AND THE LORD HEARD THIS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>NUMBERS 12:1-2 NIV</span><br>Who wants to spend time with somebody who takes over every conversation with an update of their Top-Ten-People-To-Hate-List. Even staying in on a Friday night to do your maths homework would be more fun than hanging around with somebody like that! So watch out for yourself too, what you say and how you act, people will start to distance you if you become known as a fault-finder!

But sometimes criticism can just be clumsiness. On a good day, filled with the Holy Spirit and focused on what's right we'd never say those daft things. Notice how Aaron said, '...We have acted foolishly...' (Numbers 12:11 NASB). He didn't try to defend his position by saying, 'Yes, Moses did marry the wrong person' or 'No really, me and Miriam should have more public profile.'  No, he realised his position then turned around and walked away from it. You have to do that too! Why? Because criticism blocks the flow of God's blessing! Our mate Ozzy Chambers wrote, 'Whenever you're in a critical temper, it's impossible to enter into communion with God.' That's a scary thought! The cheeky buzz you get from dissing somebody isn't worth losing God's presence, is it? To get back into the flow with God you need to get real about your critical attitude, and trade it in for a more positive one. 

Why don't you pray: 'Lord, forgive me for thinking that I'm always right. I can see that I've been arrogant. Give me grace in dealing with other people. Help me to get on with different people and not demand that the whole world see things exactly as I do. Give me victory over my neggy attitude today. In Jesus' name - Amen.'

That's what criticism does: it makes us feel superior when we're blatantly not. It's hot being in the spotlight and so we turn it onto other people to make them sweat instead. In a sick sort of way it can feel good to put the pressure on others. Let's face it, people find it much harder to see what's going on in your life while you're shining the glaring light of criticism on theirs. 

Let's take another look at poor old Mo': his brother and sister suddenly turn on him. When we're known well by people close to us we're constantly vulnerable to their criticism. Parents often leave their kids' lives in a right state by creating an atmosphere filled with criticism. Maybe you've been reading these sessions on criticism thinking about somebody in your family - hardly able to focus because you constantly see their face and their words always ring in your ears. 'You're hopeless, useless!' How should you respond to criticism? Paul says, 'Do you think I am trying to make people accept me?...' (Galatians 1:10 NCV). He'd learned how to do something very, very clever... it was as if he had a filter on his ears so that he could just turn down the volume on his critics! 

Today, centre your attention on what God thinks of you and your life. Zone out all that other noise and listen to his words. Why? Because God's opinion of you is the only one that really matters!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>MIRIAM BEGAN TO TALK AGAINST MOSES...AND THE LORD HEARD THIS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>NUMBERS 12:1-2 NIV</span><br>While a critical attitude won't completely destroy your relationship with God, it will certainly damage your ability to enjoy His love and presence. In the story we've been looking at Miriam and Aaron started out criticizing their brother Moses, and ended up feeling the consequences most in their relationship with God. Why's that? It's because God always pays attention to the way we treat each other!

You might wonder, 'Why does God make such a big deal of this?' Because when you choose to sin you choose to suffer! Everything God classifies as sin is injurious to you - everything. When God says 'Don't', what He really means is 'Don't hurt yourself.' When He says, 'Don't criticise,' He's not just acting like a boring school teacher. No, He's saying, 'Having a critical attitude goes against who I've made you to be. Fish were made to swim, birds were made to fly, and you were made to enjoy friendship with Me. A critical spirit spoils that fellowship, I don't like hanging around neggy people.' 

Even people who don't claim to be particularly religious are observing the negative effects of criticism upon each of us. Top stress boffin Doctor David Fink, has studied thousands of mentally and emotionally disturbed people. He noticed two groups: the stressed-out group and the stress-free group. Gradually one fact began to emerge: the stressed-out group were habitual fault-finders, constant critics of people and things around them, while the stress-free group were loving and accepting of others. No doubt about it, the habit of criticising is a self-destructive way to live.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>MIRIAM BEGAN TO TALK AGAINST MOSES...AND THE LORD HEARD THIS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>NUMBERS 12:1-2 NIV</span><br>When Miriam criticized Moses, God got really heavy to teach her a lesson. Notice three things:

1) we should all watch out! Miriam was very godly; she had saved Moses' life as a child, she also wrote the worship song celebrating Israel's escape from Egypt. We never become so spiritually advanced that we're incapable of a critical attitude

2) sometimes what we focus on isn't the real issue! Listen: 'Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the (African) woman whom he had married.' But was that the real issue? No, listen: 'And they said, &quot;Has the Lord indeed spoken only through Moses? Has he not spoken through us as well?''' Moses' wife was the surface issue but the real issue was Moses' public profile. Their point was, 'How come he gets all the attention?' Look out! When you have competitiveness or resentment in your heart, there'll be criticism on your lips

3) doing God's will makes you an easy target! As a leader with the responsibility of making big decisions that affected peoples lives old Mo' was a sitting duck. He got it in the neck from all directions even though he was only acting on God's instructions. 

It was only when Aaron pleaded, '...forgive us for our foolish sin' (Numbers 12:11 NCV), that God showed His mercy and healed Miriam. Often we'd rather call criticism a 'weakness' we have, but from God's perspective it's a sin - a genuine, bona fide, registered sin! And there's only one way to deal with sin - say sorry and stop doing it.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>MIRIAM BEGAN TO TALK AGAINST MOSES...AND THE LORD HEARD THIS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>NUMBERS 12:1-2 NIV</span><br>We're gonna start a little mini-series today, based on something that happened to Moses and his gang waaaay back in the dusty Old Testament, in Chapter 12 of the book which is called 'Numbers'. Why don't you just get your bible out and have a quick read of it before we go into this in more detail. 

In the story God got a bit heavy on Moses' sister Miriam. Why? Because she criticized her brother Moses. You think your critical attitude is no big deal? It is to God. Maybe you've grown up in a family where everyone's getting at each other all the time. You can't enjoy the good things in life because all you've known to do is nit-pic, nag and jump to conclusions (usually negative ones). You need to know that Jesus has shown us a much better way of life. 

Here's a quick definition of a critical attitude: focusing on somebody's faults but ignoring their good points. If you look closely enough at anybody (except Jesus!) you'll find faults. But, are they really faults anyway - or do you just misunderstand them?

Do you walk through life saying, 'That's not fair!' Or, 'I wouldn't do it that way!'?  You're never going to be happy looking at the world like that. Jesus used a really funny image when he was talking to people who were always being critical, '...first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly...' (Luke 6:42 NIV) Do you get it - who are you to pick faults, Mr or Miss Perfect? 

So what's the right way to act then? Simple, if you notice an issue, and you think maybe you can help, first pray about it and then sensitively raise it with the person involved. Open your conversation by saying, 'Can we talk about this, I think I might be able to help.'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...I WILL NOT LEAVE YOU UNTIL I HAVE DONE WHAT I HAVE PROMISED.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 28:15 NIV</span><br>In an old episode of Dawsons Creek, Jack is having a deep chat with Joey, 'All the really exciting things in life require more courage than we currently have. A deep breath and a leap. See Joey, the kind of fear you're talking about...sometimes it's how you know what's worthwhile.' You might not be a Dawson's Creek fan, but don't miss the point that Jack's making, don't let fear limit your life. 

God knows what is waiting for you on the other side of your fear so He keeps encouraging you to go for it saying, 'I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised.' 

If you know Abram's story then you'll know God never left - He just kept expanding the promise! God told Abram, 'Do not be afraid...I am your Shield, your very great reward.' 

(Genesis 15:1 NIV). Now, if Abram had backed down because he feared the unknown and the untried, he'd have missed a 'very great reward'. God told Joshua, 'Be strong and brave! You must lead these people...be sure to obey all the teachings... If you follow them exactly, you will be successful.' (Joshua 1:6-8 NCV)  Are you picking up the vibe here? Do what God says, even when it's scary!

The Devil will use all sorts of tricks to scare you off your blessing. Don't let him! Jesus said, '...he is a liar and the father of lies.' (John 8:44NIV). You belong to the truth, the truth has found you, the truth is in you, and the truth has set you free. God is calling you deeper today so just take a deep breath and leap into his arms.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WHOEVER CAN BE TRUSTED WITH A LITTLE CAN...BE TRUSTED WITH A LOT.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 16:10 NCV</span><br>When artistic master Michelangelo was painting his famous mural on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Italy, he spent hours lying on a wooden platform high up in the dome perfecting all the fine details. He took his time over every brushstroke, every colour had to be just the right tone. A friend, who was curious about why Mike bothered with details that couldn't be seen from a distance, asked, 'But who'll know whether or not it's perfect?' Michelangelo replied, 'I will!'

Jesus said: 'Whoever can be trusted with a little can...be trusted with a lot.' Before God will trust you with a big job He'll test you with a small one. The only way to know if you're ready for more, is to look at how you're handling what you've already got. Don't be surprised when God keeps bringing you back to certain things until you get them right. Remember Jesus' 12 disciples? Their ego's kept getting in the way and JC had to keep reminding them that positions and promotions are nothing, they needed to learn to serve.

As you walk through your life with God He'll grow your faith by testing you in areas that only require a little bit of faith. If you do well, He'll bring you a challenge that requires a bit more faith, then a bit more, then a bit more. Each time you're willing to trust Him at a higher level He'll show you a bit more of Himself and you'll feel well blessed - that's how it works! Every small step of faith leads to a deeper, richer and more amazing relationship with Him. 

So, will you take a little step of faith today?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>GOD...WILL NOT FORGET YOUR WORK AND THE LOVE YOU HAVE SHOWN...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HEBREWS 6:10 NIV</span><br>Read this quote and see what you think, 'Glamour isn't greatness, applause isn't fame. A stone may sparkle but that doesn't make it a diamond. People may have money but that doesn't make them a success. It's the seemingly unimportant people who determine the course of history. The greatest forces in the universe are never spectacular. Summer showers do more good than hurricanes but they don't get a lot of publicity. The world would soon die but for the loyalty, creativity and commitment of those whose names are unhonoured and unsung.' Who would you expect to write something like that? Somebody famous right? Nope. It was actually a very un-famous bloke called James Sizoo.

You may think you don't really count in God's kingdom because you don't have 'special' gifts like preaching on stage or leading worship. Wrong! Listen: 'God...will not forget your work and the love you have shown him as you have helped his people' (Hebrews 6:10 NIV). The Bible says, 'People look at the outside of a person, but the Lord looks at the heart' (1Samuel 16:7 NCV). God sees you working behind the scenes, caring for your little brother when he's poorly, helping your Gran coz she's not so quick on her feet these days. God sees you encouraging people and getting involved where you can.

Cheesy cowboy Will Rogers said, 'We can't all be heroes, somebody has to sit on the curb and clap as they go by.' So remember, not everyone will do big things, but everyone can do small things with a big heart. And one more thing: '...tough it out through the tired times and keep on doing the right thing - if we keep going we'll see results.' (Galatians 6:9 STREET).

<title><![CDATA[R U spiritually bored?]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WHEN YOU LISTEN AND DO NOTHING, YOU ARE FOOLING YOURSELVES</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JAMES 1:22 NCV</span><br>It's OK, nobody's looking over your shoulder, you can admit it, sometimes you get bored with church, and even with your spiritual life? Today, consider this: listening but not doing becomes boring - every time! You'll quickly reach the place where you have heard so much that you'll think 'Oh no, here we go, not another preach!' The problem isn't the preaching - it's that you have become spiritually stuffed, a bit like the 'Chubby Bunnies' game where you have to fill your mouth with marshmallows. You only get bored when you're not getting out there and doing the stuff that you've heard preached about. Get this: SHOCK HORROR - even The Word 4U 2day is gonna get boring if you just skim it in five minutes; then forget about it! If you'll start doing what you've already been told you won't have time to be bored. 

Right now, find a pen and some paper, spend a minute in prayer and then try to remember the last three things that you felt God wanted you to do - but you haven't done yet. Write them down, and then put a note at the side of them for when you are going to do each one by. Now stick that little list somewhere obvious as a reminder. When will you be able to cross those items off, tonight, tomorrow, next week? One thing's for sure, you'll be buzzing when you start ticking them off - not bored.

One of our points yesterday was how David recalled the way God worked in his life in the past. If you're still bored think back to a time you weren't. What was different back then? Has anything changed? Ask God to bring that passion back to you. 'Bored' and 'Christian' are two words that just don't belong together!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...I COME TO YOU IN THE NAME OF THE LORD ALL-POWERFUL...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 SAMUEL 17:45 NCV</span><br>Everybody loves the story of David and Goliath - maybe because it contains so many lessons:

1) face up to what's threatening you! 40 days of listening to Goliath dissin' God and the King and his country weakened Israel's army but made David determined to open a can of WHUPASS on the great bag of wind! 

2) remember what you've learned! David recalled the time God helped him batter a lion and a bear - way before guns were invented! You have to remember the lessons you've learned. Listen: 'I have hope when I think of this: The Lord's love never ends; his mercies never stop. They are new every morning' (Lamentations 3:21-23 NCV). If you ever start getting freaked out just hit your replay button!

3) use the enemy's weapon against him! Listen: 'David...took Goliath's sword out of it's holder and killed him by cutting off his head. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they turned and ran' (1 Samuel 17:51 NCV). When you're struggling with stuff that's getting you down you must be willing to fight with intensity. When you're dealing with bad habits and temptations never assume they're dead at the first attempt, they might just be dazed. Cut the head right off that wrong stuff before it comes back another day. Go for a permanent solution, not a short-term fix. Go bonkers in prayer, refresh your head with the Bible, grab some support from God's family - your church. Above all, remember, your strength is not in yourself but in God. With Him on your side, you can't lose.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...I’m the runt of the litter. God said to him, ‘I’ll be with you...’</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Judges 6:15-16 TM</span><br>For every battle, God has a plan, so stop praying about the problem and start praying for the plan.  The idea will always be greater than the one who is called to put it into action (ie YOU!). But God loves to have big ideas for your life. King David said: &quot;…If GOD doesn't build the house, the builders only build shacks...&quot; (Psalm 127:1 TM). God’s ideas or blueprints will build your life into a mansion not the tatty shack you’d come up with without Him. Also remember, Jesus is a carpenter; He knows how much you can carry, the materials required and how it will all fit together in your life.  Could it be that He has already been speaking in your head for months?  Has He been revealing His plan to you, but you have been afraid to act on it? Stop asking everyone else what they think and get alone with Him. Shut the door and wait in His presence until you receive a ‘clear word’.

Remember, if God is giving you blueprints, then you are about to go under construction. That means getting ‘battered’ and ‘nailed’. But do not be discouraged, the God who landscaped the earth has already designed every detail of your future. Just step out and follow Him. You are built for it; you are designed to handle the pressure.

The One who said to Gideon: &quot;I’ll be with you&quot; is saying the same thing to you today.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>If you prize wisdom, she will exalt you. Embrace her and she will honour you.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 4:8 NLT</span><br>Be teachable. Don't think that as you learn more that means you'll have less to learn. Top sports coach John Wooden said: &quot;What counts, is what you learn after you know it all.&quot; 

Never stay satisfied with your achievements so far. The greatest enemy of tomorrow's success is today's success. Thinking you've 'arrived' because you achieved certain things is fatal! It takes away your desire for continued growth. Your wins, like your losses, are temporary. Understanding that is an important step to getting wisdom - wisdom that will keep you in top form, wisdom that will keep you hungry. Growth means refusing to settle in the comfort zone or let success go to your head. Enjoy it briefly, then move on to greater things.

Be a learner. Check this out - A university study done a few years ago found that almost one-third of all doctors were so busy working, they were two years behind in the latest developments in their field. Heaven help their patients! If you want to be a learner, you must create time to learn! Mr Motorcar, Henry Ford said: &quot;It's been my observation that successful people get ahead during the time other people waste.&quot; So in those in between minutes, get busy with your Bible. Seize every opportunity to keep growing. The secret to growth - is to learn something new every day! Listen: &quot;Get understanding. Esteem her and she will exalt you...&quot; (Proverbs 4:7-8 NIV)

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Let the wise guys listen and learn some more...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 1:5 STREET</span><br>>From zero to 18 years you grow upwards...but that's not the type of growth we're gonna be talking about the next few days. We're talking about spiritual growth.

1) Growth isn't automatic. You're only young once, but you can be immature indefinitely. Come on, if you don't make spiritual growth your responsibility it'll never happen. The road to anything worthwhile is always uphill, so the sooner you start climbing the closer to reaching your destiny you'll get.

2) Growth is linked to new ideas. The ideas you've held on to so far may not take you all the way. Well over a 100 years ago, Oliver Wendell Holmes said: &quot;Man's mind, once stretched by a new idea, never regains its original dimensions.&quot; What new ideas are you being challenged by at the moment?

3) Growth equals change...and most of us are uncomfortable with change! Best selling author Gail Sheehy writes: &quot;If we don't change we won't grow, and if we don't grow we're not really living. Growth demands the temporary surrender of security. It means a giving up of familiar but limiting patterns, safe but unrewarding work, values no longer believed in, relationships that have lost their meaning. Taking a new step is what we fear most, yet our real fear should be the opposite.&quot; 

Can you think of anything worse than living a life without growth?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Be angry...but...don't stay angry.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ephesians 4:26 TM</span><br>Anger can ambush any one of us at any time, so knowing how to deal with it is really important. The Bible says: &quot;...anger is the friend of fools&quot; (Ecclesiastes 7:9 NTL). Anger never did anyone any good - it will rot your personality and drag you out of the will of God. That's why Paul wrote: &quot;Be angry...but...don't stay angry.&quot; Anger-management boffin, Dr Mara Julius, says: &quot;If you get angry and deal with it quickly, the damage is minimal.&quot;  So here's how to handle your anger:

1) Take a walk. Exercise burns off excess adrenaline better than stewing. It also helps you think more clearly and handle things in a way you won't regret later. Listen: 'A quick-tempered man does foolish things...' (Proverbs 14:17). 

2) Accept your limits. Recognise the things you can't control, like other people's actions and attitudes, or annoying stuff like getting locked out or getting rained on. 

3) Think before you let off steam. It's one thing to be angry; it's another to sound off at the wrong time. Remember, 'A fool gives full vent to his anger, but a wise man keeps himself under control' (Proverbs 29:11). Only share your feelings with those you trust, and who are not targets of your anger. Otherwise it might come back to bite you. 

4) Don't hang out with angry people. Like happiness and vision, anger's also contagious. So whenever God says: &quot;Don't hang out with angry people...&quot; (Proverbs 22:24 TM), it's good advice - take it!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...I opposed him to his face, because he was clearly in the wrong.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Galatians 2:11</span><br>In the film The Truman Show, actor Jim Carey suddenly comes to realise that everything in his life is fake. All the people he thought were his friends were actually actors. Even his wife was an actor and the whole world was watching him on a TV show! Now that's a bit of an extreme example but it should help you see that genuineness - keeping it real and not putting on an act, has a big effect on your family and your friends. Putting on an act is called hypocrisy and it destroys your testimony. In fact, did you know that 'hypocrite' is an ancient word used to describe a special kind of actor in a stage show who wears different masks to play different characters!?! Hmmmm. Well, we all know people who say they don't attend church because: &quot;They're all hypocrites.&quot; How sad is that? When people lose respect for us and the One we represent because they think we're faking it - just wearing a mask.

Paul could never be called a faker because he just told it like it is. He even had a big confrontation with Peter over this. Listen: &quot;When Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he was clearly in the wrong.&quot; It takes backbone to speak out like that! Throughout history, it's not the people who put on an act but the people who kept it real who became the most admired and influential. Do you want to inspire trust and respect in everybody who knows you? Then don't put on an act, be genuine!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>No one needed to tell Him about human nature.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>John 2:25 NLT</span><br>Idealism affects us in different ways. First, we might be unrealistic about ourselves. So when we do things poorly we feel bad. That sets in motion a never-ending cycle of reaching for things that are out of our reach, hoping to prove something we don't have to prove in the first place. We think we should be able to do everything to a perfect standard, but there are some things we just don't have in our mix of talents and abilities. You don't need to prove anything! Just obey God and allow Him to take care of your reputation. If you expect to excel outside of your abilities and destiny, you're setting yourself up for disappointment.

Idealism also affects us in our relationships with others. To make somebody else responsible for your happiness, or you for theirs is a huge mistake. Abraham Lincoln said: &quot;Most people are about as happy as they make up their mind to be.&quot; If somebody doesn't have the right outlook on life, all the friends in the world won't make them happy.

Idealism about life in general also set us up for disappointment. Listen: &quot;The system will drag you down, but I've beaten the system. So relax...&quot; (John 16:8 STREET).  As long as you're in the world you'll have problems. Nobody gets a free pass. But don't stress, God's got everything under control, so learn to be realistic, not idealistic. You'll always have to deal with unpleasant situations and difficult people. But your attitude (not theirs), is what will determine whether or not you enjoy life!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>No one needed to tell Him about human nature.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>John 2:25 NLT</span><br>When we start getting all idealistic it's a set up for disappointment. &quot;Are you saying I shouldn't expect anything from anybody then?&quot;  No, you should expect the best and encourage it, but never forget that people are just people. When Jesus' disciples disappointed Him, it didn't devastate Him. Listen: &quot;...He knew what people were really like. No one needed to tell Him about human nature&quot; (John 2:24-25 NLT). Jesus expected His disciples to do their best, but He knew that even their best would still be imperfect. And you need to understand that about your mates and your family too. 

The perfect family, the perfect friend, the perfect partner, the perfect job, the perfect church don't exist! God knew that, so He gave us instructions on how to handle people who disappoint us. Listen: &quot;Share each other's troubles and problems, and in this way observe the law of Christ&quot; (Galatians 6:2 NLT). What is the law of Christ? Well, Jesus said: &quot;...I am giving you a new commandment...Just as I have loved you, you should love each other&quot; (John 13:34 NLT). We must love His way - without conditions and without pressure. Yeah, it is easier to be idealistic about how to love the irritating people in our lives than it is to actually do it - but God never commands you to do what He won't give you the grace to carry out. And the great thing is, in the process of carrying it out, you'll become a bit more like Jesus!

<title><![CDATA[A greater awareness]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>We have heard...we have seen...our hands have touched.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 John 1:1</span><br>Being switched on to God's reality in your life brings three great benefits:

1) Confidence. Your journey won't be free of storms, nobody's is. But an awareness of God's reality in your life will enable you to face those storms, confident that life can't throw anything at you that you won't be able to handle in God's strength.

2) Companionship. At some point we all realise that human relationships are limited; even your best mates can't always 'be there'. They get hitched, move away or just get boring. Sometimes they don't understand. Sometimes they say stupid things. If you try to meet all your companionship needs through people, no matter how wonderful they are, you're in for a life of frustration. &quot;...But, there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother&quot; (Proverbs 18:24). And we learned just a few days ago - He's been &quot;..tempted in every way, just as we are...&quot; (see Hebrews 4:15), He understands us completely. John says this friend who can &quot;be heard...seen...touched&quot;, always listens, always communicates, always expresses affection, is patient with us, forgives us whenever we let Him down, and stays devoted to us, even when we ignore Him.

3) Compassion. The more time you spend with Jesus, the more like Him you become. Look what happened to John. As a young disciple he wanted to destroy a town because some of its residents didn't want Jesus to stay there (See Luke 9:54). But after a lifetime in God's presence he wrote: &quot;Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love&quot; (1John 4:8).

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...I live by faith in the son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Galatians 2:20</span><br>&quot;How could Jesus die for me - it was ages ago!&quot; Let's look at some pictures the Bible uses to explain how. 

Ransom: When someone's been kidnapped a ransom has to be paid to set them free. People in the ancient world understood this because family members might be kidnapped as prisoners of war or for the slave trade. Jesus said that he came: &quot;...to give his life as a ransom for many&quot; (Mark 10:45).  

Substitute: We understand substitutes in football - but this is a bit different - unless the game of footy was being played on Death Row! Jesus who'd done no wrong exchanged himself for us on the cross. &quot;This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us...&quot; (1 John 3.16).

Reconciliation: This strange word means that opposing sides are brought back together after they've been separated, it's the process of healing wounds, like between blacks and whites in South Africa. &quot;But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near through the blood of Christ&quot; (Ephesians 2:13).

Representative: Jesus was 100% man and 100% God in perfect unity. So when He poured out His life on the cross there's no wonder His death sent shockwaves through the whole of time. This was the King of the world giving Himself for the sins of the world:  &quot;...we are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died&quot; (2Corinthians 5:14). We need this picture because we have become fragmented, individualistic and need reminding that we are all connected by the cross.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>John 20:29</span><br>We've not seen Jesus - here on earth in bodily form. When He returned to heaven 2000 years ago the angels asked His disciples: &quot;...why do you stand here looking into the sky?...&quot; (Acts 1:11). They wouldn't be able to relate to Him in the same way that they were used to, they'd have to get to know Him again in a different way, through His Holy Spirit who He would send, invisible to the human eye, but just as knowable as a best friend. 

So what about us then? We read about Jesus in the Bible, but because we've never seen him here on earth our minds can play tricks on us or our mates can make fun of us, saying: &quot;Doh! You think Jesus is alive?!? You think the Hoooly Spirit talks to you?!?&quot; Well, think about this for a minute before you give in to that stuff - how much of this life is actually made up of things you can see? Think about it. Where are your friends right now? Can you see them? Do you start to doubt that they exist when you can't see them? When your mum shouts from the bottom of the stairs that your tea's ready do you get all spooked and start thinking that you're hearing voices in your head just because you can't see her but you can hear her voice? Don't be daft! And what about the feelings you have, and the memories - all that's invisible but it makes up a massive chunk of your life. 

So just because you've not seen Jesus you're not at a disadvantage - Jesus said: &quot;...blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.&quot;

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>This high priest of ours understands our weaknesses...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Hebrews 4:15 NLT</span><br>Jesus loves you unconditionally - that means love without any strings attached. On top of that He is devoted to working any difficult stuff through with you. And the best part is - He never gets impatient or angry in the process! Listen: &quot;This High Priest of ours understands our weaknesses, for he faced all of the same temptations we do...&quot; (Hebrews 4:15 NLT).

Check out the word 'understand'. Jesus understands us even when everybody else thinks that we've lost the plot and might even be a sandwich short of a picnic! He even understands us when we don't even understand ourselves! People see what we do and want to know why we're not doing it better - or even why we're doing it at all. But Jesus understands why we behave like we do. He understands what we were created for. He understands the temperament given to us at birth. He understands our struggles. He understands the emotional wounds in our past. He even understands the faulty foundation upon which we base our self-worth.

And He not only understands, He cares! Once we enter into a personal relationship with Him, Jesus begins a process of relieving our pain, revealing our true value, and releasing our gifts. Bit by bit He restores everything Satan has stolen from us. And while all this is happening, God has positioned us securely 'in Christ' so that we're always acceptable to Him. Jesus won salvation for us on the cross - complete acceptance by God. That's all you'll ever really need to understand.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Salvation is not a reward for the good things we have done...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ephesians 2:9 (NLT)</span><br>It's essential that you understand what makes you acceptable in the eyes of God. True faith leads you into serving God in all sorts of ways, but you won't depend on that. No, you'll do that stuff as loving obedience rather than a 'work of the flesh' - which means stuff people do to try to earn His love.

Lots of people spend their lives chasing after this and that. And unfortunately the world backs this up by promoting the idea that our value is somehow connected to our 'doing.' Growing up have you been constantly compared? Asked why you were not doing as well as your brother or sister or the kid next door? And even if you're determined to try harder; no matter how hard you try somebody still won't be satisfied with you. That subtle message lingers: &quot;Something's wrong with you.&quot; The whole experience leaves you turned-off, and fed-up. Let's face it, the world needs a crash course in God's unconditional love. Nobody's mixed up behaviours will be permanently changed until the penny drops: &quot;I'm loved by God for who I am - not what I do!&quot; All of us need that - and that's what Jesus made possible through the cross!

Why is this important to believe? Because until you know who you are 'in Christ', you'll stumble along believing that your acceptance with God is doing-based. Well technically that's half right, your acceptance with God is based on doing, but not what you do - it's what Jesus has already done. Get that, and you're well on your way today!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>For in Him we live, and move, and have our being...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Acts 17:28</span><br>God loves you as much on your bad days as He does on your good ones. Really? How's that possible? Because His acceptance of you is based on your position in Christ not your condition in the flesh. Listen: &quot;For God made Christ, who never sinned, to be the offering for our sin, so that we could be made right with God through Christ.&quot; (2 Corinthians 5:21 NLT).

The most amazing exchange took place at the cross. God took every sin you would ever commit and laid it upon His Son. Then, when you come to the cross as a sinner, He took all of Christ's perfection and wrapped you up in it. From that point on He sees you only one way - a Christ-ian! How cool is that?!?

Now we see that our worth isn't based on what we do, but on who we are 'in Christ'. God showed massive love for you by allowing Jesus to die for you. &quot;But I can't believe that God doesn't care about what I do?&quot; You're absolutely right! God does care about what you do with your new life, He wants you to serve him and do good stuff - but He doesn't want you to do that to earn His love, He wants you to do all that out of love for Him. Once you understand your position, who you are 'in Christ', you can get off the treadmill and begin doing the right things for the right reasons.

<title><![CDATA[Losing a loved one]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>He heals the brokenhearted, binding up their wounds.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 147:3 NLT</span><br>Grief stings, especially at anniversaries, birthdays and holidays. God also knows that grieving is an important part of closure. He never promised to keep us from pain and loss, just to bring us through it. Maybe these five suggestions will help:

1) Don't deny your loss. The Bible says: &quot;Good people are remembered long after they are gone...&quot; (Proverbs 10:7 CEV). When you're around friends don't hesitate to talk about your lost loved one. When you do, you're saying it's okay for them to share their memories too.

2) Expand your 'family.' Solomon writes: &quot;...Better a nearby friend than a distant family&quot; (Proverbs 27:10 TM). So if you don't (or even if you do) have family nearby, reach out to caring people who are close at hand.

3) Don't try to do it all. Remember: &quot;There is a time to cry...&quot; (Ecclesiastes 3:4 NCV). Because grief is so draining you'll need more rest than usual. While your ability to function normally is reduced, chill out about the everyday stuff until you feel stronger. 

4) Protect your boundaries. Nobody knows how you feel better than you, so give yourself permission to say: &quot;Thanks - but no thanks&quot; without feeling guilty. 

5) Network with others. You might meet some people who've been through exactly what you're going through and discover that you're not alone and that grieving isn't a sickness. Sharing with those who understand brings healing.

<title><![CDATA[What's faith?]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Hebrews 11:1 NKJV</span><br>Faith is a substance! We don't often think of it that way, we look at it as being kind of fuzzy. But it's not; we use faith every day. For example: your dad picks up the phone, and calls PC World to order that new flat screen monitor - they ask for his credit card number. Then they send him a receipt. Now that receipt is what he holds on to while he waits for the item to arrive; it gives the assurance that the product is on the way. And the same is true in the spiritual world. You talk to God and God promises to answer your prayer. You believe Him. But your faith is the receipt you hold on to while you're waiting.

Faith is also evidence! Why would you believe that somebody you can't see on the other end of a phone line would send you something just because you order it. Because it happens every day for other people, and because it's happened to you before. Therefore, you're not being ridiculous when you go to your door expecting it to be there. You're not the first person to trust God and you won't be the last. Listen: &quot;...His faithfulness continues through all generations&quot; (Psalm 100:5). People have been trusting God for thousands of years and has He ever let them down? Never! His past faithfulness is all the 'evidence' you need. So, it's not stupid to have confidence in a God like that, is it?

<title><![CDATA[Daily grace]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Grace and peace to you from God...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Corinthians 1:3</span><br>Lots of Paul's letters to the young churches around the Mediterranean began: &quot;Grace and peace to you.&quot; Why? Because we can't experience God's peace unless we first know how to receive His grace and walk in it. There are three things about grace you need to understand: a) it can't be earned  b) it's God doing for you what you cannot do for yourself  c) it usually doesn't kick in until you stop struggling, trying to do it your own way.

The Apostle James wrote: &quot;...God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble&quot; (James 4:6). The humble are those who admit their total inability to succeed without God's help. But the proud are always trying to take credit. They like to think it's their ability that gets the job done, so they have difficulty asking God and even more difficulty receiving from Him. That's why Peter writes: &quot;Grow in grace...&quot; (2 Peter 3:18 KJV). We only learn to trust God by doing it. We grow in grace by practicing putting our trust in Him, expecting the arrival of His delivery of grace every day, His help in situations that are difficult or impossible for us.

Face it: there'll never be a day when you won't need God's grace. And if you're willing to say that you need it, there'll be no shortage of it. Listen to what the extra-juicy Amplified Bible has to say: &quot;For out of His fullness (abundance) we have all received [all had a share and we were all supplied with] one grace after another and spiritual blessing upon spiritual blessing and even favor upon favor and gift [heaped] upon gift&quot; (John 1:16 AMP).

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...God doesn't give us a mouse mentality...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Timothy 1:7 STREET</span><br>When somebody says: &quot;This is off the top of my head,&quot; expect dandruff! Einstein said: &quot;Thinking is hard work, that's why so few of us do it.&quot; To upgrade your thinking you must test two things regularly:

1) The Fitness Test. Gordon MacDonald says: &quot;People who are out of shape mentally, fall victim to ideas and systems that are destructive to the human spirit. They've not been taught how to think, nor have they set themselves to the life-long pursuit of the growth of the mind, so they grow dependent upon the thoughts and opinions of others. Rather than deal with ideas and issues, they reduce themselves to lives filled with rules, regulations and programmes.&quot;

2) The Faith Test. A man went to a fortune teller who told him: &quot;You'll be poor and unhappy until you're 45.&quot; He asked the fortune teller: &quot;What will happen then?&quot; She replied: &quot;Then you'll get used to it.&quot;  How many successful people do you know who are really neggy or 'can't be bothered'? None! Real faith produces excitement &amp; energy - characteristics that help you achieve success. If you'd like to possess these qualities, then raise your faith level. Bring it into line with God's Bible promises.

Do you want to succeed where you've failed before - to become the person you know you are inside? Don't start by trying to change your actions, start by changing your mind. Renew it daily with God's Word. Nothing you do will have as great an impact.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...He channels His brilliance through our...fragile bodies, so there's no question that the glow's from Him...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Corinthians 4:7 STREET</span><br>When you first accept Jesus He puts the light of His love inside you. But there are times when it can get hidden under layers of failure, fear and low self-esteem. You might know that you have His light shining inside you but not know the effect it can have in this dark world. If that's you, listen: &quot;...He channels His brilliance through our...fragile bodies, so there's no question that the glow's from Him...&quot; The light that shines from your life, in the good times and the bad, proves to the world that God is for real. People notice stuff like that and so they'll ask: &quot;What's different about you?&quot; And you can answer: &quot;Oops, sorry - did I leak a bit of God onto you...never mind, it will do you good!&quot; The fact is; you've got so much light within you and our enemy - the devil, hates it. He does his dirty business in darkness but the light of God exposes him. So protect your light, don't let him trick you into hiding it or burying it under self-doubt, unconfessed sin, bad habits, regret and despair. 

God has taken something that looks like your 'fragile body' and created something wonderful within it. Just think, He made the earth from nothing - so imagine what He can do when He has something to start with! Today will you ask Him to help you to tear away anything that is preventing the rest of the world from seeing the eternal light that He's put inside you.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Since He himself has gone through suffering...He is able to help us...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Hebrews 2:18 NLT</span><br>Is life getting a bit hectic? Jesus understands: &quot;Great crowds came...the lame...blind...crippled, those who could not speak...and He healed them&quot; (Matthew 15:30 NCV). You know, Jesus had a secret weapon: &quot;...while it was still dark, Jesus...went to a lonely place, where He prayed&quot; (Mark 1:35 NCV). Jesus understood the universal law: you can only make withdrawals as long as you keep making deposits.

Are you disappointed in people? Jesus understands. Remember, Judas grassed Him up, then sealed the deal with a kiss!  Even in His darkest hour, Gethsemane, His own disciples couldn't stay awake to pray with Him for one hour. (See Matthew 26:40). So many times during His life the people around Jesus let Him down but it didn't make Him bitter - He loved them unconditionally.

Have you been laughed at? Jesus understands. They accused Him of being  &quot;...a friend of the riff-raff...&quot; (Matthew 11:19 TM). And worse, up until the time of His death they were trying to &quot;...find something false...so they could kill him&quot; (Matthew 26:59 NCV). You know, Jesus said: &quot;...The servant is not greater than his Lord&quot; (John 15:20). So when you decide to follow Jesus, you're signing up for both blessing and stress, they go together! So why did Jesus go through these things? Listen: &quot;Since he himself has gone through suffering...he is able to help us...&quot; He already walked the path you're on today so that you could come to Him, knowing He understands and &quot;...is able to help...&quot; Not only is He able to help, He wants to.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...Christ...is the perfection of God in a human body.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Colossians 2:9 TLB</span><br>Jesus can relate to us on every level. The Bible says that Jesus experienced &quot;every detail of human life. Then, when he came before God as high priest to get rid of people's sins, he would have already experienced it all himself - all the pain, all the testing - and would be able to help...&quot; (Hebrews 2:17-19 TM). Jesus knows where you're at today.

1) He understands your sense of inferiority. He came from a grotty little backwater town. Even when Philip said: &quot;We've found the One Moses wrote of...Jesus...from Nazareth!' Nathanael said: 'Nazareth? You've got to be kidding!' (John 1:46 TM). Jesus' family tree was nothing to write home about either! Rahab was a prostitute, Jacob was a crook, David was an adulterer and a murderer - to name just a few.

2) He understands when you feel overwhelmed. Listen: &quot;Crowds...were coming and going so...Jesus...did not even have time to eat...&quot; (Mark 6:31 NCV). Sound familiar? Not only did He have to deal with the public, He also had to organise, train and correct His own mates, who included some uneducated fishermen, a political activist, and a dodgy tax collector.

3) He understands your family problems. Once when Jesus was preaching His family said: &quot;He's out of his mind&quot; (Mark 3:21 NLT). Things may not be great in your family, but chances are they aren't planning on getting the men in white coats to pick you up just yet! The truth is - Jesus understands. He knows exactly where you're at today and He's able to help. So talk to Him!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...God said, 'It isn't good for...man to live alone...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Genesis 2:18 CEV</span><br>A famous newspaper columnist wrote: &quot;I'm lonely and it saddens me. How could I not have enough friends? It seems as though every woman's friendship quota is filled and she's no longer accepting new applicants. It's easy to fill your day with work, but it's not enough.&quot; And if you think it's bad for women, 90% of men report that they don't have one close friend! Mother Theresa said: &quot;Loneliness is modern-day leprosy and people don't want others to know they're lepers.&quot;

In Genesis chapter 1 we read: &quot;and God saw that it was good.&quot; It's a recurring phrase - that is, until God created Adam. Then He said: &quot;It isn't good for...man to live alone.&quot; Think: even though sin hadn't yet happened and Adam was enjoying friendship with His Creator, because he was without a human mate God said it wasn't good.

Inside every one of us there's a hole that only God can fill. But the Bible also says: &quot;...we're all connected to each other...&quot; (see Ephesians 4:5 TM), did you know there's also a people-shaped hole that God won't fill. And nothing else can either - not jobs, houses, cars, or money. The One who created you for connection says: &quot;Do not be interested only in your own life...be interested in...others&quot; (Philippians 2:4 NCV). So, the answer to loneliness can be found in reaching out: finding an unmet need somewhere and pouring yourself into it. In that typical upside-down God-way you'll find that as you pour out what you didn't know you had, you'll find yourself getting more and more full.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...I have learned to be content...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Philippians 4:11</span><br>If greed gets hold of your life you'll find it really difficult to shake it off. So you need to know when enough's enough.

1) Choose it. Make enough a daily choice. Come to the place where you really believe that more doesn't equal happier. As you do this you'll find one word really crucial - 'simplify'.

2) Say it. Practice saying: &quot;I have enough.&quot; Push back from the table and say: &quot;I've had enough.&quot; Take the surprise birthday money in your hand considering what you might buy and say: &quot;I have enough God, how can I use this for You?&quot;

3) Live it. David writes: &quot;...if your wealth increases, don't make it the centre of your life.&quot; (Psalm 62:10 NTL). You might not have a lot of cash right now - good! That's the best time to start practising this principle. Choose a realistic level of living and don't compromise by spending more just because more arrives. If you don't choose your lifestyle the world will choose it for you, and it'll probably be one that costs more than you can afford. Let your lifestyle be eternally focused!

Consider this: if all the grains of sand on all the beaches of the world represented eternity, then you could say that one grain of sand represents your lifespan. Now think: you're grinding your one grain day and night to get everything you can out of it, while ignoring all the beaches of eternity that God has in store for you. Not too bright, eh? Listen, focus on eternity. Let enough be enough. Paul did! He said: &quot;..I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances.&quot;

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>He brought me out into a spacious place...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 18:19</span><br>Everyone on this planet exists within a zone of freedom. It has nothing to do with what country you live in or who the Prime Minister is - it's an inner freedom. We make most of our decisions based on it. Outside of it we begin to feel uneasy. For example, some of us lack self-confidence unless we wear flashy name brand clothes; others are perfectly happy with cast-offs and hand-me-downs. Some of us are intimidated by people who seem important; others would be comfortable having tea with the Queen!

Accomplishing anything worthwhile generally means - expanding your zone of freedom. That can be scary. It takes guts to leave the ruts! In a rut you learn to put up with unbearable situations, that makes change difficult. It takes courage to examine your life, decide what isn't working and change it. 

But if you want the fruit, you've got to get out on the limb. Just like a turtle, you'll only make progress when you start sticking your neck out. David said: &quot;He brought me out into a spacious place...&quot; Taking risk everyday empowers you; widens your space, expands your zone. So go ahead, talk to the person who intimidates you. Why not invite him/her to that event you're planning on going to? Every night, before you get down to pushing up the zzzzzzzz's, plan tomorrow's 'risk'. Why? Because the wider your zone of freedom, the less fear can control you.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Can two people walk together without agreeing...?</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Amos 3:3 NLT</span><br>Today we'll take a look at relationships - and if you're not really thinking about getting hooked up just yet, then bear this advice in mind for the future. OK - don't fall off your chair but just because you're both Christians it doesn't guarantee harmony. Here are some practical areas you need to E-V-A-L-U-A-T-E:

Enjoy. Do you enjoy the same things? Maybe it's no big deal now, but later when he's glued to the football and you want a little conversation - it will be!  

Values. The Bible asks: &quot;Can two people walk together without agreeing...?&quot; Are you able to agree on lifestyle, money, family, church, vision for the future? Those are make-or-break issues!  

Accessibility. Are you both emotionally accessible, or is he the strong silent type who doesn't communicate - or understand your need to?  

Love. Do you really love each other? Not the Hollywood version, but real love that: Listens to your partner's opinions and concerns? Overlooks their faults and failings? Values them? Expresses itself through kindness?  

Understanding. You won't agree on everything, but can you understand and handle each other's point of view?  

Appreciation. Dave McIntye says: &quot;Appreciation is like an insurance policy, it has to be renewed every now and then.&quot; Do you make a habit of expressing yours? 

Temperament. Are your personalities compatible? If you're naturally upbeat but they're moody and introverted, you may have an oil and water mix.  

Environment. Last but not least, the physical attraction between you needs to be happening in both directions, even at breakfast when you both feel like swamp things!

Before you get too serious - think carefully about all this!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...In the day of trouble...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 27:5</span><br>Anytime you see someone who's really going places with God, chances are that somewhere along the way they've experienced some very empty moments. Fortunately God specialises in restoring the wounded, the condemned and the hassled. 

Example 1) After he was thrown out of the city, and left for dead, Paul speaks of being taken up into the third heaven and experiencing things too wonderful to speak of on earth. (See 2 Corinthians 12:2&amp;4). In fact it was so amazing, he couldn't explain whether it had happened to him in the body or out of it! 

Example 2) When John was taken as a prisoner to the island of Patmos, they chained his body but they couldn't chain his spirit. Abandoned and alone, he wrote these words: &quot;On the Lord's Day I was in the Spirit, and heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet&quot; (Revelation 1:10). As a result, he wrote the Book of Revelation.

Example 3) King David could say: &quot;In the day of trouble...my head will be exalted above the enemies who surround me...I will sing...to the Lord&quot; (Psalm 27:5-6). Now that's how to view your problems, to look back and be able to say: &quot;Thanks for the experience. Without it I'd never have come as close to God as I am today.&quot;  In fact, once you start seeing things in that light, you might even be tempted to phone up your enemies and thank them for how they treated you!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Love...is not rude...not self seeking...not easily angered...keeps no record of wrongs.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Corinthians 13:4-5</span><br>How does love take action? Only within these rules:

Love: a) &quot;...is not rude.&quot; It doesn't use the &quot;open-wide-while-I-jam-this-down-your-throat&quot; approach  b) &quot;...is not self seeking.&quot; Love thinks beyond itself, making sure that what the other person hears is filtered by kindness. It refuses to walk away having spoken only half the truth  c) &quot;...is not easily angered.&quot; When you confront someone in love, don't be upset if you get a bad reaction like: &quot;Who are you to tell me?&quot; d) &quot;...keeps no record of wrongs.&quot; When you've been hurt, it's vital that you deal with the hurt and get it behind you. It'll be much easier to sort out the situation with that person if you've got a bit of peace inside first.

How does love take action? Only after you've answered these questions... a) Is it vital? If it involves majorly misunderstanding God, or if it's an abusive behaviour or a situation that could hurt them like being involved in crime, then it's vital  - get involved  b) Is it chronic? If you observe the same thing happening over and over, it doesn't have to be a big thing to get your love in gear  c) How close are you to the situation? If you saw a random person doing something not very clever, that's probably not your business. But if someone close to you is clowning around and looking like they'll regret it, you ought to say: &quot;Oi - sort yourself out!&quot;

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>When you pray, do not keep on babbling...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 6:7</span><br>There are lots of cheesy Christian phrases which sound so religious that we can string them together and call it prayer. It's like auto-prayer; there's no thinking about what we're saying - it's babbling. Then there's prayer-babble that forgets God's promises - like: &quot;Lord, be with me as I go on this trip,&quot; when Jesus said: &quot;...surely I am with you always...&quot; (Matthew 28:20). We don't need to ask God to be with us if we're members of His family; we just need to become more aware of His presence. Asking God to be with us when He's already there, is just 'babbling'.

Another kind or prayer babble is heard at the dinner table. We sit down to a nutritional nightmare, slimy with grease, loaded with salt, piled up like a mountain, with a sugary drink ready to slosh it all down. &quot;Lord, bless this food to our body.&quot; Are you kidding? We are to &quot;honour God with our body&quot; (See 1Corinthians 6:20). Asking God to bless junk food and give it nutritional value is like asking Him to turn a dog into a cat.

So listen, God doesn't want you to pile up impressive phrases or use words without thinking about their meaning. He wants you to talk from your heart - as you would to someone you really love and trust. Listen: &quot;You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart&quot; (Jerimiah 29:13). God knows how you feel - and He cares. Nothing matters as much to Him as what's going on in your life right now. So talk to Him - from your heart!

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>When you pray...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 6:5</span><br>Britney Spears puts herself through a 90 minute physical fitness routine everyday - that's before she starts any dance rehearsal or voice training. People who are serious about something always make room for it in their schedule. When the disciples asked Jesus about prayer, He began by saying: &quot;When you pray.&quot; He assumed they'd have a regular time for prayer. Could He assume that about you? 

He also said: &quot;When you pray, go into your room, close the door...&quot; (Matthew 6:6). Why the emphasis on privacy? Because voices, noise, music, phones, computers, TV - even a ticking clock can cause you to lose your concentration. He was basically saying: &quot;Don't bother fighting distractions because you'll lose. Just find a quiet place where you can pray without interruption.&quot;

But there's another reason: once you identify your 'secret place' and begin to use it regularly, a kind of attachment develops. It's just like couples who might have a favourite restaurant where they go for special nights out. You know, they love its atmosphere; they have lots of memories drawing them back like a magnet. It's easy for them to be open and intimate there. So when you create such a regular meeting place with God, you'll look forward to going there too. You'll grow to love it and eventually it'll become the most important place in your life. &quot;When should I go there?&quot; you might wanna know. In the morning if you're a lark; at night if you're an owl! In other words, whenever you can really 'get into it'.

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Peter and John went...to take part in the three o'clock daily prayers.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Acts 3:1 TLB</span><br>How can I make prayer a daily habit like Peter and John did? Before answering, you need to hear two warnings:

1) There is no scientific formula! Jesus warned the disciples not to &quot;...think they will be heard because of their many words&quot; (Matthew 6:7). By all means take notes in church, highlight what you read, set your alarm for six in the morning; but before you lengthen your list of techniques think - do you need more habits, or more effective ones? Too often spiritual discipline turns into a straight jacket filled with rules that squeeze the joy out of life. Most of us can't live that way very long; and some who do manage to keep it up, develop such a self-righteous attitude that the rest of us wish they'd fail.

2) You won't get by with no structure at all! You can't grow without structure anymore than you can get fit or get rich by just sitting back and waiting for whatever happens. You don't wait to exercise until you feel like doing it. Be honest, how many days do you feel like it? &quot;Not today; it's a bit chilly outside; it's going to rain; it's too sunny; I feel queasy; my knees ache; the sofa is extra comfy today.&quot; The list is endless. It's the same with prayer. A good prayer habit gets over the excuses and gets down to the action; but you'll never develop a rich and rewarding prayer life if you try to wing it without discipline.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...I've never been this low...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 142:5-6 TM</span><br>Have you heard the phase 'the straw that broke the camel's back'? It means that we all have a limit to the amount of stuff we carry around at any time - when we've reached that point, even the smallest thing can cause us to crumble. Before you reach that point, here are some suggestions:

Lose the red cape. You're not Superman (or woman!). When you know that enough is enough say so! Don't keep taking on more and more as if you have superhero powers. Be real. Whenever David bottomed out he told God: &quot;I've never been this low.&quot; Coming to the end of his strength was an invitation to God - who really can do the super hero stuff.

Acknowledge your limits. Jesus didn't try to personally minister to every person in the world, so how come you think you can do it all? God kept this world spinning before you arrived and He'll keep it spinning when you're gone! Chill out for a few minutes of quiet time with God to refresh and refocus you.

Just say...no! Usually we feel guilty and worry that people won't like us if we say no. The problem is, when we don't, we end up too stressed out to enjoy ourselves. Dr H B London writes: &quot;It's easy to say no to a root canal filling or colonoscopy. It's more difficult to say it when things are interesting and enjoyable. Yet, even if everything we're doing is enjoyable, if we don't learn to say no, overload will overwhelm us.&quot;

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...Let this be known to all the world.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Isaiah 12:5</span><br>Right, you'll really need your Bible out for this one, we're gonna take a look at some quality words found in Isaiah chapter 12 - it's just six verses long so we won't be here all day.  

Even though the book of Isaiah is a book of prophecy - a load of thoughts from God about the way things will work out in the future - this is like a little interlude.

The thing that you'll notice is that it's really in two halves. How many times do you see 'me' and 'my' in the first half? Six times in two verses! &quot;You were angry with me... and you have comforted me.&quot;  &quot;God is my salvation... the LORD, is my strength and my song; He has become my salvation.&quot; It's like in these first few verses the penny drops - it becomes personal: &quot;I'm just buzzing because I've realised that God saved me!&quot; 

Then the second half has a different kind of excitement. What was a personal sense of God is beginning to explode, listen: &quot;...make known among the nations what He has done, and proclaim that His name is exalted...He has done glorious things; let this be known to all the world. Shout aloud and sing for joy...&quot; The sort of excitement Isaiah has here is exactly the kind of excitement that always overflows from those who have realised that God has saved them. It's a bubbling, overflowing praise that says: &quot;I want the whole world to know that God is so amazing!&quot;  If you don't exactly feel like that today then don't just try to whip it up - just return to the cross and remember: &quot;...He has become my salvation.&quot;

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>[Love]...believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Corinthians 13:7 NAS</span><br>&quot;Love...believes all things.&quot; Love believes the best about others - always! When someone you care about is being dissed, love says: &quot;You don't know what you're talking about; that's not the kind of person she is. That's not what she meant.&quot; Listen again: &quot;[Love] hopes all things.&quot; Love sees people not as they are right now, but as they will be by God's grace. Wouldn't it be great if God could download that kind of love into all our hearts? Then Paul adds that love 'endures all things'. Endure is a strong word. It describes standing firm like a mountain, and enduring love says: &quot;I'll stand my ground in loving you.&quot;

In his amazing book Love, Acceptance &amp; Forgiveness, Jerry Cook describes a church in America that grew in 14 years to more than 4,000 people. The book includes a commitment the people at that church made to each other. It says: &quot;You'll never knowingly suffer at my hands. I'll never knowingly say or do anything to hurt you. I'll always, in every circumstance, seek to help and support you. If you're down and I can lift you, I'll do that. If you need something and I have it, I'll share it with you. If I need to, I'll give it to you. No matter what I find out about you, no matter what happens in the future - either good or bad - my commitment to you will never change. And there's nothing you can do about it!&quot;  

Today pray: &quot;Lord, help me to love like that.&quot;

<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...Lord, increase our faith!</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Luke 17:5</span><br>There's something about doubting that satisfies our need for self-protection. Nobody likes to be wrong, to get hurt, to fail, so our mind works like this: &quot;It's easier not to trust God, to lower my expectations, then I won't be disappointed.&quot; But it doesn't work, does it? You do get disappointed, don't you? Why? Because life can be mixed up and confusing - but that doesn't mean God's not real. It doesn't mean God's stopped loving you.

Generally doubting is quite a passive thing. You don't wake up in the morning and say: &quot;Today I'm going to doubt God.&quot; No, doubt moves into your empty spaces. It takes over when you don't fill yourself with the right things. Listen: &quot;...faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God&quot; (Romans10:17NKJV). If you don't keep your nose in God's Word you'll find all sorts of doubts creeping in.

Do you know that doubting is contagious? It's easier to catch than the common cold, the germs are negative words. Solomon writes: &quot;...you are trapped by your own words&quot; (Proverbs 6:2 CEV). Words either build you up or tear you down, like this: &quot;What'll I do?&quot; or &quot;In God's strength I can handle it.&quot;  &quot;It's awful!&quot; or &quot;It's a learning experience!&quot;  &quot;I see no way out!&quot; or &quot;It's not too big for God.&quot;

Your words determine the spiritual climate of your life. So, to move from doubt to faith, start removing any negative words from your conversation and begin talking in line with the promises of God.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...I will make your name great; and you will be a blessing.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Genesis 12:2</span><br>Having no family George spent his early years shuffled between foster homes till one day Maria Watkins, a childless washerwoman, found him asleep in her barn. But she didn't just take him in, she took him to church and introduced him to Jesus. When eventually he left her home, he took with him the Bible she'd given him. Maria left her mark on his life - and George Washington Carver left his mark on the world as one of the leading black Americans of his time. He became a friend of world leaders including three American Presidents and Ghandi. His claim to fame wasn't really that special - he was the world's No 1 peanut expert! He came up with over 300 peanut inventions! It wasn't what he did that impressed these leaders so much - it was how he did it. You see the remarkable thing is, despite his early disadvantages this orphaned boy never became bitter or spent so much as a minute trying to 'get even'. Instead, when he went into his lab each morning he prayed: &quot;Open my eyes that I may see...&quot; (Read Psalm 119:18). How could God fail to bless someone with that attitude?

God always takes the time necessary to develop our character to match our abilities. After telling Abraham: &quot;I will make your name great,&quot; it took 25 more years of testing before God finally entrusted him with a son to establish the Jewish nation. So, if you're waiting for 'the call', could it be that your character needs more work? That the task God has in mind for you requires a bigger person than you are right now?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...Your message burns in my heart...I cannot keep silent.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Jeremiah 20:9 CEV</span><br>God is a passionate God. And God's passion is contagious - so if you get close to Him you're likely to catch it! You'll start to be passionate about whatever God is passionate about. Whatever it is, you'll feel compelled to speak up or do what you can to make a difference. You can't keep yourself from acting on what you're passionate about: &quot;...whatever is in your heart determines what you say&quot; (Matt hew12:34 NLT). God will give you a passion to champion a cause; often it'll relate to something you've personally experienced such as abuse, addiction, illness, rejection, or some other challenge.

God uses passionate people to fulfil His purposes. He may give you a burning desire to put all those millions you make into a church planting programme or a child sponsorship scheme. You may be given a passion for reaching a particular group of people: kids, teenagers, singles, exchange students, lone parents, prisoners, asylum seekers, or those with a particular interest like music or skating. If you ask God He'll light a fire in your heart for specific people you can reach.

God gives each of us different passions. Why? So that everything He wants done, will get done!  But be careful - don't expect everybody to be equally passionate about your passion! Learn to listen to and value other people's God-given passion, because nobody can do it all. Never belittle somebody's passion. The Bible says: &quot;It is fine to be zealous, provided the purpose is good...&quot; (Galatians 4:18). So, what do you feel passionate about today?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Make the most of your chances to tell others the Good News...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Colossians 4:5 TLB</span><br>Telling people about the way Jesus has changed your life isn't always easy but love leaves us with no choice. Listen: &quot;There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear...&quot; (1John 4:18). A parent will run into a burning building to save a child. Why? Because their love for that child is greater than their fear! If you've been afraid to share your story with those around you, ask God to give you a greater love for them. As long as there's one person in your circle of influence who isn't in God's family, you must try to reach them. 

&quot;...God who settled the relationship between us and him...called us to settle our relationships with each other...God has given us the task of telling everyone what He is doing. We're Christ's representatives...&quot;  (2 Corinthians 5.18-20 TM)

What are you willing to do so that the people you know will go to heaven? Invite them to an event? Share your story? Give them a copy of this little magazine? Hang out with them more regularly? Pray until they're saved? Your mission field is all around you.

Will anyone in heaven be able to say to you: &quot;Thank you. I'm here because you cared enough to share your story with me?&quot; Imagine the buzz of meeting people in heaven who you've helped to get there. The salvation of a single life is more important than anything else you'll ever achieve. Why? Because only salvation lasts forever!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplist...the saving of many lives.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Genesis 50:20</span><br>Your story will include all sorts of circumstances and crises that God has brought you through since you became a Christian. What lessons have you learned about relationships, problems, temptations, habits, and other aspects of life? David prayed: &quot;God, teach me lessons for living so I can stay the course&quot; (Psalm 119:33 TM).

You know, it's good to learn from your mistakes but there simply isn't enough time to learn everything by trial and error. So much frustration could be avoided if only we'd learn from each other's experiences. Smart people develop the habit of extracting lessons from everyday life. So start making a list of 'lessons learned'. You don't really know what you know until you've written it down. Here are a few questions to jog your memory and get you started:

What is God teaching me from failure? What is God teaching me from lack of cash? What is God teaching me from pain? What is God teaching me through waiting? What is God teaching me from disappointment? What have I learned by allowing God to speak through my family, my church, my relationships, my friends, my critics? 

When you can look at your life as Joseph did and say: &quot;You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish...the saving of many lives,&quot; you've got a story that will grab the attention of the people around you and attract them to Jesus.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...You will be my witnesses...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Acts 1:8</span><br>In a courtroom a witness is not expected to argue the case or press for a verdict; that's the lawyer's job. Witnesses simply tell the story of what they saw and experienced. And Jesus said: &quot;...You will be my witnesses...&quot;

There's no other story like yours! Only you can share it. If you don't, it'll be lost forever. You may not be a Bible boffin but you are the No 1 expert on your life. Actually, your story, however fragmented, could be more effective than a polished sermon, because people see ministers as professional salesmen, but they see you as a satisfied customer! People have a natural curiosity about experiences they've never had. So, all you have to do is use your story to build a bridge that Jesus can walk across into their heart.

Your story bypasses their defences. Many people who don't necessarily accept the truth of the Bible will respect your personal experience. That's why on six different occasions Paul used his life story to share the Gospel and also why Peter writes: &quot;...if you are asked about your Christian hope, always be ready to explain it&quot; (1Peter 3:15 NLT).  Notice the words 'be ready'. To be ready, write out your story and memorise the main points  a) what was life like before?  b) how did you realise you needed Jesus? c) how did you commit your life to Him?  d) what difference has He made? 

Now get out there and tell your story!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Whoever walks with the wise will become wise...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 13:20 NLT</span><br>Before you make the decision, be sure you can live with the consequences! Ask yourself: &quot;Do I have what it takes to handle this?&quot; If you can barely cope now, how will you handle more? Think: added success brings added pressure. If your success makes you unavailable to God and your family, it's not success, it's failure.

Never allow your expectations to exceed your practical potential! Get rid of the myth that you can do anything if you just put your mind to it. Dogs can walk on their hind legs, but it's not what God intended for them! Be honest with yourself. Concentrate on what you do well. &quot;But what about all the other stuff that needs doing?&quot; When you get good at recognising potential in other people you'll be able to pass the other stuff to them and they'll thank you for it!

If the return isn't greater than the investment, is it worth your time? Time is your most valuable and limited resource; you don't have any to waste. Wasted time is the leading cause of failure, so get away from people and habits that waste your time. Live every day as though it were your last - it might be! (eek - scary!)

You have to stay alive to thrive! Let nothing take you out!  Psalm 30 v 5 (Street Bible version) says: &quot;We cry through the night, but the morning sun begins its climb, And it's celebration time.&quot; If you can survive today, you can thrive tomorrow!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...Don't begine until you count the cost...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Luke 14:28 NLT</span><br>You don't demand leadership you earn it - every day. To be a leader worth following, you must:

1) Learn to control your impulsiveness! Short-term solutions create long-term problems. Listen: &quot;...be quick to listen, slow to speak...&quot; (James 1:19). Don't lead from one knee-jerk reaction to the next - or you'll end up surrounded by a lot of bruised people! Always ask: &quot;Do I have to decide this right now?&quot; Usually you don't. This is important because your leadership is only as good as your track record. 

2) Put the right people in the right slot! Leaders have the job of helping others find the best place to express their talents. But it's tempting to put people in certain slots because there's no one else to fill them. That can be a big problem because if they don't fit you'll have to pull them out again and then you're dealing with somebody's feelings. And what happens when the right person comes along for that role but now you've already filled it? 

3) Consider all your options, then accept final responsibility. By learning to wait a little longer and getting more information before making a decision, you can avoid the heartache of ending up with second best. What looks good today may not look so good tomorrow when you're presented with better options. Talk to someone you respect - someone who's already done what you want to do, then make that decision. And guess what - if you're successful you can praise your team and if you fail you can take the blame...isn't life great for leaders?!?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...My God...why did you abandon me?</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 27:46 TEV</span><br>How would you feel about having to stand on a stage and watch a video of every sin you've ever committed? The angry outbursts, selfish motives, critical attitudes, jealous intentions, secret addictions. You'd probably want to crawl under a rock! Well, Jesus endured much worse, the Bible says He: &quot;...carried our sins in his body on the cross so we would stop living for sin and start living for what is right...:&quot;(1Peter 2:24 NCV). No wonder we love Him so much!

But there's more - it's bad enough to carry sins you didn't commit, but can you imagine being abandoned by God? Well Jesus endured that too, it was part of the plan to set us free. Jesus called to his Father that day, but with an aching heart God had turned His back. 

Why? Because at that moment Jesus was carrying the most hideous sins. On the cross He took the place of the gossiper, the thief, the liar, the cheat, the alcoholic, the porn star,the child abuser and the terrorist. Does it offend you to see His name linked with those? Gentle Jesus? Well, like it or not He really did put Himself in their place - and yours! With a breaking heart God poured out all His holy judgment on to His only Son. So, when Jesus cried from the cross: &quot;My God, my God, why did you abandon me?&quot; He said it - so you'd never have to!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...He made known to us the mystery of His will...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ephesians 1:9</span><br>If you're into PS2 or Xbox you'll have no doubt played Tony Hawk's Pro-skater. One of the many challenges is to ride a half pipe ramp while a guy calls out tricks. You have to skate for your life, keeping up with him using skill and focus because it gets harder &amp; harder!  Before you know it you're pulling a 720 Indy Nosegrab and wondering: &quot;How did I do that!&quot;  It's a total buzz! You know, before Israel ever set foot in the Promised Land, God told them He'd already given it to them: all they had to do was go in and take it. There's a lesson here: we simply carry out here on earth the moves God's already decided in heaven. That's also why Jesus said: &quot;...apart from me, you can do nothing&quot; (John 15:5). That is - nothing of eternal value. Before He responded to the people he met in the course of the average day, Jesus first consulted His Father. Listen: &quot;...I judge only as I hear...&quot; (John 5:30). He understood that 'getting everything done' doesn't mean very much, unless it's what God wants done! 

All this is about communication, God talking to us, and us paying attention. Listen to what the Bible says: &quot;...He made known unto us the mystery of His will...&quot; (Ephesians 1:9). Imagine living in such a way that God's will is no longer a mystery to you. That kind of life is possible - God calling the tricks and you making the moves!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>What do you think about...Christ?</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 22:42</span><br>One day Jesus and some mates climbed a mountain...&quot;Moses and Elijah, appeared and began talking with [Him]...Peter...blurted out, 'Master...We will make three shrines - one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah&quot; (Luke 9:30-33 NLT). Peter's intentions were good, but his idea came straight out of cloud cuckoo land! Suddenly, the voice of God spoke from heaven and Moses, Elijah, Peter, James and John all heard it. God said: &quot;...This is my Son whom I have chosen; listen to him&quot; (Luke 9:35).  It was a powerful moment but Jesus already knew exactly who He was. We see that when His accusers shouted: &quot;...Are You then the Son of God?&quot;... He said to them: &quot;You rightly say that I am&quot; (Luke 22:70 NKJV). He also said: &quot;Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father...&quot; (John 14:9). And He really blew everyone's minds saying: &quot;...I lay down my life voluntarily.  For I have the right to lay it down when I want to and also the power to take it again...&quot; (John 10.18 NLT).

Top boffin C S Lewis said: &quot;A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic - on the level with a man who says he is a poached egg - or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is the son of God, or else a madman or something worse.&quot;

Please don't call Jesus just another historic figure. Surrender to Him as 100% God or reject Him as just some crazy sandal wearer. There's nothing in-between.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Their delight is in the law of the Lord, and on his law they meditate day and night.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 1:2 NRSV</span><br>Jesus people stand out in the crowd! Their character is deeper, their ideas fresher, their spirit softer, their courage greater, their leadership smarter, their concerns wider, their compassion more genuine, their convictions more concrete. They thrive in tough situations and show wisdom far beyond their years. And they're full of surprises. You think you have them boxed in, but they turn out to be unpredictable. When you're around them you feel slightly off balance because you don't know what to expect next. Over time you realise that their unexpected ideas and actions can be trusted.

Why? Because these people have developed a strong relationship with Jesus - one that's renewed day by day. Long ago King David had encountered the same devotion: &quot;Their delight is in the law of the Lord, and on his law they meditate day and night.&quot; Jesus people have a spiritual root system that reaches down to streams of living water, so whatever the weather - they're on form. So why don't all Christians reach this level. Because we're just too busy! The arch enemy of spiritual growth is busyness, which is closely tied to something the Bible calls &quot;worldliness&quot; - starting to jig to the world's tune instead of God's. Any way you cut it, the No 1 priority for Jesus people is time with Him. Not left over time, not throw away time, but quality time. Time for contemplation. Time for meditation. Time for reflection. Unhurried, uninterrupted time with God.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I...did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give my life...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 20:28 TLB</span><br>Chew on this: studying without serving leads to stagnating. Do you know that most of the Bible is set in a geographic area between two seas? The Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea. Galilee is full of life because it takes in water and also gives it out. But nothing lives in the Dead Sea because it has no outflow so its waters are smelly, salty and stagnant. The same is true in Christian living - why are so many churches dying? Because they have studied God's Word Sunday after Sunday but never done anything about it. Jesus said: &quot;I...did not come to be served, but to serve and to give my life...&quot; He summed up life in two words: serving and giving! It's not enough to keep learning, you must practice what you claim to believe. 

The last thing many of us need is another Bible study. We already know far more than we're putting into practice. What we need are serving experiences to exercise our spiritual muscles. Instead of saying: &quot;I'm looking for a church that meets my needs and blesses me&quot; you should be praying: &quot;Lord, show me a place where I can serve and be a blessing.&quot; Instead of expecting others to serve you, as you grow in Christ the focus of your life should shift to serving others. The mature follower of Jesus stops asking: &quot;Who's going to meet my needs?&quot; and starts asking: &quot;Whose needs can I meet?&quot; So, when are you going to start asking that question?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Night and day...he would cry out and cut himself with stones.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Mark 5:5</span><br>This poor guy was about as far from living the life God desires as you can get. He was totally in the grip of an evil spirit that warped his personality and behaviour. He was more comfortable among the dead than the living. Ordinary people were terrified of him. He hurt himself again and again. To us it's a picture of Satan's favourite pastime - destroying lives.  And he'll use all kinds of tricks, creating obsession and dependency on drugs, sex, alcohol, gluttony, overwork, the end result being zero peace. The Bible says: &quot;The evil spirit...wanders...looking for rest&quot; (Matthew 12:43 Phps) because the downside to godlessness is restlessness; nothing's ever enough. The guy in today's picture lived in seclusion. Remember, Satan's continually &quot;seeking someone to devour&quot; (1Peter 5:8) and his job's much easier when you don't have a support system. On the flip side good quality, healthy friendships get in the way of his evil plans. 

And there's more...when Jesus spoke, hell went into retreat and the tormenting demons submitted. Evil spirits may do their best to bring chaos to people's lives but they tremble at the name of Jesus!  This is a story with a happy ending - and that's what Jesus always does - his words bring order to chaos and light into darkness - He loves to break the grip of the strongest powers.  Just one word from the Master and this guy's restored to &quot;...his right mind...&quot; (Mark 5:15).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...Without faith it is impossible to please God...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Hebrews 11:6</span><br>If you want to put a smile on God's face, a really big grin, then what will you do about these words?: &quot;...without faith it is impossible to please God...&quot; 

You can't tell by looking at a person how much faith they have. There's not a common feature like a way of walking or talking, no special twinkle in the eye. So instead stretch your imagination for a minute and think about a bucket of water - you find out how much is inside when you bump it, right? Likewise, when circumstances bump you, you spill out what you're full of. Maybe you've just realised that your dream guy/girl is actually a nightmare! What's spilling out, faith for your future? Maybe you're moving house away from your friends - bump! What is splashing over the side, faith or fear?  

Bumps are going to happen and to expect otherwise is to set yourself up for disappointment. Count on it, you'll face lots of these tests. But God doesn't test your faith in order to know how much there is - He already knows. He tests it so that we can know what's in there - and when we see we're empty - yell out to Him for a fill up! That explains how you can often come out of a challenging situation with more faith than when you went into it. With that in mind, think of the hardest thing that's going on in your life right now, then ask yourself: &quot;Is this emptying or filling my faith?&quot;

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 5:10</span><br>Today we start with a science question - what turns worthless carbon into diamonds? Heat! Pressure! And that's what we're looking at today. In parts of the world there's a special tree called a Lodgepole Pine. Its cones can hang on for years before falling off. Even then they remain tightly closed. They only open when they're in contact with intense heat so whenever a forest fire rages and all the trees are being destroyed, the heat opens these peculiar pine cones. Then they just need to wait for a splash of rain and hey presto - new life!

Jesus said: &quot;Blessed are those who are persecuted.&quot; Why? Because like that pine cone there's potential in you that's only released when 'the heat is on'. Old Testament dude Job discovered this when God permitted Satan to test him. He lost everything, from his health to his seven sons. He had a major hard time but at the end of it all he could say to God: &quot;My ears had heard of you but now my eyes have seen you&quot; (Job 42.5). 

It's one thing to hear how God works based on somebody else's story, it's another to realise it for yourself when you're wondering: &quot;What did I do to deserve this?&quot; Or asking: &quot;If you're really there God, then why am I here?&quot; You need to know that God's promises are spot on. He says you're blessed. In the fire of standing for your faith you discover that when others abandon you, God remains faithful.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 5:9</span><br>The life and message of Jesus gave society a new way of living. Instead of 'an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth', Jesus talked about 'loving your enemies'. Weird. But what do you expect from the One the ancient prophets described would come into the world as the 'Prince of Peace'?  

You know, a lot of people were really astonished by the peaceful approach Jesus took.  When you read about all the battles and the violence in the Old Testament you could jump to conclusions and think: &quot;Isn't God just a bit angry and aggressive - all this war and bloodshed?&quot; Well, did you know that God gave this command to the Israelites regarding the nations neighbouring their land: &quot;When you march up to attack a city, make its people an offer of peace&quot; (Deuteronomy.20:10). God is always massively more interested in peace than conflict. 

The peace principle inspired St Francis of Assisi to write this: &quot;Lord make me an instrument of Your peace! Where there is hatred, let me sow love. Where there is injury, pardon. Where there is doubt, faith. Where there is despair, hope. Where there is darkness, light. Where there is sadness, joy. Divine Master grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console. To be understood, as to understand. To be loved, as to love. For in giving we receive. In pardoning we are pardoned. In dying we are born to eternal life.&quot;

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 5:8</span><br>Describing how as a child he accompanied his dad to the Texas oil fields, Max Lucado writes: &quot;The countryside was flat and predictable, that's why the refinery stood out like a science-fiction city. The function of that maze of machinery is defined by its name. A refinery takes whatever comes in and purifies it, so it's ready to go out. It does for petroleum what your heart should do for you.&quot;  Do you get it? Is your heart doing that job for you?

Listen: &quot;The good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart...&quot; (Luke 6:45). When you're criticized or ignored, do you bite back or bite your tongue? When you're on overload, do you blow your top or stay cool? When you hear gossip do you start drooling or start yawning? When somebody offends you, do you harbour a grudge or choose to forgive? The answers to all those questions depend on the state of your heart.

Jesus said: &quot;The pure in heart...will see God.&quot;  That sounds like a tough call, the Bible itself says that &quot;the heart is deceitful above all things&quot;.  Is Jesus setting us a standard we can't reach? No, he's just saying that God will reveal himself to those who have allowed him to clean them on the inside. We do the reverse by cleaning up the outside, but it doesn't work. You only change your life by working with God to develop a state-of-the art heart.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 5:7</span><br>Revenge only looks sweet, in reality it's bitter. That's why Paul writes: &quot;Never avenge yourselves. Leave that to God.&quot; (Rom.12:19 NLT).  In today's promise we find out a little bit more about life the Jesus way, so let's expand this a bit more: 

1) Mercy doesn't always have to be 'right'. Is whatever you're in a flap about so important that you must go to extremes to prove others wrong and yourself right? Why bother? You'll just end up on the merry-go-round of resentment and neither you nor whoever you're arguing with will be able to get off. Mercy breaks the cycle - it's a life-giving force &quot;...God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ...&quot; (Ephesians 2:4-5) 

2) Mercy dissolves anger. Like all roots, the root of someone's anger is hidden under the surface. That is, until they trap their finger or stub their toe! When you see really exaggerated anger it's likely that something deeper's at work. Ask God to show you a creative way to show mercy and dissolve that anger. 

3) Mercy heals. By forgiving your sins God's already shown you mercy - and you've seen its healing effect in your life. So share it out, especially to the people you're busy working out how you'll get even with. You need to set an example here - whole nations in our world are sick because of the cycle of revenge, will you start to bring healing today by showing mercy?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 5:6</span><br>When Jesus said: &quot;...those who hunger and thirst for righteousness...shall be filled,&quot; He was reminding us of the spiritual hunger only He can satisfy. But how can Jesus fill us if we're full of ourselves, or the things of the world? And what's 'righteousness' anyway? Is it being a 'do-gooder' or having a 'holier-than-thou' attitude! No, that's not righteousness, it's religious pride and Paul calls it 'rubbish' (Philippians 3:8). In fact he was much stronger than that when he wrote the book in Greek - he used a word which describes 'rubbish' of an especially smelly &amp; gross variety! 

On our own we could never be perfect enough to approach a Holy God. That's why He sent Jesus to die for us on the cross: &quot;...so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes&quot; (Romans 10:4). The moment you accept Jesus as your Saviour, you become righteous - perfect - in God's eyes. That's righteousness. Paul tells us more: &quot;...count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God...&quot; (Romans 6:11). He means this new condition of righteousness that we have before God should be made visible to the world in our daily living. 

Jesus said: &quot;...seek first His [God's] kingdom and His righteousness...&quot; (Matthew 6:33)  which you do by a) valuing God's opinion more than anybody else's (see Proverbs 3:5)  b) talking to Him before making important decisions (see Jeremiah 29:13)  c) replacing selfishness with the Fruits of the Spirit (see Galatians 5:19-23)  d) modelling your life on Jesus. (see 1Peter 2:21).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 5:5</span><br>'Meek' is not a word you hear everyday, is it? Firstly, meekness is not to be confused with weakness; because to be meek is more about what's going on inside a person than outside a person. A big greasy metalhead can still be meek by choosing to use his strength for the good of other people. 

Other people really might be weak on the outside but being meek on the inside means they cope better with life's ups and downs, the brash and the bold do. On the cross, Jesus could have called down legions of angels to save Him, but instead He chose to submit to His Father's will. That is our ultimate example of being meek - submitting each decision to God, taking direction from Him, trusting Him to provide, letting Him make whatever changes are necessary - all the stuff your old nature rebels against. 

In the Street Bible, Rob Lacey unpacks our third 'blessed' like this: &quot;I'll tell you who'll laugh the longest: the modest, gentle types, who don't go round grabbing - they'll get given the world.&quot; So, whether you're stepping out into a new opportunity or just faithfully doing what's given you to do, go about it with quiet confidence, knowing you're backed up by, and energised by the strength of God. You are meek and you can say: &quot;Lord, I gladly receive what You give and surrender what You demand. You not only know what's needed; You'll provide it. So I surrender everything I am, inside and out, to You.&quot;

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...So that we may receive...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Hebrews 4:16</span><br>Are you so used to ducking and diving and working for everything, that you struggle to receive what God wants you to have for free? God's always pouring out His blessing. Like great big empty jugs we must be totally available to what He pours in. Listen: &quot;Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace...&quot; (Hebrews 4:16). To get is to obtain by effort. To receive is simply to accept what's being offered. Jesus came to save us from struggling, not introduce us to a new way of struggling called Christianity. We need to realise that all of God's blessings are given because of grace, and received by faith, just like this Bible teacher realised: &quot;Every time I became frustrated it was because I was trying to do something in my own strength instead of putting my trust in God and receiving His help. I was always trying to 'do' something and leaving God out of the loop. I tried to change myself, my family, circumstances I didn't like. But God will never permit us to succeed without Him. If He did, we'd take all the credit. Finally I learned to pray for what I needed and allowed God to provide it His way, in His timing. When I did, I entered into His rest.&quot; 

Look, if you need to break the cycle of ducking and diving, first, realise your importance to God; and second, learn to count on His grace. He is more than willing to help, if we'll only let go of our independent attitudes.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 5:4</span><br>Grief is the price we pay for love! To love deeply is to grieve our losses deeply. Down to earth priest Henri Nouwen wrote: &quot;We wonder when grief hits hard, 'Why did this happen?' To remind us of the brevity and fragility of life? To deepen the faith of those who carry on?' It's hard to answer 'yes', when everything seems dark. The important thing to us at that moment is to be relieved of the pain. But when we move through adversity rather than avoid it, we greet it differently. We become willing to let it teach us. Like Joseph, we see how God can use it for some larger end. Ultimately, mourning means facing what wounds us, in the presence of the only One who can heal us!&quot;   

King David wrote: &quot;...Weeping may go on all night, but joy comes with the morning&quot; (Psalm 30:5. NLT) Morning always comes! Grief does ease with time. Your willingness to embrace the pain rather than escape it, guarantees that. It's not that you'll forget, it's that you'll remember it differently: with more gratitude and less grief.

Your tomorrows aren't in the hands of your teachers, your leaders, your friends or even your family. No, they're in God's hands, and He'll be there for you when every other support has gone. Hasn't He always protected, provided for, and comforted you? Times and seasons change, but not  'the God of all comfort' (2 Corinthians1:3). So be encouraged today. He's promised to be with you always, at your side in even your darkest hours.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...The whole nation...completed the crossing on dry ground.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Joshua 3:17</span><br>To get into the 'Promised Land' the children of Israel came face to face with a huge obstacle: the River Jordan. It was flood season so the river was swelled up and gushing - totally impassable. God said He'd make a way, but they'd never seen anything like that happen before because most of them weren't born when the Red Sea was parted for their parents &amp; grandparents. What would God do? Would he create a cosmic bridge across? Well, no, but He gave Joshua some strange orders: &quot;Command the priests to pick up the Ark [a special holy box they carried around] and go and stand in the river.&quot; Then He told the people to follow. Finally, He said to expect amazing things. 

You know nothing happened until they stepped into the water, which is a lesson for all of us: nothing will change until we step out in faith. There's a new relationship waiting to be formed, a new outreach to be launched, a breakthrough to be experienced - but nothing will happen until you move. This story shows it's not when we hear God, but when we do what he says that He will move to meet you, doors will open, the right people will show up and the resources will be provided. But you've got to take the first step! So next time you come up against a difficult situation, here are three things you must do: 1) talk to God about the situation  2) find out what godly leaders would do  3) decide to step out when God says &quot;go&quot;!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...I am your father and master, but where are the honour and respect I deserve?...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Malachi 1:6 NLT</span><br>When the Israelites asked God: &quot;How are we dissing you?&quot; He replied through a prophet dude called Malachi:

1) you cheat me out of your finances; by taking your prize animals to market for top price, but bringing blind, lame and half-dead ones to my altar (Malachi 1:7-8)

2) you cheat your fellow man - paying stingy low wages, making life impossible for single parents, and treating immigrants like trash (Malachi 3:5).

3) you cheat on your partner, divorce is rampant. Listen: &quot;You weep...because [the Lord] no longer pays attention...You ask, 'Why?'...because you have broken faith with her, though she is...the wife of your marriage covenant' (Malachi 2:13-14).

God basically told them: &quot;You rebel against me, then expect me not to be affected. Well, excuse me, I'm deeply affected. You're dissing me to my face; your sin breaks my heart; The barriers you put up have got to come down. We can make no real progress unless you're willing to do things my way, and that means everything.&quot;

The amazing thing is, God Himself wants to help break down those barriers. He wants to get things sorted.  Listen: &quot;Come now, let us argue this out,' says the LORD. 'No matter how deep the stain of your sins, I can remove it...&quot; (Isaiah 1:18 NLT). It's Good News - you can get back on track with God right now. All you have to do is pray: &quot;Father, forgive me. I'm doing a u-turn on sin and running back to You.&quot; The moment you pray that prayer, God will choose to forget all the times you've dissed Him and He'll lift you in His love again.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>You shall not covet...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Exodus 20:17</span><br>What does 'covet' mean? Here's a four-part definition: 

1) Wanting the wrong things. Like wanting power without any willingness to serve. Like wanting control so that 'I' can be at the centre. Like wanting money without generosity. Like wanting to steal the attention from others. 

2) Wanting things for the wrong reasons. Lots of stuff we chase after in life is good but our reason for wanting it is bad. Like wanting to make an impact - that's a good thing; but you have to want it for the right reasons. If you want it for your own ego, for personal recognition or to put others down - that's coveting. 

3) Wanting things at the wrong time.  A young couple says: &quot;We love Christ and each other. We've committed ourselves to a lifetime together; we're already engaged and we're getting married in three months so why wait to have sex?&quot; They want the right thing for the right reason, but they want it at the wrong time - that's coveting. 

4) Wanting too much. How much is enough? We don't know so we answer: &quot;More!&quot; Coveting is wanting more than is required to provide for your needs and your destiny. Get this: more of anything other than God, will never satisfy the longing He's placed within you. Only when you realise that and bring your life's choices into line with it, will you discover a truly buzzing life.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 5:3</span><br>Right - we're going to take the next week or so looking at what it means to be 'blessed' from Jesus' own words. First:  &quot;Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.&quot; We think of being poor as having very little. What did He mean? 

You might have heard of John B Rockefeller, a Christian multi-millionaire. He once said: &quot;I've made many millions but they brought me no real happiness. I'd barter them all for the days I sat on an office stool in Cleveland and counted myself rich on $3 a week.&quot;  Railroad king W H Vanderbilt said: &quot;The care of $200 million is too great a load for any brain or back to bear. It's enough to kill anyone. There's no pleasure left in it.&quot;  $200 million was a lot in the 1800s!  Automobile king Henry Ford said: &quot;Work is my only pleasure. It keeps me alive and makes life worth living. I was happier doing a mechanic's job.&quot; 

So when Jesus says: &quot;...it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom...&quot; (Matthew 19:24 NCV), does that mean He's against us being successful? No, He's just saying: &quot;Be careful how you order your priorities. Don't let your possessions obscure your relationship with Me, or keep you from fulfilling the destiny I put you on this earth for.&quot;

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Let's just go aheda and be what we were made to be...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Romans 12:6 TM</span><br>God deserves your best. He expects you to make the most of what He's given you instead of stressing about what you don't have, or being jealous of the other people's abilities. When you attempt to be what you're not, it's like forcing a square peg into a round hole - not only does it require a bigger hammer, it's also a total waste of time, talent and energy.

The book of Romans takes time to point this out: &quot;...It's important that you not misinterpret yourselves...&quot; (Romans 12:3 TM). So, involve others, tell them you're searching for the truth, not fishing for compliments. Ask them: &quot;If we were on a desert island together, what is the one thing about me that would: a)Make you really happy  b) Drive you round the bend!&quot; 

By the time you've asked three or four people you'll probably have a really good idea what you have to offer the world - and what you should try to avoid!  It's really common for people to be totally oblivious not only to their faults but also to the destiny that God is clearly leading them towards. 

In the Bible Gideon needed an angel to point it out to him: &quot;...The LORD is with you, mighty warrior...&quot; (Judges 6.12).  Like many of us, he wasn't really convinced about it at the time! And if you still haven't got a clue what God has gifted you to do - just start where you are. You discover your strengths by being a player in life not by being a spectator. You'll never know what you're good at until you try!

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Where there is no vision...[we] perish...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 29:18 KJV</span><br>We live in the 'free' world where every person has the right to dream his or her own dreams about the future. But at the cross, all of us who have given our lives to Jesus have surrendered that right. Listen: &quot;..You do not belong to yourself, for God bought you at a high price...&quot; (1Corinthians 6:19-20 NLT).   &quot;How can I not belong to me? What does that mean?&quot; It means listening to His rhythm for your life and refusing to march to the beat of any other drum. 

With that in mind, consider these words: &quot;For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do&quot; (Ephesians 2:10 ). Your life's been pre-planned. You can't just take your talents, experiences, opportunities and education and run off in any direction you please. No, you lost that 'right' at the cross. Anyway why would you think of doing your own thing? What could possibly be more fulfiling than God's destiny for your life? And what could be more tragic than missing out on it? 

Maybe up until now your vision has had you at the centre, but it's the kind of vision that finds you at the end of life wondering what you could've done, and should've done, with your brief stay on this planet. History proves that there's not enough meaning in personal accomplishments to satisfy the soul. The life you're trying to live has an eternal dimension that only Christ can satisfy. That's why it's such a big deal for you to pray: &quot;Lord, help me to see and to reach Your vision for my life.&quot;

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...I have come that they may have life...to the full.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>John 10:10 NIV</span><br>What's the most amazing life possible? Jesus taught a lesson: 'Unless a grain of wheat is buried in the ground, dead to the world, it is never anymore than a grain of wheat. But if it is buried, it sprouts and reproduces itself many times over. In the same way, anyone who holds on to life just as it is destroys that life. But if you let it go, reckless in your love, you will have it forever, real and eternal,' (John 12:24-25 TM). 

In the Old Testament God proved His miracle power to the Israelites by doing a miracle with Aaron's staff - a piece of dead wood!  Overnight it &quot;...not only sprouted but had budded, blossomed and produced almonds&quot; (Numbers17.8).

The Apostle Paul knew that dying to his own desires was crucial to a victorious Christian life and it became the cry of his heart. Listen: &quot; I gave up all that inferior stuff so I could know Christ personally, experience His resurrection power, be a partner in his sufferings, and go all the way with Him...&quot; (Philippians 3:10 TM). 

 What they're saying is that the most amazing life comes by resurrection. It involves laying down: a) Your independence b) Your ambitions c) Your pride. When these things are dead and buried the new life can start to spring up - just like a plant bursting out of its seed.  It's the No 1 way God shows that He's God.

<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...Because you complained against me...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Numbers 14:29 NLT</span><br>We've established that complaining is a pretty pointless pastime that doesn't do anyone any good. But there's a particular kind of complaining that affects God directly and personally - complaining against Him.  Suggesting that our problem is His fault. 

For some of us, the complaint is about a health situation, either our own or someone close to us. For others it's a family situation, either something current or something that happened years ago, for which we shove the responsibility over to God quite unfairly. Some of us made poor decisions and our exams fell apart; now we struggle with the consequences of our choices, a lack of options for our future. Each of us has stuff in our lives that we really shouldn't be complaining to God about. OK, that stuff means that some days are really tough, but understand this - you reject the grace God gives to get you through it, when you complain against Him. The strength and joy needed to be a winner is available to you, but by choosing to complain by clinging to the idol of a perfect life, you reject it.

&quot;So what do I do?&quot; Ask yourself two questions: a) Have I been complaining against God? b) Am I willing to say sorry to God? If you're serious about putting this wilderness attitude behind you, think about why you're in the wilderness to begin with. If God reveals complaining as a problem in your life, be real about it - then turn from it! Otherwise, expect more wilderness ahead.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Don</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>t get worked up...God will help you deal with what</span><br>Fear is just 'a grown-up' version of worry! If you let worry in, fear won't be far behind. Stop and have a bit of a rewind: of all the things you worried about last year, or even last month, how many became realities? And how many things did you change by worrying? And did your worrying make your life better or worse? Think about this - what does your worrying say to those who know you're a follower of Christ? (don't think about it too long - you might start worrying about it!) 

So, you wanna deal with those worries - you'll only stop worrying about tomorrow, when you learn to place it in the hands of the One who holds all our tomorrows. Listen: &quot;Commit everything you do to the LORD. Trust him, and he will help you&quot; (Psalm 37:5 NLT). By giving each day to the Lord before it arrives you're trusting Him to go before you and work things out in your favour. It's amazing what you accomplish when you live trusting God a day at a time, when instead of worrying, you attack your anxieties with the promises of God. 

Go ahead, bring your worries into His presence and watch them shrivel: &quot;...It's wonderful what happens when Christ displaces worry at the center of your life&quot; (Philippians 4:7 TM). Why don't you just close your eyes right now, let go of whatever is stressing you out and let God fill you with fresh confidence.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Where there is no vision...[we] perish...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 29:18 KJV</span><br>Vision weaves four essential things into our daily living: 

1) Passion. A clear, focused vision, allows you to experience in advance the emotions associated with the future you see. These emotions strengthen your desire to reach the vision. How? By providing a sneak preview of things to come. 

2) Motivation. Vision is the drive to complete anything. All the hours of study for an exam, training in the cold before a big game, strutting your stuff in front of the mirror until you can make that move. You did it. Why? Because of what could be a different future, a dream fulfiled. 

3) Decisions. Vision is like a traffic light. It simplifies the decision-making process. Anything that moves us closer to our vision gets a green light, stuff we're not sure about gets amber.  Anything that would lead away from the vision gets a big fat red light!  Without vision you'll be bumping into things all day long because people without clear vision are easily distracted. with a tendency to drift from one side of the road to the other. They've no spiritual or relational grip on the steering wheel so they never find the way to their dreams. 

4) Purpose. Vision gives you a reason to get out of bed in the morning. If you don't show up, something important won't happen. Suddenly your life matters! It matters a lot! Without you, what could be - won't be. So, protect your vision!

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...You should carry this project through to completion...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Corinthians 8:11 NLT</span><br>In the Olympic games the triathlon is composed of three events: swimming, bike riding and running. Medals are given for completing all three stages, not just one or two. And the same is true in your Christian life. You need to develop three vitally important habits: 

1) Talk stuff  through! A superb way to get to grips with any scriptural principle is to discuss it with others. The Bible says: &quot;As iron sharpens iron, so people can improve each other.&quot; (Proverbs 27:17 NCV).  As you interact with others discussing real life examples, giving and receiving feedback, you begin to grasp God's principles. 

2) Get out and about! Lots of Christians settle into a comfy little world which just involves a church building and a few meetings which happen at the same time on the same day, week in and week out. Hello? Remember what Jesus said: &quot;...Go into all the world...&quot; (Mark 16.15). 

3) Give yourself regular checkups! For good physical health you need regular checkups of blood pressure, temperature, weight and so on. For good spiritual health you need to regularly check vital areas such as prayer, Bible reading, friendships, worship, and helping others.

<title><![CDATA[Quit the complaining (1)]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...Because you complained against me...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Numbers 14:29 NLT</span><br>Listen to this, it's what God said to the nation of Israel during their extended hike through the desert after dramatically being rescued from slavery in Egypt: &quot;Because you complained against me, none of you...will enter the land I swore to give to you&quot; (Numbers 14:29 NLT). If that doesn't convince you of how God feels about complaining, then what will?

&quot;But who am I really hurting when I complain?&quot; 

1) Yourself. Complaining leads to anger, bitterness and even depression. God loves you. He doesn't want you hurting yourself. 

2) God. Complaining questions God's goodness. It basically says: 'God, you blew it! You had a chance to meet my demands but you chose not to.' 

3) The rest of us! Nobody enjoys being around a member of the Cold Water Bucket Brigade. Your stinking thinking affects everyone else. Have you ever wondered why complaining is so popular, yet it changes nothing? Because it satisfies our selfish nature!

But there's good news. Complaining doesn't have to be a dead end street. You can find a way out by developing a new way of thinking about things, a new way of approaching life. So, if you've become a bit of a complainer, then by God's grace you can become a thanks-giver! Everyday you choose your attitude, so why not choose a better one! If you're serious about changing, pray today: &quot;Lord, I want to enter the full life you've promised me and I know I'm not going to get there by complaining - please help me get to the Promised Land.&quot;

<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>They tie up heavy loads and put them on men's shoulders...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 23:4</span><br>Are you ever guilty of demanding perfection in others, when your own perfection is still a long way off? Well then, stop expecting more out of people than they're able to give! That sort of pressure causes relationships to cave in.

We all need the freedom to be who we are especially in that funny stage of being no longer a child but not quite an adult! That doesn't mean we don't need or want to change, but we're more likely to try to change for people who are willing to accept us 'warts &amp; all', than for those who expect us to live by some unreal perfect standards. So have a think about the people in your life, your parents, brothers &amp; sisters, friends.  Are you expecting them to be perfect when you know inside that just like you - they're not! Even if you think you're hiding your disapproval, they might still feel it - your voice and body language will give you away. Instead of giving them a hard time, pray for them, God will work.  Prayer is the great change agent, not pressure! Who do you need to take the pressure off today?  Many of those who irritate us are simply being themselves; their personality just doesn't mesh with ours.  And here's a radical thought - maybe we want others to change when actually we need to change! For that change to be lasting it must come from the inside out, and only God can do it.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Where there is no vision...[we] perish...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 29:18 KJV</span><br>Everybody ends up somewhere. A few end up somewhere on purpose; they're the ones with vision. A clear vision and a bit of a crazy streak to go for it dramatically increases your chances of coming to the end of your life, looking back with satisfaction and thinking, &quot;I succeeded; I finished well. My life counted; I made a difference.&quot; But without a clear vision, you could reach that rocking chair and wonder if your life really mattered at all. 

Vision gives meaning to otherwise meaningless details. Let's face it, much of what we do each day doesn't appear to matter a lot unless we see how it fits into the big picture. It's the difference between filling bags with sand or building a defence to save the town - you know, like you see on the news when there's a really high tide or when a river is about to burst its banks. There's nothing glamorous about filling bags with sand, but saving the town from a flood is something else altogether. Building that defence gives meaning to the drudgery of filling bags with sand. It's the same with vision. Do the routines of your life feel like shovelling sand? Look at how those same routines lead step by step to your God-given destiny and suddenly everything looks different. Vision brings your world into focus. It brings order to chaos. It enables you to see everything differently. Take some time today to think about the big vision for your life.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...Well informed, quick to understand and qualified to serve...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Daniel 1:3-4</span><br>Even though the young Daniel was living as a prisoner in a foreign land he was &quot;well informed, quick to understand, and qualified to serve&quot; so he rose to the top spot, right next to the King. If you want to excel, take a leaf out of his book. 

A famous business man called Jack Welsh, says: &quot;The only way you're going to stand out is to grasp this simple principle: when your boss asks you a question, he already knows the answer he's looking for. He just wants you to confirm that what he believes is true. Most people do just that. But here's the difference. You must understand that the question is only the beginning...you must sink your thoughts into not only answering the question, but going above and beyond it. That means presenting him with three or four other ideas that he'd probably not considered. Your goal should be to add value to the idea by exceeding expectations. This is true not only with questions, but assignments, initiatives, and everything else ever given to you to do. If you understand that the question is only the beginning, you'll get out of the pile fast, because 99% of all employees stay in the pile because they don't think.&quot;  

Work is a massive part of everyone's life, even Jesus spent more of his life working than he did in his ministry. So in the world of work, make sure you follow this advice and really stand out.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>When I am afraid, I will put my confidence in you.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 56:3 TLB</span><br>Ever find yourself wishing you could be one of those brave hearts who 'grab life by the horns'? Well, here's a newsflash! Many of those people you think are in a completely different league to you feel the same fear you do each time you tackle something new. What's the difference? They trust God and refuse to let it stop them! 

In his book Lucas on Life 2, Jeff Lucas remembers an incident that shook him out of his comfort zone - literally: &quot;... the terrified lady passenger screamed and began eyeing the seat in front of her as a potential snack...We carried on flying. And then we apparently skimmed over the top of Mount Everest - or major turbulence according to Nigel up front. That was it. The poor lady screamed, reached out and grabbed my hand, and wouldn't let go. We sat there for a few seconds, she and I, total strangers, hand in hand now... 'Excuse me madam, I noticed that you don't like flying. Well, my friend and I are both Christians, would you like us to pray for you?'  'Pray? Oh, that would be lovely. Please do  I'm so grateful.' I was stunned. I had anticipated a negative response from her. How often do we project our fears of rejection on to those who have not heard the good news yet? We anticipate a frosty negative response and so fearful of the embarrassment that might result we clam up, walk away, and miss the opportunity for kindness.&quot;

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>No matter what happens, always be thankful...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Thessalonians 5:18 NLT</span><br>Paul was in prison when he wrote: &quot;no matter what happens always be thankful...&quot; He understood that thanks is a life-changing, happiness-attracting choice you make each day. Being thankful lifts you up to mountain-top high altitude living. You could say gratitude is the attitude that sets the altitude for living. Unfortunately, there's a kind of swampy low-altitude life that too many of us settle for. It's a hopeless, foggy, damp, depressing, ungrateful, complaining, negative sort of living! Sadly, lots of people live there - but don't let it be you. Go for life up where the air is clean, the sun is shining and the future is as bright as the promises of God. This life rises up and refuses to focus on the negative. If you've ever been up there, you know it's where you want to spend each day. 

Matthew Henry, the famous Bible boffin, lived that way. More than 250 years ago he wrote these words in his diary after he was robbed of all the money he had in the world: &quot;First, let me be thankful because I was never robbed before. Second, because although they took my purse, they did not take my life. Third, that although they took my all, it was not much. Fourth, because it was I who was robbed, not I that did the robbing.&quot;  What a winning attitude! Since thankfulness is a choice, answer this question: &quot;Am I a thankful person?&quot; If you don't like the answer - do something about it!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Be strong and let us fight bravely for our people and the cities...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Samuel 10:12</span><br>Do you ever feel like your best efforts have been flushed down the bog?  Well, if you have, you're in good company! In 1894 a 16 year old boy in Harrow, found this note from his speech teacher attached to his report card: &quot;Hopeless...seems incapable of progress.&quot; That boy's name was Winston Churchill who went on to lead the nation in victory against the Nazi's! In 1905 the University of Bern rejected an essay by a young PhD student, calling it 'fanciful and irrelevant'. The name of that physics student was Albert Einstein and he totally changed the way we think about our universe! 

There's a message here for you! Even when other people offer you no hope or encouragement, refuse to quit! Listen to the words of Joab, who led King David's army: &quot;Be strong and let us fight bravely for our people and the cities...&quot; (2 Samuel 10:12). Joab knew that as long as you stayed on the battlefield God can give you victory. But if you quit, what more can He do for you?

Like Joab, never give up when you are fighting for a godly cause like freedom for people and peace in our cities! Believe that everything will work together for good if you just hang in there. Don't let the opposition discourage you; God's bigger than all of them! Refuse to let anybody intimidate you, fight and overcome every limitation! Remember, every winner - without exception - faces discouragement but in the final outcome it's forgotten.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...We are now members of God's own family...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Peter 1:3 TLB</span><br>God wanted a family, so He made you to be part of it. Our families here on earth are wonderful but fragile, often strained by distance, challenged by illness, broken by divorce, or struggling to cope with death. On the other hand our spiritual family will last throughout eternity. That family is no less real and actually more permanent than any of our blood relationships.  The moment we were born into God's family we were given some incredible advantages: the family name, the family likeness, family privileges, and the family inheritance. Paul writes: &quot;...I want you to realise what a rich and glorious inheritance He has given His people&quot; (Ephesians 1:18 NLT). What exactly does that inheritance include?

First: we get to live with God forever (1Thessalonians 5:10). Second: we'll be completely changed to be like Christ (1John 3:2). Third: we'll be free from all pain, death, and suffering (Revelation 21:4). Fourth: we'll be rewarded and assigned positions of honour and service in the greatest of all worlds (Luke 6.23). What an inheritance! You're so much better off than you realise. What's waiting for you beyond this life is priceless, pure, permanent, and protected. Nobody can tax it from you. It can't be stolen or destroyed and its value will never reduce. Your eternal inheritance is something you can feel free to get excited about! Anytime you feel worthless, unloved, or insecure, stop and remind yourself: &quot;I'm a member of God's family.&quot;

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...Let's untie the mess that weighs us down, and let's run!!</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Hebrews 12:1 STREET</span><br>Do you want the fun of being in the race, or are you running to win?  Did you know that Roman athletes stripped down to their pants to make sure nothing prevented them from running their fastest! How about you? To move forward as quickly as God intended you to, you'll have to stop doing certain things, even enjoyable things, and begin doing other things that will help you fulfil your destiny.

That will probably mean saying 'no' to well-intentioned people who try to involve you in things that take your time but get you nowhere.  It'll also mean dealing with what the Bible describes as &quot;...sin that so easily entangles...&quot; (Hebrews.12.1). You can't be soft on sin...FULL STOP! You don't need to discuss it, blame anyone else, make excuses or feel sorry for yourself - you just need to ask for His forgiveness and get that thing out of your life.

Listen: &quot;All athletes practice strict self-control. They do it to win a prize that will fade away, but we do it for an eternal prize&quot; (1Corinthians 9:25 NLT). Who gets the prize? Those who practice self-control. The Apostle Paul knew he couldn't win the race without first bringing his body, mind and emotions under the control of God's Spirit. The same goes for you. You can't expect somebody else to run the race for you; you must listen to God's Spirit for yourself and get moving.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...Speak, Lord, for your servant is listening...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Samuel 3:9</span><br>Why is it important to recognise the Holy Spirit's voice in your life? 

 1)  Because your eternal destiny is determined by it! If you're a Christian, no doubt you can remember that feeling which first drew you to God, the thoughts that added up until you realised Jesus is your Saviour. Well, even after you become a Christian, God still keeps talking because he want to make sure you make the most of your new life with Him. 

2)  Because your growth as a Christian depends on it! Listen: &quot;...When he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all truth...&quot; (John 16:13). As believers we are responsible to read God's entire Word. But the Bible's a big book, we can't swallow it all at once. So, as we read it, God feeds us His truth, one bite-sized piece at a time. The Holy Spirit has an amazing way of pointing out different truths at different stages of your growth. Isn't that cool?

3) Because your mission in life is shaped by it!  In word4U2day we talk loads about how God has a plan for our lives - but how likely is it that you're gonna walk into Blockbuster and find there amongst the DVDs J Bloggs: the Plan for your Life -Produced and Directed by God!  Yeah right...?  Through his Holy Spirit, God leads us step by step - encourage this person, be generous to that person, share your story with that person.  If you knew right now what God has in store for you it would blow your mind.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Pray for the happiness of those who curse you...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Luke 6.28 NLT</span><br>Is there someone you really resent? Maybe they're in your life to teach you something!

Melody Beattie remembers somebody she thought was 'in her way': &quot;Years ago I felt I was meant to work at the Stillwater Gazette, but when a job opened up they hired Abigail. I'd always been taught to pray for those you resent, so I prayed for her. Sometimes three to four times a day - that's how much I disliked her! Eventually I landed a job at the Gazette, but not the one I wanted. Abigail had that - plus all the best assignments! So I kept praying, 'God bless Abigail' it's all I knew to do. Then after watching her I realised she was quick, efficient, a good interviewer, so I began to push myself, thinking, 'if she can do it, so can I!' Abigail was actually inspiring me! Eventually I stopped resenting her and we became friends. Soon afterwards I got an offer from a publisher to write a book and when it became a best-seller, I was glad I hadn't got Abigail's job or I'd never have had the time to write my book!&quot; 

God says: &quot;Pray for the happiness of those who curse you.&quot; Certain people who might seem to be the opposite of a blessing could turn out to be a blessing after all, if you will pray for them. They could actually teach you things you need to learn. So stop resenting them, start praying for them, then sit back and watch what happens!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...Jesus...laid down His life for us...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 John 3:16</span><br>If you've been hanging around church long enough you'll have recognised that there are certain stories that 'do the rounds' - sort of Christian legends! One of them which is often used by preachers at outreach events involves a bloke driving a coach-load of passengers, have you heard it? 

He's driving along and begins to descend a hill - suddenly he realises that the brakes have failed. The coach is beginning to get difficult to control and what's worse is there is a sharp bend coming up, with a cliff on the other side - they're all doomed! He has to think fast and do something, so he yanks the steering wheel and pulls the coach off the road, crashing through a fence into a garden. It's then that there's a scream and a thud. A little boy was playing in the garden and the coach has run him over. The driver is weeping uncontrollably. One of the breathless passengers sensitively puts a hand on his shoulder and says: &quot;Thank you for saving our lives.&quot; The driver replies: &quot;You don't understand, that boy was my son.&quot;

One of the signs of your growing up as a Christian is when you can find the truth in stories like that - and another is being able to see the story's limitations too. We see from the Bible that God (the coach driver) has never actually been out of control and that Jesus (the little boy) wasn't just in the wrong place at the wrong time. God the Father sent Jesus to this world, and He willingly came, knowing that He would have to die to save us. And that really is a true story!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...Stay here still a while, so that I may give you a message from God.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Samuel 9:27</span><br>The classic old sci-fi film Bladerunner contains a famous line: &quot;The candle that burns twice as bright burns half as long.&quot;  And there is actually a fair bit of truth in that. Living life at an intense pace can be exciting and fulfiling but watch out if it leads to the quality of your time with God suffering. What if God just wants to walk with you today? Now don't get the idea that God's some old codger and you need to slow down to let Him catch up - God can create breathtaking accelerations in our lives at times, but maybe today He wants to draw your attention to something you wouldn't notice if you were going too fast. Perhaps He has a message for you.

Today will you say: &quot;Time out! I'm not taking shortcuts anymore. I refuse to put my spiritual life on autopilot, no more mouthing meaningless prayers and skimming through a Bible I don't live by. Today is going to be different; I'm going to walk with God.&quot; That declaration means prioritising your time, saying no to certain things, running the risk of being misunderstood by other people. But it's the right way to find peace with God and get into a place where you can hear what He's saying to you. And you know what? The light God gives is the brightest flame, and it never stops burning.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...Speak, Lord, for your servant is listening...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Samuel 3:9</span><br>Some of us don't feel safe opening ourselves to God's voice. Why? Because we know people who claim to be doing this, but their approach scares us. These people seem to have removed their brains entirely and now they expect God to choose their socks in the morning and what flavour crisps they should eat at lunchtime. They claim to experience a vision every day, a miracle every week. In reaction to this, some of us run in the opposite direction. To us, the prods from the Holy Spirit seem to go against human nature and sensible thought. We're used to steering our own ship, we're nervous about letting Him lead. We wish the arrangement was a bit clearer; it seems too spooky and mysterious. It unnerves us. So when we sense the Spirit's leading we analyse it, we resist it, we conclude it isn't logical, therefore we don't do it. What a waste! 

Some of us want to obey the Spirit, but we're not sure we know when He's really speaking. &quot;Am I hearing my own desires or God's voice?&quot; Not wanting to go off the deep end, we avoid the water altogether. All these reactions are really common and very understandable.  But Paul does write: &quot;Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit&quot; (Galatians 5:25). When you fail to open yourself to God's Spirit and live by His word  your Christian life is wasted, boring, and worst of all - unfruitful. Don't let that happen to you!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...Love your enemies. Do good to those who hate you.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Luke 6.27 NLT</span><br>The famous old American President Abraham Lincoln had a political enemy called Edward Stanton. In one speech Stanton called Lincoln a &quot;low, cunning clown.&quot; In another he said: &quot;It's ridiculous to go to Africa to see a gorilla when you can find one just as easily in Springfield, Illinois.&quot; Yet Lincoln never responded. Why? 

Because Jesus' advice &quot;love your enemies&quot; packs a different kind of punch. This kind of love is not just being a doormat - It's not just standing across the room saying: &quot;That person drives me bananas so I'm going to steer clear of them.&quot; No, it's crossing the room and finding a way to let them know you play by different rules, you pack a punch called Love. 

Lincoln did that. When he was elected President and needed a Secretary of War, guess who he chose? Edward Stanton. When friends asked why, Lincoln said: &quot;Because he's the best man for the job.&quot; Years later at Lincoln's funeral, Edward Stanton looked into the coffin and said through his tears: &quot;There lies the greatest ruler of men the world has ever seen.&quot; His bitterness had been broken by Lincoln's long-suffering, non-reacting spirit. 

Is someone injuring you? Have they chosen a place of opposition in your life? How are you reacting? Are you trying to give as good as you get? Try doing it the Jesus way - forgive them, move toward them with grace and begin to love them. Jesus has great rewards for those who live like that.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>But they soon forgot what He had done...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 106:13</span><br>Do you think God ever feels 'used' by His people when they act like students who only phone home when the money runs low? There's a sad theme running through the Old Testament; God blesses His people, then they forget Him. He blesses them again and they forget Him again. Listen: &quot;...He saved them for his name's sake...He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up...He saved them from the hand of the foe...Then they believed his promises and sang his praise. But they soon forgot what he had done and did not wait for his counsel&quot; (Psalm 106:8-13). 

Why do we keep forgetting God? One young man said: &quot;I was partying pretty heavily and allowed my life to get out of control.&quot; Another lady said: &quot;Things got really busy at work. Greed got its hooks into me and making money became the driving force in my life.&quot; A student said: &quot;I got totally self absorbed. Before I knew it, I became the centre of my own universe and God got pushed off the side.&quot; 

>From person to person the details differ, but the effect is the same - an ever-widening gap in our relationship with God. The wider the gap the less likely we are to pray, and the less we pray the wider the gap becomes. So how can you keep this from happening to you? By turning to Jesus every single day and letting Him know that nothing in your world is more valuable than Him.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...Speak, Lord, for your servant is listening...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Samuel 3:9</span><br>Too many of us think of prayer as just talking to God, not really stopping to wonder if He might want to talk to us. By our actions you'd think that after his resurrection Jesus packed up and went back to heaven and hasn't been heard from since. But the New Testament is full of accounts of God speaking to people years after Jesus had returned to heaven. If the essence of Christianity is a personal relationship with God, then God must still speak today. But you can't build a relationship on one-way speeches; you need regular, intimate contact between two people, who both speak and both listen.

So how does God speak to us? a) Through the Bible; a familiar verse jumps off the page and takes on new meaning. b) Through people; but you can't be so preoccupied, or selective, that you don't recognise them. c) Through His Spirit; the Holy Spirit leads us, encourages us, comforts us, and stretches us and even gives us a telling off when we need it!

Hearing God speak to us through His Spirit is not only normal, it's essential. Paul wrote: &quot;...You are controlled by the Spirit if you have the Spirit of God living in you...&quot; (Romans 8:9 NLT). Once you turn your life over to Jesus, it can't be business as usual. Life no longer consists only of what can be seen, felt or figured out. It includes walking by faith! Trusting God! Constantly listening for His voice and being prodded by His Spirit!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Patient endurance is what you need now...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Hebrews 10:36 NLT</span><br>Today you might get yourself in a flap and make everybody else around you miserable, but guess what...God will still move at His own pace. Patience isn't just the ability to wait, it's the ability to keep a good attitude while you're doing it. God knows the exact time for everything.  Listen: &quot;...at the proper time we will reap a harvest...&quot; (Galatians 6:9). 'The proper time' is God's time, not ours. We're in a hurry, He isn't. He takes the time to do things right. We may not know what He's doing but He does, and that's basically all we need to know. 

God's schedule is His own business. He's never late but He isn't early either. He takes every opportunity to develop patience in us. In fact patience isn't the only thing that gets developed as we practice chilling out until Gods 'proper time'.  A time of waiting is so often a time when all sorts of loose ends in our character can be tied down, for instance maybe you've developed a genuine compassion for the poor and needy but still haven't learned to let go of the pride that prevents you reaching out to them. You might find that God gently but firmly blocks your progress in that area until the other catches up. It's hard to appreciate any of this while it's happening, but later on we realise what an awful mess we'd have made if things had been done on our timetable instead of God's.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...Though it cost all you have, get understanding.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 4:7</span><br>In his book Developing the Leader Within You, John Maxwell writes: 'Sixteen hundred people belong to the Flat Earth Society of America. Their President, Charles K Johnson, says he's been a flat-earther all his life. He says: 'When I saw the globe in grade school I didn't accept it then and I don't accept it now.' He's like the 100 year-old man in Maine who was interviewed by a Bangor Daily News reporter. 'I'll bet you've seen a lot of changes in your lifetime?' the reporter said. 'Yep,' said the old geezer, 'And I've been against every one of them'.''

To become successful, you must remain open to new ideas. It's OK to get old as long as you don't think old. Galileo proved the earth revolved around the sun. Did that make the folks around him happy? No, they threw him in prison for challenging their ignorance and kept right on believing as they did. But change is one of the few things in life that is absolutely certain. You've probably been through some difficult changes already, some new ideas you've had to take on board and adjust to, so don't expect it to be easy for others. 

New ideas need lots of exposure. First exposure - &quot;I reject it because it conflicts with my pre-conceived ideas.&quot; Second exposure - &quot;Well, I understand it, but I can't accept it.&quot; Third exposure - &quot;I agree, but I've got reservations.&quot; Fourth exposure - &quot;That idea pretty well expresses the way I feel about it myself.&quot; Fifth exposure - &quot;I used that idea today. It's terrific!&quot; Sixth exposure - &quot;I shared that idea with somebody yesterday and they loved it.&quot;  Stay open to new ideas - your future depends on it!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>You shall not covet...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Exodus 20:17</span><br>The final problem with coveting that we're going to look at is the whole thing of wanting to have our cake - and eat it too! Now that's a bit of a strange saying anyway isn't it, coz what's the point of having a cake if you're not gonna eat it, right? Well, the problem here is not that we don't want God - it's that we want God and...the perfect partner, the impressive career, the house by the lake, the flash car or whatever catches your fancy next! 

What are you craving? Putting your life on hold for? Continually begging God for? Nothing is essential but God. 'Things' were never designed to take His place! When we covet something and make it essential - then beg God to give it to us - we're asking Him to replace Himself with something we consider more important. When we do this, God may allow us what we ask for, along with the consequences. And they're not pretty! You don't need the baggage of a pile of debt, poor health, a broken heart, a tormented conscience, and the pain of having missed God's will. How do you get to that settled place where the beat of your heart is &quot;God, I just want you&quot;?  You get there by walking in the steps of Jesus, the true King of all creation, you follow his example of giving himself away for the broken, the poor, the lonely and the rejected.  You become part of the fellowship of the self-less, where every part of your life is available for God to fill.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>You shall not covet...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Exodus 20:17</span><br>Do you ever feel like two different people are living in your body! Like two cars approaching a junction at the same time, your old self and your new self are constantly on a collision course. The road they are travelling on is called 'desire', the crash seems unavoidable. Ever go to the fridge when you weren't hungry but weren't really satisfied either, sort of looking for something to grab you? Well fridges aren't particularly dangerous,  but some things in life are - have you opened a door looking for something to make you happier than you are at this particular moment? Do you covet something, imagining how attractive and accessible it is? A few Bacardi Breezers?  &quot;I can handle just two, or three.&quot;  A quick puff on that weed?  &quot;It's not really illegal anymore, right?&quot;  A one-night stand?  &quot;Nobody will ever know...&quot;  Coveting maximizes the desire and pretends there is no danger. 

Understand this: it's impossible to open the door to a desire for any length of time without inventing a way to get what you want. Like starting the countdown on the space shuttle, it's just a matter of time until lift off. What's the answer? Shut the door! Change your focus! Listen: &quot;...those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit&quot; (Romans 8:5 NKJV).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...You shaped me first inside, then out...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 139:13 TM</span><br>Do you realise how unique you are? DNA molecules can unite in an almost infinite number of ways. The number is 10, with 2,400,000,000 zeros. That number is how likely it is that you'll find somebody exactly like you. That's enough to fill 40,000 copies of word4U2day! To put this in perspective, all the particles in the universe are probably less than 10 with 76 zeros behind it - far less than the possibilities of your DNA! Your uniqueness is a scientific fact. When God made you He broke the mould. There's never been, and never will be, anybody exactly like you.

So, why did God make each of us so unique? Because He loves variety! Just look around - introverts and extroverts, thinkers and feelers, team players and individuals, those who love routine and those who love variety. There's no right or wrong temperament for serving in God's kingdom; we need all kinds of personalities to balance us, give us flavour, and get the job done!

Your personality will affect how and where you serve God best. When we're forced to serve in a way that's out of character for us it creates tension, requires extra effort, and usually produces poor results. God made you to be you! When you're you it not only blesses the world, it blesses you too. That's because it feels good to be what God made you to be, and doing what God made you to do.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...Before you trust, you have to listen...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Romans 10:17 TM</span><br>Too many of us are trying to get by on kiddy faith. We're paddling in the shallow end when it comes to trusting God. There are all kinds of things that we say we believe, but we must not really believe them - because they don't show up in the way we live. We should live in such a way that if God is not who He says He is, we'll fall flat on our face.

That means looking for opportunities to trust Him more; living in such a way that He has to come through for you; making choices that will strengthen your faith for the tough times ahead. &quot;But how?&quot; you ask. 

Paul answers: &quot;...before you trust, you have to listen...&quot; If someone could stick a spiritual thermometer under your tongue and read the level of your faith, the thing that would cause the level to rise or fall, would be the time you've spent in God's Word. &quot;Well, my faith's pretty low at the minute,&quot; you say... then make time to get into the Bible. &quot;I wish I had more faith,&quot; you say... so get hold of some preaching tapes! 

Look, there's no mystery about how to close the gap between your faith and that of others - just get more time in God's Word! Is this always easy to do? No. It means quit slobbing around and take better control of your time by putting Bible reading at the top of your 'to-do' list. If you're serious about getting out of the paddling pool, it's a price you'll be willing to pay.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...The really important thing is obeying God's call...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Corinthians 7:19 TM</span><br>When Peter preached at Pentecost, 3000 people gave their lives to Christ. But when Paul preached, a guy sitting in the window nodded off, fell out, and cracked his head on the pavement below, breaking his neck...OUCH! But Paul admitted that preaching wasn't his No 1  calling: &quot;I came to you...timid and trembling...my message and my preaching were very plain...&quot;  (1 Corinthians 2:3-4 NLT). Fortunately, while he might not have been the most dynamic speaker in town, Paul was full of God's power and brought the dead guy back to life! 

Listen: &quot;The really important thing is obeying God's call.&quot; What Paul lacked as a speaker, he totally made up for as a writer. His pen changed the world. He wrote more of the New Testament than the disciples who spent years walking with Jesus. Paul judged cities, straightened out flaky churches, rebuked idol worshippers, and established solid truth. Paul didn't need to worry about his preaching - he wrote the inspired Word that enabled people all over the world to preach themselves.

Something so powerful was released through Paul's writing that even when they threw him in jail he didn't hire a fancy lawyer to get him out. No, he just asked for more paper so that he could keep writing. In fact, Paul wrote all the way to the end of his life. And because he did, people are still being reached for Jesus today! Come on! And all because one man devoted himself to his calling! Now for the question - are you devoting yourself to yours?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Angels are...spirits sent from God to care for those who will receive salvation.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Hebrews 1:14 NLT</span><br>The Bible often talks about angels - in fact there are very few books in the Bible that don't mention them. It says stuff like: &quot;Don't forget to show hospitality to strangers, for some who have done this have entertained angels without realizing it!&quot; (Hebrews 13:2 NLT). Is it possible that angels play a part in your life without you noticing? Well, keep an open mind coz here's what the Bible says: 

1) Angels are God's special agents watching over you constantly. Listen: &quot;...He orders his angels to protect you wherever you go&quot; (Psalms 91:11 NLT). 

2) There is a special relationship between angels and children, which may explain why kids survive things that make parents go weak at the knees.  Listen: &quot;...Don't despise a single one of these little ones. For I tell you that in heaven their angels are always in the presence of my Heavenly Father&quot; (Matthew 18:10 NLT). 

An angel went before Israel's army guaranteeing their victory. An angel shut the mouths of the lions for Daniel. An angel opened prison doors for Peter, saving his life on the eve of his execution. An angel showed up in a storm to let Paul know that he'd be OK.

So, has God phased out His Secret Service Department since Bible times? Are they unemployed somewhere in Heaven? No, they're still on the job. We just need to be smart enough and humble enough to recognise them.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...Stay in the city until you have been clothed with power...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Luke 24:49</span><br>Jesus never intended His disciples to stay in Jerusalem. He told them: &quot;Repentance and forgiveness...will be preached...to all nations beginning at Jerusalem&quot; (Luke 24:47). But before they could start their journeys something important needed to happen. At that point it was as if they were naked - spiritually. They had not been 'clothed with power' - they had to wait for the moment when God the Holy Spirit would zip them up for action. So how did they wait? &quot;...Continually at the temple, praising God&quot; (Luke 24:53). 

And Jesus was faithful to his promise - the Holy Spirit came to the disciples with power, 10 days after Jesus had left. You can read about it in Acts 2 - things started getting really exciting for the disciples, but the pressure increased too. Listen: &quot;At that time the church in Jerusalem suffered terribly...the Lord's followers...were scattered...Saul started ...arresting men and women and putting them in jail&quot; (Acts 8:2-3 CEV). Interestingly, it was the power, plus the pressure that eventually got the disciples moving out of Jerusalem and into the world.

When God has a mission for you He'll do whatever it takes to get you there! Before He'll let you miss out on your destiny, He'll permit trouble to uproot you. In fact, you may be going through certain difficulties right now because you're trying to stay where you're not supposed to be! You can't freeze-frame your past or relive it. When God moves, you must learn to move with Him.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>We should make plans, counting on God to direct us.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 16:9 TLB</span><br>If you want to change your life here's some ways to get started.

1) Set your goals - in prayer! It's good to want to achieve the purpose God has for you and it's not wrong to set goals, it's just wrong to set prayerless ones. Solomon said: &quot;We should make plans counting on God to direct us.&quot;  What are your goals? How do you plan to reach them?

2) Give yourself a break! When other people feel good around you, you are popular; when you feel good about yourself, you are successful. Now feeling good about yourself can be hard work to keep up when every five minutes somebody's trying to put you down. But every winner in history paid a price, you will too!

3) Stop looking at everybody else! Don't wait for flowers to arrive; God gave you seed - start growing your own! Listen: &quot;...enjoy the personal satisfaction of having done your work well, and you won't need to compare yourself to anyone else&quot; (Galatians 6:4 NLT). As you begin to connect into the destiny God has for you people will start looking in your direction more and more.

4) Get over yourself - everyone else has! A well-known minister says he was praying one day: &quot;Father why does the enemy keep reminding me of my past failings?&quot; God replied: &quot;Because he is running low on material!&quot; What a great answer! God says He will not remember your sins (See Isaiah 43:25 NIV). So unless you are better than Him - do the same thing! See if you can apply any of these changes today.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>My purpose is to give life in all its fullness.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>John 10:10 NTL</span><br>When you've been shopping for birthday presents, have you ever seen the 'experience gifts' that are now available? You might chip in with your mum or dad to buy your brother a day out rally driving or something like that. The companies that offer these experiences take care of all the details. A highly tuned race car will be waiting to be revved up, big fat tires and noisy exhaust. An instructor will be watching for the wannabe rally driver to come and have a go. If you were to go along and watch, it would be hilarious. The cars are so powerful that an ordinary driver just totally loses control. At every bend they'll be spinning out onto the grass! Then just before the end of the session the instructor and the driver will swap seats. It's time to see how it really should be done. The receiver of the gift will be razzed around the track faster than he ever thought was possible. The instructors are the only people who really know what the cars are capable of and when they're behind the wheel, the thrills are out of this world! Jesus said: &quot;My purpose is to give life in all its fullness.&quot; If you'll let him get in the driving seat of your life he'll show you exactly how to get the most out of every twist and turn. You'll find you can keep your grip in situations that used to throw you out of control. You'll see that there is power in your life to make rapid progress, even when the going is rough!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>We are like the blind feeling our way along a wall...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Isaiah 59:10 NCV</span><br>Some settlers landed on the shores of America full of vision. The first year they established a town. The next year they elected a council. In their third year the town council proposed building a road five miles out into the wilderness for westward expansion. However, the people criticised the idea as a waste of public funds. Amazing! They had been able to see across the ocean to new world, but now they could not see five miles down the road! What happened? They lost their vision! How can you keep that from happening to you?

1) Refuse to become self-centred! Yes, God wants you to be the best you can be, but that's not first and foremost for your own benefit, it's because a better you can serve other people better.

2) If it's important - get on with it! Who do you know who enjoys everything they do every minute of every hour of every day? One successful leader writes: &quot;Some things will be fun, some will not, but with preparation the most important things will get done well.&quot;

3) Refuse to go with the flow! Lots of people are happy to settle for what already is, not what can be. They like safety and simple answers. To keep your vision alive you must give yourself permission to go a different way, to break new ground. The moment your eyes open each morning remind yourself: &quot;There is more out there than what I've experienced&quot; then commit your day to God and get moving!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...Those who wait on the Lord will find new strength...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Isaiah 40:31 NTL</span><br>Instant communication with your mobile phone. 

Instant music with MP3 downloads. 

Instant buzz at the amusement arcade or the club. 

Who wants to wait? So, when it comes to our spiritual lives, 'waiting on God' - just standing, sitting or lying still and thinking about Him, is really hard to get used to. But it brings rewards that nothing else will, like: 

Strength. Listen: &quot;Those who wait on the Lord will find new strength. They will fly high on wings like eagles. They will run and not grow weary. They will walk and not faint&quot; (Isaiah 40:31 NTL). Do you feel drained today? Waiting on God will recharge your batteries!

Rescue. Listen: &quot;I waited patiently for the Lord; he turned to me and heard my cry. He lifted me out of the slimy pit&quot; (Psalm 40:1-2 NIV). Do you feel stuck or trapped by something today? Wait on God and he'll take you by the hand and pull you out.

Honour. Listen: &quot;Wait for the Lord's help and follow him. He will honour you and give you the land...&quot;  (Psalm 37:34 NCV). Do you ever feel invisible or insignificant? The Bible promises that those who wait on God, and then follow the way He leads them will be recognised and given massive responsibilities!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...This happened, so that what the prophets wrote would come true...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 26:56 CEV</span><br>How can we be sure that Jesus' death was not just the death of another man? Well, for starters, it fulfilled 29 different prophecies! Discussing the odds of that happening, American boffin Peter Stoner says: &quot;Cover the state of Texas two feet deep in silver dollars, then, on one, place a mark. Now, what is the probability that a person could, on their first attempt, select the marked dollar?&quot; That is the likelihood of just eight prophecies being fulfilled in one lifetime - and Jesus fulfilled 29 in one day! Here are some of them:

1) &quot;He was wounded and crushed for our sins. He was beaten that we might have peace. He was whipped, and we were healed&quot; (Isaiah 53:5 NTL) 2) &quot;...They have pierced my hands and feet&quot; (Psalm 22:16 NTL) 3) &quot;They divide my clothes among themselves and throw dice for my garment&quot; (Psalm 22:18 NTL). Jesus was not the victim of circumstances - He was the arranger of them! He lined up every event, including Judas' betrayal, the high priest hypocrisy and Peter's denial. Why? &quot;So that what the prophets wrote would come true.&quot; You need to know this right, you can trust what He says! 

The Bible says He is &quot;...able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine&quot;  (Ephesians 3:20 ). Did you get that? &quot;Immeasurably more.&quot; What seems impossible to us, is all in a day's work for Him. So don't get stressed, talk it through with Jesus.

<title><![CDATA[A strange reason to be happy!]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...All that is secret will be made public.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 10:26 NLT</span><br>How would you like to have everything you do, say or think broadcast 24-7 on TV? Well, the Bible says: &quot;Nothing in all creation is hidden from God's sight. Everything's uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give an account&quot; (Hebrews 4:13 NIV). &quot;He...knows what lies hidden in the darkness&quot; (Daniel 2:22 NTL). &quot;You must give an account on judgment day of every idle word you speak&quot; (Matthew 12:36 NTL). &quot;...He will bring our deepest secrets to light and will reveal our private motives&quot; (1 Corinthians 4:5 NLT).

Hang about; this sounds more like a cause for panic than reassurance! So why is it a reason to be happy? The answer is found in Romans 2:16 (NCV). Listen: &quot;God through Christ Jesus, will judge people's secret thoughts.&quot; Did you get that? Highlight those three words: 'through Christ Jesus' then heave a big sigh of relief! When you accept Jesus, he becomes the filter through which God sees you. Listen: &quot;Those who are in Christ Jesus are not judged guilty&quot; (Romans 8:1 NCV). &quot;Everyone who believes in him is freed from all guilt and declared right with God&quot; (Acts 13:39 NLT). &quot;I will forgive their wrongdoings, and I will never again remember their sins&quot; (Hebrews 8:12 NLT).

Today when God looks at you - He sees Jesus Christ surrounding you! Your weaknesses still need to be dealt with, but they don't disqualify you. Because you are 'in Christ' your future is secure! And that's a pretty good reason to be happy!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>A spiritual gift is given to each of us...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Corinthians 12:7 NLT</span><br>You have certain abilities given to you by God. You can't earn or choose them - they are gifts. Paul writes: &quot;...He alone decides which gift each person should have&quot; (1 Corinthians 12:11 NLT). Because God loves variety, no single gift is given to everyone. If you had them all you wouldn't need anybody else. That would be useless because we'd never learn to love each other, help each other and depend on each other. Think about it like this: Before the architect designs a building, she asks: &quot;What is its purpose?&quot; The answer to that determines everything. And before God created you, He decided your purpose too, and then designed you to be able to do it. He also planned all sorts of stuff to fill your life. Listen: &quot;...All the days planned for me were written in your book before I was one day old&quot; (Psalm 139:16 NCV). God has given you talents and allowed you to go through life experiences as part of the construction process.

Your gifts were not just given for your benefit, but for the benefit of others, again it's like the architect...99.9% of the time she is using her skills to design buildings that will be enjoyable environments for other people - not herself. Listen: &quot;A spiritual gift is given to each...as a means of helping the entire church&quot; (1 Corinthians 12:7 NLT). God planned it that way. If you don't use your gifts, it's like short-changing people at the checkout. That's why we're encouraged in the Bible to discover and develop our spiritual gifts. So, what are you doing today to discover and develop yours?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Do your part to live at peace with everyone.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Romans 12:18 NTL</span><br>It's often said that 'life would be so simple if it wasn't for all the people!'  Check out these three Ps:

1) Perspective. How you see yourself affects how you see other people. It's impossible to keep up an act that's different from the way you see yourself. If you see yourself negatively, you will see other people negatively too. The opposite is also true; if you start to look at yourself positively, you'll start to find it easier to see the good in others - it's all in your perspective.

2) Process. You mustn't view your relationships as just random events or incidents or else one little fall-out could ruin everything. You want your friendships to be solid as concrete, not wobbly like jelly! Every relationship goes through changes. So when a difficulty arises, give it time before legging it out of the emergency exit, that's if you want to develop firm, long-standing relationships.

3) Problems. How do you handle your really important relationships? Here's how God says you should be handling them: &quot;Love never gives up. Love cares more for others than for self...is not always 'me first', does not fly off the handle, does not keep score of the sins of others...puts up with anything...always looks for the best, never looks back, but keeps going to the end&quot; (1Corinthians 13:4-8 TM). Stop! Get a pen and pad and write that down so that it really sinks in. When you hit problems in an important relationship, you need to choose to love like that and not just do what you emotions tell you to. 

That advice comes straight from God who knows a lot more about love than any of us!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Don't be afraid...for I, the Lord, will be with you and see you through.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Jeremiah 1:8 TLB</span><br>At a coastal aquarium a big barracuda kept trying to attack a mackerel, but a glass barrier stopped it. After repeatedly bumping his nose into the barrier, he finally gave up and quit trying. Later when the barrier was removed, the barracuda would swim to the point where the barrier had been - but he could go no further. To him that barrier was still there. Are you like that? Do you have imaginary barriers in your mind that say 'so far and no further'?

When God called Jeremiah to be a prophet to his nation, he made excuses to God saying that he was a lousy speaker, wasn't qualified and basically couldn't do the job. Immediately God said: &quot;Do not say that...&quot; (Jeremiah 1:7 NLT). You know, there are certain things you have to stop saying if you are ever to break through your mental barriers and self-imposed limitations. What God said to Jeremiah, He is saying to you today: &quot;You will go where I send you, you will do what I enable you to do, and whatever I have promised I will bring to pass in your life&quot; (See Jeremiah 1:7 TLB).

God wants to radically rewire your response patterns and false belief systems. He wants to give you a new pair of glasses. Instead of seeing what you normally do, He wants you to see what is possible with Him. Instead of expecting the worst, He wants you to begin looking for the best - because the best is what He has in mind for you today.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...No weapon turned against you shall succeed...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Isaiah 54:17 NLT</span><br>The Bible is full of amazing stories of the way God has got involved in people's lives at just the right time. One time this happened was while the people of Israel were taken as prisoners to a far away country. If you could talk with the three Jewish lads about the experience they had in the fiery furnace, perhaps they'd describe it this way:

&quot;The fire was all over us, flames and smoke everywhere, but we didn't feel the heat, not even our hair was touched. Something moved towards us, a shape; we were not alone. Suddenly, out of the smoke came a shining, gleaming - person! We never got his name; he never said it. He never said anything. But just by being there, he brought an amazing peace - right there, in the middle of the bonfire that was supposed to frazzle us! The fire kept on raging and it was definitely really hot coz people watching were passing out. But the brightness of the flames was nothing next to the brightness of his presence. We never saw him again; he showed up only the once, but right when we needed Him. Looking back, we honestly thought that we were dead meat - but God had a big point He wanted to make that 'no weapon turned against you will succeed'.''

You can read the whole story of these lads in Daniel chapter three. It's there as a reminder that whenever standing up as a believer in the one true God gets you into trouble - God will ensure that you are not alone, He'll get you through.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>It is in Christ that we find out who we are...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ephesians 1:11 TM</span><br>In the Bay of Naples there is a jellyfish that loves to swallow a certain snail. But the snail has a hard shell and the jellyfish can't digest it. So the snail fastens itself to the inside of the jellyfish and slowly begins to eat the jellyfish from the inside out. By the time the snail is fully-grown, it has consumed the entire jellyfish! Understand this: a lot of the things in life that look tasty and we think we can handle, finish up consuming us - the places we hang out, the people we hang around with, or interests that turn into obsessions...music, clothes, a football team!

Don't allow your insides to be eaten away by things that can't satisfy. God has a spectacular plan for you and His plans make you grow - not shrink. (See Jeremiah 29:11). 

A bloke called Fred Smith once sent his friends a letter with three questions: 1) Am I enjoying what I am doing? 2) Am I happy with where I am going? 3) Am I satisfied with what I am becoming? One of his friends, a top stock broker who was always buying and selling shares, called him back and said: &quot;When I read the question, 'Am I satisfied with what I am becoming?' I said, absolutely not!  My life has no real meaning outside of my investments, so, today got rid of them all - I am quitting! Tomorrow I am beginning a new life and I want to thank you for giving me the courage to do it.&quot; 

Ask God today to help you sort out anything in your life that is causing you to shrink and not grow.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...There must be a spiritual renewal of your thoughts and attitudes.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ephesians 4:23 NLT</span><br>Old boffin William James said: &quot;The greatest discovery of our generation is that we can alter our lives by altering our attitudes.&quot;  Think about that! It's what's happening on the inside - not the outside, that determines your happiness.

Imagine you were selected to be one of the contestants on Big Brother. Suddenly you would lose all contact with the outside world. All the things that you enjoy and all the things that drive you mad would be left behind that barbed wire fence. You have to start living your life in a different way because any pleasure or pain would now be a product of the world inside the house, not the world outside the house. Now imagine that house is your mind - anything can be going on outside but how are you coping inside?

David said: &quot;...I will praise the Lord at all times: I will constantly speak his praises&quot; (Psalm 34:1 NLT). David chose the right attitude - and you have to choose it too. You also have to maintain it. That's the hard part. It's like the old farmer said: &quot;The hardest thing about milking cows is, they never stay milked!&quot;  And it's the same with attitudes; they don't stay changed; you have to work on them every day. That's why Paul writes, ' There must be a spiritual renewal of your thoughts and attitudes.'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...The godly are as bold as lions.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 28:1 NLT</span><br>There are times when we must show fear who's the boss. For example, you know your boyfriend or girlfriend's no good for you but you're scared of being lonely. Or you're being pressured to do stupid things and go with the crowd, well don't be scared to just walk away. Your fears are not the boss of your life, you've given that honour to Jesus!

God says: &quot;The godly are as bold as lions.&quot; Now even if you do not feel that way, remember, courage is not the absence of fear, it's the ability to squash it when you need to. David said: &quot;...Be strong and brave and wait for the Lord's help&quot; (Psalm 27:14 NCV). 

People who pretend to have no fear are generally hiding something! As long as you are alive, fear never completely disappears. That's not what you want to hear is it!? You were probably looking for a quick formula that would make all your worries vanish overnight. But it doesn't work that way. Anytime you risk, stretch, or 'put yourself out there', you will experience fear. It's normal; it lets you know you are alive!

When you sense your fear starting to wake up, the worst thing you can do - is nothing! Just sitting around letting your mind fill up with neggy thoughts will leave you paralysed. Today God's calling you to remind your fears who's the boss - Jesus...who could say: &quot;You hate me? - So what.&quot; &quot;You want to whip my body? - It's my calling.&quot; &quot;You want to kill me? - It's my destiny.&quot; Fear doesn't stand a chance when Jesus is around!

<title><![CDATA[Prove it!]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>If your sinful nature controls your mind, there is death. But if the Holy Spirit controls you mind there is life and peace.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Romans 8:6 NLT</span><br>Some people are so determined to prove God's existence that they miss the whole point of having faith. God can't be 100% proved or fully explained by our puny human minds and words. God's known only by faith - and faith defies understanding. If salvation was based on IQ most of us wouldn't stand a chance. But God designed it so that: &quot;...the most stupid cannot miss the way&quot; (Isaiah 35:8 TLB), and children can &quot;...enter the kingdom of heaven&quot; (Matthew. 18:3 NIV).

Some of the hardest struggles can come to people wanting neatly packaged explanations and proof to be delivered right to their doorstep. That's because God hasn't got some sort of inferiority thing going on, He doesn't need to prove himself. God's looking for people who simply take Him at His Word.

In the Old Testament He found a man named Abraham and called him His friend (see 2 Chronicles 20:7 NIV). Was Abraham perfect? Hardly; not once, but twice he lied saying his wife was his sister. And when God told him to leave his relatives behind, he decided to bring along his nephew and father-in-law! But one thing Abraham had going for him was: &quot;Abram believed the Lord and the Lord accepted Abram's faith&quot;  (Genesis 15:6 NCV). God could give you proof in an instant, but developing faith in you is more valuable. Faith is the exchange that is used in God's kingdom. It defies reason, transcends feeling, and gets results every time. Peter says faith is: &quot;...worth more than gold&quot; (1 Peter 1:7 NCV). So today start using your faith!

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...Take delight in honouring each other.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Romans 12:10 TLB</span><br>Legend has it that when Hitler was looking for a chauffeur he selected the shortest man he could find and kept him as his driver for the rest of his life. The man was so short that he needed special blocks under the driver's seat just to see over the steering wheel. Hitler used the poor guy to make himself look bigger than he really was. 

You may smile, but if you feel constantly threatened by somebody else's looks or popularity or ability, you have a problem that needs to be dealt with. That problem is insecurity, it hangs around with its mate - jealousy. It will spoil today and seriously limit your tomorrow. 

Paul says: &quot;Take delight in honouring each other&quot; (Romans 12:10 TLB). That means thinking well and speaking well about the people around you. It means not getting in a mood when you're not first, top or the centre of attention. It also means not developing a victim complex just because you seem to have a tougher time in life then some other people. Honouring others means helping them be the best they can be in life. That's something you can do today - even if it means sacrificing yourself to do it. Look at your friends, their desires, their talents and their opportunities. Find a seed in their life that you can water with encouragement. If you do, you will have a joy of seeing that person blossom before your eyes. When you start giving out to the people around you, your own insecurities are starved of attention and begin to die away - so you can't lose!

<title><![CDATA[Prayer barriers (4+5)]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>When you ask, you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>James 4:3 NIV</span><br>Barrier No 4 - selfishness. To take a closer look at our praying means coming face to face with selfishness. That means realising the difference between wants and needs, rights and responsibilities, justice and grace, personal comforts and being a living sacrifice. It's impossible to grow spiritually without tests of faith. To pray&quot; &quot;give me an easy, happy, problem-free life,&quot;  is a prayer God can't answer because if He did you, and faith, would never grow.

Barrier No 5 - uncaring attitudes. The Israelites wondered why God was not answering their prayers. Here's what He told them: &quot;Stop oppressing those who work for you and treat them fairly...share your food with the hungry...Clothe those who are cold and do not hide from relatives who need your help. If you do these things...the Lord will answer&quot; (Isaiah 58:6-9 TLB). God's committed to developing people who will be full of his love and who will show it to the world. 

Have you seen the cartoon picturing hundreds of people lined up as far back as the eye can see? Each of them is thinking the same thing: &quot;What can I do? I am just one person?&quot; As just one person you may not be able to change the world. You can, however, look for small ways to show you care. Maybe your church runs a kids' club or a soup run? Maybe you could make a difference for someone who struggles with reading and writing, or you could cheer up someone who's upset. As long as your ear is open to the hurting, God will keep His ear open to you.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...Go and make peace with that person, and then come...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 5:24 NCV</span><br>Barrier No 3 - unresolved conflict. If the Bible has got one big theme it is the theme of relationships. Being a Christian is about sorting out our relationship with God so that he can enable us to have amazing relationships with the people around us - leading them to God too. Take family for example; the Bible says: &quot;children, obey your parents...&quot; (Ephesians 6:1 NIV) and also to parents: &quot;...don't make your children angry...&quot; (Ephesians 6:4 NLT). Most of us underestimate how committed God is to building and maintaining loving relationships. If you want to get through to God in prayer stop freaking out at the people around you! John writes: &quot;Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates his brother is still in the darkness&quot;  (1 John 2:9 NIV ). God wants to meet with you in the light. God will help you deal with the thing that drove you and the other person apart, so you can mend the relationship.

Of course it's not always possible to make amends. Paul writes: &quot;If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone&quot; (Romans 12:18 NIV); but sometimes the other person would rather keep the issue alive than accept your apology. If this happens, look deep into your heart. Have you really tried to put things right, or are you still holding something back? Do you really want peace, or would you rather be a blamer and let things fester? If your attempts have been wholehearted and honest, God will not let that broken relationship stand in the way of your prayers. But if your attempts have been half-hearted and self-serving, try again - this time for real.

<title><![CDATA[Prayer barriers (1 + 2)]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...You do not have, because you do not ask God.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>James 4:2 NIV</span><br>When we feel like our prayers aren't being answered, we want to know what's wrong with God. After all, it's easier to blame Him than look in the mirror and say: &quot;Maybe I'm the problem.&quot; For the next few days let's look at some common prayer barriers that can be sorted out.

Barrier No 1 - prayerlessness. Why pray when you can worry? Why pray when you can work yourself to death trying to get it? Why pray when you can go without? Be honest; how often do you decide to pray about something, add it to your prayer list, say you will pray about it, and almost do? You think about it from time to time, but you hardly pray about it at all. Why is God not answering? Because you have not prayed yet! Get this: when we work, we work; when we pray, God works!

Barrier No 2 - unconfessed sin. Listen: &quot;...Your sins have hidden his face from you so that he will not hear&quot; (Isaiah 59:2 NIV). God expects you to have high personal standards, to show thoughtfulness and love to the people around you, and to put Him first in your life. Listen: &quot;...he has told you what he wants from you: to do what is right to other people, love being kind to others, and live humbly obeying your God.&quot; (Micah 6:8 NCV). Those are not suggestions - they are requirements! If you don't meet them, don't get shirty if God doesn't answer your prayer. Regularly pray prayers of confession, God promises forgiveness to you. Then from a pure heart bring on those issues and requests to your Daddy God.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...Lord, first let me go and bury my father.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 8:21 NIV</span><br>In Bible times, Jewish people were expected to do the honourable thing and care for their elderly parents until they died. So when a group of would-be disciples wanted to follow Jesus, one man's family ties immediately began to compete with God's destiny for his life. When He said: &quot;Lord, first let me go and bury my father&quot; Jesus replied: &quot;Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead&quot; (Matthew 8:22 NIV). Was Jesus being insensitive or uncaring? Maybe. But one thing's for sure, nobody understands matters of life and death better than Jesus. 

Your dilemma may not be deciding whether or not to do what God wants - but knowing when to do it! It's easy to commit to make all sorts of promises to God during a tingly worship event but when an opportunity comes in everyday life timing is everything! When God tells you to do something, don't start making excuses. Jesus said: &quot;Those who want to be my disciples must...follow me...and...the Father will honour them&quot; (John 12:26 NLT). God-given opportunities generally come with a sell by date, and they can be lost if you don't respond when He speaks. When Jesus called His disciples, the Bible says that 'immediately' they left their nets and followed Him. Didn't they have responsibilities? Sure, but none more important than this! So, if God interrupts your schedule today and tells you to pray for somebody, or text somebody an encouragement, or give somebody a surprise gift, stop whatever you are doing and do it. When God speaks, the time to respond is - now!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>But in all these things we have full victory through God...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Romans 8:37 NCV</span><br>After 9/11 some amazing stories began to surface about the people who'd escaped tragedy totally randomly. Like the accountant who was late for work because his son started a new nursery that morning. Or the secretary who survived because it was her turn to go and buy the donuts. Or the salesman who wore new shoes to work, developed a blister and stopped at the chemists to get some plasters! Random?!?

It can be really difficult to get your head round this life when for some people it's really hard work and for others it's one long holiday. Jesus had a clear opinion on this - He said: &quot;...In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world&quot; (John 16:33 NIV). 

A writer called Thelma Wells once said: &quot;Every trial, tribulation, question mark, perplexity, decision, burden, disappointment, heartache, calamity, tragedy, turmoil, loss, danger, exclusion, accusation, threat, or act of the devil, is within the scope of God's knowledge. He is sovereign, He knows the outcome; He has already worked it out. His ministering angels protect us. His precious blood covers us. His grace and mercy go before us.&quot; Go Thelma! She's got a view on the world that we could all do with. And what about all the random stuff that happens then - the coincidences and deja-vu's? Well maybe sometimes God is working but decides to remain anonymous! After all, the Bible does encourage us to: &quot;...fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen...&quot; (2 Corinthians 4:18 NIV)

<title><![CDATA[Beating burnout]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Help, God - the bottom has fallen out!...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 130:1 TM</span><br>If you burn the candle at both ends, you aren't as bright as you think! In these times of working harder but achieving less you can get irritable and cynical and lose your sense of humour. David was there: &quot;Help, God - the bottom has fallen out.&quot; If that describes how you feel sometimes, here are two helpful suggestions:

1) Don't go it alone. The Bible says that on the seventh day: &quot;God...rested from all his work&quot; (Genesis 2:3 TM). And rest is still one of His priorities for your life. But that can be a problem when you're a one-man band. Check out Moses. He had trouble sharing out the responsibility for keeping two million Israelites happy in the wilderness! Finally, he told God: &quot;I cannot carry all these people...the burden is too heavy...kill me...now&quot; (See Numbers 11:14-15 NIV). Wow! Now that's major burnout! And what was God's response? &quot;I never told you to do it all yourself. There are talented people all around you just waiting to be asked. Don't be a plonker Mo' - get them involved!&quot;

2) Nobody's perfect. Chuck Braun runs a company called Idea Connection Systems and gives all his trainees 'a mistake quota'. It works like this: each person can make up to 30 mistakes during a session with nothing to worry about. If anyone uses up all 30, Chuck gives them another 30, then another. And the result? They learn to see their mistakes as a creative process and begin thinking of them as part of the learning curve. And you need to do that too!

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...Keep your head in all situations...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Timothy  4:5 NIV</span><br>No matter what you find yourself doing, always keep asking: &quot;Is there a better way?&quot; In other words, use your head! &quot;How do you do that?&quot; By taking control of your thoughts instead of letting them control you. Slick thinking is a form of training recommended by the Bible: &quot;...we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ&quot; (2 Corinthians 10:5 NIV). So keep the following things in mind:

1) Expose yourself to good input! Read good books and magazines, listen to CDs, and spend time with real slick thinkers. When something gets your attention, whether it's someone else's idea or your own - make a note of it and chew it over for a while.

2) Act on your thoughts! Many ideas have a short shelf life so act on them before the 'best before' date. World War 1 flying ace, Eddie Rickenbacher, said: &quot;I can give you a six-word formula for success: think things through - then follow through.&quot;

3) Repeat the process! One good thought does not make a good life. There are too many one-hit wonders, one-book authors, one-message speakers, one-time inventors struggling on to promote and protect a single idea. Slick thinkers are not those who find one nugget and try to live off it for 50 years. Instead, they turn their mind into a mountain of gold they continually mine. It does not matter whether you are born poor or rich, have a zilcho education or a PhD, suffer from multiple disabilities or are a picture of health, you CAN train yourself to be a slicker thinker!

<title><![CDATA[Wrong requests]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>You don't know what you are asking.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 20:22 NIV</span><br>One day James and John came to Jesus asking Him to reserve a place for them in His kingdom. It wasn't just a good view they were after, they wanted the best seats in the house. Jesus said: &quot;You do not know what you are asking!&quot; Later, when the residents of a certain village refused to welcome Jesus, His disciples asked: &quot;Lord, do you want us to call fire down...to destroy them?&quot; (Luke 9:54 NIV ). Again Jesus rebuked them. So, if Jesus' closest disciples could be so misguided in their requests, so can we. Fortunately God loves us too much to always say yes. Whoa! That's a bit deep actually - but think about it. Would you trust a God who would do otherwise?

Probably the most famous wrong prayer request is: &quot;Lord, please change such-a-body.&quot; Whenever two people have to get along together, that prayer appears on God's radar. Well, let's think about that for a minute. How many people have prayed that prayer about you? And how many of the people that drive you round the twist has God actually allowed to remain in your space so that you can be shaped in your attitude and behaviour?

If you've been praying and getting nowhere - your request may be the problem! Maybe it's a cop-out on your part. Maybe it's destructive in ways you don't understand. Maybe it's self-serving, short-sighted and too small; God may have something better in mind. Whatever the reason, when your request is wrong, it's gonna crash and burn. And as you become more mature you'll look back on some of your old prayer requests and thank God that He loved you enough to say 'no'.

<title><![CDATA[3 BIG questions!]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...Our goal is to measure up to God's plan for us...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Corinthians 10:13 TLB</span><br>Q1. How will I know when Christ is the centre of my life? Because any other priorities will not seem important compared to Him. Worrying about the cares of this life is a warning light that Christ has been shoved to the sideline. You need to return to the cross again and say: &quot;I am trusting You, not me.&quot; Listen: &quot;...A sense of God's wholeness...will come and settle you down. It is wonderful what happens when Christ displaces worry at the centre of your life&quot; (Philippians 4:7 TM).

Q2. What kind of person am I becoming? The Apostle Peter says: &quot;Don't lose a minute in building on what you've been given, complementing your basic faith with good character, spiritual understanding, alert discipline, passionate patience, reverent wonder, warm friendliness, and generous love...&quot; (2 Peter 1:5-7 TM). Can you see any of those things beginning to develop in your own life? You have the potential to become all those things, slowly but surely.

Q3. Where do I fit in? We are called to be servants, yet even Jesus did not try to meet everybody's needs. Choose where you can be effective based on your passions. Ask: &quot;Who do I have a desire to help the most?&quot; God is more concerned with 'fit' than 'hit' and He has prepared amazing stuff for you.

One day God will review your answers to these questions. Did you make Jesus the centre of your life? Did you push on to become more like Him each day? Did you give yourself to serving others? Ultimately, these are the questions that will matter.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I will go to the king, even though it is against the law. And if I perish, I perish.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Esther 4:16 NIV</span><br>Esther, a Jewish girl married to a pagan king, broke a long-standing tradition, marched into her husband's throne room, spoke her mind and rescued her people from the death sentence. One girl, just one, saved the whole nation because she was willing to put everything on the line and say: &quot;If I perish, I perish.&quot; What do you think about that? Do you find Esther inspiring or intimidating?

Maybe you think: &quot;Other people are more capable and more important than me.&quot; Or: &quot;I can't really make a difference.&quot; Don't believe it! In this story, how many people did it take to convince the king? One young woman - Esther.

Think about how many people it took to rescue the dying man on the Jericho Road (see Luke 10:30-37 NIV). One good Samaritan. How many did it take to confront Pharaoh and lead the exodus (see Exodus 5)? One man - Moses. Life is so often like a see-saw and it could be you who tips the balance.

So, before you say: &quot;Somebody else should be doing this instead of me&quot;, read these words: &quot;I am only one, but I am still one. I cannot do everything - but I can do something. And because I cannot do everything, I will not refuse to do what I can.&quot; 

Ask God today: &quot;Can I swing the balance in this situation?&quot; Then jump in there!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...By all possible means...save some.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Corinthians 9:22 NIV</span><br>What would you think of someone who had a cure for cancer, but refused to share it? Well, we are guilty of worse when we refuse to connect our faith with the people we meet in the big wide world. The faith you have found in Jesus really is the only cure for the sin that rots human life. If you don't connect your faith they will die lost. So what can you do?

1) Pray for a desire! Jesus said: &quot;...when the Holy Spirit comes on you...you will be my witnesses&quot; (Acts 1:8 NIV). When God's Spirit lives in you, you will see others through His eyes and seize every opportunity to share His love with them.

2) Get over your fear! Don't be intimidated by words like: evangelism, Generation X, Muslim, gay, atheist, intellectual, addict. Everybody needs Jesus. So bury your ego. If they reject you, you will only lose face; if they reject Jesus they will lose out eternally.

3) Loosen up! &quot;Blessed are the flexible for they will not break (that's not in the Bible!)&quot; Paul says: &quot;I have become all things to all men so that by all possible means I might save some&quot; (1 Corinthians 9:22 NIV). Be willing to be stretched, including rethinking the way you share your faith. If your message is not getting through, check the messenger (that's you!)

4) Break out of your Christian bubble! To reach people you have to go to them, not wait for them to come to you. Jesus was pretty clear about that - He said: &quot;...Go into all the world...&quot; (Mark 16:15 NIV). So come on, get out there today and tell somebody about Jesus!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...GUARD YOUR HEART...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 4:23 NIV</span><br>We use the heart to describe the centre of our emotions. But it's more; it's also the origin of our desires, imaginations, motives and intentions. That's why God says: &quot;Above all else...guard your heart for...it is the well-spring of life.&quot;

Just like a dodgy engine makes a car rattle and splutter, Jesus says: &quot;...What comes out of the mouth gets its start in the heart, it's from the heart that we vomit up evil arguments, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, lies and cussing&quot; (Matthew 15:18-19 TM). Jesus also says: &quot;...Your true being brims over into true words and deeds&quot; (Luke 6:45 TM).

So, how is your heart today? Do you get upset easily? Do you constantly compare yourself to other people and resent them? When you hear rumours, do you silence them or spread them? What kind of thoughts do you entertain? Your answer depends on the state of your heart. Jesus said that those whose hearts are pure, will see God in everything (see Matthew 5:8 NLT).

Even your best trainers get a bit smelly right? So do you just wipe them with a cloth? That won't help - it's the inside that's causing the smell - get them in the washing machine! Get some Odor-eaters! Likewise, it's not enough just to try and change your bad habits, you must go to the heart of the problem - which is the problem of the heart! Our mate, King David realised this, so he prayed: &quot;Create in me a clean heart, O God...&quot; (Psalm 51:10 NLT). Maybe today you should pray that too?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...You will be able to decide what God wants for you...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Romans 12:2 NCV</span><br>On one of his long journeys Paul told some of his friends about one of his directions. Listen: &quot;...I am going to Jerusalem, drawn there irresistibly by the Holy Spirit, not knowing what awaits me, except that the Holy Spirit has told me in city after city that jail and suffering lie ahead&quot; (Acts 20:22-23 NLT). Paul was not being asked to do something out of synch with his gifts - all the way to Jerusalem he would be preaching and strengthening the new churches. He was, however, being asked to sacrifice his own safety and comfort in order to reach and bless others. Thankfully, not every direction God gives involves pain and sacrifice, but often they do. God may ask you to choose between comforts or character; the things of this world or the things of His kingdom; promoting yourself or serving others.

We'll finish today with a &quot;DANGER LIST' of things that God will not usually ask you to do: a) to make a major, life-changing decision in a very short period of time b) to go deeply into debt c) to place yourself or someone else in a position of compromise or danger d) to shatter family ties or covenant relationships.

Today, like every day, you'll have lots of choices to make that may affect the future in all sorts of ways. Be confident that God is with you, to give you a little nudge in the right direction when you reach those crossroads.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...You will be able to decide what God wants for you...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Romans 12:2 NCV</span><br>One of the amazing ways God relates to us is by being our guide in life, giving us directions. And of course, God's directions always match up with the map He's given us - the Bible. Always! He will never lead you to two-time your boyfriend or girlfriend, to cheat on an exam, to spread hurtful rumours or deceive your parents. And that's only the beginning.

God's directions will always be in line with the person He meant you to be. For example: if you love mathematics and are naturally gifted with computers, why would you assume that God would lead you into music or theology? Or if you don't come alive unless you're in the great outdoors, why would you think He would lead you to a nine-to-five office job on the 16th floor? Or if you aren't comfortable around children, why would you figure He would lead you to become a schoolteacher? Get real! God's leadings do not contradict who He made you to be. He doesn't create you with particular gifts, and then expect you to waste them by doing something totally unrelated.

If you think you're heading in a direction that isn't what God made you to be, test it carefully. Is God asking you to do this because there is no one else to do it? Is He stretching you into new areas so that your faith will grow? Or is this not a DIRECTION, but rather a DISTRACTION from the way He wants you to go? This is why Paul writes: &quot;...You will be able to decide what God wants for you; you will know what is good and pleasing to Him...&quot; (Romans 12:2 NCV).

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...His mercies never stop...they are new every morning...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Lamentations 3:22-23 NCV</span><br>This Bible verse is a favourite for lots of people, including a woman who said: &quot;It's a good thing God's mercy is new every morning, because I used up all of yesterday's supply&quot; The Collins English Dictionary defines mercy as: &quot;Compassionate treatment of or attitude towards an offender.&quot; It's a massive confidence boost to know that even though every day we create a thousand reasons for God to reject us, he chooses to love us, again and again and again.

King David was a man who loved God very much but he also had an eye for the ladies, and that eventually got him in a shed load of trouble. The reason David talks so much about God's mercy in his Psalms is because he needed so much of it! Listen: &quot;Remember, O Lord, your great mercy and love...Remember not the sins of my youth...&quot; (Psalm 25:6-7).

Paul, the greatest of the Apostles wrote: &quot;I know I am rotten through and through...&quot; (Romans 7:18 NLT). Arrogant people just don't understand mercy - but those like Paul who have honest hearts find God's mercy unlocks a new level of life. Sometimes though, we have a memory lapse concerning our own faults and we end up being a pain in the neck to the people around us. So God reminds us again that we need Him; its not unusual for Him to allow us to get into just enough trouble to realise we need His mercy, and to keep us humble.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...We...are being transformed...from glory to glory...by the Spirit.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Corinthians 3:18 NKJV</span><br>Are you able to look at how you're doing without getting discouraged or feeling a failure? Can you look at how far you still have to go, and be able to appreciate how far you've already come? Where you are now, isn't where you're going to be. You must have a clear view of the finish line or you will never get off the starting blocks. In the Amplified Bible, Paul states that God changes us from one degree of glory to another. Notice, the improvement takes place by degrees - not giant leaps!

&quot;But why do I keep falling?&quot; you ask. Well, you can't walk before you can crawl? You weren't born wearing walking shoes! No, you had to learn. And at first you stumbled more than you walked. The truth is, some of us just grow up faster than others.

We are too hard on ourselves; we would grow faster if we chilled out. We can't live by how we feel. Satan will make sure we frequently feel like 'a right old mess', or that God's not working in our lives. That's a lie! We must learn to live by God's Word, not by how we feel, for His Word states that as long as we believe, He is working in us. Listen: &quot;...The Word of God...is effectually at work in you who believe, [exercising its superhuman power in those who adhere to and trust in and rely on it]&quot; (1 Thessalonians 2:13 AMP). He is at work in your life, changing you a degree at a time!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Dry bones, listen to the Word of the Lord...live...then you will know that I am the Lord.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ezekiel 37:4-6 NLT</span><br>When the prophet Ezekiel obeyed God and proclaimed: &quot;Dry bones, listen to the word of the Lord...live...and know that I am the Lord&quot; the Bible says: &quot;The bones...came together...began to breathe, and stood up&quot; (Ezekiel 37:7-10 NLT). There's a lesson here; only the living Word of God can: a) create order out of the chaos in our lives b) give the church life and direction, to be effective in the world today c) unite the dry bones of division and disappointment. Without the Word we have 'shape', but no force and no life!

Notice that when Ezekiel prophesied the first time, although the bones came together, &quot;they still had no breath in them&quot; (v 8). So at that point He stopped talking to the dry bones and went straight to the source - the wind, which represents God's Spirit, saying: &quot;Breathe into these dead bodies so they may live again&quot; (v 9). You will never get a divine answer to your situation by looking to people; that kind of experience comes only from God Himself. When you need His help, you must go directly to the source!

Today if you are struggling with life's pressures, feeling ill, stress, or relationship problems, you need the Holy Spirit to breathe on you. Job said: &quot;...The breath of the Almighty gives me life&quot; (Job 33:4 NIV). So call 'time out', get alone and pray: &quot;Holy Spirit breathe on me.&quot;

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Levi gave a...dinner...for Jesus. Everybody was there, tax men and other disreputable characters.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Luke 5:29 TM</span><br>A writer Mark Twain said: &quot;Its name is Public Opinion. It is held in reverence. It settles everything. Some even think it is the voice of God. But loyalty to petrified opinion never yet broke a chain or freed a human soul.&quot;

In the Bible whenever Jesus mixed with outcasts and 'other disreputable characters', the religious crowd was really upset. But He told them: &quot;I have come to call sinners...not to spend my time with those who think they are already good enough&quot; (Luke 5:32 NLT).

There is nothing 'spiritual' about distancing yourself from people who are not exactly like you. A famous Bible teacher called Chuck Swindoll says: &quot;True spirituality is about destroying the rigid mold of predictability where you do not have to concern yourself with living up to anyone else's expectation, or worry about who thinks what. It is about breaking the bondage of tunnel vision. Bottom line, it is about freedom. In Jesus' day He took His disciples across a lake to... Who knows, maybe they climbed rocks, swam in a cool lake, sat around a fire. Whatever, you can count on this - they laughed. They probably did a lot of stuff that made the sanctimonious squirm. Why? Because real disciples know the truth - and 'knowing the truth sets you free'.&quot;

It's time you stopped living your life according to what others think. Remember: &quot;If the Son sets you free, you will indeed be free&quot; (John 8:36 NLT). The truth is, being a Christian allows you to 'be your best self', and enjoy it!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>You will...declare a thing, and it will be established for you...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Job 22:28 NKJV</span><br>Did you know you have your own 'internal chatterbox?' It holds the key to most of your fears! It is the little voice of gloom and doom that goes something like this: &quot;I would love to be friends with that person, but if I make the first move and they don't respond, I'll feel rejected.&quot; Or: &quot;I'd like to have a great career, but what if I don't get the exam results I need, I'll feel stupid.&quot; What you say, so often, is what you'll get. Until you change your negative self-talk with faith-talk, you will always live in fear.

Your mind is like the garden of your spirit; it nurtures each thought or 'seed' you sow, until the time of harvest. So if you don't want to produce weeds, you must stop sowing and feeding bad seed. Your first step to breaking fear's hold is recognising the self-talk that got you into trouble in the first place. Is that easy to do? No. You need to get tough on what you think about and feed your mind with positive programming. How? Read the Bible and get God's opinion to be your good seed. If you change your thoughts, you'll change your life.

In the Bible a guy called Eliphaz says to Job: &quot;You will...declare a thing, and it will be established for you.&quot; Now the amazing part is, at times you may not 'feel like you believe' the particular Scripture you have read, but; if you form a habit of choosing to believe what God says, you'll see it affect how you act. So go ahead, serve an eviction notice on every negative thought that's holding you back and begin reprogramming your mind with God's Word.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...Love each other as I have loved you.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>John 15:12 NIV</span><br>You cannot make someone feel important in your presence, if secretly you think they are a nobody! When Jesus said: &quot;Love one another,&quot; He was using a Greek word which means to nurture. Think of a mother and her child. Her love is constant. Her greatest desire is that they should thrive. You may be saying to yourself: &quot;But isn't that something they should get somewhere else, like at home?&quot; The truth is, some of the people you know desperately need to be nurtured. And they will be influenced most by those who make them feel best about themselves. So, if you want to influence them, become a nurturer. 

But first check your motives. Do not be like the little girl who announced one Sunday on her way home from church: &quot;When I grow up I want to be like the man who stood up in the pulpit today.&quot; Her delighted mom said: &quot;You want to be a minister?&quot;' &quot;No,&quot; she replied. &quot;I just want to tell people what to do!&quot; You may smile, but a lot of us want to become authority figures in order to correct people, reveal their weaknesses, and give them our so-called constructive advice. John Knox said: &quot;You cannot antagonise and influence at the same time.&quot; That is why Jesus said: &quot;My command is this: love each other as I have loved you&quot; (John 15:12 NIV). That kind of love seeks only the best, and believes only the best. If you find yourself needing more of it, talk to God! It is &quot;...the fruit of the Spirit...&quot; (Galatians 5:22 NIV).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...Stop allowing yourselves to be...unsettled.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>John 14:27 AMP</span><br>Here are some final thoughts on decision-making:

1) Learn from every decision. When things do not seem to work out, we have a tendency to play the blame-game. That is not good! One woman said: &quot;I hated my broker when my stocks plummeted. Finally, after admitting that nobody twisted my arm to buy, I realised that: a) I should have done more personal research b) I needed to deal with my insecurities; money is a big trigger for me c) it was not the end of the world; stocks go back up as mine did later. So, it was not such a bad decision after all.&quot; Jesus said: &quot;Stop allowing yourselves to be...unsettled.&quot; By accepting personal responsibility for your life and learning from each decision, you gain wisdom.

2) Never protect what you need to correct. Do not become so invested in a decision that you stick with it regardless. Writer Stewart Emery describes being in the cockpit of a plane and noticing a particular console whose function was to keep the plane on course and on time. Anytime the plane veered off course the system corrected it and they arrived on time - despite having been off track 90% of the time. Emery says: &quot;The path from here to where we want to be starts with an error which we correct, which becomes the next error which we correct, etc. The only time we are truly on course is the point in the zigzag when we actually cross the path.&quot; So stay flexible and learn to make course corrections - the quality of your life depends on it!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Put God in charge of your work, then what you've planned will take place.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 16:3 TM</span><br>Here are a few more thoughts on decision-making:

1) Trust the 'still, small voice'. But even when you have prayed, done your homework and made your best guess, if your spiritual gut says 'no', pay attention. The Bible says: &quot;We should make plans, counting on God to direct us&quot; (Proverbs 16:9 TLB). A minister called Henry Ward Beecher wrote: &quot;Wisdom means finding the way in which God is going, and going that way too.&quot; During the American Civil War somebody asked the president Abraham Lincoln if he was sure that God was on his side. &quot;I have not thought much about it&quot; he replied. &quot;I just want to know I am on God's side!&quot; In the Bible, Isaiah says: &quot;...Whoever believes need never run away again&quot; (Isaiah 28:16 NLT). God sees your whole life, not just your tomorrow. So listen for His voice, get instep with him and don't rush things. Remember, He's directing your steps - and your stops! (See Psalm 37:23 NLT).

2) Let it go! Once you've made your final decision, fear and faith will both sail into your harbour. Allow only faith to drop anchor! Paul said: &quot;...Forgetting what is behind...I press on...&quot; (Philippians 3:13-14 NIV). It is normal to speculate about how you would like things to turn out, but you can't control the future, and unfulfilled expectations only create disappointment. Plus, when you're too overly focused on how things should be, you miss out on how they are - which is usually much better than you imagined!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>We know that in everything God works for the good of those who love Him.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Romans 8:28 NCV</span><br>Usually our biggest mistake - is being afraid of making a mistake! A guy called Brian Tracy wrote The Psychology of Achievement. He tells of four multimillionaires who made their fortunes by 35. All four tried an average of 17 different things before they found what made them successful. Imagine failing 16 times before you discover what works! Could you handle that? We are too quick to judge things as failures when they are just a learning experience. The guy who invented the light bulb, Thomas Edison said: &quot;Many of life's failures were just people who did not realise how close they were to success when they gave up.&quot; Only by allowing yourself to fail, do you give yourself permission to succeed. So, what should you do?

1) Consider all your options! Then discuss them with the right people. Find those who know their stuff and are willing to support you. Don't be afraid and never hesitate to talk about your plans, even if they might not work. Swallow your pride! 

2) Lighten up! Nowadays everything's a big deal! Chill out and stop taking yourself so seriously! A theology boffin J I Packer says: &quot;A moment of conscious triumph makes one feel that after this, nothing really matters; a moment of seeming disaster makes one feel like this is the end of everything. But neither feeling is realistic; because neither event is really what it is 'felt' to be.&quot; Do not get bent out of shape; God's grace will help you handle it. Remember: &quot;In everything God works for the good of those who love him.&quot;

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>If you don't take your stand in faith, you won't have a leg to stand on.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Isaiah 7:9 TM</span><br>The Bible says: &quot;If the trumpet does not sound a clear call, who will get ready for battle?&quot; (1 Corinthians 14:8 NIV). Putting stuff off will make you miss some of your greatest opportunities. But what if all your life you've been warned about making the wrong decisions about relationships, what you spend your money on, education, career, or life in general? Now you feel like a donkey standing between two bales of hay; unable to decide which one to eat, and afraid of making the wrong choice, you stand there starving to death. Make a choice!  Wanting to do things perfectly and being a bit of a control freak will make you so afraid of getting it wrong you won't move. Anytime you are immobilised by the thought of making a mistake you have forgotten the key: failing does not make you a failure, giving up does! Over the next few days we will talk on some ideas for making top choices. The first is: You can't please everybody, so stop trying! The writer of Proverbs said: &quot;Fear of man is a dangerous trap, but to trust in God means safety&quot; (Proverbs 29:25 TLB). Once you know what brings you fulfilment, as long as it's God's will, chart your course accordingly and refuse to let the opinions of others intimidate you or colour your view. Remember, over time goals can change; what you need today may not be needed a year from now. So pray, reassess your plans regularly, and be willing to change direction.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>When SIN grew...God's Grace increased.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Romans 5:20 NCV</span><br>Although Paul was always very religious, he didn't start out as a Christian. As a Jew, he was obsessed with the law; an intellectual who could debate with the finest minds of his generation. Successful, articulate and educated, he was deeply committed to the beliefs and rules of his faith. And he hated Christians! He watched as a Christian called Stephen was stoned to death, and though he didn't join in, he happily held the coats of the killers.

Paul never dreamed that one day he would switch sides. But when God has a plan for your life you don't get to vote on it! He knows the best path for you and He has already begun to work out His purpose for you. Even while Paul held the coats of Stephen's executioners, God had a plan to use him. Just like He had a plan to use you when you were busy getting drunk and doing your own thing, or running around from relationship to relationship, none of that intimidated God, because: &quot;Where sin abounded, grace abounded much more.&quot;

If Paul had known God's plan to meet him that day on the road to Damascus, he might have taken a different route. It says: &quot;He was...dazed by a blinding flash. As he fell to the ground...&quot; (Acts 9:3-4 TM). This proud religious teacher had an appointment with God that was not in his diary; one that knocked him off his high horse! And to bring you into submission to His will, He will do 'whatever it takes'. So, watch out - God won't permit your pride to stop His amazing plans for your life.

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Be strong...fight bravely for...the Lord will do what is good.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Samuel 10:12 NIV</span><br>In the 14th Century, the Emperor Tamerlane (a descendant of brutal warrior Ghangis Kahn) was badly defeated in battle. As he lay hidden in a barn, enemy troops searched the countryside looking for him. He noticed an ant trying to push a kernel of corn that was many times bigger than himself over a wall. Sixty-nine times the ant tried and didn't make it, but on the seventieth attempt he did it. Leaping to his feet, Tamerlane said: &quot;If you can do it, I can too.&quot;  That day he changed his outlook, reorganised his army, went back and totally beat the enemy.

If you're under attack at the moment, listen to the words of Joab, commander-in-chief of King David's army: &quot;Be strong and let us fight bravely for...the Lord will do what is good.&quot; Joab knew that if he did his part, God would do His. So keep fighting! As long as you are on the battlefield God can give you victory. But if you turn and leg it, what else can He do for you?

Today as you face your difficulties keep these seven things clearly in mind: 1) never give up when you know you are right: 2) believe that God has a bigger and better plan, if you just persevere: 3) don't look at the odds and freak out; God's bigger than all of them: 4) never let anyone intimidate you or tell you that its impossible: 5) fight and overcome everything that is trying to stop you: 6) remember, every winner has dealt with losing and opposition: 7) don't give up, be confident that in God's strength you will succeed.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>God has given us...this ministry of restoring relationships.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Corinthians 5:18 GWT</span><br>The purposes of God in your life are worked out through your key relationships. So it's helpful if you learn to recognise them! Some people in the Bible did. Remember Jonathan, who loved David even at the cost of his own life? Or Ruth, who loved her widowed mother-in-law, Naomi, and gave her a reason to live again? God has people like that, and you need them. He wouldn't say: &quot;...It is not good that man should be alone...&quot; (Genesis 2:18 NIV), then tell you to get on with it all by yourself.

Your heart may need some healing before you can start these friendships. That will involve developing an ability to spot the difference between 'destructive' relationships and 'constructive' relationships. Give God space to work on you. It will make sense one day...He will help you untangle things. And while you're in that process get to know Him better. Make His opinion the source of your self worth; He's the only one that counts anyway. If you've had people you love mess you around and hurt you, making you feel rubbish, ask God to help you forgive them.

Begin today to love like God loves. He sees your faults, deals with your rejection and loves you no matter what. Don't throw away a good person just because they did a bad thing. Forgive them, like God forgives you. If God forgave you like you forgive others, what state would you be in? Ask God to teach you about real relationships.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Write the vision and make it plain...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Habakkuk 2:2 NKJV</span><br>The sun is a powerful source of energy. Every hour it washes the earth with billions of kilowatts of energy. Yet with a hat and some sun block you can sit in its light for quite a while without anything bad happening. A laser, on the other hand, is a relatively weak source of energy. It takes only a few watts and focuses them. But with a laser you can drill a hole in a diamond or wipe out cancer. Focus brings a new dimension of power to almost anything! The harder the challenge, the more focus it requires. &quot;But how can I stay focused?&quot; you ask:

1) Get rid of distractions. The best way to keep your mind off things you don't want, is by focusing it on things you do. Don't do easy things first or hard things first, or urgent things first - do first things first. Switching from task to task can be a real waste of energy. You get more done by focusing on one job at a time, not by switching constantly.

2) Always check your progress. Only when you've got a clear goal, written down, can you develop a plan and see how well you're doing. To do well at a few things you have to give up many things. You can't know everyone, so make sure you know the right people and build good relationships with them. Since you can't do everything, make sure you do the right things and find other people to take care of the rest. There are only a few exceptional opportunities in any person's lifetime! Ask God to help you see them, and seize them!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...Neither are your ways my ways.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Isaiah 55:8 NIV</span><br>Kids think the words 'not yet' are the most tragic in the whole English language! And there's still a bit of that impatient child in all of us that wants God to grant every request - immediately! God who loves us and is wise says: &quot;Not yet&quot; and what's our response to that? &quot;But God, You don't understand, I need it now! Read my lips, I said now!&quot; But God's not impressed or intimidated; He just says: &quot;You can shout all you like, you're not having it yet. Trust me, I know what I am doing.&quot;

Don't think you know better than God! Just 'cause He's not given you what you want doesn't mean He won't. Sometimes He delays in order to test our faith, other times so that we can change what we're asking. When we see the situation better, we may be glad to change our prayer and make it more in line with He wants. Sometimes God delays so that He can develop in us qualities like discipline, trust, compassion and submission. Most spiritual gains come only through struggle. If we had our way, we wouldn't put up with much before asking God to remove the stuff that's hard?

Often we're not able to see the reason for the delay. But that's not surprising. God says: &quot;Neither are your ways my ways.&quot; Often we think God's saying &quot;no&quot; only to discover that He is saying &quot;not yet&quot;, so that He can orchestrate an even better result than we could imagine.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I try to find common ground with everyone...that I might bring them to Christ.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Corinthians 9:22 NLT</span><br>It's a mistake to think your way is the only way! Paul wrote: &quot;I try to find common ground with everyone...that I might bring them to Christ.&quot; Get comfortable with people who are different from you. God made variety so life wouldn't be predictable and boring. So don't stick to one flavour 'cause you're scared to try something new...you can't live a healthy life off just one food group can you, right? 

When people feel like you respect them for who they are, you are more effective at influencing them and pointing them towards Jesus. The Bible says: &quot;In Christ's family...you are all equal...in a common relationship with Jesus&quot; (Galatians 3:28 TM). Just think, when the saints of the ages gather round God's throne to praise Him, they will not only be from different continents and cultures, but different eras - some from the early church and some from the space age, all worshipping together. What a concert! But you won't enjoy it if you are so narrow that you only know one song; what if they don't sing it?

Some of God's best characters were culturally diverse: like Moses, an Israelite raised in an Egyptian household to increase his understanding and prepare him for his destiny, or Peter, who was prejudiced enough to think that God only used Jews, until God straightened him out saying: &quot;If God says something is acceptable, don't say it isn't&quot; (Acts 10:15 NLT). Jesus prayed: &quot;That they may all be one...that the world may believe&quot; (John 17:21 NASB).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Dear friends, don't be surprised at the fiery trials you are going through...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Peter 4:12 NLT</span><br>It takes a lot of fire to purify gold, and when God gets ready to clean us He's not afraid to use a bit of the hot stuff! Nothing gives strength to your character and depth to your faith, like tough times. Whenever you see someone whose life reminds you of Jesus - you are probably looking at someone who has been through the fire. 

But here's some good news: you may in a hot spot today, but God has His hand on the temperature dial! He knows how hot it needs to be to burn away the rubbish that stops His purposes in your life. His hand fans the flames needed to teach you endurance, forgiveness, compassion, and a lot of other lessons that build your character. You need His correction - you don't enjoy it - but you need it. Listen: &quot;We do not enjoy being disciplined. It is painful, but later, after we have learned from it, we have peace, because we start living in the right way&quot; (Hebrews 12:11 NCV).

No one invests in something without expecting to get something back, and God is a great businessman. He will do whatever it takes to protect His investment in you. We spend too much time talking about what we want from God when the real issue is - what He wants from us and what He'll do to get it. John said: &quot;He'll place everything true in its proper place...everything false he'll put out with the trash to be burned&quot; (Matthew 3:12 TM). Maybe that will help you to understand some of the things you're going through at the moment.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>People may make plans in their minds, but the Lord decides what they will do.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 16:9 NCV</span><br>The world isn't going to devote itself to making you happy! Once you accept that, you will begin to move forward. Life doesn't always work the way you want it to. Paul wrote: &quot;I hope to visit you on my way to Spain...&quot; (Romans 15:24 NCV). But he never got there; instead he ended up in prison. But from there, he wrote the awesome letters to the early churches that you find in the New Testament. 

Look out! Your disappointment may turn out to be - God's appointment. The Bible says: &quot;People make plans in their minds, but the Lord decides what they will do.&quot; Aren't you glad God's in control of your life! Let the philosophers argue over what 'life' means; all you need do is focus on how to live it! If you live to a hundred, what's the point if resentment and regret keep you from enjoying it? And what good is more time, if you are just time wasting? 

A guy in the Bible called Job was having a really hard time but he understood that God knows how to get the good stuff out of us, even though it can be uncomfortable at the time. He said: &quot;But God knows the way that I take and when He has tested me I shall come out as gold&quot; (Job 23:10 NCV).

God is working in everything you are going through today, for your good and His glory. So let it make you better, not bitter.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...Forget yourselves long enough to lend a helping hand.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Philippians 2:4 TM</span><br>If you want to be like Jesus, forget about yourself and live for others! Listen: &quot;...The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many&quot; (Mark 10:45 NIV). Don't pray for a generous heart, practise being generous...and your heart will follow. As long as you've got breath and are willing, God will ask you to put others first (see 2 Corinthians 9:10 NLT). 

Always do more than you are expected to. Rebecca did, and she became the bride of Isaac and the inheritor of his father Abraham's blessings. Have you any idea how much water one thirsty camel can drink? Well, Rebecca watered a whole load of camels for a stranger. And even though she didn't know it at the time, she was fulfilling God's plan for her life. Never turn your nose up at an opportunity to give or be gracious; you have no idea whose camels you are watering (!), or what doors of opportunity you may be opening.

Instead of always having to be the centre of attention all the time, learn to put others first. Follow the example of a bunch of people who had the right idea. Listen: &quot;They gave as much as they were able and even more than they could afford...they first gave themselves to the Lord then to us&quot; (2 Corinthians 8:3-5 NCV). Now, there's a formula for making your life count!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Anyone who meets a testing challenge head-on and manages to stick it out is mighty fortunate. For such persons loyally in love with God, the reward is life and more life.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>James 1:12 TM</span><br>Most successful people are usually just 'hungrier' and 'thirstier.' What we daydream about - they chase after! Nation conqueror Napoleon was born in total poverty. In school his friends made fun of him. But he devoted himself to his books and excelled in his studies. Eventually he became the brightest student in the school. Before he was through he'd taken over most of the world!  If a baby tree has to fight its way up through stones and hard soil to get to sunlight and air, then wrestle with storms and frost to survive, its root system will be strong and its timber worth a mint. You get the message don't you...? It's impossible to succeed without going through trials. Impossible! If you are successful and haven't experienced hard stuff, you can be sure that someone else has experienced it for you. If you are experiencing it without any joy, there is a good chance somebody else will succeed one day because of you. Either way, there is no success without trials.

The true test of your character is - seeing what it takes to stop you! Famous preacher Dr G Campbell Morgan tells of a man from Chicago whose shop was burned down in a massive fire. The next morning he arrived at the ruins carrying a table, set it up in the middle of the charred debris and put up a big sign which read: &quot;Everything lost except wife, children and hope - business will resume as usual tomorrow morning!&quot; And you need that same grit!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...Make the first move; make things right...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 5:25 TM</span><br>Grudges will hold you back. You'll never get ahead as long as you are trying to get even with somebody. Never! Jesus said: &quot;Make the first move; make things right.&quot; When you've been hurt by a friend's backstabbing, a teacher's unfair treatment, or a parent's careless words, unforgiveness will cost you more than just your temper. It will damage your relationships, distract you from your work, accelerate the aging process, cause stress and depression, make you feel unhealthy, and stop you from enjoying life. Forgiveness, on the other hand, wipes the slate clean and reverses much of the damage that has already been done. People, who forgive, feel better about them selves and feel less stressed. Check out these two Scriptures: 

a) &quot;Do not laugh when your enemy falls. Do not crow over his collapse&quot; (Proverbs 24:17 TM). b) &quot;If you see your enemy hungry...buy that person lunch; if he is thirsty...get him a drink. Your generosity will surprise him...&quot; (Romans 12:20 TM).

Do you remember when you were little, a friend took your toy and you thought you would hate them forever? But minutes later you were back playing together like nothing ever happened. Well, Jesus said that unless you learn to think like a child, you won't enjoy the benefits of His kingdom. Children don't dwell on the past; they live in the present, never worry about the future, and forgive quickly. That's a great strategy for life! So, ask yourself today: &quot;Who do I need to forgive?&quot; Then do it as quickly as possible!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...David went in and sat before the Lord...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Samuel 7:18 NKJV</span><br>Here are three reasons we don't hear God speaking to us more often:

1) We don't know how to handle His silence. When God seems to be silent we think: &quot;Did I ask the wrong question? Was I stupid to expect an answer?&quot; Don't be upset. God is a living being, not an answering machine; He speaks when He has something to say to you.

2) We don't listen for God's voice. As well as spending time alone listening to God, you must learn to keep your ears tuned to Him each day. One Christian author writes: &quot;A friend of mine has a company car equipped with AM/FM radio, a CD player, a phone and mobile communication unit which he consistently monitors at a low decibel level. Often we have been riding together, talking and listening to music, when all of a sudden he will reach down, pick up the microphone and say, 'I am here, what's up?' With all the other noise in the car I never hear the signal, but he has tuned his ear to it. He is able to carry on a conversation and listen to music without ever missing an incoming call.&quot;  And it's possible for you to develop that same sensitivity to God's voice.

3) We don't plan to do anything about it. When God speaks we listen, nod and say: &quot;How interesting&quot;' if we never respond to what He says, God may see no reason to continue speaking. When He speaks to us it is usually always requires - obedience!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>While it was still NIGHT...He got up and went out to a secluded spot and PRAYED.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Mark 1:35 TM</span><br>One well-known Christian leader writes: &quot;I used to try to pray on the run, till it became obvious that the pace of my life outstripped my capacity to analyse it. It exhausted me to be constantly doing, rarely reflecting on what I did. At the end of the day I would wonder if my work had any meaning at all. So I developed my own approach to stillness before God. It is called &quot;journalling&quot;. It is one of the spiritual disciplines that has really worked for me, and I am not tempted to abandon it because it has made my life so much richer. After I open my journal, reflect on the previous day, and write out my thoughts and prayers, my spirit is receptive. Then I sit quietly and simply say, &quot;Lord, I invite You to speak to me&quot;. The moments that follow are the ones that really matter. I like my way of quieting my mind and preparing myself to hear God speak: it works well for me. But I know it will not work for everyone. Some people cannot stand writing anything, let alone journals and prayers; they prefer to talk quietly to God. Some are good at meditating without writing or saying a word. Some &quot;...Come before him with joyful songs&quot; (Psalm 100:2 NIV). The important thing is not to follow a particular method, but to find a way that works for you. Custom design an approach that will still your racing mind, soften your heart, and enable you to hear God speaking to you!'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Grace and peace to you...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Philippians 1:2 NVC</span><br>The same circumstance that gets the better of others won't get the better of you - if you've been 'graced' to handle it! How could Paul maintain his joy through beatings, betrayals, shipwrecks and imprisonment? Because God told him: &quot;My grace is enough; it is all you need. My strength comes into its own in your weakness...&quot; (2 Corinthians 12:9 TM). Grace will enable you be kind to a difficult friend, stick be someone that's having a tough time, pray for people you know who don't believe in God yet, and keep your faith strong in the face of overwhelming odds.

When does grace come? When you need it most! Listen: &quot;...We will find grace to help us when we need it&quot; (Hebrews 4:16 NLT). God won't give you tomorrow's grace today. But like the manna God gave the Israelites to eat in the desert when you wake up each morning it will be there - enough grace for your need. One of the greatest mistakes you can make is envying others or trying to be like them. Why? Because you may have equal talent, but unless God has given you grace to do the job, you will not succeed. Actually, getting what they have could bury you instead of being a good thing.

How does grace come? Listen: &quot;And now, I entrust you to God, and the Word of His grace...that is able to build you up...&quot; (Acts 20:32 NLT). There it is; in the pages of God's Word you will find a solution, or the grace to handle it, learn from it and come out stronger. So the word for you today is: &quot;Grace and Peace to you.''

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>See how very much our heavenly Father loves us...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 John 3:1 NLT</span><br>You wouldn't be so critical of yourself, or so bothered about the opinions of others - if you knew how God really felt about you! He made up His mind about loving you long before you failed, so say sorry and tell that guilt you feel to get lost! Guilt is not from God; it insults God's mercy. And stop running around in all those weird places looking for love. Open your heart right now where you are; God is speaking to you today in the tough circumstances you are trying to escape. He is the One you need when life has hurt you and you feel like you've lost your way. Only His hand can save you, put you on the right path and give you the strength to try again - and succeed!

The problem is, we've never been loved by anyone the way God loves us, so we have nothing to compare it to! Some of us have never been secure in the love of our mum and dad and it affects how we see our Heavenly Father. Go back to His Word! It is a living love letter. It is a 'statement of intent' from One who wants only the best for you. 

&quot;But I never hit the mark...&quot; Nothing you have done has changed His mind. His love for you is constant - and unconditional! 

No parent wants their child to be insecure or question their love. That's why God disciplines us, develops us, and delights in us! The fact that He loves you even when you are wrong is what gives you the power to right the wrongs you've done. So, come and experience His love afresh.

You are my God and I trust you.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 91:2 NCV</span><br>Those who go to God Most High for safety will be protected by the Almighty. I will say to the Lord, 'You are my place of safety and protection. You are my God and I trust you'. God will save you from hidden traps and from deadly diseases. He will cover you with His feathers. And under His wings you can hide. His truth will be a shield of protection. You will not fear any danger by night or an arrow during the day. You will not be afraid of diseases that come in the dark or sickness that strikes at noon. At your side a thousand people may die or even ten thousand right beside you, but you will not be hurt...

The Lord is your protection; you have made God most High your place of safety. Nothing bad will happen to you; no disaster will come near your home. He has put His angels in charge of you to watch over you wherever you go. They will catch you in their hands so you will not hit your foot on a rock...

The Lord says: &quot;Whoever loves me, I will save. I will protect those who know me. They will call to me, and I will answer them. I will be with them in trouble; I will rescue then and honour them. I will give them a long life and they will see who I can save&quot; (Psalm 91 NCV). Now read it again and feel His arms around you; let His peace fill your heart.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Should a man like me run away?...I will not.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Nehemiah 6:11 NIV</span><br>If you are serious about success, study the life of Nehemiah. Jerusalem lies in a ruin; that is when he enters the picture. He rallies, organises and motivates the people. Fifty-two days later they wash off their trowels, stow their gear and walk away from a newly finished wall. How did he do it? 

a) He had passion! He couldn't stop thinking about the problem and seeing himself solving it (Nehemiah 1:3-4 NIV). That's what it takes! b) He could motivate other people! What good is your vision if you can't involve others in it? (Nehemiah 4:17 NIV). c) He had confidence in God! He may have doubted his own ability but he never doubted God's. His book is full of prayers - silent ones, short ones, specific ones (Nehemiah 4:4 NIV). d) He refused to give up! From when he started mixing the mortar until he hung the last gate, his critics never kept on and on at him. But he took it, sarcasm, suspicion, threats, you name it, nothing moved him (Nehemiah 6:11 NIV). e) He was realistic! He had some workers building the wall while others stood guard against attack (Nehemiah 4:16 NIV). He acted without over-reacting; he was gracious but unbending. You may be Mr or Miss Spiritual, but you've got to keep your feet on the ground. f) He had the discipline to finish the job! Successful people are finishers. (see Nehemiah 6:15 NIV). When the job loses its appeal they don't go somewhere else; they stay at it whatever the weather. Still want to be a success? Start putting some of this into practice

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Exodus 33:14 NIV</span><br>There are some people who make us feel stronger just by being around them. Hanging with them and hearing their 'angle on life' makes us feel better. But the best person to go to when we're in need or need advice is God, we must spend time with Him. Spending time in His presence is like sitting in a room filled with beautiful perfume. If we sit there long enough, we take the fragrance with us when we leave into our everyday lives.

Moses was a man of prayer. He spent a lot of time hanging out with and talking with God. He knew that without God's presence he wasn't worth much. Can you imagine being responsible for the daily care of two million people; for getting them out of one country and into another - on foot? It's a mind-boggling task! And if that wasn't bad enough, most of them spent their time complaining about life and giving Moses some serious grief. Perfect ingredients for freaking out completely. But God told Moses: &quot;My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.&quot;

Did you get that? God's presence can give you peace in any situation, including a difficult relationship or if stuff is tough at home. It can help you to show love in the face of abuse and patience in the middle of stress, bring a positive result without a lot of words, and end up feeling good about the way you handle things. So today, spend some time in God's presence.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>She turned to Abraham and demanded, 'Get rid of that servant and her son...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Genesis 21:10 NLT</span><br>It was easy for Sarah to say 'get rid' of them! She had no emotional investment in the deal! This was Abraham's son, that he loved and probably looked like him. But just because you are willing to take responsibility for your actions, doesn't mean there will not be painful consequences. Be careful where you lie down; getting up again may not be as easy as you think!

There are things in life you can give up easily; others take every ounce of grace and grit you have. It is especially hard to give something up when you can see yourself reflected in it: a job you love, a house you are living in, a relationship you are tied to can make you want to keep things as they are. But when you've gone as far as you can with your Ishmael and you are ready to see God's promise fulfilled in your life, you must be willing to give up anything that will hold you back.

If you have ever wondered how Abraham could bear to give up his son Isaac as a sacrifice to God - remember Ishmael. When you have given up one thing, it is easier to give up another.  When you see somebody who is really going for God, you might want to think twice before you judge them and label them a fanatic. Remember, behind the 'hallelujah' there is often a sacrifice. Chances are, when you look in their past you will find an Ishmael they loved and had to let go. Is there a message here for you?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Isaac grew...but Sarah saw Ishmael making fun of Isaac...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Genesis 21:8-9 NCV</span><br>When God promises you something and it doesn't happen straight away, it's easy to get impatient. And to make matters worse, there is usually somebody around who will write the promise down, date it, and keep reminding you of it! When that happens, you start doubting God and wondering if He needs your help to make it happen.

After God promised Abraham that his descendants would be &quot;...too many to count...&quot; (Genesis 15:5 NLT), things weren't happening fast enough. So Abraham got impatient and took matters into his own hands, slept with Hagar, his wife's maid, who got pregnant and had Ishmael. Bring on the trouble!

When God gave Sarah baby Isaac, both boys ended up living under the same roof. Right and wrong, obedience and sin, growing up together. Look out! It's a recipe for disaster, trying to walk one path that is split clean down the middle. It will overwhelm you unless you handle it and make a choice.

One day Sarah caught Ishmael &quot;...making fun of Isaac&quot;. That's what happens when you don't confront your mistakes; they end up making fun of you and belittling your success. To make sure that doesn't happen you need to take a stand and say: &quot;Enough is enough! I am going to clean up my act and straighten out my life.&quot; You can't sit on the fence when it comes to dealing with things that threaten to destroy you. You have to take a stand!

Sometimes it feels like you do loads for people without much thanks doesn't it? Well get ready for a news flash...people can be pretty self-centred!!! But guess what? God sees the good stuff you're doing and He is well pleased. He's got you where He needs you, doing your stuff for Him. Once you get your head 'round that that, you'll totally chill out and enjoy life. You've already figured out that life's all about Him anyway haven't you?!

Don't let how someone is, or isn't with you, affect how happy you are! They may not notice, but God does. He records and He rewards. Count on it! Listen: &quot;He will not forget how hard you have worked for Him and how you have shown your love...&quot; (Hebrews 6:10 NLT).

If you feel unappreciated today, stop and read these words carefully: &quot;Let every detail in your lives - words, actions, whatever - be done in the name of the Master...&quot; (Colossians 3:17 TM). That's it - do it for Him! Why not pray this prayer: &quot;Lord, all that I do today, I do for You. I know that You appreciate me - look at all the good thing You have given me. So I will praise and honour You today with my thoughts, my words and my actions. Amen.&quot;

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Give all your worries to Him because He cares for you.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Peter 5:7 NCV</span><br>Do you sometimes feel like no one is really listening to what you say? One boy said: &quot;I feel like a comma. When I talk to my Dad he will say something. Then when I start to talk again he makes a comma; he doesn't interrupt me, but when I'm finished he starts right in where he left off. It is as if I didn't say anything.&quot; Even people who love us can seem dismissive towards us and act like they don't care sometimes. But when that happens, who do you go to? What voice do you listen to?

God's opinion of you needs to be the one that is the loudest, the one you build your confidence on, that enables us to rise above the negativity and fear of failure.

What dreams has God placed in your heart?  If no-one seems to be listening to you and you feel dismissed, go to the one who will never talk over you, but listen to your worries and then take them from you.

Get this: In the Bible, it tells us God's opinion: &quot;Give all your worries to him, because he cares about you&quot; (1 Peter 5:7). Isn't that awesome! You don't have to lug a load a load of rubbish around with you. God cares enough to take it from you. But you have to make the first move and hand over all your fears. Let Him deal with them. Today, I dare you to trust Him!

<introtext><![CDATA['Who dares accuse us whom God has chosen?' Romans 8:33 NLT<br />When you tear someone down, you're on thin ice with God. The Bible says: 'Who dares accuse us whom God has chosen for His own? Will God? No! He is the one who has given us right standing with Himself... Will Christ Jesus? No, for He is the one who died for us and was raised to life for us and is sitting...next to God, pleading for us.' (Romans 8:33-34 NLT)<br />Christians are not perfect, but God says they 'belong to His dear Son.' (Ephesians 1:6 NLT) There's nothing you can slag them for that God doesn't already know. So don't go treading the rumour mill because, when you do, you're insulting the God who made them. You're implying that God has cut off more than He can chew when it comes to changing this person. It's not your job to judge where others are at. Jesus tells us plainly, that if we judge others, God will boomerang it back on us.<br />So what happens when somebody oversteps the mark? Are we to keep it zipped? Well, we're not to post it on Facebook, nor are we to rub their faces in it. Out of love and concern for the person we can try and get alongside them to support and help. Human nature enjoys seeing someone fall flat on their face; 'God nature' enjoys helping them back up.<br />SoulFood: Num 30:1-32:24, Mark 5:1-10, Ps 44:9-16, Pr 11:10-11]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He will purify...and refine them like gold...' Malachi 3:3 NIV<br />If we're not careful and prayerful it's all too easy to wander off to Dead-end Street. King David was described as a man 'after God's own heart' - his dare-devil faith saw him do immense things with God. Yet even someone as clued up in God's ways as David wasn't safe from mooching off the path.<br />David wrote, 'Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me,' (Psalm 51:10 NKJ) as he reflected how far he'd meandered off-track. He'd committed adultery, tried to gloss over it, and had an innocent man's blood on his hands. All this because David thought he could have what he wanted no strings attached. So he prayed for a clean heart because he was clogged with sin; the dross had congested his hotline to God.<br />In order to purify David's heart, God took him through the refining process. When gold is about to be refined over extreme heat, copper and silver must be separated first. These are less precious metals that blend with the raw gold ore. There's an important lesson here. Most of us are unable to separate the good from the best, so Malachi writes, 'He will purify...and refine them like gold.' Do you need purifying? Get away with God and allow Him to filter out all your wrong thoughts, actions and attitudes.<br />SoulFood: Lev 26-27, Luke 22:1-13, Ps 56, Pr 10:8-9]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Your Word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.' Psalm 119:105 NKJ<br />Anyone who's been camping knows the feeling: you wake up in the middle of the night desperate for the loo. You lie in your tent and try to ignore the feeling but as time ticks by, you have to get up. Grumbling, you rummage for your trusty torch and start to trek across the site. It's pitch black, but as you flick the switch on your torch, a beam lights up the ground in front of you. Listen: 'Your Word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.' The Bible is the Word of God in printed form. When you open it up and read it, like that torch, you flick the light on in your life. It can answer a problem, give direction for your life and help you get to know God better. It's your trusty God-torch! He gives you His Word and Spirit to help you stick to the right path and go in the right direction.<br />The Bible uses the example of darkness and light over and over again to describe the difference between people who have found God (or been found by Him - depending on how you look at it) and those who haven't. The Apostle Paul said to his mates in Corinth: '...God, who said, &quot;Let light shine out of darkness,&quot; made His light shine in our hearts...' (2 Corinthians 4:6 NIV) Maybe today you could pray for your friends who have not yet had their lives brightened by God, that they would suddenly see what it's all about.<br />SoulFood: Lev 23:26-25:55, Luke 21:29-38, Ps 50:16-23, Pr 10: 4-7]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Cast your burden on the Lord...' Psalm 55:22 NKJ<br />You know all that spam that finds its way into your inbox? Stuff like: 'Marine sale now on: 10% off shark kidneys.' You'd be daft not to hit the delete button - it's stuff you really don't need in your crowded life. And yet in life, we can allow a lot of 'spam' to filter in without ever hitting delete.<br />Troubles come our way and we should just hand them over to God - after all, His Word says, 'Cast your burden on the Lord.' But what do we do? We choose to keep them in our 'inbox' - we struggle with sleepless nights, we let them grind down our health, we become worry-warts.<br />In Psalm 46:10 NIV, God says: 'Be still, and know that I am God...' In this instance, the command to 'be still' comes from the Hebrew word for 'to let go' or 'give up'. You've struggled long enough now - give your burden to the Burden Bearer. Let it go. Here's what you could do: (1) Sit and sweat over it. Let it become the focus of all your thinking until your head explodes like an Icelandic volcano. Or (2) 'Don't worry about anything; instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need, and thank Him for all He has done.' (Philippians 4:6 NLT)<br />SoulFood: Gen 12:1-3, Heb 9:11-15, Jn 8:46-59]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Make allowance for each other's faults...' Colossians 3:13 NLT<br />Imagine you're playing a game of footy or doing a dance class. In front of you, you have a choice of two pairs of shoes: top of the range, high-tech, lightweight super-duper shoes or a really old, heavy lead pair with chain laces. Which do you choose? The first pair, right? So, when it comes to feeling low when someone's hacked you off, why would you choose not to forgive? It's like choosing the lead shoes - they'll weigh you down and stop you doing your best in the 'game' that is your life.<br />By choosing to forgive, it's like chucking away those ugly heavy shoes and grabbing the high-tech pair - you'll find the game goes much more smoothly. Just like lead shoes, unforgiveness will hold you back and slow you down in your walk with God.<br />You may still ask: 'Why should I forgive?' Not because <em>word4U2day </em>is telling you to, but because God is. Jesus said, '...be reconciled to your brother' (Matthew 5:24 NIV) - that means it's your job to make things right. Should you wait for them to make the first move? No. Paul says, 'Make every effort to live in peace with all men...' (Hebrews 12:14 NIV) You have to bite the bullet. Finally, don't stop with forgiveness, but 'pray for those who mistreat you.' (Luke 6:28 NIV) When you do, God will give you the strength and grace to truly forgive, and leave those lead shoes behind once and for all.<br />SoulFood: Lev 21:1-23:25, Luke 21-25-28, Ps 50:1-15, Pr 10:3]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Make allowance for each other's faults...' Colossians 3:13 NLT<br />How annoying (or embarrassing) would it be if you were only known by the stuff from your past? Everyone calls you a thief, coz one time you took something that wasn't yours. You're a bully because you hit someone when you were seven. You're a liar coz you once told your teacher you hadn't done your homework coz your gran was ill. How unfair would that be? You've changed since then. Everyone knows that. Everyone changes, don't they?<br />So, try to remember that next time someone else hurts you. God can change anyone! You're not doing anyone any favours by holding a grudge or bad-mouthing them.<br />Here's the thing - you don't get to choose who you forgive. Love is a command; forgiveness is an act of obedience. 1 John 4:21 NIV says 'whoever loves God must also love his brother.' To love someone, you must forgive them. Tough stuff, hey? God sets the bar high coz grudges and unforgiveness are like a virus that eats you up from the inside. Forgiveness is the miracle cure. God knows it's hard when someone really hurts you, but check out Romans 6:14. You've got His Spirit living in you, and He'll give you the grace to forgive if you ask for it.<br />Remember - people change over time. Try to see everyone through God's eyes. Most people are doing their best with what they know now - so give 'em a break! God's not finished with them yet - just like He's not finished with you!<br />SoulFood: Lev 18-20, Luke 21:12-24, Ps 25:16-22, Pr 10:2]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I am...discouraged, but I will remember You...' Psalm 42:6 NLT<br />Feeling blue? Fed up? Stressed out? Just plain sad? Things aren't going your way, and you're a bit low about it? That's normal. Don't panic! God's in control. Here are five handy hints to help you when you're down:<br />(1) Look in. Ask God to show you why you feel like rubbish. Maybe you've got anger bottled up, you're jealous of a mate, you're worn out or unforgiveness is wearing you thin? Be ready for what God says to you.<br />(2) Look up. Check out Psalm 42:5. David says he'll hope in God and praise Him. Don't focus on your problems, but on God, who can sort them out.<br />(3) Look back. In today's verse, David remembers God's faithfulness in the past. And all through Joseph's story, we see him grabbing hold of the fact that God is in control of his destiny. Joe knew God would provide, as He always had.<br />(4) Know you don't have to 'get it'. God 'causes all things to work together for good.' (Romans 8:28 NAS) He doesn't say we'll always understand. It's amazing how much more things make sense later, when you look back. Sometimes, you just have to trust God - you'll be glad you did.<br />(5) Don't be a bitter lemon. It's easy to get bitter when you think God's left you - but He hasn't. Remember - 'if God is for us, who can be against us?' (Romans 8:31 NIV) He's on your side, He knows best, and He will come through for you.<br />SoulFood: Ex 12:1-14, Matt 26:1-29, 1 Cor 11: 20-34, Ps 49]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['... set free...[from] the fear of dying.' Hebrews 2:15 NLT<br />One thing that each and every one of us in this little corner of the universe has in common is death. You can bet your life that one day you'll die. And yet death has become a taboo subject. We put all our effort on the treadmill hoping a good ticker will keep us going. We swallow pills and down bottles of medicine hoping that science will keep the grim reaper at bay. We ply all our energies into life, even though we're on this earth for what - 80 years? - but forget that God designed life to be a whole lot longer than that.<br />Ok, so talking about death isn't going to make you Mr Popular at a party, but don't we need to get the conversation going on the dreaded 'd' word? You see, this is where faith in Jesus positively explodes with answers and good news. When we die, we don't just rot in a box covered with dirt, or as organs left to science.<br />No, we get Jesus who 'brings eternal life...' (Romans 5:21 NIV) We get to live with God himself and 'He will wipe every tear from their eyes.' (Revelation 21:4 NIV) If we stake our faith on Jesus, 'we will also live with him.' (Romans 6:8 NIV) So break the taboo and see people set free from the fear of dying.<br />SoulFood: Lev 15-17, Luke 21:8-11, Ps 25:8-15, Pr 10:1]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I confessed all my sins...my rebellion...' Psalm 32:5 NLT<br />There's a mailbox hidden deep in the sand dunes on an island off the coast of America, where people post their deepest, darkest secrets. These are the things they'd never share with family or friends, but that are dragging them down. The people who travel to Bird Island find that leaving their anonymous notes in the middle of nowhere helps them finally feel free.<br />Did you know you don't have to do that? You don't even have to leave your bedroom to get rid of what's dragging you down. All you have to do is talk to God. He's just waiting with open ears to hear what you need to tell Him.<br />What's even better is that no matter what it is, once you've told God and said sorry, then that's it, it's gone. There's no record of what you said in a mailbox somewhere. It's not like the film Bruce Almighty where there's a massive filing cabinet with all your secrets in it, just waiting for anyone to look at. It's not even like a blackboard or whiteboard that, even when you wipe it clean, you can still see faintly what was written.<br />It's more like an Etch-a-sketch - remember them? When you 'write down' on there what you're telling God, He shakes it up and it's completely clean. There's no trace whatsoever of what was there before. It's gone. How awesome is that? So don't bottle stuff up - own up, and let God wipe the slate clean for you.<br />SoulFood: Lev 13:38-14:57, Luke 21:1-7, Ps 25:1-7, Pr 9:17-18]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...You desire truth in the inner parts...' Psalm 51:6 NIV<br />Are you afraid of being a Humpty Dumpty, scared that if you ever let yourself fall apart, you'll never get put back together again? You try all sorts of things to make sure no one sees how you're really doing: tell little lies, bury yourself in shopping, computer games, clothes or makeup, hide if you're having a bad day, pick on other people's insecurities - anything to stop you falling apart.<br />But do you know something? You can't hide from God. He knows what's going on, but He wants you to tell Him about it, being truthful with Him, in everything 'from the inside out'. That means being truthful with others too. God wants you to be real, transparent. He loves it when you're honest, and you'll find that your real friends do too. If you're honest with them, you'll find they'll start to be honest with you - and you'll end up with a much deeper, stronger friendship as a result.<br />You might think: 'But if God sees the real me, and my friends find out what I'm really like, I'll just fall apart, won't I?' No, you won't. Why? God's the King of Kings, and He doesn't need horses or men to put you back together - He can do it Himself. And you'll be better off at the end of it. No cracks, no chips - you'll be as good as new. He's just waiting for you to let Him put you back together again. Go on, give honesty a go.<br />SoulFood: Lev 11:1-13:37, Luke 20:41-47, Ps 32, Pr 9:10-16]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He chose them to become like His Son...' Romans 8:29 NLT<br />Have you ever thought it'd be great if your mates looked up to you and wanted to be like you? Maybe you've imagined them saying, 'I wanna be like them, coz they're so popular' or 'they wear the best clothes' or 'they make everyone laugh' or 'they're so like Jesus' or... Hang on a minute, what was that last one? Is it possible your mates would look up to you because you're so like Jesus? Well actually, that's what God wants us to be like - His Son. The only reason we should want people to look up to us is so they see us reflecting Jesus Himself. But how does that work?<br />Bill was a homeless drunk, with a reputation and no hope - until he became a Christian at a mission. Afterwards, he stayed and helped out there, cleaning up vomit, scrubbing toilets, and helping the homeless in off the streets - all without grumbling, showing love and gratitude. One night, the boss of the mission gave an evangelistic talk, and one of the regulars came forward, praying, 'Oh God, make me like Bill!'<br />The boss went over to him, and said 'Wouldn't it be better if you prayed, &quot;Make me like Jesus&quot;?' The guy thought about it, then looked up and said, 'Is he like Bill?' He hadn't quite got it - but Bill totally had. He lived like Jesus, so that others could see Jesus in Him. And that's what you should aim for too - try and be a Jesus mirror today.<br />SoulFood: 2 Kings 5:1-27, Matt 6:19-34, Acts 5:1-11]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Shamgar...killed six hundred...Philistines with an ox goad.' Judges 3:31 NKJ<br />If you like all things gruesome then Judges is the book for you. It's full of gory tales like King Eglon in Judges 3 who was stabbed to death and was so fat that 'The fat closed over the blade so that he could not draw the dagger out.' (Judges 3:22 KJV) In the next chapter, Sisera was killed by a woman called Jael: 'She drove the (tent) peg through his temple into the ground, and he died.' (Judges 4:21 NIV)<br />But Judges is also a book of God's amazing love and forgiveness. Even though God's people keep messing up, God never stops forgiving and helping them get back on track. And He used anyone who was ready and willing. Shamgar was one of those people. There's only one verse in the Bible that mentions what he did. However what got Shamgar included in the Bible was not so much what he did but his attitude.<br />Shamgar was someone ready to be used by God any time, anywhere. He could have complained and said, '600 to 1 and all I've got is a stick? You're having a laugh, aren't you? Pick someone else, will ya!' But he didn't.<br />What about you? Are you ready to be used by God any time, anywhere to do whatever He asks, or do you have a bag full of excuses?<br />SoulFood: Lev 8-10, Luke 20:34-40, Ps 72:12-20, Pr 9:7-9]]></introtext>

'Mum, she's wearing my clothes again!' 'Why is it always me who does the dishes?' 'Hey, I was watching that, turn it back!'<br />And so we could go on. Growing up with brothers and sisters can be hard: competition, tension, fighting and arguing are daily occurrences. It's always been that way.<br />Go right back to Genesis and you'll find it there too. Jacob and Esau were twins born to Isaac and Rebecca. Esau was born first, which in those days meant that he would inherit everything from his dad. Jacob was jealous and was always fighting with Esau about it, until one day, just before their dad died, Jacob tricked their dad - so he got everything, not Esau.<br />Jacob was chuffed with himself until he found out Esau was so mad he wanted to kill him. Knowing his brother was serious, Jacob made a quick exit! Years later when they met up again, Jacob was still convinced his brother would kill him. But when they met, 'Esau ran to meet him and embraced him...and kissed him.' (Genesis 33:4 NKJ) Jacob burst out crying, he couldn't believe his brother had chosen to forgive him: 'What a relief...to see your friendly smile. It is like seeing the smile of God!'<br />Learn from Esau, and when people wrong you, forgive them. Hug and smile and let them see the 'face of God'. Yes, even your brothers and sisters!<br />SoulFood: Lev 1-4, Luke 20:20-26, Ps 31, Pr 8:34-36]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Lazy people want much but get little, but those who work hard will prosper.' Proverbs 13:4 NLT<br />By the time she was 16, Romana Bañuelos had been deserted by her husband and left to raise her two children alone. Living in Mexico, she was poverty-stricken, untrained in any profession and unable to speak English. But that didn't stop her. She had a dream - one she refused to let go of. With only a few dollars in her pocket she headed for Los Angeles, where she used her last seven dollars to take a taxi to the home of a distant relative.<br />Romana refused to live on the charity of others. Immediately she found a job washing dishes, followed by a second job making tortillas from midnight until 6 am. From her two jobs she was able to save $500 which she used to invest in her own tortilla machine. Over time, and with a great deal of hard work and study, she became the owner of Ramona's Mexican Food Products, the largest Mexican food products business in the world. And that's not all. She was hand-picked by President Richard Nixon to become the thirty-fourth United States Treasurer.<br />Whether you flip burgers or design web pages, whether you have a little or a lot, remember these words: 'Lazy people want much but get little, but those who work hard will prosper.' (Proverbs 13:4 NLT) God will add His blessing to your best effort so today give it all you've got!<br />SoulFood: 2 Thess 1-3, Luke 20:9-19, Ps 6, Pr 8:32-33]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['You have been wandering around...long enough; turn...' Deuteronomy 2:3 NLT<br />Having a GPS is great. What did drivers do before they were invented? Drive around for hours, entering stress city, in the hope that they'd somehow stumble across their destination? Thanks to the invention of our friendly TomTom and other satellite navigation systems, drivers can now relax while their route is plotted for them and a friendly voice calmly speaks each direction: 'In 200 m, turn right'.<br />If you've ever had the unfortunate pleasure of being lost in a car without GPS, you won't need convincing how helpful they are. What's especially fantastic about this genius technology is that even if the driver goes off-route, the GPS just recalculates and gets them back on track.<br />If only life were that simple. If only we had someone calculating the best way for our lives, to avoid us going round in circles and getting nowhere. If only we had someone to quickly get us back on track when we shoot off in the wrong direction.<br />Actually we don't have to say 'if only'. Jesus said, 'I am the Way and the Truth and the Life.' (John 14:6 NLT) Jesus is like our personal GPS; showing us the right way to go - directing, guiding, telling us the truth about how to live right so we avoid painful mistakes, providing everything we need for our life. Our worries can be over. If you've been travelling without Jesus, do a U-Turn: 'You have been wandering around...long enough; turn...'<br />SoulFood: Esther 5-10, Luke 20:1-8, Ps 18:1-29, Pr 26:24-27]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Live joyfully with the wife whom you love...' Ecclesiastes 9:9 NKJ<br />Now if you're single and don't want to be, talking about relationships and marriage can totally 'do your head in'. It's easy to run out of patience, thinking God doesn't understand, that He's ignoring you or not giving you who you need. If we've been asking for His help and nothing's happened, it can leave us feeling unfairly treated and we can stop trusting God, thinking He doesn't care about us. The thing is, when we try to get ahead of God we end up with regrets - we make mistakes that can be devastating, heartbreaking.<br />Before you were born, God knew you: 'You made all the delicate, inner parts of my body and knit me together in my mother's womb. Thank you for making me so wonderfully complex!' (Psalm 139: 13-14 NLT) God gave you certain traits and abilities that make you unique. He knows exactly who you would need to help fulfil His purposes and develop the gifts He's given you. Until that happens, remember: He is your spiritual partner! He's been caring for you all along: protecting you, providing for you and directing your steps. He's not going to stop now.<br />Stop wrestling with your singleness and use this time to develop your relationship with God. Ruth in the Bible kept on trusting in God, no matter how difficult life got. There's a whole book named after her, so read her story - be encouraged discovering how God brought a husband to her in the most extraordinary and seemingly impossible of circumstances.<br />SoulFood: Esther 1-4, Luke 19:45-48, Ps 69:19-36, Pr 8:30-31]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Live joyfully with the wife whom you love...' Ecclesiastes 9:9 NKJ<br />It's easy to become very cynical when we read a verse from the Bible about marriage - after all, doesn't divorce seem more or less inevitable in our culture? The Australian Bureau of Statistics tells us that over forty percent of marriages end within ten years.<br />God says, 'Live happily with the [one] you love...' But if in your family your mum and dad are always arguing, or are already divorced, this verse can just seem unimportant, a joke, unrealistic. It can even make you feel really sad. Perhaps you would like to have parents who 'live happily' (as long as they don't hold hands or kiss in public, of course!) but instead find yourself in the middle of a battleground. Or perhaps you have friends whose parents are always 'at each other's throat'. Situations like these can be torturous and divorce is always a very painful time for everyone involved. Perhaps you have already had to cope watching your parents split up, or are going through this right now?<br />Today, God wants to remind you that His best for us is always that we have great relationships, but when we don't go the way He's planned He's still there with us, loving us. He promises; 'I will be with you... I will not fail you or abandon you.' (Joshua 1:5 NLT) So today: 'Give your worries to the Lord, and He will take care of you. He will never let good people down.' (Psalm 55:22 NCV)<br />SoulFood: Lev 27:30-33, Num 31:48-54, 1 Cor 16:1-3, 2 Cor 9:1-15]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Live joyfully with the wife whom you love...' Ecclesiastes 9:9 NKJ<br />Getting ready to go out can take ages, can't it? A few hours soaking in a hot bubble bath, plucking, waxing, and preening. Then it's time for the hairdryer, the straighteners, the creams, the make-up, the irresistible scent - and blokes, we're almost ready for a night on the town!<br />And girls - we're just the same, with the final decision being: 'What shall I wear?' We've spent the whole day shopping and our rooms now have clothes piled everywhere and belts, scarves and jewellery hanging off everything including doors, wardrobes and some poor unsuspecting teddy bear. And we still end up crying, 'I've got nothing to wear!' Finally after about 100 outfit changes we're ready to go out. It's only taken five hours - but, hey, we're worth the wait.<br />We can put so much effort into getting ready - yet so little effort into building relationships. Within five minutes of meeting up with our friends we're behaving as reckless as everyone else, falling for every cheesy chat-up line that's around. We put all that time and energy into looking good on the outside, but so little effort goes into who we are on the inside. We scan the room looking for that suitable guy or girl - caring only how they look, not who they are. God invented relationships. But He knows that good relationships can only happen when we take notice of what is on the inside too.<br />SoulFood: Job 35-37, Luke 19:20-27, Ps 38:1-12, Pr 8:22-23]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['&quot;Test me in this,&quot; says the Lord...' Malachi 3:10 NIV<br />We think nothing about forking out five bucks for a burger, $80 for a concert ticket or even $180 for a new pair of trainers. Sit in church while the collection plate passes by, however, and we're scratching around for a bit of loose change to chuck in. What is that about? Why do we find it difficult to give our money to God? We're happy to pay to go see the new box office hit at the cinema - but church?<br />God wants us to be generous in all aspects of our life, just like Him, and when we do, we open ourselves up to a whole new world of excitement - honestly! Listen, amidst Jesus talking about loving our enemies He also says; 'Give and you will receive. Your gift will return to you in full-pressed down, shaken together to make room for more, running over, and poured into your lap...' (Luke 6:38 NLT)<br />Psalm 24:1 NLT says 'The earth is the Lord's, and everything in it.' Therefore what you have belongs to God. None of it is yours really and God wants you to be generous with all He's given you. So give the folding stuff next time you're in church, and no walking past the guys collecting for third world children. And fork out for a friend's take-away too, not just your own. Be generous and see what God does: '&quot;Test me in this,&quot; says the Lord.'<br />SoulFood: Job 15-17, Luke 17:20-37, Ps 19, Pr 8:6-7]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...And he who believes in [...relies on] the Son has [now possesses] eternal life.' John 3:36 AMP<br />There's a story about a wealthy English Baron named Fitzgerald who had only one child, a son. Early in his teens, the boy's mother died. Tragically, in his late teens, the boy died also. In the meantime, Fitzgerald's financial holdings greatly increased as a result of acquiring the artwork of Europe's greatest masters.<br />Before his death, Fitzgerald left explicit instructions that an auction be held at which his entire art collection would be sold. A big crowd of prospective buyers gathered. The artwork was displayed for viewing before the auction began. Among the paintings was one that received little attention. It was of poor quality and by an unknown local artist. It happened to be a portrait of Fitzgerald's only son. As the auction began the auctioneer read from Fitzgerald's will, which clearly instructed that the first painting to be sold was of 'my beloved son'.<br />Because of its poor quality the painting didn't receive any bids - except one. The bidder was the old servant who'd helped raise the boy and had dearly loved him. For less than a dollar he bought the painting. At that point the auctioneer stopped the bidding and asked the lawyer to read again from the will. The crowd was hushed as he read, 'Whoever purchases this painting of my son gets all my art collection - the auction is over!'<br />Jesus: without Him you have nothing. But with Him you have the best of both worlds: this one, and the one to come.<br />SoulFood: Job 11-14, Luke 17:11-19, Ps 11, Pr 8:4-5]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...the number of the disciples multiplied greatly...' Acts 6:7 NKJ<br />In the book of Acts, you can read all about how the church started (a pretty amazing story by the way, so make plans to read it). Things hit a rocky patch, though, when the church leaders realised they were getting involved in doing some admin stuff that left no time for doing what only they - and no one else - could do. They learned that they needed to delegate this admin stuff to others, and get on with what God had really called them to do. As a result, the church grew big time: 'The number of the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem.'<br />Locked up inside of you is God-given potential. You have the potential to be the best you there is. No one else on the entire planet can do that-only you.<br />But it's so easy to keep that potential locked up inside, by focusing on what you can't do instead of what you can. You might find yourself thinking, 'I can't do that - it's so unfair,' 'I'm not good at that, I don't know why I bother,' 'Oh, why can't I be more like them?'<br />Focus on what you can do and you'll release the power of potential to be the best you there is. Stop moaning about what you're not and start concentrating on what you are. What can I do? What can I give? How can I help? You'll be amazed at what that God-given potential power inside you becomes.<br />SoulFood: Job 8-10, Luke 17:1-10, Ps 115, Pr 8:1-3]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Live purposefully...' Ephesians 5:15 AMP<br />If you are a people pleaser, then you have a people pleaser problem! People pleasers can fall into any of these six traps: (1) Become easily distracted - by what everyone else is doing; (2) Become easily persuaded - by other people's opinions and ideas; (3) Become miserable - trying to keep everyone else happy; (4) Never reach their potential - as they're too busy doing what everyone else wants them to do; (5) Have no real direction in life - because they're busy following everyone else around; and (6) Lose their own identity - because they become who everyone else wants them to be.<br />God says, 'Live purposefully.' He says, 'For I know the plans I have for you... plans for good and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope.' (Jeremiah 29:11 NLT) If all we do is people-please, we will miss out on God's best for us.<br />Mark Twain (the guy who wrote the classic books Huckleberry Finn and The Adventures of Tom Sawyer) once said, 'The secret of success is to make your vocation your vacation.' In other words, love what you do and do what you love! God wants you to focus on who He has made you and to enjoy being you, using the gifts He's given you.<br />So people-pleasing is out and God-pleasing is in. Are you courageous enough to follow your heart rather than the crowd?<br />SoulFood: Job 5-7, Luke 16:19-31, Ps 26, Pr 7:26-27]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Now the Lord...said to Abram...' Genesis 12:1 NKJ<br />How many times have you been promised something that never happens? Not good, is it? At the very least you feel let down and disappointed. If it happens a lot, it can cause us to stop believing in promises, never trust them, and refuse to take them seriously. After all, you don't want to be made to look like a fool, do you? No point in believing something that will never happen!<br />Abraham's life shows us that God's promises are different. When God promises, He delivers. God gave Abe and his wife Sarah some pretty massive promises. Some of them seemed totally ridiculous - like when God promised Sarah she would have a baby when she was 90 years old! (Honestly - go look for yourself in Genesis 17-18.)<br />When God hands out a promise, He means it, satisfaction guaranteed. With God there's no backing out, stepping down or trying to wriggle out of it. God gave Abe promises that totally baffled him, but filled him with hope for his future. Promises that he could hardly believe, but left him waiting expectantly. Abe trusted in God's promises and He wasn't disappointed. Every one came true.<br />God has made hundreds of promises to you in the Bible - promises you can believe in. Here are two of them: 'I will never fail you. I will never abandon you' (Hebrews 13:5 NLT) and 'For God loved the world so much that He gave His one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish but have eternal life.' (John 3:16 NIV)<br />SoulFood: Ps 51, Mk 8:34-38]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Now the Lord...said to Abram...' Genesis 12:1 NKJ<br />We all want to be in a relationship, don't we? The guys may pretend they'd rather hang around with their mates and girls may pretend it doesn't matter - 'we don't care.' But deep down, go on admit it, you want to be in a relationship. But relationships aren't all lovey-dovey gooeyness though - they take time and effort.<br />Abraham discovered that the best relationship to have was a relationship with God. Abraham knew God: he put the time and effort in to get to know Him and recognise His voice. 'Now the Lord...said to Abram: &quot;Get out of your country, from your family and from your father's house, to a land that I will show you.&quot;' (Genesis 12:1 NKJ)<br />Abe didn't have a Bible to read, and there were no prophets around to say, 'Thus saith the Lord.' Getting it right was critical. He was being asked to leave everything. He needed to know that the voice he was hearing was truly God's voice. We know that Abe trusted what he heard, so we can be sure that he knew God and what His voice sounded like. And if it's possible for Abe, it's possible for you too.<br />People can help you understand more about God, but it's up to you to learn to hear from God for yourself. Abe knew that nothing increases your confidence like hearing from God and knowing exactly what He's asking you to do. So listen and get to know the voice of God for yourself.<br />SoulFood: Job 1-4, Luke 16:1-18, Ps 24, Pr 7:24-25]]></introtext>

When things go wrong or when we fail, it can feel like life is over. It's too late, you've missed it, missed your chance, missed your moment, missed the mark - opportunity has passed you by! If you've been there, done that, got the T-shirt - then Abraham's going to cheer you up today.<br />Abe reminds us that when you've got God in your life, opportunity has never passed you by. Any moment, at any time, God can change things - taking you further than you've dreamed, bringing new and better prospects into your life.<br />When we're hanging out with God, holding fast to His ways, not ours, we don't have to promote or protect ourselves, God will do it for us. 'He permitted no man to do them wrong; yes, He rebuked kings for their sakes, saying, &quot;Do not touch My anointed ones...&quot;' (1 Chronicles 16:21-22 NKJ)<br />When God's in your life, no exam, teacher, boss, or personal failure can stop you or steal what God has planned for you. So give God all of yourself - no matter how much of a failure that looks sometimes - and see what He can do with it! '...the Lord appeared to Abram, and said to him, &quot;I am Almighty God; walk before me, and be blameless.&quot;' (Genesis 17:1 NKJ)<br />He's saying the same to you.<br />SoulFood: Ex 39-40, Luke 15:11-32, Ps 135, Pr 7:21-23]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Lazy people are soon poor; hard workers get rich.' Proverbs 10:4 NLT<br />Given the choice, I think most of us would prefer to sit at home watching TV or playing computer games, never having to cook, clean or tidy up after ourselves. But God says 'Lazy hands make a man poor, but diligent hands bring wealth.'<br />Now God's not necessarily saying that if you're broke you're suffering from lazy-itis, but He is saying, 'Don't become a couch potato - do stuff - make an effort.' God knows it's important for us to be active because He made us that way.<br />When God first made people, 'The Lord God placed the man in the Garden of Eden to tend and watch over it.' (Genesis 2:15 NLT) Get involved and your life will become rich in more ways than one. Work hard and you'll feel good about yourself; you'll find purpose and fulfilment; you'll respect yourself and gain the respect of others; you'll unleash your potential as you accomplish new things.<br />Notice how God never chooses couch potatoes and not once did Jesus call on lazy people, or those sitting around waiting for their 'big break'. In Luke 5, Jesus says, 'Follow me and be my disciple' to Simon Peter, James and John whilst they were fishing, and Matthew while he was collecting taxes. So do all you can to stop being a 'Lazy Annie' or 'Sloth-like Harry'. Be active and see how rich and full your life becomes.<br />SoulFood: Ex 36-38, Luke 15:1-10, Ps 27, Pr 7:10-20]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Honour the Lord our God. Worship at His feet. He is holy.' Psalm 99:5 NIV<br />If you support an AFL or league team, you'll have an idea of what it means to worship something. Every game, thousands of fans gather to watch in awe as their team runs onto the ground. They sing, chant, wave their hands, and when their team scores, they go ballistic - jumping up and down, whoop-whooping and hugging each other.<br />Avid fans follow their team everywhere, wear the team shirts and they want to know everything about them. They're constantly talking about them and discussing the ins and outs of the latest match. Even in the bleakest of times they never stop cheering on their team - always believing and hoping in them.<br />But as great as sport is, the Bible tells us we should honour God. The one we should be cheering on the most, whoop-whooping to the loudest, talking about constantly and including in everything, is God.<br />When we worship God more than anything else, it keeps God massive and us little, and that's the way it should be. When we worship God, we recognise that He is all-powerful and we stop worrying; that He's always there, so we never feel alone; that He's forever approachable, so we tell Him everything knowing He'll never turn us away; that He's in charge, so we feel secure; that He's our provider, so we can be generous; that He's faithful, so we trust Him; that He's awesome, so we tell others about Him; that He's beautiful, so we choose to become like Him.<br />SoulFood: Ex 33-35, Luke 14:25-35, Ps 112, Pr 7:6-9]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['My soul, wait silently for God...' Psalm 62:5 NKJ<br />You're standing at the bus stop but the bus doesn't arrive - what do you do? Or you're stuck in the queue at the checkout behind that woman who's got 17 items in the 'Express' lane (she should only have 15!) and she's chatting away to the girl on the till. Or you call to get that phone plan upgrade only to hear 'Your call is important to us...' - again! How annoying - we don't like to be kept waiting. Unless...<br />You're queuing up for that sports match or concert - that's worth the wait. You've got your ticket, you know you'll get in, you've got your seat. It's worth the wait, all part of the process, it's really not a problem.<br />Being a Christian is sometimes about waiting - waiting for God! But just like waiting for that bus, waiting can sometimes seem really frustrating, like we're wasting time or missing out on something. But when we learn to trust God, waiting for Him is more like standing in the queue to go to that concert or footy match. We know the waiting is worthwhile because something really good will come out of it.<br />Two verses to encourage you in the waiting: 'I waited patiently for the Lord to help me, and He turned to me and heard my cry...' (Psalm 40:1 NLT) and '...those who wait on the Lord shall renew their strength.' (Isaiah 40:31 NKJ)<br />So instead of running around like a headless chook, becoming panic-stricken like a demented goose or stressing out like a hooked barramundi, relax. 'My soul, wait silently for God.'<br />SoulFood: Ex 30-32, Luke 14:15-24, Ps 106:24-48, Pr 7:3-5]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...forgiving one another...even as Christ forgave you...' Colossians 3:13 NKJ<br />'I hate her!' 'Did you see the way she looked at me?' 'You are so gonna regret this!' 'This time you have gone too far!'<br />How often do you say and think stuff like that instead of, 'I forgive you'? Revenge tactics seem to automatically kick in. We'll even hold a grudge against someone we don't know because of something we might have heard about them. When we've been wronged, we want to get back at that person and we'll choose the most public of places to do it. Facebook, YouTube, texts, gossip at the tuck shop - we'll use any way we can to bring them down.<br />What is that about? Why is it we always want to do the opposite of what God says: '...forgiving one another... even as Christ forgave you'? I mean it's not like that's too difficult to understand, is it? Ok, some bits of the Bible can just wreck your head with complicatedness! But not this bit: 'forgive as Jesus forgives me'. Simples!<br />When we don't do what God asks us, it's like we're saying, 'I don't trust You, God. My way is better than Yours.' In Luke 6:37 NIV, Jesus says, 'Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.' If we want to be forgiven then we need to forgive. So don't question it, ignore it or forget about it. Just do it! Simple.<br />SoulFood: Ex 28-29, Luke 14:1-14, Ps 106:1-23, Pr 7:1-2]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Work willingly at whatever you do, as though...for the Lord...' Colossians 3:23 NLT<br />Do you ever notice how people make certain jobs appear more important than others? Perhaps you do the same? Think you'll be a 'nothing' or a 'nobody' until you're a world class AFL player, top model, pop megastar or Nobel Peace Prize winner? Is the thought of working in Macca's or mowing lawns to earn a bit of extra cash beneath you?<br />Perhaps you feel pressured by teachers and parents saying, 'You must aim higher!' Or perhaps you'd really like to follow your passion for music, dance, or drama but keep being told: 'It's a waste of time - that's not a proper job.' Perhaps you think you need to get a God-type job, like worship leader, youth pastor, missionary or minister - and you couldn't possibly follow your dream of working with computers!<br />But imagine a world without fast food places, supermarkets, receptionists, theatres, cut grass... someone needs to do all these jobs. Our world is full of variety - that's what makes it good! It's not what you do that matters most to God, it's how you work at what you do.<br />The Bible says, whatever you do, you should do it well - as though you were doing it for God Himself. God created us all with different gifts, talents and abilities. He wants you to do what you're good at, something you enjoy. So follow your dreams and 'work as for the Lord'.<br />SoulFood: Ex 20:7, Lev 24:10-16, Phil 2:5-11]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Lord demands fairness in...business... He sets the standard.' Proverbs 16:11 NLT<br />If someone were to ask you today, 'Are you honest?' what would your answer be? Would you answer straightaway: 'I'm totally honest me!' or would you hesitate, wondering how best to answer, because you know deep down that you're not always truthful?<br />'The Lord demands fairness in...business...' (Proverbs 16:11 NLT) That means whatever you're up to, whatever you get yourself into, God makes it His business too. And whatever you're doing, whoever you're speaking to, He wants you to be honest. In fact, did you know that God hates lying? '...the Lord...cannot stand...a lying tongue, hands that kill innocent people, a mind that thinks up evil...' (Proverbs 6: 16-18 NCV)<br />In Matthew 21:28-31 NLT, Jesus tells a story: 'A man with two sons told the older boy, &quot;Son, go out and work in the vineyard today.&quot; The son answered, &quot;No, I won't go,&quot; but later he changed his mind and went anyway. Then the father told the other son, &quot;You go,&quot; and he said, &quot;Yes, sir, I will.&quot; But he didn't go. Which of the two obeyed his father?' They replied, &quot;The first.&quot;'<br />Even though both sons lied, it was their hearts that showed their real attitude. We may be able to fool others and get away with it, but we can't fool God. 'People judge by outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.' (1 Samuel 16:7 NLT) Whatever you're up to today, make sure your heart attitude is switched on to God.<br />SoulFood: Ex 25-27, Luke 13:18-35, Ps 136, Pr 6:30-35]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...My Father never stops working, and so I keep working, too.' John 5:17 NCV<br />Can you imagine what it would be like if everywhere you went you ran into someone you didn't like? What a nightmare that would be! At a party, out shopping in town, in school - there they are. Just when you think it couldn't get any worse, this person turns up at your house to eat your food and sit on your sofa. That's the kind of situation you find yourself in when you don't like yourself. Everywhere you go, you're there - you can't get away from yourself, not even for a minute. You're heading for a sad life.<br />God thinks you are extremely precious - did you know that? - and all the time God is working on your behalf. Jesus told us, 'My Father never stops working, and so I keep working, too'. Every moment of every day He is working to keep gravity going, so the universe holds itself together for you. He holds the stars in place at night and makes the sun rise and set at the right time - just for you. You are that important to Him.<br />He likes you so much that He can't stop being around you. He even gets on the heavenly karaoke for you: 'The Lord your God...is always with you. He celebrates and sings because of you, and He will refresh your life with His love.' (Zephaniah 3:17 CEV)<br />Enjoy you as much as God does. He says you're worth it!<br />SoulFood: Ex 22-24, Luke 13:1-17, Ps 77, Pr 6:29]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...When he was still a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion [on him]...' Luke 15:20 NKJ<br />Jesus told a story about the importance of being in relationship with God (read it in Luke 15:11-32). It begins with a son asking his dad for an inheritance even though dad hasn't died. He gets what he wants, flashes the cash, lives it up in a place far from home. Soon, the bank balance hits the red and the kid finds himself out on his own, far from where he used to be, reduced to desperate measures.<br />What's the problem here? Is it the taste for loose living? Is it that the money has run out? Or is it the kid finds himself half a world away from where he should be? Obviously, the taste for casinos, casual sex, drugs and alcohol are major symptoms but the root of the problem lies in where the runaway son has found himself - far away from his father's house. After all, would the kid be living a riotous life if he was in relationship with his father?<br />Does any of this strike a chord with you? Perhaps, the problem isn't your long list of wild party living antics - the real problem is you're no longer in relationship with God.<br />So, you've found yourself a long way from where you should be; you've done stuff you never dreamt you'd do. What now? Leave it all behind, start those first steps back to a relationship with God. He's seen you a long way off and He wants you back home. You'll find Him running towards you.<br />SoulFood: Ex 19-21, Luke 12:49-59, Ps 70, Pr 6:26-28]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...God loves a person who gives cheerfully.' 2 Corinthians 9:7 NLT<br />Maybe you learned this little lesson around the tuck shop at primary school when you offered a crisp to your fellow diners and before you knew it, all you had left was a bagful of salty crumbs: with giving there is always a cost.<br />Generosity is a class God wants us to take throughout life. The Bible is a textbook on kindness. Think about it: right from page one, God is giving. At first there's nothing, , zilch. Then God gives life (life to the universe, life to nature, life to humans, life to animals). Adam is without a co-worker so God gives an eye-pleasing equal. Abraham is without a home so God gives a promised land. Moses is without purpose so God gives a burning bush. Israel's without a hope so God gives a shepherd with a slingshot. The world's in need of saving so God gives His one and only Son.<br />There's no shortage of examples of God role-modelling generosity. Clearly it's important that we learn to live open-handedly.<br />So what does a person who gives cheerfully look like? He's the kind of guy who gives up his umbrella to stop a stranger from getting wet. She's the kind of girl who carries a pensioner's shopping, even if it means going in the opposite direction for a bit. He's the sort of bloke who gives away flowers to someone he's not trying to date. She's the anonymous girl posting an envelope of cash into her needy neighbour's letterbox. This is Christian behaviour from people who have grasped that giving is always more rewarding than getting.<br />SoulFood: Ex 16-18, Luke 12:35-48, Ps 66:13-20, Pr 6:23-25]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you...' Acts 1:8 NLT<br />During the dark ages, when games consoles meant wiring a cassette recorder to a ZX Spectrum in order to play 'Daley Thompson's Decathlon' (ask your Dad), power was in short supply. There was no memory card to save your accomplishments - once you unplugged, you lost all your hard work. The power we get from God, thankfully, isn't like a dodgy old ZX Spectrum.<br />God has UPS (geek-speak for uninterruptible power supply), which means when we get down on our knees there's always a constant source of power we can draw from. If you worry that you get tongue-tied when it comes to talking about your faith, Jesus has a UPS for you: 'When the Holy Spirit has come upon you, you will receive power to testify about Me with great effect.' (Acts1:8 TLB) If you're thinking of quitting because being a Christian brings a whole load of trouble, Jesus has UPS for you: 'For when your faith is tested, your endurance has a chance to grow. So let it grow, for when your endurance is fully developed, you will be strong in character and ready for anything...' (James 1:3 NLT)<br />And if you're feeling like your battery is completely drained or your hard drive has crashed, Jesus has UPS for you: 'Come to Me, all of you who are tired and have heavy loads, and I will give you rest.' (Matthew 11:28 NCV) Connect to the only true Power Supply.<br />SoulFood: Ex 13-15, Luke 12:22-34, Ps 66:1-12, Pr 6:20-22</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...the Lord's unfailing love surrounds the man who trusts in Him.' Psalm 32:10 NIV<br />What's going to be your slant today? Are you going to whinge about all the things you miss out on or are you going to adopt an 'attitude of gratitude' and give God thanks regardless of what comes your way? Paul reckons: 'In everything give thanks; for this is the will of God...for you.' (1 Thessalonians 5:18 NKJ) He could've whinged - after all he wrote those words from inside a prison cell - but his slant was based on his God, not his circumstance.<br />Maybe, today your slant could be sceptical: 'Here goes another day of struggling with the same old sins; another day of being young, broke and single; another day with nothing worth getting out of bed for.'<br />But flip that slant to faith and it becomes: 'Today, God will forgive and help me deal with my sins; today God will provide for me in ways I hadn't dreamed possible; today God can lift this dark cloud from me.'<br />Faith asks us to trust: 'The Lord's unfailing love surrounds those who trust in Him.' (Psalm 32:10 NIV) Perhaps, your slant on today will involve other people rubbing you up the wrong way. 'If she gives me that look again today - I'll give her something to look at,' or 'If I see him today, I'm gonna avoid him like the plague; he's soooo boring.' Or will those who bring out the worst in you today bring out the best from you? What's going to be your slant today?<br />SoulFood: Ex 10-12, Luke 12:13-21, Ps 61, Pr 6:16-19</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...do your work willingly...' Colossians 3:23 CEV<br />The difference between you and Michelangelo is not necessarily that he was an art genius and you can't even paint within the lines. It's dedication. See, Michelangelo was obsessive about his work; his sculpture masterpiece of David wasn't just knocked up over the weekend as homework, it was agonised over 24/7, 365. He didn't just pop into a craft shop for a bit of marble and start chiselling, either - he made hundreds and hundreds of sketches before even contemplating carving a bit of stone; he made mathematical calculation after calculation examining the best angles to approach each individual score of the marble.<br />Sure Michelangelo was in the gifted and talented set but he knew the difference between getting by with your minimum and channelling every scrap of energy into excellence. Maybe art isn't your thing, but the point is, you should try to paint a masterpiece in whatever you undertake.<br />Aim high. If you're a Christian - aim to be like Jesus. Sure you could get by doing the minimum: pew filling, learning the latest songs, slapping a Christian fish sticker on your dad's car. But you should aim bigger than that. Show people how to cooperate instead of compete or fight; bring out the God colours in the world; love the unlovable; hate injustice. Surpass the minimum standard - aim for the Jesus standard.<br />SoulFood: Ex 20:4-6, Ex 32:1-35, Is 44:6-21</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Those you allow to remain will become...thorns in your sides...' Numbers 33:55 NIV<br />Have you got a mess of a mate? The kind whose idea of a good night out ends with being passed out on the footpath? Or maybe a needy friend - the sort who drains every ounce of oomph out of you? Or the green-eyed type - they boil over if you so much as text someone else?<br />Of course we're to love our neighbour warts'n'all...but there may come a time in a relationship when the most loving thing you can do is let them go. If someone is dragging you back from living out your God-destiny - you need to release them.<br />Releasing somebody doesn't mean they'll never improve, it just means God is better suited to the job to helping them than you are. It's why God instructed the Israelites concerning the hostile nations in the Promised Land, 'Those you allow to remain will become...thorns in your sides.'<br />When a relationship is not working, when your efforts to rehabilitate it have failed, it's time to acknowledge it. Be careful around those who are always trying to make you feel guilty for not 'being there'. There's a difference between helping somebody and carrying them. Your help may actually be a hindrance. Why should they even try, if you're always there to do it for them? Pray for the right way forward between you and your mess of a mate - but don't expect easy answers; loving them may mean setting them free.<br />SoulFood: Ex 7-9, Luke 12:1-12, Ps 58, Pr 6:12-15</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...the Child grew and became strong...' Luke 2:40 NKJ<br />Did Mum tell the infant bedtime stories of how an angel flew down and made it known that she would conceive God's divine Son? Was the little Jewish kid rifling through Isaiah's predictions of a pregnant virgin giving birth to a boy who would answer to the name 'Immanuel'? Maybe the child was worlds away in dream-like prayers when God whispered the plan to Him.<br />We just don't know how Jesus put two and two together about His divine identity. However, by the time he was 12, He was fully clued up. After three days on the missing list, Mary and Joseph finally tracked Jesus down to Jerusalem's religious centre of operations. After Mum laid on the parental guilt trip, the not-quite-teen answered back, 'Didn't you know I had to be in My Father's house?' (Luke 2:49 NIV)<br />'My Father's house' - not 'the temple' not 'church' or 'synagogue'; Jesus clearly understood that His Father is God. So, with a clear sense of God's calling on His life, why didn't the boy kick off proceedings there and then? Why doesn't the Messiah story start to gather momentum - why is it another 18 years before Jesus goes public with His God assignment? Maybe one reason is that being a son, a brother, a carpenter and a 'family man' is the first step in His mission.<br />Perhaps, we could all adopt that attitude: our primary mission field is our home.<br />SoulFood: Ex 4-6, Luke 11:45-54, Ps 53, Pr 6:9-11</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.' Philippians 4:13 NKJ<br />When David first arrived at King Saul's palace he was a simple, shabby unknown kid with an advanced diploma in sheep. He had a skill for throwing stones on target yet this simple pebble-tossing opened a door to his future as the head of Israel's royal family. Lesson: God can take something small in your hands and make it enormous in His. <br />Yeah, you say, but don't you need qualifications and endorsements and all that before you can do anything full-size for God? David didn't own a pair of army boots, he hadn't scaled the balance beams and tunnel ropes of army training, he couldn't even fit into the uniform. All he did was believe in God and made himself available. <br />All God wants of you is a dose of faith and to be open to His offer. When you give God what you've got, He gives you what He's got and that makes your odds unbeatable. The Bible has promises to back this up: 'The Lord protects my life; I am afraid of no one.' (Psalm 27:1 NCV) '...be strong and steady, always enthusiastic about the Lord's work, for you know that nothing you do for the Lord is ever useless.' (1 Corinthians 15:58 NLT) 'I can do everything through Him who gives me strength.' (Philippians 4:13 NIV) 'I pray that you may prosper in all things and be in health, just as your soul prospers.' (3 John 2:1 NKJ)<br />SoulFood: Ex 1-3, Luke 11:29-44, Ps 40:9-17, Pr 6:6-8</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...who may enter your presence?...those who...do what is right.' Psalm 15:1-2 NLT<br />You know the kind of kid at school, the one who needs to wash his gob out with soap? Ever thought where his dirty language comes from? Chances are there's a role model at home spewing out the same sort of verbal filth he is.<br />Like it or not, the ways of our parents or guardians filter down to us. The Bible tells one or two stories along these lines. King David had so many areas of his life going for God, but he did have a weakness for the ladies. This weakness filtered down to his son, Solomon. During Solomon's reign as king, Israel continued to build and expand. Trouble was, Solomon developed a habit for walking down the aisle, collecting wives from all kinds of cultures, and these wives swayed him into being half-hearted with God.<br />By the time Rehoboam became king, it wasn't just the palace that had become half-hearted, it was the whole nation - so much so, the country split, never to reunite. The seeds of destruction could be traced back to a flaw in one man: David. His compromise weakened Solomon; Solomon's weakness impacted Rehoboam. A little unfaithfulness became the undoing of a whole nation. You see, the things we pretend don't matter really do. Our sin doesn't just affect us, it has implications for others. What kind of influence will filter down from you?<br />SoulFood: Gen 50 + Haggai 1-2, Luke 11:14-28, Ps 40:1-8, Pr 6:1-5</p>]]></introtext>

It's no accident that you're a dab hand with a paint brush or you're quick at making friends or you're good at saying the right words at the right time - it's part of how God has designed you. 'God has given gifts to each of you... Manage them well...then God will be given glory.' (1 Peter 4:10-11 NLT)<br />You've been given shades of genius in certain areas, so that you might express shades of God in this world. Discover what He's given you ability in, develop what you have flair for and use your forté for God. There's not one person on this planet that has the same mix of talents and experiences as you, so, if you sit on your hands and do nothing, the world will be a duller place.<br />By tapping into your unique abilities and giving the credit to God, you're fulfilling your part in making His will here on earth as it is in Heaven. Paul says, '...everything comes from Him...and is intended for His glory.' (Romans 11:36 NLT) The way you show kindness to another human being, the way you take pen to paper and craft a poem, the way you bake a cake for others to enjoy, the way you use your talents - it all gives honour to God. And, if you love God, you'll want to spend your life in a way that pleases and bring glory to Him.<br />SoulFood: Gen 47-49, Luke 11:1-13, Ps 36, Pr 5:21-23</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...take the stumbling block out of the way...' Isaiah 57:14 NKJ<br />Any sprint hurdler needs to overcome ten stumbling blocks in order to reach the finishing line. 2 Timothy 4:7 NIV says, 'I have fought the good fight. I have finished the race. I have kept the faith.' Paul had finished the race, but not without stretching over a few hurdles along the way. To run your race, here are some examples of stumbling blocks you'll need to hurdle: <br />(1) Pride. Whether it's a superiority complex you're carrying, or you tend to be self-sufficient rather than God-sufficient, pride is a hurdle waiting to trip you up. The antidote? '...with humility...regard one another as more important than yourselves.' (Philippians 2:3 NAS) <br />(2) Insecurity. Wobbly in our emotions and shaky in our identity, insecurity is like a hurdle we can clatter into. How do we clear it? By finding our worth in God and nothing else. 'It is not those who say they are good who are accepted but those who the Lord thinks are good.' (2 Corinthians 10:18 NCV) <br />(3) Negativity. Saying 'no' to life can drain the goodness out of it. Looking through grimy spectacles makes the world seem grubby. Ecclesiastes 3:11 NIV says, 'He has made everything beautiful in its time.' We leap over the negativity hurdle by saying 'yes' each day to God's beautiful life. <br />What about you? Make a list of stumbling blocks you struggle to clear, then ask God to provide situations where you can practice your hurdling technique. <br />SoulFood: Gen 44-46, Luke 10:38-42, Ps 33:13-22, Pr 5:15-20</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'No...I have not achieved it, but I focus on this...forgetting the past and looking forward...' Philippians 3:13 NLT<br />Flip through any Christian biography or sit at the back of a big, bouncy Christian festival and before long you can feel a little bit of a spiritual featherweight. On stage there's this blue-eyed, toothpaste-twinkling, haloed evangelist who has raised orphans from the dead, cured lepers and tweaked the nose of Satan (all before his first mouthful of Weet-bix in the morning) and crouching at the back is little old you (who'd be doing somersaults if you could make it all the way to your Weet-bix without sinning).<br />Situations like this only seem to remind us how weedy we are and how everybody else seems to have this God-thing sorted. Not true. Every wild-eyed evangelist, every holy heavyweight has had (and still has) struggles in some shape or form. It's part and parcel of the Christian walk.<br />The trick is to not let it hold you back. Paul, the radical father of missions, admits his faults but he won't let it hold him back: 'I am still not all I should be, but I am focusing on...forgetting the past and looking forwards.' James 3:2 NLT says, '...we all make many mistakes.' The way to forge forward, though, is to own up your mess to God, get forgiven, forgive yourself, forgive others, forget it and then move on.<br />God said, 'I...am He who blots away your sins...and will never think of them again.' (Isaiah 43:25 TLB) Forget your mistakes (God has) and know grace instead.<br />SoulFood: Ex 20:3, Acts 14:1-18, 1 Sam 5:1-5</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision...' Acts 26:19 NKJ<br />Four ways to spot a truly God-given vision:<br />(1) Vision butts into your brain. If a verse or thought or idea keeps on coming to you, it's time to pray and ask God what He wants you to do with this thought.<br />(2) Vision won't take no for an answer. Read the story of Jonah. God allowed him to reach the very pits (the pit of fish guts to be precise) in order to get his attention. Jonah teaches us that we can run but things won't go right until we've said 'yes' to God's idea.<br />(3) Vision means trouble. Acts 14:22 NIV says, 'We must go through many hardships to enter the Kingdom of God.' The devil won't update your Facebook with 'I like this' once you agree to do God's will. He'll single you out for his dirty tactics. So fasten up that spiritual armour and get plenty of support from committed Christians.<br />(4) Vision arouses your heart-rate. Gideon had self-esteem issues; when God went looking for him, Gideon was blending into the wallpaper (check out Judges 6:11). God called this whimpering coward 'a mighty man of valour'. Our resident wimp took little step of faith by little step of faith until he became a soldier who, with a unit no bigger than the student population of a small rural primary school, defeated an entire army!<br />God-given vision flips the impossible sunny-side up.<br />SoulFood: Gen 42-43, Luke 10:25-37, Ps 33:1-12, Pr 5:7-14</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision.' Acts 26:19 NKJ<br />Hang out with big-mouth Christians and you're sure to hear to this word 'vision' hurled into conversation from time to time. 'Vision' - doesn't that mean the ability to see, or getting caught up in a dream? Yes, so what is the God Squad on about when they say they 'have a vision'?<br />Well, William Carey (considered as one of the founding fathers of overseas mission as we know it) said, 'Expect great things from God; attempt great things for God.' You could argue that this sums up what is meant by 'vision'. 'Expect' suggests that we wait on God for the great ideas of what we should do with our lives. 'Attempt' suggests that once we have ideas from God, we should have a good crack at putting them into practice.<br />The important part in all of this is making sure the ideas have come from God in the first place. We could say we have a 'vision' to walk down the aisle with someone super-wealthy and drop-dead gorgeous - but that daydream has probably come from you, not God. We could even pretend to be super-spiritual and say God has given us a vision to work with orphans in Romania - which on the surface sounds amazingly godly, but if the idea has come from anyone other than Him, you'll soon find yourself worn out because you'll lack the confidence that God is doing the work and start to believe it all rests on your shoulders.<br />So, how do you know it's God-stamped vision? More tomorrow.<br />SoulFood: Gen 40-41, Luke 10:13-24, Ps 28, Pr 5:3-6</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...love your neighbour...' Mark 12:31 NKJ<br />Does loving your neighbour mean visiting the house next door and giving whoever answers the doorbell a bear-hug until he or she either passes out or surrenders to the Lord? Er, nope. Don't confuse 'loving your neighbour' with 'creeping out your neighbour'. Actually you don't have to live next door to somebody to be a neighbour. And loving them isn't about sentimental gush.<br />Making other people's priorities your own priority is loving your neighbour. Making your time their time is loving your neighbour. Random acts of kindness without expecting a thank you in return is loving your neighbour.<br />So, you want to love your neighbour but you're stuck for ideas. Check out a ministry like www.compassion.com.au for inspiring ways to spread the love. Also, you could 'hang with Gran' (yours or somebody else's): play Scrabble, listen to what life was like for her generation, clean up her garden. You could 'give a lunch': next time your homeless neighbour asks for spare change, bless him with a burger.<br />You could 'lose the litter': you and a few mates tidying up your street and save the council a job. Or how about 'bless a cop? It's not easy being a police officer. Why not write your local cops a thank-you card on the National Day of Thanksgiving and buy them a box of choccies? Simple, small but effective ways to show love to your neighbour.<br />SoulFood: Gen 37-39, Luke 10:1-12, Ps 5, Pr 5:1-2]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Bring me seventy...who are known...as leaders...' Numbers 11:16 NIV<br />In the Old Testament, we read about Samson and his amazing adventures in origami, the craft of paper folding. We also read about King David, famous for opening supermarkets and cutting ribbons on newly-launched community centres. And as for Esther, what that woman could do with a tin of beans and a loaf of bread - the mind boggles.<br />Sarcasm alert! There's nothing wrong with origami, opening shopping centres or being a sandwich artist. The point is these things are not part of Samson's, David's or Esther's stories. Their strengths could be found in other areas. Samson's God-given gift was muscle. His physical prowess enabled the Jewish people to be protected. David was a God-born leader, famous in the Bible because his leadership brought the Jewish people their strongest position in their history. Esther had God-given people skills: yes, she was gorgeous, but it was her ability to be diplomatic, rather than flutter her long eyelashes, that saved the Jewish people from an Old Testament holocaust.<br />What kind of story will you write with your life? A good starting point is becoming aware of what talents God has given you. He won't call you to be a worship leader if you sound like a loose fan belt every time you exercise your tonsils. Your purpose will be connected to your gifts.<br />SoulFood: Gen 35-36, Luke 9:57-62, Ps 149, Pr 4:25-27]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...let us follow the Spirit's leading in every part of our lives.' Galatians 5:25 NLT<br />Charles Spurgeon said, 'If we are not seeking the Lord, the devil is seeking us.' And He gets us when we're not worried but smug with ourselves. If you're serious about living all out for God, get what Galatians 5:19-23 NLT says:<br />'Live according to your new life in the Holy Spirit... The old sinful nature loves to do evil, which is just the opposite of what the Holy Spirit wants. And the Spirit gives us desires that are the opposite of what the sinful nature desires. These two forces are constantly fighting each other, and your choices are never free from this conflict... When you follow the desires of your sinful nature, your lives will produce these evil results: sexual immorality, impure thoughts, eagerness for lustful pleasure, idolatry, participation in demonic activities, hostility, quarrelling, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambition, divisions, the feeling that everyone is wrong except those in your own little group. Envy, drunkenness, wild parties, and other kinds of sin... But when the Holy Spirit controls our lives, He will produce this kind of fruit in us; love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self control... Those who belong to Christ Jesus have nailed the passions and desires of their sinful nature to His cross and crucified them there. If we are living now by the Holy Spirit, let us follow the Holy Spirit's leading in every part of our lives.'<br />Be God - satisfied, not self-satisfied.<br />SoulFood: Gen 32-34, Luke 9:46-56, Ps 145:14-21, Pr 4:23-24]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['When he saw him, he had compassion.' Luke 10:33 NKJ<br />There are plenty of 'Christian Job' bulletin boards out there on the net, pinned to church notice boards and propped up at festivals. But did you know that God has a heavenly Jobcentre everywhere you go? All you need to do is learn to open your eyes and see the needs of a hurting world and you'll never be short of a job.<br />Here's a true story of a guy who lived with his wife in London. For his first ten years in the capital he just didn't know what job God wanted him to do. One evening, while his missus was leading a Bible study, he took an evening stroll through the slums of the East End. His eyes were opened. He saw kids running wild, men fighting, women on street corners, small children getting smashed on gin without anyone batting an eyelid. It was as if God's heavenly Jobcentre was recruiting for a post to work, love and live right there. However, there would be no starting salary, no holidays, no company car nor job perks.<br />Later that year, this man and his wife set up their first project amongst the down-and-outers. Their names: William and Catherine Booth. Their project: The Salvation Army. Over a hundred and fifty years later, this couple's vision has grown into a movement that works for God in 113 countries around the world. Jobless? Just ask God to open your eyes.<br />Valentine's Day SoulFood: Eph 5:21-33, S of S 2:1-7, Ps 45, Prov 5:15-19]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...we...are...one body, and each member belongs to all the others.' Romans 12:5 NIV<br />So what do your youth worker, pastor, PE teacher, Bible and even the <em>word4U2day</em> all have in common? Answer: they all stress and stress the importance of teamwork. A great lesson in this was learned by the first-ever team to climb Mount Everest. Listen to what they found out:<br />'For each level we reached, a higher degree of teamwork was required. One group would exhaust themselves just getting the equipment up the mountain for the next group. Two-man teams would work finding a path, cutting steps, securing ropes, spending themselves to make the next leg of the climb possible for others. You don't climb a mountain like Everest by trying to race ahead on your own or by competing with your comrades. No, you do it slowly and carefully, by unselfish teamwork. Certainly I wanted to reach the top myself; it was the thing I'd dreamed of all my life. But if the lot fell to someone else I would take it like a man, not a crybaby. Where would Hillary and I have been without the others? Without the climbers who made the route? The sherpas who carried the loads? Those who cleared the path ahead? It was only through the work and sacrifice of them all that we had our chance at the top.'<br />The Bible teaches, 'We...are...one body, and each member belongs to all the others.' Come on, let's climb together.<br />SoulFood: Isa 9:1-7, Luke 2:1-7, Matt 4:12-16]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['We are not ignorant of [Satan's] devices.' 2 Corinthians 2:11 NKJ<br />Ok guys and gals, today we're looking at temptation. Our lesson: 'Hands on or hands off?'<br />In the Bible we find these two approaches exemplified by Joseph and David. Israel's greatest king's attitude to temptation could be described as 'hands on'. You see David got the royal hots for somebody else's wife, Bathsheba. From the minute his wandering eye spotted her, he was in trouble. He allowed his quickening pulse and the flutter in his stomach to do the reasoning. He ended up with a long-term heap of trouble (murder, bereavement, civil war - in fact, things were never quite the same again). David just had to have his 'hands on' something he shouldn't.<br />The other tactic for temptation is the 'hands off' approach as demonstrated by Joseph. His stakes are upped because Potiphar's wife is deliberately flashing a bit of flesh, trying to seduce him. Joseph, however, keeps his 'hands off' and his godly character still intact.<br />When temptation comes your way (dodgy websites, spreading gossip, going too far with the opposite sex) will you have your hands on or hands off it? 'God will bless you, if you don't give up when your faith is being tested. He will reward you with a glorious life.' (James 1:12 CEV)<br />SoulFood: Gen 30:25-31:55, Luke 9:37-45, Ps 145:1-13, Pr 4:20-22]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Seek out...men of good reputation...whom we may appoint over this business.' Acts 6:3 NKJ<br />Hey you! Do you know that you are the light of the world? Your light cannot be hidden. Fact. Jesus said so. Jesus began all this freedom work but now He believes in you to take it further: more God freedom everywhere because of what you do. Amazing, eh? So, let's get down to the nitty-gritty of what's going to help you be a freedom movement leader.<br />First, practice being a follower: accept and act upon good instructions from tried and tested quality Christians in your inner circle. Second, get yourself in order. Take control of the 'yuck' stuff in your life before it takes control of you. '...avoid the evil things your bodies want to do that fight against your soul.' (1 Peter 2:11 NCV) Third, cultivate staying power. What good is it to be fastest out of the blocks, only to limp off track halfway through the race? 'Finishing is better than starting. Patience is better than pride.' (Ecclesiastes 7:8 NLT) Get spiritually fit by digging into your Bible, fixing prayer and praise times into your day, and taking risks for God. Fourth, be accountable. A green light from God and a gutful of passion are great starting points but it's easy to stray off course, so surround yourself with older, wiser Christians who can share the ups and downs with you. Finally, Matthew 20:26 NIV is your best recipe for success: 'Whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant.'<br />SoulFood: Gen 28:1-30:24, Luke 9:28-36, Ps 141, Pr 4:18-19]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Lord was with Joseph ...' Genesis 39:2 NKJ<br />Picture the episode: the opening credits fade to the sound of studio applause. The star helper of dysfunctional families, Dr. Phil, introduces his first guests: 'Coming up next on my show, the mass-murdering brothers who trafficked their own flesh and blood halfway across the world...' Now there's a family he's going to struggle to turn around!<br />And yet, God not only turns round this family, He makes them one of the most famous family units in history. You may have heard of them - you may have seen their real-life soap opera performed on stage - <em>Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat</em>. We can learn from Joseph: it's possible to rise above your beginnings; that your history needn't hold you back; that with God, the most dysfunctional DNA can be transformed into the holiest.<br />Joseph inherited bad blood: his father, Jacob, was a shark who did the dirty on his own brother. Joseph's brothers had blood on their hands: Genesis 34 tells a story of Simeon and Levi on a revenge rampage that turned into a bloodbath. Finally, driven by jealous bullying, his brothers earn a quick buck selling him into slavery. And yet, because the Lord was with Joseph, he rose to historical greatness despite his horrendous start in life.<br />Bottom line: if God is for you, it doesn't matter who or what's against you.<br />SoulFood: Gen 25:19-27:46, Luke 9:18-27, Ps 138, Pr 4:14-17]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['You will seek Me and find Me when you seek Me with all your heart.' Jeremiah 29:13 NIV<br />Adam Clarke wrote, 'Prayer requires more of the heart than the tongue.' Do you find prayer hard work? Maybe taking the pressure off your tongue and letting your heart do some of the work might be just want you need.<br />First, don't think of it as a long monologue or a big shopping list of what you want from God - after all, He is the Almighty, not a department store shelf. Think of a trusted friend you love to spill the secrets of your heart to: share your exciting news with Him, tell Him what's troubling you. Admit it when you're craving for stuff you know is not right; ask Him to clean out the junk that's clogging your life.<br />Call for help when you're tempted to trample on somebody else to make yourself look good. Ask for a fire in your heart where the frost has set in. Find out what makes Him tick, what sets His pulse pumping and then match your own pulse to His rhythm. Show Him the pains in your heart and expect Him to heal them. Tell Him who hurt you and then pray for good things for that person. Ask Him to lift your eyes from your own feet and to look to the needs of others. Don't role-play, just be as honest as you can manage.<br />Say what you think and you'll find the focus shifts from your tongue to your heart. You'll find a focus on God, your trusted friend.<br />SoulFood: Gen 24:1-25:18, Luke 9:1-17, Ps 134, Pr 4:5-13]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['God is...a very present help in trouble.' Psalm 46:1 NKJ<br />Randy Reid, a 34-year-old construction worker, was welding on top of a nearly-completed water tower outside Chicago. The story goes that Reid unhooked his safety gear to reach for some pipes when a metal cage slipped and bumped the scaffolding on which he stood. It tipped, and Reid lost his balance.<br />He fell 35m, landing face down on a pile of dirt, just missing rocks and construction debris. A fellow worker called the emergency services. When paramedics arrived, they found Reid conscious, moving, and complaining of a sore back. As paramedics carried him on a backboard to the ambulance, Reid had just one request: 'Don't drop me.' Doctors later said Reid came away from the accident with no more than a bruised leg.<br />Sometimes we resemble Randy Reid. God protects us from harm in a 35m fall, yet we are not willing to trust Him to get us over the next half-metre hurdle. Exodus tells the story of Israelites experiencing God's protection: they're led through a wall of standing sea without getting the slightest bit damp. And yet, in a full-blown case of 'Randy Reid syndrome', only days later they've lost all trust that God can provide a bottle of mineral water for each of their parched tongues.<br />Have you got a dose of 'Randy Reid syndrome'? Are you feeling abandoned, even though you've seen God come up trumps for you in the past? Well, Psalm 46 is just for you.<br />SoulFood: Gen 20-23, Luke 8:40-56, Ps 125, Pr 4:3-4]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Look at the birds in the sky!' Matthew 6:26 CEV<br />Imagine it - you're a well-primed, muscular bird. You've braved near-arctic blizzards, you've battled through cramp in your wings, you've done your brave stint as the wind-breaker at the front of the formation. The team are just starting to look like a well-oiled machine when suddenly a bunch of dirty, bedraggled and ill-fed birds join your crew.<br />Surely you'd be entitled to chase them out of your squad of high-fliers: after all, they're only going to be a drain on you; they'll slow down the team and eat their way through your food.<br />But geese don't have that mindset. Even if it means altering plans and rescheduling arrival times, all are welcome, all are given full family status. Jesus has the same ideas about church: 'All...who are weary and carry heavy burdens' are accepted. (Matthew 11:28 NLT) 'I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also... there shall be one flock and one shepherd.' (John 10:16 NIV)<br />High on Jesus' agenda is to save and sign up starving, scruffy little sheep like us. He scrubs us up, feeds us up and straightens us up. He welcomes us to the family despite all our faults. And He expects us to welcome other bedraggled sinners as well. Listen: 'Then Christ will make His home in your hearts as you trust in Him. Your roots will grow down into God's love and keep you strong.' (Ephesians 3:17 NLT)<br />SoulFood: Gen 17-19, Luke 8:26-39, Ps 67, Pr 4:1-2]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Look at the birds in the sky!' Matthew 6:26 CEV<br />We trade in our pitiful iPod for a pretty impressive iPad. We chuck out clothes because they were 'last season's'. We dump the old TV for the latest HD model. And sometimes, unfortunately, we transfer our 'out with the old, in with the new' attitude to people. If somebody's getting a bit needy or old, or they just can't look after themselves as well as they used to, we treat them like last year's model. We dump them on the trash heap.<br />But that's not the attitude a Jesus follower should take. We should be more like the geese. When a bird is too old or ill or injured to carry on with the flight, the other birds don't leave them for dead. What happens is that two stronger geese leave the formation, flying with the 'patient' safely between them, finding shelter, food and a new home for the needy bird. These stronger birds stay with the weaker one until it either recovers or dies. What a lesson in self-sacrificing love.<br />Paul says the same: 'God has combined the members of the body...that its parts should have equal concern for each other. If one part suffers, every part suffers with it.' (1 Corinthians 12:24-25 NIV) God hates it when we treat people like disposable rubbish: 'Do not withhold good from those who deserve it when it's in your power to help them.' (Proverbs 3:27 NLT) If a simple bird can do it, so can we.<br />SoulFood: Is 53:1-12, Acts 8:26-40]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Look at the birds in the sky!' Matthew 6:26 CEV<br />So, you've made your mind up about the grey army at church. Best to avoid them unless you want a dose of: 'Back in my day, we didn't need all this texting; we got by with carrier pigeons and smoke signals.'<br />Well, think again. With age comes experience and wisdom. You could learn a lot from the older members of your church. Geese have this sussed. When a goose gets old, the younger birds don't wheel him off into a corner with a copy of Gardening Australia. No, he's given a vital role in the flying formation. He's entrusted to 'honk' (and before you say, 'That's exactly what our old people do' - it's not that kind of 'honk').<br />The honk of a wild goose is to encourage. Old, experienced birds know how tough it can be out front so they spur on the younger ones with their honking choruses.<br />Fashions may change but one thing that never changes is human nature. The older people in your church have struggled with the same type of challenges you face. But get this - they've lived to tell the tale. If you want a bit of encouragement or a bit of wisdom from one who has bravely battled the weathers, go to the pew honkers. A few drops of their encouragement can overpower your storm of struggles, because 'Pleasant words are...sweet to the soul and healing to the bones.' (Proverbs 16:24 NIV)<br />SoulFood: Gen 13-16, Luke 8:16- 25, Ps 120, Pr 3:33-35]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Look at the birds in the sky!' Matthew 6:26 CEV<br />Remember our flying 'V' formation from yesterday? Imagine being the poor little bird out front, making the tip of the point. He's the one who gets the full force of the wind breaking in his face. He's the one who feels the first drop of rain. He's the one out there on his own with no one to chat to. He's the one who has to set the pace for the others.<br />What a tough, lonely, thankless task it must be to be out front. And that applies to everybody who's got the job of leading the way. Prime ministers do a tough job leading out front and what thanks do they get? Newspapers tearing their decisions apart. Teachers lead from the front, only to be thanked by students' cruel back-chat. Pastors set the pace out front, and are mostly thanked by the groans and moans of their church.<br />Here's an idea: let's be quick to be supportive and slow to be nit-pickers when it comes to our part in the formation. In fact, let's do our bit. Maybe we think it's an easier ride for us if the guy whose name starts with 'pastor' is out front doing all the flapping. Not so. Geese adjust their formation in order to reach their destination. So should we. How about lending a helping hand or throwing out a word of thanks? Take up your position in the church's flying formation. Soar like a bird.<br />SoulFood: Gen 10-12, Luke 8:1-15, Ps 108, Pr 3:31-32]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Look at the birds in the sky!' Matthew 6:26 CEV<br />Next time you're exercising your worry muscles over a pimple or a split end, you want to look heavenwards to our feathered little friends. That's what Jesus says: 'I tell you not to worry about your life... Look at the birds in the sky!' Now this isn't hippy-speak from the Lord: there are lessons to be learned from birds. Take geese, for example. When geese fly south for their jollidays they don't pack a suitcase for one. Geese fly in droves. They group together in their famous flying 'V' formation, because when a bird flaps its wings the air movement created provides uplift, easing the workload of the bird behind it. Together, their flight range increases about 71 per cent. Even the youngest, weakest and oldest geese can make the trip. They accomplish together what they could never achieve separately.<br />There's a lesson here. The Bible says, 'Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another...' (Hebrews 10:25 NIV), or in other words: no flying off solo. Why? Well, when a goose strays off from the flying 'V' formula, he soon finds he's knackered. He loses altitude. He's doing the work of a hundred geese all by himself. What about you - are you in a flap, doing the work and worry of ten when you could be soaring with God and His people? <br />SoulFood: Gen 7-9, Luke 7:36-50, Ps 111, Pr 3:29-30]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Now give me this hill country that the Lord promised me...' Joshua 14:12 NIV<br />Ah, Disney World - the only place on earth where it's perfectly acceptable to hug a two metre high rodent without fear of men in white jackets whisking you away to a place with padded walls. However, Mickey Mouse's stamping ground wasn't just sneezed out of Walt Disney's imagination - it was expertly designed and carefully constructed by grey-haired architect, Joe Fowler. This specialist designer was 55 when he built Disneyland in California. Not one for propping up a walking frame, Fowler then put together Disney World in Florida, aged 71. At 87, he was asked to build a futuristic theme park called the Epcot Centre. While most of his mates were being sized up for coffins, Joe Fowler was taking on another enormous task. Why? 'You don't have to die until you want to!' was his answer. He completed the job in 1993 before retiring, aged 99. Phew!<br />Know what? You're never too old and you're never too young to take on enormous tasks of your own. God is probably not asking you to build Disney World in your local supermarket car park but there may be a wild-eyed dream you've got lurking in your heart. With God's expert design and your willingness to construct, anything is possible. At 85 years of age, Caleb said to Joshua, 'Give me this hill country that the Lord promised me [45 years ago].' Did he get it? Yes. And you have 60 or 70 years' headstart on Caleb - so no excuses, all right?<br />SoulFood: Gen 4-6, Luke 7:24-35, Ps 107:33-43, Pr 3:27-28]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['But the word of the Lord stands forever.' 1 Peter 1:25 NIV<br />You know that heavy old book gathering dust on your shelf - the one which is thick enough for propping open doors? Well here's an idea... try prising it open with your dad's best wrench and see what happens. You never know, it might just have something to say; it might scream something important from the tonsils of its pages; it might grow two large arms and grab you in a bear hug somewhere around John chapter 3, verse 16.<br />A book with tonsils and feet and a body - why all the weird imagery? Because you need to get in your head that the Bible isn't just a neat bundle of ink and paper ideal for door-stopping - it's alive. Seriously, Martin Luther (google him) thought so: 'The Bible is alive, it speaks to me; it has feet, it runs after me; it has hands, it lays hold of me.'<br />Take time out to read it, chew it over in your mind, think of creative ways to apply it to how you live. Do all that and you'll find a book that shapes, shakes and sticks you together. 'The Word of God is full of living power. It is sharper than the sharpest knife, cutting deep into our innermost thoughts and desires.' (Hebrews 4:12 NLT) It exposes us to what we really are. Do you want to be packed with power? Well, get to know your Bible.<br />SoulFood: Gen 1-3, Luke 7:11-23, Ps 107:23-32, Pr 3:25-26]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['What you say flows from what is in your heart...' Luke 6:45 NLT<br />There's loads of different bumper stickers you can get for your car like: 'Cover me, I'm changing lanes' or 'I love cats...they taste just like chicken' or 'Where there's a will, I want to be in it.' The stickers are a reflection of the person who owns the car. What's on the outside says a lot about what's on the inside.<br />God's not overly concerned about what we look like on the outside but He is totally bothered about what's going on, on the inside. 'Man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.' (1 Samuel 16:7 NIV) What's happening on the inside matters more, because it determines who we become. What's happening on the inside is going to come out of your mouth, your speech and your actions and will reveal your true underlying beliefs, attitudes and motivations. What you're storing up on the inside affects every decision you make. As it says in Luke 6:45 NIV: 'The good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and the evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart. For out of the overflow of his heart his mouth speaks.'<br />What are you storing up in your heart? What does your speech and behaviour say about you? Do you need to throw out some rubbish? 'Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that...you may discern what is the will of God.' (Romans 12:2 ESV)<br />SoulFood: Ecc 9-12, Luke 7:1-10, Ps 107:17-22, Pr 3:21-24]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['What you say flows from what is in your heart...' Luke 6:45 NLT<br />Let's start today being a little bit gross: let's talk about poo. On the TV programme, <em>You Are What You Eat</em>, Dr Gillian McKeith tells us that there is good poo and bad poo. She's become famous for letting the world know that if you eat foods that are good for you, your poo will look and smell healthy, but if you eat foods that are bad for you, your poo will look and smell disgusting. There's something freakishly appealing about the programme.<br />Whatever you think about her and her methods, there's no denying she has a point; the only way to get good healthy stuff out of our bodies is to put good healthy stuff in. And guess what? God tells us the same thing! Only He says far more! He tells us that we are what we speak and says, 'A good person produces good things from the treasury of a good heart, and an evil person produces evil things from the treasury of an evil heart. What you say flows from what is in your heart.' (Luke 6:45 NLT)<br />Mind your language! Feed your heart with God's word; 'All Scripture is inspired by God and is useful to teach us what is true and to make us realise what is wrong in our lives. It corrects us when we are wrong and teaches us to do what is right. God uses it to prepare and equip His people to do every good work.' (2 Timothy 3:16 NLT) Good stuff in = good stuff out.<br />SoulFood: Exod 16:1-35, Jn 6:30-40]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I pour out my complaint before Him...' Psalm 142:2 NIV<br />Blubbing your heart out like a wet lettuce? That's not for men! Why, they should be able to have their innards pecked out by a ravenous crow and still turn up for uni with dry eyes. Come on, guys, what is it about us and crying? Oh, it's fine to weep Niagara Falls when the Socceroos score an undeserved red card, but if someone precious to you runs a bulldozer over your heart, you just get on with it without flinching.<br />Listen, without getting too tree-hugger about this, it's ok to relax those tear-ducts. In fact the Bible sheds more than a few salty snuffles. David himself writes, 'I pour out my complaint before Him; before Him I tell my trouble.' Can't you just feel the tears as he vents the pain and allows us to feel it? The Ephesian church cried into the neck of the Apostle Paul, because they knew they wouldn't see him again. Jesus, the model of how a perfect person acts, wept in public.<br />Are you getting this? It's ok to cry and it's healthy to express a wide range of emotions. The Psalms run the gamut of human emotion: anger, fear, loneliness, grief, joy. They're all beautifully articulated in poetry. Has someone hurt you? Do you feel rejected? Are you trying to put a lid on it? Don't; instead vent the pain and allow God to heal your heart.<br />SoulFood: Ecc 5-8, Luke 6:37-49, Ps 107:10-16, Pr 3:19-20]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living...' Psalm 142:5 NKJ<br />So, you thought that caves were the place where long-haired beardy Neanderthal-types took their women after clubbing them over the head with a tree branch? Caves actually feature a good deal in the Bible: it was in a cave that David the giant-killer wrote some of his most tender poetry (as found in the Psalms).<br />Stuck in a dank, dark cave, David must have thought his 'hero' days were well behind him. No one to cheer on his army victories, no one to hear his latest love ballad, no one to call a friend; David finds himself cold and alone, fleeing for his life.<br />Yet at his bleakest, he can write, 'You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living.' There's a strange law that operates on this planet: often when you're at your lowest, God seems closest. Makes sense actually because the Bible talks about God's power being strongest through our weakness. David, at this point, had no way of knowing that things would turn out right for him. He knew he was predicted to be a future king but, stuck in the cavern, this must've looked unlikely.<br />If you're cold, alone, stuck in a bleak problem, take heart: hold onto God's promises and predictions spoken over your life. If our sense of worth is only tied to our success, we're sure to be disappointed.<br />SoulFood: Ecc 1-4, Luke 6:27-36, Ps 107:1-9, Pr 3:13-18]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Please...settle your disagreement...' Philippians 4:2 NLT<br />What kind of a friend are you? Are you the 'forever friends' kind or more like 'forever falling-out friends'?<br />Euodia and Syntyche were two women who worked alongside Paul starting up the early church (read all about how the church began in Acts). It was a really exciting time; God was doing truckloads of miraculous stuff and heaps of people were becoming Christians every day. But what's sad about these two women of God is that the only thing said about them in the Bible is that they couldn't get along with each other: 'I ask Euodia and Syntyche to agree in the Lord.' (Philippians 4:2 NCV) They must have fallen out big time if that's the only thing that's mentioned about them. It must have really affected everyone around them too.<br />God doesn't want His children holding grudges. Why? Because it stops us receiving from Him what we need most; His forgiveness. Jesus said: '...whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours. And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive...so that your Father in Heaven may forgive you...' (Mark 11:24-25 NIV) Serious stuff.<br />Think twice before you start arguing over 'who did what to whom'. Be bigger than that! 'Let your reasonableness be known to everyone. The Lord is at hand!'

<introtext><![CDATA['...though Naaman was a mighty warrior, he suffered from leprosy.' 2 Kings 5:1 NLT<br />Sometimes we can think we have to be 'Mr Popular' in order to do anything of great importance. But think again. Here are some of the 'extras' who were a vital part of Naaman's story.<br />A servant girl: This girl was a servant because Naaman's army frequently raided her country and took prisoners to work for them. This girl introduced Elisha to Naaman, '...the girl said to her mistress, &quot;I wish my master would go to see the prophet in Samaria. He would heal him of his leprosy.&quot;' (2 Kings 5:3 NLT) Because of this girl's faith and forgiveness, Naaman was healed.<br />Elisha's messenger: He gave Naaman the instruction of how to be healed. 'Go and wash yourself seven times in the Jordan River. Then your skin will be restored, and you will be healed of your leprosy.' (2 Kings 5: 10 NLT) Without the messenger, Naaman would never have known what to do.<br />Naaman's officers: We don't even know their names, but because they believed, Naaman was healed: 'But his officers tried to reason with him and said, &quot;Sir...you should certainly obey him when he says simply, 'Go and wash and be cured!'&quot; So Naaman went.' (2 Kings 5:13-14 NLT)<br />We don't know exactly who they were but God knew them and chose to use them. God knows you too; you don't need to be famous, well liked or extremely talented before God will let you in on the incredible things He's doing.<br />SoulFood: Rom 12-14, Luke 6:1-16, Ps 104:1-23, Pr 3:9-10 (Australia Day)<br />]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...though Naaman was a mighty warrior, he suffered from leprosy.' 2 Kings 5:1 NLT<br />Sometimes God uses our circumstances to let us know He's in charge; not us.<br />Naaman was used to hanging out with royalty, used to flashing the cash to get what he wanted. So he went confidently, not to Elisha but to the king of Israel, overloaded with expensive pressies and a letter from his king saying, 'With this letter I present my servant Naaman. I want you to heal him of his leprosy.' Naaman thought, 'Get in! It's not what you know it's who you know!' Naaman believed he could buy what he wanted. But only God could help Naaman and we can't buy God's power. We have to accept it. He chooses to help us for free, because He loves us.<br />Naaman was used to his grand status. He was used to mixing with 'big-wigs' while others ran around after him. He was, after all, 'a mighty man'. So he was a bit put out when, first, he had to make the trip to Elisha's house. Second, Elisha wouldn't even speak to him directly; he told his servant to speak to Naaman on his behalf. And third, he was asked to make himself look foolish: 'Go and wash yourself seven times in the Jordan River. Then your skin will be restored, and you will be healed of your leprosy.' 'Of all the rivers', Naaman thought, 'why that one? It's pathetic!'<br />But Naaman needed to get over himself here and recognise that without God he was nothing. He simply needed God.<br />SoulFood: Rom 9:17-11:36, Luke 5:27-39, Ps 100, Pr 3:7-8]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...though Naaman was a mighty warrior, he suffered from leprosy.' 2 Kings 5:1 NLT<br />Did you know that Jesus mentioned Naaman once? When He was teaching people in the synagogue in His hometown Nazareth, Jesus said, '...there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha, but the only one healed was Naaman the Syrian...' (Luke 4:27 NLT) Jesus lets us in on something here: now we know that Naaman had never seen or heard of God heal anyone of leprosy before.<br />It's always easier to believe God can do something you've seen Him do previously; always easier to trust God when we know other people who have been through a similar thing and have come through it. It gets really difficult when we think, 'No one really knows or understands what I'm going through; how can they? It's not happening to them, it's happening to me!'<br />Naaman had to reach a point where he stopped focusing on his problem and started focusing on God. God doesn't need anything to begin with in order to solve your problem; He made the whole world from nothing.<br />Naaman became the only one in the time of the prophet Elisha to be healed from leprosy. His life changed dramatically after that. Naaman was 'a mighty man' but God made him even greater, because Naaman chose to trust Him with his difficult situation. Look to God not your problem. Jesus said, 'In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.' (John 16:33 NIV)<br />SoulFood: Rom 7:1-9:16, Luke 5:12-26, Ps 96, Pr 3:5-6]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...though Naaman was a mighty warrior, he suffered from leprosy.' 2 Kings 5:1 NLT<br />Naaman was not just any commander of the king's army but a great one! The king thought he was absolutely brilliant. (Look it up: 2 Kings 5.) He was 'a mighty warrior', winning many battles. But hidden underneath the armour of this great commander was a secret. Naaman suffered from leprosy.<br />Leprosy is one of the oldest recorded diseases. It is a chronic, infectious disease that attacks the nervous system, particularly the nerves of the hands, feet and face. Sufferers feel no pain in these areas and are therefore likely to injure themselves without realising. It wasn't until the 1980s that a cure was found for leprosy and Naaman lived way before then- around 840 BC! Back then, sufferers were excluded, shunned, chucked out of their communities to stop others becoming infected. This is why Naaman would have hidden his illness, but even so, he knew that no matter how much he ignored or hid his problem, it was never going to go away.<br />Thankfully for Naaman we read how he stopped hiding his illness and went and asked for help. He found Elisha who told him how God could heal him-and eventually Naaman was healed. Amazing!<br />Sometimes, just like Naaman, we can hide things that we don't want people to know about because we're scared of what might happen if people really knew us. Ask God to help you to stop hiding. God helped Naaman and He wants to help you too.<br />SoulFood: Ezek 47:1-12, Rev 21: 22-22:5]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Accept My teachings and learn from Me...' Matthew 11:29 NCV<br />When someone tells us to do something we often want to know why. Sometimes it's difficult for us to accept authority. When we're told to do something, especially if that something is something we don't want to do, we snap back, 'Why should I?' We don't often like doing things unless we think it's for a good reason. Jesus knows this about us, which is why He takes the time to explain why what He wants from us is good for us.<br />Today Jesus is telling you: 'Accept My teachings and learn from Me.' Now depending what mood you're in today you may just reply, 'Ok,' and get on with it but, just as likely, you'll either respond by asking an inquisitive 'Why?' or a more defensive 'Why should I, eh?'<br />But however you respond, Jesus answers you, saying this: '...because I am gentle and humble in spirit...you will find rest for your lives.' (Matthew 11:29 NCV) Jesus doesn't wait until you're feeling your best or can answer Him without the attitude. Jesus always meets us exactly where we're at. So listen to what He is saying to you today. He is letting you know that He is a kind, gentle God, who speaks the truth and can teach you all you need to know to ensure you get the best out of life. More than that, you can walk through life with Him-you never have to go it alone.<br />SoulFood: Rom 3:21-6:23, Luke 5:1-11, Ps 91, Pr 3:3-4]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The people stood afar off, but Moses drew near...where God was.' Exodus 20:21 NKJ<br />There's a guy in the Bible called Moses and get this: He knew what God's presence felt like, what His voice sounded like, and what He looked like. How great is that! But what's weird is that the people Moses hung out with were happy to leave it that way. Even though they had the same opportunity to feel, hear and see God, they chose not to. They said to Moses, 'You tell us what God says...but don't let God speak directly to us...' (Exodus 20:19 NLT) How sad is that? Why did they choose to do that? Some of them were most definitely scared, afraid that God might tell them off for the stuff they were doing wrong. Some of them just wouldn't have cared and rather carry on doing their own thing, not interested in knowing God at all. Some of them probably thought they didn't deserve that incredible life changing experience-to be that close to Almighty God.<br />What about you? You have the same choice. God wants you to know Him personally too- to experience His power, to feel His presence, to see Him actively working in your life. What are you going to choose today? To be an onlooker, watching God move in the lives of others, not yours? Not your style-want to do things your way, not God's way? Make the right choice today-the Moses choice.<br />SoulFood: Rom 1:1-3:20, Luke 4:31-44, Ps 89:38-52, Pr 3:1-2]]></introtext>

At the end of our driving test we want to be told, 'You've passed.' And after the job interview we want to hear, 'You've passed, you're qualified, the job is yours.'<br />When it comes to doing things for God we don't have to become stress-heads swatting up for exams, take nerve-racking tests or sit through intense interviews: '...Our qualification comes from God.' You see, God never asks you to do things for Him, He asks you to do things with Him. With God you are always qualified to do whatever He asks you to do. So go for it!<br />Don't panic, saying, 'But I just can't do it.' 'Your qualification comes from God': 'And God will generously provide all you need. Then you will always have everything you need and plenty left over to share with others.' (2 Corinthians 9:8 NLT) Don't panic, saying, 'But I'm broke, I don't have the money to do that': '...God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that in all things at all times, having all you need, you will abound in every good work.' (2 Corinthians 9:8 NIV) Don't panic, saying, 'But I'm not strong enough to cope with doing that.' Because your qualification comes from God, you can confidently say, 'I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.'

But 1 Corinthians 10:12-13 NLT says, 'If you think you are standing strong, be careful not to fall. The temptations in your life are no different from what others experience. And God is faithful. He will not allow the temptation to be more than you can stand. When you are tempted, He will show you a way out so that you can endure.'<br />(2) Temptation doesn't always look bad: Take time to stop and ask yourself, 'Will this benefit or hurt me? Does it have the power to control me?' 1 Corinthians 6:12 AMP says, 'Everything is permissible...for me; but not all things are helpful.'<br />(3) A little bit of temptation always leads to a lot more: You open a box of chocolates and you know what's going to happen... you won't just have one, will you? 1 Corinthians 5:6 NIV says that sin is like 'a little yeast [that] works through the whole batch of dough...' Get rid of the old 'yeast': don't mess around with even a little. Eliminate it from your life.<br />(4) Giving into temptation can stop you reaching your potential: 1 Corinthians 9:27 NLT says, 'I discipline my body like an athlete, training it to do what it should. Otherwise, I fear...I...might be disqualified.' Train hard, so you don't cave in when temptation turns up.<br />SoulFood: Is 58-62, Luke 4:1-13, Ps 89:1-14, Pr 2:20]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...If someone slaps you on the right cheek, offer the other cheek also.' Matthew 5:39 NLT<br />Ever feel like you're taken for granted? Ever felt used? If we don't forgive people when they upset us, we end up carrying that hurt around inside us. We use it to build up emotional walls. We think we're protecting ourselves. 'No one is ever going to do that to me again...'<br />Then when Jesus says, '...If someone slaps you on the right cheek, offer the other cheek also,' how do you feel? Are you going ballistic inside: 'You better be joking, Jesus! No way am I doing that, ever!' Are you fuming: 'Does Jesus really expect me to be someone's punch bag? Well, He can just think again.'<br />If we listen a bit more to what Jesus is saying we'll understand that we're actually hurting ourselves when we mistakenly think we're protecting ourselves. Jesus' way of doing things makes us strong and healthy.<br />Jesus says, 'You have heard the law...&quot;Love your neighbour&quot; and hate your enemy. But I say, love your enemies! Pray for those who persecute you! In that way, you will be acting as true children of your Father in Heaven... If you love only those who love you, what reward is there for that? ...If you are kind only to your friends, how are you different from anyone else? ...But you are to be perfect, even as your Father in Heaven is perfect.' (Matthew 5:43-48 NLT)<br />SoulFood: Is 53-57, Luke 3:21-38, Ps 84, Pr 2:16-19]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Daniel distinguished himself...because an excellent spirit was in him...' Daniel 6:3 NKJ<br />Ever notice how easy it is to get distracted? You get home with every good intention to do your homework, study for that test or get that coursework done, but before you know it, it's 11 pm and all you've managed to do is send twenty text messages and discover what Disney character you are from a quiz on Facebook. Is this sounding too familiar? Learn from Daniel.<br />It's easy to find Daniel in the Bible because he's got a whole book named after him. He grew up in Jerusalem, but it was invaded when he was still young. He was forced to live and work in exile in Babylon, along with 10 000 other Jews. He didn't exactly 'have it easy'. Even so, Daniel was known by everyone, for his 'attitude of excellence'. It paid off: 'Daniel distinguished himself above the governors...because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king gave thought to setting him over the whole realm.' The king put him in charge! Wow!<br />Daniel wasn't born with this attitude of excellence, he chose it. The more he did it, the better he got at it. Whatever situation Daniel found himself in, he lived how God wanted him to live. Spiritually: listening to God, talking to God, obeying God. Physically: exercising well and eating right. Mentally: doing every task, having every conversation in the right frame of mind.<br />SoulFood: Is 49-52, Luke 3:11-20, Ps 81, Pr 2:11-15]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The blood...makes atonement for the soul...' Leviticus 17:11 NKJ<br />Jeffrey Ebert writes: 'When I was five years old, before factory-installed seat belts and airbags, my family was driving home at night on a two-lane country road. I was sitting on my mother's lap when another car driven by a drunk driver swerved into our lane and hit us head on. I don't have any memory of the collision. I do recall the fear and confusion I felt as I saw myself literally covered with blood from head to toe. Then I learned that the blood wasn't all mine, but my mother's. In that split second when the two headlights glared into her eyes, she instinctively curled her body around mine. It was her body that slammed against the dashboard, her head that shattered the windshield. She took the impact so that I wouldn't have to. It took extensive surgery for my mother to recover from her injuries.'<br />At the cross Jesus took the impact of our sin, and the moment we place our trust in Him, His shed blood makes it possible for us to be accepted by God. Think about God's problem. The Bible says that God cannot stand the sight of evil. (Habakkuk 1:13)<br />So God solves His problem by repositioning us 'in Christ' and seeing us 'through the blood'. God's Word says, 'The blood...makes atonement for the soul...' The word 'atonement' means 'at-one-ment.' Incredible! The blood of Jesus bridges the gap and makes us one with God.<br />SoulFood: Judges 16:23-31, 2 Cor 12:3-11]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Abide in My love...' John 15:9 NKJ<br />Why take another day hearing Jesus words, 'Abide in My love'? Well, to remind ourselves it's not a 'one off' action! It's not something we do once and then think, 'Yep, got that sorted!' It's ongoing, a process, something we need to keep on doing. It needs to keep happening so we don't 'fall off the rails' or go AWOL. We just end up hurting ourselves when we fall away from God; so why do it if we don't have to? God says, 'Abide in My love' so let's learn a bit more about this 'abiding':<br />(1) It's not a feely thing: being in a relationship with God is not based on how we feel; it's a choice. So stop thinking you have to have to wait to feel all 'super holy' before you can hang out with Him, just hang out with Him anyway. It's what you were designed to do.<br />(2) It is a doing thing: Jesus said, 'If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love...' (John 15:10 NKJ) Don't kid yourself, you can't turn up on a Sunday and have a great time worshipping God and then spend the rest of the week doing whatever you like. That's not abiding in God's love. When Jesus is right in the middle of our lives not only do we get to experience His amazing love for us, but we start living in it too.<br />SoulFood: Is 45-48, Luke 3:1-10, Ps 79, Pr 2:9-10]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Abide in My love...' John 15:9 NKJ<br />In Psalm 63 you can read these words written by David: 'O God...I...search for You. My soul thirsts for You... Your unfailing love is better than life itself... You satisfy me more than the richest feast...I lie awake thinking of You, meditating on You through the night. Because You are my helper, I sing for joy in the shadow of Your wings.' (Psalm 63: 1-7 NLT)<br />He sounds pretty happy, doesn't he? But you can read a lot about David in the Bible and you discover that his life wasn't exactly a bed of roses. Sure he had some great times, but he also had a fair amount of tough stuff going on as well.<br />David is described as 'a man after [God's] own heart.' (1 Samuel 13:14 NIV) David learnt to abide in God's love. To keep God at the centre of his life, every moment of everyday. That's why he was able to write those words. But you know what's even more amazing? You can experience God that way too-in fact it's what God wants for you. That's why He says, 'abide in My love'. So what you waiting for? Get focused-let Jesus be right at the centre, let every bit of your life be about Him.<br />SoulFood: Is 42-44, Luke 2:41-52, Ps 74:12-23, Pr 2:7-8]]></introtext>

John 15:9 NKJ<br />After a dance routine on<em> So You Think You Can Dance UK</em>, a judge commented to one of the contestants, '...you never found your centre at all this evening... you never found your centre of gravity... you dropped your partner, you stumbled...'<br />Being 'centred' is vitally important to a dancer, it's what keeps them connected, what enables them to put the dance moves together flawlessly, it's what makes them stand out on stage. Losing their centre means they stumble and fall, as the contestant found out that night. The consequences for him were 'gut-wrenching'. He was eliminated from the competition.<br />When Jesus says, 'Abide in My love', He's asking us to remain, continue, stay, to be centred in Him, to be connected to Him. God knows that when we go off doing things our own way, we end up 'losing it'. We stumble, we fall, we hurt both ourselves and others in the process. Jesus says, 'I have loved you even as the Father has loved Me. Remain in My love.' (John 15:9 NLT) God wants you to be part of His family; He wants you to feel at home, knowing we will never be rejected. So stay centred in Jesus.<br />SoulFood: Is 38-41, Luke 2:34-40, Ps 74:1-11, Pr 2:6]]></introtext>

In April 1993, Arsenal footballer Steve Morrow was thrown high in the air for scoring the winning goal that won the Championship Cup. But the team didn't catch him! Morrow was carried off the field on a stretcher with a broken arm and an oxygen mask over his face.<br />Hero one minute and laid out the next.<br />Psalm 133 talks about '...oil...poured over Aaron's head, that ran down his beard and onto... his robe.' Now the thought of being covered in oil may sound gross. But being anointed with oil in Bible times was something special. The oil was a sign of God affirming you.<br />With God we are loved and we stay loved. He never 'drops us' or lets us down. '...His anointing teaches you about all things and as that anointing is real, not counterfeit.' (1 John 2:27 NIV) God affirms us, making us a sure thing in Christ. By His Spirit He has stamped us with his eternal pledge; a sure beginning of what He is destined to complete.<br />SoulFood: Is 34-37, Luke 2:21-33, Ps 71:17-24, Pr 2:3-5]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Having hope will give you courage...' Job 11:18 NLT<br />Hope is one of those little words that can have a massive impact on our lives if we let it. Hope is a powerful force. It means things can change. It's like the sun coming out when it's bucketing down with rain; the rain dries up and rainbows appear. Hope means change for the better. The Bible describes God as 'the God of hope' (Romans 15:13 NIV) and tells us we should 'hope in God'. (1 Timothy 6:17 NIV) No one or nothing else, just God.<br />Sometimes life, relationships, family, school, college, uni or work can become almost unbearable. 'Having hope will give you courage...' knowing God will provide a way out of the mess we're in. Even if we 'hit the self-destruct button' hope is always there letting us know there's a better way, change can happen. Here's what HOPE stands for to me: Holding Onto Possibilities Everywhere.<br />Holding: never letting go, never giving up. Onto: Attaching ourselves; clinging onto God, expecting God to help, knowing we need His help. Possibilities: The impossible becomes possible. It's possible that things can be different. Life can get better. Things can improve. Everywhere: We realise that no situation is beyond hope. Every situation, every attitude, can be changed.<br />Hope is absolutely essential to the life God wants you to live. It's the fuel He wants your heart to run on. 'Hope in the Lord; for with the Lord is unfailing love.' (Psalm 130:7 NIV)<br />SoulFood: Is 30-33, Luke 2:8-20, Ps 71:1-16, Pr 2:1-2]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['You have been wandering around...long enough; turn...' Deuteronomy 2:3 NLT<br />Ever feel overloaded and overwhelmed? As well as the normal 9-5, there's study, a job, church commitments. Plus your family want some of your time and-oh yeah, what about that friend who really wants some advice from you this week? It's all too much!<br />Maybe like me you fall back on that promise: 'I can do everything through Him who gives me strength.' (Philippians 4:13 NIV) But God doesn't promise we can do everything we want to do, or everything people expect us to do, or even the things other people manage to do. God only gives us grace to do what He calls us to do.<br />Author Parker Palmer writes: 'I was raised in a culture that insisted I could do anything; that I was without limits, given enough energy and commitment on my part and all I had to do was get with the programme. My troubles began when I started to slam into my limitations...in the form of failure.'<br />Few things humble us like failure. As with today's reading God will let us circle the same mountain over and over until the scenery becomes so familiar that we're forced to stop and ask for direction; especially when we know in our heart that we're not where God wants us to be.<br />What's your most painful limitation? The one you won't admit? The one you don't want anybody to see? Acknowledge it. Seek honest feedback. Ask for God's help in accepting the limits He's placed on you; for your own protection.<br />SoulFood: Is 26-29, Luke 2:1-7, Ps 46, Pr 1:32-33]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Can't touch this<br />'...no weapon turned against you will succeed.' Isaiah 54:17 NLT<br />How would you feel if the Prime Minister decided Christianity was against the law? And made a new law: that everyone had to bow down to a statue and worship it? Wouldn't exactly float your boat would it? Would you keep your faith and risk going to prison, or forget about God in order to avoid being thrown in the slammer? What if the punishment was the death penalty? How much would your faith mean to you then?<br />Would you risk losing your life for God just like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego (see Daniel 3)? They were in just this position. King Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold 30m high and 3m wide; 'Whoever does not fall down and worship will immediately be thrown into a blazing furnace,' (Daniel 3:6 NIV) he ordered.<br />Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego chose not to obey that order-they chose to obey God instead. They told the King: 'Do your worst! We're sticking with God! He'll save us and you know what, even if He doesn't, we're not bothered, we're still sticking with Him!' (Or words to that effect!)<br />All three got chucked in the fire and all three walked right back out again, without one little burn. They didn't even smell of smoke. God had saved them. God was on guard duty. His promise is '...no weapon turned against you will succeed.'<br />SoulFood: 1 Sam 3:1-11, Act 9:1-9]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[The importance of worship (2)<br />'Oh come, let us worship...' Psalm 95:6 NKJ<br />We've all seen them, haven't we? Those couples that are in lurve. They're everywhere: hanging around town, on the bus, at the cinema (back row, of course). They stick out like a sore thumb, oblivious to everyone around them. They can't stop gazing into each others' eyes, they narrowly miss lampposts, revolving doors and small children, because they don't want to let go of each other's hands. They're more than content to show PDA (public displays of affection) everywhere...but let's not go there.<br />Hang on a minute-aren't you one of them? Or dreaming of being one? Going gaga over a photograph of that special person...the one you can't stop thinking about?<br />When we are in love we just want to be with that special person. Being with them changes how we feel for the better: about life and about ourselves. We want their opinion, want to know what they're thinking, how they're feeling.<br />Worshipping God can be like this too. You were designed to be in a relationship with God. And God doesn't only want you to think about what you want from Him, He wants us to spend time just hanging out with Him, praising Him. Raise the roof for the Rock who saved us! Drop everything and listen, listen as He speaks. Why should we praise God? So 'you can show others the goodness of God, for He called you out of the darkness into His wonderful light.' (1 Peter 2:9 NLT)<br />SoulFood: Is 22-25, Luke 1:67-80, Ps 42:6-11, Pr 1:28-31]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[The importance of worship (1)<br />'Let everything that has breath praise the Lord...' Psalm 150:6 NKJ<br />A woman in Kansas City entered a Häagen-Dazs store for an ice cream. After ordering, she turned around and found herself face-to-face with Paul Newman (a famous actor; the Brad Pitt of yesteryear), who was in town filming. He said, 'Hello.' His radiant blue eyes caused her knees to shake. She managed to pay for her cone, then left the shop, heart pounding. When she regained her composure she realised she didn't have her ice cream.<br />She started back into the store and met Newman at the door. 'Are you looking for your ice cream?' he asked. She nodded, unable to speak. 'You put it in your purse with your change,' he said, smiling. Embarrassing or what? But so easy done when overwhelmed with meeting someone you think is amazing, don't you think? Come on admit it; you've had those gooey-eyed moments. Probably not over Paul Newman, but over someone! But what about over God?<br />When was the last time your knees buckled, your pulse quickened and your heart was overwhelmed with praise to God? Did you even know it was possible? The Bible says, 'Let everything that has breath praise the Lord,' (Psalm 150:6 NKJ) and 'Always be full of joy in the Lord. I say it again-rejoice!' (Philippians 4:4 NLT) The more we celebrate God the more we get to know who He really, what He's really like; it's enough to make anyone go weak at the knees!<br />SoulFood: Is 17-21, Luke 1:57-66, Ps 42:1-5, Pr 1:20-27]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Fight right<br />'Be strong in the Lord and in His mighty power.' Ephesians 6:10 NIV<br />Imagine the scene: the year's 1917 and it's four years into World War 1. Aqaba, a town on the border of Israel in the country of Jordan, was protected by huge naval guns. The Turks were in charge and believed that no one could ever attack Aqaba and win. But the opposing army risked their lives, travelling through a desert so terrible it was called the 'Anvil of the Sun', planning a surprise attack. The guns were completely powerless because they were facing the wrong way! So why the history lesson? Three reasons: the Turks made three big mistakes: they didn't know their enemy, they didn't know their own weak points and they didn't have the right weapons. Don't make the same mistakes in your life.<br />(1) Know your enemy. 1 Peter 5:8 NIV says, 'Be self-controlled and alert. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.' (2) Know your weak points: Be honest with yourself and then give your weaknesses to God to take care of. Then you'll be ready for anything the devil throws your way because God promises you, 'My power is made perfect in weakness.' (2 Corinthians 12:9 NIV) (3) Know your weapons: 'Put on the full armour of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.' (Ephesians 6:11-12 NIV)<br />SoulFood: Is 12-16, Luke 1:39-56, Ps 10:12-18, Pr 1:17-19]]></introtext>

Malachi 3:3 NLT<br />If you're good at science you'll know that the symbol for silver is Ag and if you're a real whizzkid you'll know that this comes from the Latin word argentum, which means 'white and shining'. Silver was one of the earliest metals known to humans. It's rare, strong, unaffected by moisture, and can be moulded into different shapes. Silver possesses many special physical characteristics and qualities that make it useful. Silver is used in the Bible to describe our relationship with God.<br />Silver is rarely found alone; it is usually contaminated. In order to create this amazing metal, a silversmith has to place it in the hottest part of a fire, watching carefully so as not to leave it there too long, but long enough to burn away all the impurities. The silversmith knows the process is complete when he can see his face reflected in the silver.<br />So when we read, 'He will sit like a refiner of silver, burning away the dross,' what God is letting us know that we are precious, we're made in His image, and He will do everything to make sure we reach our potential. When life as a Christian gets tough, as it sometimes will, don't run away from God, trust Him. Know He is acting like a silversmith making sure all the grubby stuff in us is gotten rid of, so people can see Him when they look at us!<br />SoulFood: Is 8-11, Luke 1:26-38, Ps 10:1-11, Pr 1:10-16]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Gifted<br />'We have different gifts...' Romans 12:6 NIV<br />Do you sometimes think, 'I'm not good at anything?' Worse, do you think it a lot? There could be two main reasons why.<br />Firstly, you're 'wallowing in it': you've got so used to thinking negatively about yourself, and spent so much time thinking about all the stuff you can't do, you've forgotten all the things you can do, and do brilliantly. You need to let God invade your thoughts; 'be transformed by the renewing of your mind.' (Romans 12:2 NIV)<br />Or maybe envy is to blame. But think about it, why be jealous of what someone else has when you can be enjoying what you have? You are unique and gifted. We all have different gifts and God wants us to '...be honest in your evaluation of yourselves, measuring yourselves by the faith God has given us.' (Romans 12:3 NLT)<br />Elisha was a prophet who hung out with Elijah, a top-notch prophet. But Elisha never felt sorry for himself or got jealous. He was wowed by how well Elijah used his gifts for God and inspired to ask God to give him twice as much as what He'd given Elijah, so he could do even more good stuff for God. As a result, he did. Thank God for the gifts He's given you and use them well.<br />SoulFood: Is 4-7, Luke 1:11-25, Ps 90:7-17, Pr 1:5-9]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Care for your conscience<br />'...I have lived in all good conscience before God...' Acts 23:1 NKJ<br />Back in the 70s (ask your parents if they remember it!), there was a massive political scandal known as Watergate. It was so bad that the US President Richard Nixon decided to resign. Nixon's aide Jeb Magruder told the Senate Investigation Committee, 'We conned ourselves into thinking we weren't doing anything wrong, and by the time we were doing things that were illegal, we'd lost control.'<br />1 Timothy 4:2 mentions people '...whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron.' In Bible times, there were no ambulances or emergency departments in hospitals with specialised surgeons. So to stop a wound from bleeding they would burn it shut with a big piece of hot iron... ouch! As you can imagine this would leave a big ugly scab that created very hard skin; tough scabby skin that loses all feeling, very different to how skin usually is.<br />God gave us a conscience and He wants us to use it. If we don't, we can end up creating a big scab over it and we don't even notice when we are doing wrong. Your conscience is like a motion detector, letting you know that a thief has entered your home intending to rob, or even kill you.<br />Today, 'Cling to your faith in Christ, and keep your conscience clear. For some people have deliberately violated their consciences; as a result, their faith has been shipwrecked...' (1 Timothy 1:19 NLT)<br />SoulFood: Is 1-3, Luke 1:1-10, Ps 90:1-6, Pr 1:1-4]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Look up!<br />'...Abraham lifted his eyes...' Genesis 22:4 NKJ<br />Walk along the road with your head down and you're not going to be surprised when-ouch!-you walk smack-bang into a lamppost. Look up; watch where you're going! That's the general rule to walk pain free.<br />Did you know that three times the Bible says that Abraham 'lifted his eyes...' Abraham knew that in order to make the most of life he needed to shift his focus. To stop looking down on his situation, feeling battered down by his problems but to look up, look to God and see beyond his problems. Do you need to shift your focus today? Three things happened when Abraham shifted his focus:<br />First, he knew God was with him and realised how much he needed God: 'He bowed himself to the ground, and said, &quot;...do not pass on by Your servant.&quot;' (Genesis 18: 1-3) Second, He understood what God was asking him to do and he received the strength to do it. (Genesis 22:4) Finally, he got convinced God would give him all he needed; God would not let him down '...Abraham lifted his eyes and looked, and there...was a ram caught in a thicket by its horns...' (Genesis 22:13 NKJ) Abraham had already said, 'God will provide...' (Genesis 22:8)<br />Today, shift your focus: Look up! See that God is with you. Look up! See beyond your problems. Look up! See that God will provide all you need. Look up! See the best way forward.<br />SoulFood: 2 Chron 7:12-16, Matt 6:5-15, Luke 18:1-8]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[New Year's Day<br />I stand corrected<br />'The Lord disciplines those He loves...' Hebrews 12:6 NIV<br />Did you know God loves you? It's a fact-God truly does love you! Not just when you've got your posh gear on or been extra specially wonderful-right now, every minute of every day, just as you are-God loves you! The Bible is totally clear: 'Nothing can ever separate us from God's love.' (Romans 8:38 NLT)<br />But did you know that He also corrects you? 'Now hang on a minute, how can He do both?' you may ask. 'How can God truly love me and then go correcting me? Aren't I good enough for Him?'<br />Q(1) Why will God tell us when we're 'out of line'? It's the child He loves that He disciplines. God is educating you: that's why you must never drop out. This trouble you're in isn't punishment, it's training. Why not embrace God's training so we can truly live? God is doing what is best for us, training us to live God's holy best.<br />Q(2) What's in it for me? 'God's discipline is always right and good for us because it means we will share in his holiness. No discipline is enjoyable while it is happening-it is painful! But afterward there will be a quiet harvest of right living for those who are trained in this way.' (Hebrews 12:10-11 NLT)<br />Q(3) And how does God discipline us? 'I correct and discipline everyone I love. So be diligent and turn from your indifference.' (Revelation 3:19 NLT)<br />SoulFood: Rom 13:12-14:19, John 1:1-14]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[What I go to church for<br />'...No one cares for my soul.' Psalm 142:4 NKJ<br />What do people come to church for? What do you go to church for? And I don't just mean church on Sunday but youth groups, small groups, special events, whatever. It could be that the music, the preaching or some special attraction got them there in the first place. (Good coffee and doughnuts works for me.) But I guarantee that won't be what keeps them going along.<br />Sure, everybody needs good teaching and the opportunity to worship as a church body together. But deep down, what people most crave and need from church is warmth, friendliness, human interaction, a feeling of belonging. Jesus told His disciples, '...I have called you friends...' (John 15:15 NIV) Many people are shy, distrusting, and relationally impaired. Our mandate is to make 'friends' out of them, not just pew-fillers and financial givers.<br />The Scripture says, 'Bear one another's burdens...' (Galatians 6:2 NKJ) and we're all carrying burdens. We all carry with us the wounds of our past, the struggles of our present, and the unspoken anxieties of our future. What we all want to know is, 'Will you love me as I am, even if I don't fit your mould and change as quickly as you'd like me to?'<br />So when you arrive at church this Sunday, remember the people you see around you probably aren't looking for profound answers, they just want to feel cared for. When that happens, they open up to God's love and miracles take place.<br />New Year's Eve SoulFood: Phil 3:8-14, 2 Cor 5:14-21, Ps 77:11-20, Pr 9:10-12]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Character Building<br />'Anyone who listens...and follows...is...like a person who builds a house on solid rock.' Matthew 7:24 NLT<br />Christian thinker John Ruskin said, 'The highest reward for man's toil is not what he gets for it, but what he becomes by it.' It's said that when Michael Eisner, head of the Disney Corporation, had plans drawn up for a house, one wall was so thin it almost buckled under its own weight. One billionaire's house had wooden sides that rotted before the house was even completed. So, were they just too busy to notice?<br />Architects say that people find construction details boring; they'd rather spend their money on glitzy stuff. Yet it's the foundation that determines the strength, stability (and ultimately the value) of the house.<br />Are you putting all your efforts into maintaining an image while neglecting your own foundation: your attitude, your integrity and your God-given purpose? Jesus said, 'Anyone who listens to my teaching and follows it is wise...like a person building a house on solid rock... when the rain comes...it won't collapse.' (Matthew 7:24-25 NLT)<br />Houses (and Jesus applies this to our lives) built on sand are quick, cheap and easy. They provide temporary comfort and instant gratification. Building on rock is hard: it takes time, effort, foresight and perseverance-but the results are worth it.<br />If you're not sure what kind of house you're building, watch what happens when the storm hits! A house built on rock will withstand the same storm that levels those built on sand.<br />Simply stated, there are no shortcuts. Character is the result of commitment, consistency, and building according to the principles of God's Word. When you make these things the foundation of your life, you'll make it through any storm.<br />SoulFood: 1 Cor 15-16, Matt 3:1-10, Ps 116, Pr 31:30-31]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Don't give up<br />'Trust the Lord with all your heart, and don't depend on your own understanding...' Proverbs 3:5 NCV<br />Has God given you a passion to do something, but things keep coming up to block you or stress you out? Don't worry; you're not alone. Life can throw us a series of challenges that can make you wonder whether you were on the right track to start. Maybe you need a lot of money to pay for a course or your rent, but it unexpectedly dries up, or a personality clash gets in the way of you succeeding.<br />But you know what, it's through these challenges that God shows you what you are really passionate about, and how He wants you to do things.<br />Don't get caught up in Plan A, where everything is set in stone. It can make life more stressful than it needs to be. Allow yourself to adapt with your circumstances. So you can't get the money you need, or you don't get the right marks in your work; that doesn't mean God is going to scrap your dream or think differently about you.<br />A teenage prophet called Jeremiah said these wise words: 'For I know the plans I have for you,' says the Lord. 'Plans to prosper you and not harm you...to give you a hope and a future.' (Jeremiah 29: 11 NIV)<br />Those plans may not work out the way you're expecting, but God knows what He's doing, and He will not leave your side or be disappointed in you if things don't go the way you expect. Just hold on, keep giving your plans to Him, and trust that He is in control of your life.<br />SoulFood: 1 Cor 12-14, Matt 2:16-23, Ps 139:13-24, Pr 31:28-29]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Fliers, runners, walkers<br />'...They will soar... They will run... They will walk...' Isaiah 40:31 NLT<br />Watchman Nee wrote a best-selling book entitled The Normal Christian Life. Why that title? Because, he says, you will only be able to recognise what season you're in, and adjust to it, when you know what's 'normal' in Christian living.<br />At one point Paul raises a man from the dead, yet at another he writes, 'We even gave up hope of living...' (2 Corinthians 1:8 NCV) The Bible says, 'Elijah was a man just like us...' (James 5:17 NIV) Yet one day he is calling down fire from Heaven, and the next he is suicidal and in the depth of depression.<br />Now, you can't use this fact as an excuse for spiritual laziness, but we must be discerning. Faith in Jesus doesn't exempt us from life's ups and downs, it just enables us to go through them victoriously.<br />So: (1) If you're a flier: If you're being blessed by God and experiencing success beyond your natural abilities, enjoy it. But always remember, your ability to fly comes from God-not you. Forget that, and down you'll go!<br />(2) If you're a runner: Thank God you're still in the race. Don't compare yourself with high fliers or you'll get discouraged, and don't compare yourself with walkers or you'll become proud. Just keep running and your time will come.<br />(3) If you're a walker: Keep putting one foot in front of the other. Some days pain, discouragement and fatigue make it impossible to fly high or run; all you can do is walk without fainting, and even that's hard. No problem; give yourself permission to be where you are. Walking counts with God. When it's the best you can do, it's enough!<br />SoulFood: 1 Cor 10-11, Matt 2:9-15, Ps 139:1-12, Pr 31:25-27]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[A sense of awe<br />'Look up to the skies. Who created all these stars?' Isaiah 40:26 NCV<br />Author GK Chesterton wrote: 'The world is not lacking in wonders, but in a sense of wonder.' Listen to these facts which point to the wonders of our planet.<br />If the earth were as small as the moon, its gravitation wouldn't sustain our needs. On the other hand, if it were as large as Jupiter its gravitation would be so extreme, it would make human movement almost impossible.<br />If we were as close to the sun as Venus the heat would be unbearable, yet if we were as far away as Mars every region would experience snow and ice nightly.<br />If the oceans were half their size we'd get only 25 percent of our present rainfall, and if they were one-eighth larger, the annual rainfall would increase 400 percent, turning the earth into a vast, uninhabitable swamp.<br />Normally water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, but if that happened in the oceans, the amount of thawing in the polar regions wouldn't balance out and we'd all end up living in an ice-age.<br />To prevent this, God put salt in the sea to change its freezing point. How's that for a day's work? The Psalmist wrote: 'Lord, You have made many things... the earth is full of your riches... I will sing praises to my God as long as I live.' (Psalm 104:24;33 NCV)<br />If all that isn't enough to get you praising God, and wanting to know Him better, what would? John Stott said: 'Our greatest claim to nobility is our [ability] to know God, to be in personal relationship with Him, to love Him and to worship Him. We are most...human when we are on our knees before our creator.'<br />SoulFood: 1 Cor 7-9, Matt 2:1-8, Ps 97, Pr 31:22-24]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[How's Your Prayer Life?<br />'Evening and morning and at noon I will pray...' Psalm 55:17 NKJ<br />Today, a few words of wisdom from people past and present on spending time with God. It's sad but true that when we're faced with a busy day our appointments with God are often the first things we cancel. I'm ashamed to say I spend much more time on an average day on Facebook that I do 'facedown' before God.<br />Allow yourself to be challenged by these wise words.<br />'If you have so much business to attend to that you have no time to pray ...you have more business on hand than God ever intended you should have.' (DL Moody)<br />'The management of time is the management of self; therefore, if you manage time with God, He will begin to manage you.' (Jill Briscoe)<br />'The Word of God is demanding. It demands a stretch of time in our day; even though it be a very modest one; in which He is our only companion...God will not put up with being fobbed off with prayers in [twitter] style and cut short like a troublesome visitor for whom we open the door just a crack to get rid of him as quickly as possible.' (Helmut Thielicke)<br />'We must simplify our approach to Him. We must strip down to essentials (and they will be found to be blessedly few). We must put away all effort to impress, and come with the guileless candour of childhood. If we do this, without a doubt God will quickly respond.' (AW Tozer)<br />SoulFood: Isaiah 11:1-10, Luke 2:21-38]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Christmas presence<br />'...they presented gifts to Him...' Matthew 2:11 NKJ<br />Well, aren't you good? In the midst of unwrapping all those shiny new gifts and stuffing your face with turkey, you've made time to read your Christmas word4U2day.<br />So what was that first Christmas like?<br />(1) Everyone was welcome. So, who were amongst the first visitors around Jesus' cot? Devout Jews, committed God followers? Oddly, no, it was some new-age astrologers on the trail of a star. Right from His birth, Jesus welcomed all, no matter what background. What about you? Is there someone you know who you've got down as a bit weird and wacky, who you think would never make a Jesus follower? Try leading them to the cot of Jesus this Christmas. He welcomes all.<br />(2) Everyone had prezzies. Mary and Joseph weren't wealthy. Giving birth in a farmyard is hardly glamorous, yet this poor, young family were soon loaded up with gold, frankincense and myrrh, gifts only the rich could give. No matter how poor you are you're always rich with Jesus.<br />(3) Everyone was starry-eyed. The star guided the wise men to the birth-place. In the history of the solar system there's never been anything like it. God moved a star like we move a pawn in a chess game, that's because He '...works all things according to the counsel of His will.' (Ephesians 1:11 NKJ)<br />This Christmas, follow the star to the Son.<br />SoulFood Christmas: Isaiah 9:1-7, Matt 1:18-25, Micah 5:2-5a]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Unsung hero<br />'...Joseph [Mary's] husband, being a just man...' Matthew 1:19 NKJ<br />Forget Santa, forget Rudolph, forget Scrooge, you know who really has the Christmas spirit? Joseph. The simple carpenter (who doesn't even get a mention in two of the Gospels) shows us beautifully that Christmas is all about God.<br />So, why does God choose a guy with a certificate in woodwork to become His only Son's foster-parent? Why not a rabbi or a king? Well, because 'Man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.' (1 Samuel 16:7 NIV) And Joseph had a heart the size of Christmas.<br />Most men of Nazareth in 1 BC would have dragged their fiancée out into the street and pelted her with rocks if they so much as suspected she was carrying somebody else's child. But not our Joseph. God chose Joseph because of his good heart.<br />Secondly, Joseph shows us his Christmas spirit by placing God's plans above his own. Who needed the hassle of changing nappies and 3am feeds when the child wasn't even yours? Who needed all the curtain-twitching neighbours gossiping about your love-life when you didn't even have one?<br />Who? Joseph, that's who. Joseph: the guy who was prepared to change his whole world for a baby. Joseph: the guy who would put up with the moans and groans of others all for the sake of Jesus. Joseph: the guy who held a baby with a bright future one starry night 2000 years ago.<br />SoulFood: 1 Cor 4-6, Matt 1:12-17, Ps 117, Pr 31:18-21]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Fit but you know it!<br />'...Those who...have their senses exercised to discern...' Hebrews 5:14 NKJ<br />The Bible says that those who are spiritually grown up 'have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.' What does that mean? Well the word, 'exercise' suggests trimming and toning until we've got muscles in all the right places. The word 'discern' means telling the difference between things. So, this verse tells us we need to get in good shape when it comes to telling the difference between right and wrong, God-style. But how do you flex those muscles into shape?<br />We need to bench-lift a bit of Bible; it's no good to us on the shelf. Study it, chew on it, live by it; that'll firm up those discernment pecs. We need to compare what we hear from others, what we're thinking, what we're doing, alongside what the Bible says. And we need to practice it: just as a treadmill won't get you fit unless you work on it, the Bible won't help you grow unless you're acting on it.<br />And here's another important reminder. When it comes to knowing what's good for you and what's not, the Holy Spirit can speak to you and guide you when your head doesn't know which way to go. Sometimes things that you have dismissed as a hunch or an intuition are actually God's Spirit trying to convey the answer to you.<br />SoulFood: 1 Cor 1-3, Matt 1: 6b-11, Ps 113, Pr 31:14-17]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Olympic spirit<br />'...Stand firm. Let nothing move you...' 1 Corinthians 15:58 NIV<br />Kathryn Watt, Kieran Perkins and Clint Robinson all won gold at the 1992 Olympics. However it was British athlete Derek Redmond who defined the Olympic spirit that year, even though he finished last in his heat. Barcelona '92 was going to be his year and yet with just 175 metres to go, he felt an explosion of pain in his leg and he collapsed. Tears ran down his cheek as he realised a dream was over.<br />But as the medical stretchers pulled up by this lame athlete, something special happened. In a moment etched in millions of minds forever, Redmond hobbled the remainder of the track's bend. As he approached the final straight, his father and trainer, Jim Redmond, joined him. Father and son crossed the line, weeping together.<br />No medals are awarded; the other athletes finished minutes previously. Redmond had failed to make his final and yet 65 000 people in a stadium stood and applauded the real winners. Afterwards, when his father was interviewed, he said something that expresses the Father heart of God: 'I'm prouder of him, than I would've been if he'd won the gold medal. It took a lot of guts to do what he did.'<br />It's always too soon to quit. When you face tough opposition, and you just want to pull out of life's race; take heart knowing that: 'Blessed is the man who perseveres...' (James 1:12 NIV)<br />SoulFood: Malachi 1-4, Matt 1:1-6a, Ps 128, Pr 31:10-13]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Increase the peace<br />'...You will...be led forth in peace...' Isaiah 55:12 NIV<br />There's always one, isn't there? Mr. Cool who's totally chillaxed about the forthcoming all-important exam, boasting about how he's not done a single bit of revision because, 'Hey, who cares, they're just stupid exams, right?' Well Mr. Chillax has based his 'peace' on total delusion.<br />What about us? Is our peace based on nothing; are we deluded? Jesus said, 'I am leaving you with a gift-peace of mind and heart. And the peace I give isn't like the peace the world gives. So don't be troubled or afraid.' (John 14:27 NLT) When we seem to be in way over our head, Jesus assures us that He's there with us. Peace comes from knowing God has it all in hand. When we turn our head to what God can do, rather than focus on the problem, we get a 'peace of God, which transcends all understanding.' (Philippians 4:7 NIV)<br />It's easy to be at peace when everything is going your way, but what about when the maths doesn't add up; when the world is giving you a headache? Peace is not an absence of trouble; it's assurance in the trouble. Peace is why Paul, despite being locked in jail, could write: 'Don't worry about anything; instead, pray about everything.' (Philippians 4:6 NLT)<br />SoulFood: Zech 12-14, John 21:15-25, Ps 47, Pr 31:6-9]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Furnace faith<br />'...The God we serve is able to save us from it... But even if He does not...' Daniel 3:17-18 NIV<br />The Bible has to be the 'extreme sports' of books. Every other chapter you've got some faith-adrenalin-junkie risking life and limb in their love of God. Like Daniel and his crash course in lion-taming. Or pint-pot David squaring up to 'ten-men' Goliath armed with a catapult. Or Noah sailing the seven seas with a boat he's sharing with grizzly bears, wolves and elephants.<br />But the faith biscuit-takers have to be Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. They're the risk-riders who take a beach towel down to the local walk-in oven. And as the flames grew higher, God didn't provide a neat exit sign or a fire extinguisher or fireproof outfits and asbestos gloves. They're chucked into the furnace but God doesn't bring them out, He brings them through the fire. Have you got your own furnace at the moment? All around you things are hotting up, and God doesn't seem to be answering your SOS prayers? Well, perhaps He's developing your furnace faith.<br />Furnace faith is dead to doubt and blind to impossibility. It reaches up through the flames and holds hands with the One who specialises in the impossible. It makes the blaze bearable and the future brighter. Furnace faith makes Jesus visible. Listen to an unbelieving king: '...I see four men loose, walking in...the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.' (Daniel 3:25 KJV)<br />SoulFood: Zech 9-11, John 21:1-14, Ps 12, Pr 31:1-5]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Good grief (3)<br />'A time to gain, and a time to lose...' Ecclesiastes 3:6 NKJ<br />Different people grieve in different ways, even those in the same family sharing the same loss. The swirling feelings of our grief can include lots of responses:<br />Crying: 'I can't stop crying ever since Dad left...' Denial: 'This can't be happening, I don't believe it.' Questioning: 'What have I ever done to deserve this?' Anxiety: 'How will I cope? How am I supposed to behave?' Self-blame: 'If only I'd kept my mouth shut, Mum and Dad might still be together.' Anger: 'How could God let this happen!' Loneliness: 'Nobody understands what I'm going through.' Depression: 'There's nothing worth getting out of bed for.' Sadness: 'I wish my mum could see me now.'<br />Some days we might go through all of this in the space of an hour. Don't feel guilty about what's going on; it's all healthy. We shouldn't brush an important event under the carpet, nor should we be working to forget about someone. Grief has its season, and its season may last some time: 'For everything there is a season...a time to cry and a time to laugh. A time to grieve and a time to dance.' (Ecclesiastes 3:1,4 NLT)<br />Take hope, there will come a time to laugh and to dance without having to pretend to forget what's happened. Know that God grieves with you, understands your sorrow, and wants to reassure you: '...I will comfort you...as a mother comforts her child.' (Isaiah 66:13 NLT)<br />SoulFood: Jer 31:31-37, Heb 8:1-13, 2 Cor 3:1]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Good grief (2)<br />'A time to gain, and a time to lose...' Ecclesiastes 3:6 NKJ<br />Grief can come in all shapes and sizes. Ruth teaches us that grief can be saying goodbye to people we love: '...she kissed them goodbye, and they all broke down and wept.' (Ruth 1:9 NLT) Nehemiah teaches us that grief is seeing pain and need: 'The king asked me, &quot;Why are you so sad?&quot;... I replied, &quot;...the city where my ancestors are buried is in ruins, and the gates have been destroyed by fire.&quot;' (Nehemiah 2:2-3 NLT) Jesus understands that grief can be hearing of the death of a friend: 'Lazarus had died...then Jesus wept.' (John 11:13; 35 NLT)<br />Losing a job, living with a disability, a family bust-up, even getting ill, can all bring on grief. It's important we don't just grit our teeth and try to get on with it. Grief 'buried' is unfinished business. Depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress can all appear further on up the road if we don't deal with them through grief.<br />Mourning is the work of grief. The Bible says, 'There is a time to mourn.' (Ecclesiastes 3:4 NAS) That means God intends us to have a time to wrestle with all our pain and feelings. You grieve because you have lost something very precious to you.<br />Grieving is a way of honouring what was meaningful to you. It's an important part of your healing because it allows you to release the emotional pressure you're carrying. Whatever you're carrying, you're promised: 'The Lord is close to the broken-hearted; He rescues those who are crushed in spirit.' (Psalm 34:18 NLT)<br />SoulFood: Zech 5-8, John 20:19-31, Ps 67, Pr 30:29-33]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Good grief (1)<br />'A time to gain, and a time to lose...' Ecclesiastes 3:6 NKJ<br />Grief is the word we use to describe how intense life gets when we lose somebody, a relationship finishes, or a major trauma happens. Feelings can run so deep that our whole world seems out of sync when we grieve.<br />Poet WH Auden put it like this: 'The stars are not wanted now: put out every one. Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun; Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood. For nothing now can ever come to good.' Perhaps, at times, we agree, and would love nothing more to tear down the sky and pull the plug on this earth. It's ok to feel like that when we've lost something precious; it's all part of grieving. Nobody should expect you to 'get over it'; you need time to grieve properly and then find a way to take your sadness into the next part of your life.<br />The Bible doesn't hide away from loss. In Deuteronomy 34 we see a picture of a whole country dealing with their pain when Moses, Israel's spiritual father, was taken from them: 'So the sons of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days...' (Deuteronomy 34:8 NAS) There's no putting on a brave face and pretending things are ok. The entire nation stops what it's doing to grieve. They figuratively 'pack up the moon and dismantle the sun'.<br />So should you; when the tears are running, God is healing.<br />SoulFood: Zech 1-4, John 20:10-18, Ps 57, Pr 30:24-28]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[The flava of favour<br />'...Esther...won his favour...' Esther 2:17 NIV<br />The Bible says, 'The King was attracted to Esther more than to any of the other women, and she won his favour.' If you want the flava of favour, get the Esther know-how:<br />(1) Prep. You don't think your average diva just crawls out of her pit, without so much as a shower or a shave, looking pop princess do you? Nooo, there's work going on behind the scenes. Esther, too, put in the hours (12 months actually, read Esther 2:12) toning up, shaping up and covering up. Whether you're aiming to be our next top model or to lead worship at Easterfest 2020, the principles are the same: no shortcuts-preparation, talent and hard work are all essential.<br />(2) Focus. Esther, no doubt, turned a lot of heads but she focussed on one man: the King. Where's your focus? Do you want to please yourself, others or God?<br />(3) Destiny. Forget a date with the King; Esther had a date with destiny. The story suggests that Haman was Hitler's role model. He wanted to wipe out God's chosen people. A true hero was needed; enter Esther stage left: '...You have come to the kingdom for such a time as this...' (Esther 4:14 NKJ) Our beauty Queen uses what God has given her to save the day. What about you? You were born for such a time as this-how will you use your God-given talents?<br />SoulFood: 2 Tim 1-4, John 20:1-9, Ps 105:37-45, Pr 30:20-23]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[It wasn't me<br />'...They all began making excuses...' Luke 14:18 NLT<br />You know the excuses: 'Yeah but...no but...it wasn't me... I haven't even done anything.' Face it-we all have our uncomfortable moments before God.<br />Adam did when God asked, '...Have you eaten...the fruit I commanded you not to eat?' He replied, 'It was the woman you gave me...' (Genesis 3:11-12 NLT) Welcome to 'Pass The Buck: anyone can play!'<br />Like, 'I would help clean the church after youth club...but that's the youth-worker's job.' Like, 'I'd love to pray more...but I've got too much work on at the mo.' Like, 'One day I'll give the church some money...when I make as much as the guys with proper jobs.' See, we can con ourselves, like Adam, by filtering a tiny touch of truth into our excuses-after all, it was Eve that passed on that apple, right?<br />God doesn't love us any less because we try to con Him but we're not doing our relationship any favours. A mother loves a child with chocolate round his mouth, but she still wants to get to the truth of just how that cake magically disappeared. 'Jesus said to the people who believed in him, &quot;You are truly my disciples if you keep obeying my teachings. And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.&quot;' (John 8:31-32 NLT) Free yourself from excuses, get with the truth.<br />SoulFood: Micah 5-7, John 19:30-42, Ps 105:23-36, Pr 30:15-19]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Tiaras and tantrums<br />'...They all began making excuses...' Luke 14:18 NLT<br />Ok, you're the blushing bride-to-be, you're dressed to impress; your piece of arm candy is drooling into his cufflinks; the caterers have laid out a feast to awe the experts at Masterchef. This is your wedding and you're taking no prisoners. Except... where are the guests?<br />Your best mate texts you half way down the aisle, 'sorry m8. Sale on at Target. Not gonna make it.' The chief bridesmaid has already cancelled by updating her Facebook, 'Gutted to miss my sis' wedding 2day but have got driving test. Boo hoo.' Even your Ma and Pa are snuggled up at home watching the final of Dancing with the Stars. This is your big day and everyone has cried off with poor excuses.<br />In Luke 14, Jesus tells a story about pathetic no-shows at a wedding bash. The invites have gone out, but at the last minute one no-show cancels with: '...I have just bought a field and must inspect it...' (v. 18) In other words his possessions held him back. The next cancellation comes in the form of: 'I have bought five pairs of oxen, and want to try them out.' (v. 19) This farmer was too occupied with his career to accept. The final excuse was: 'I now have a wife, so I can't come.' (v. 20) This guest's personal life was more important than wedding invites. We all get a personal invite from God; let's not no-show through poor excuses. 'Set your affection on things above, not on...earth.' (Colossians 3:2 KJV)<br />SoulFood: Micah 1-4, John 19:17-30, Ps 105:16-22, Pr 30:10-14]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Driver's seat<br />'Your Kingdom come. Your will be done...' Matthew 6:10 NKJ<br />You're driving in the fast lane during rush hour; it's bumper-to-bumper but you're focussed on the car in front and have everything under control. A hand reaches over from the passenger seat and forces the wheel out of your hand. You're not scraping any vehicles, the airbag hasn't inflated, but you're criss-crossing lanes, swerving at the last minute, flying whatever direction your passenger is steering you.<br />How do you feel? Vulnerable? Powerless? Fearful? Of course you do. It's the same when God reaches over the steering wheels of our lives, when our safe plans for 'destination easy street' are hijacked by Him, and we find ourselves powerless in the fast lane, narrowly avoiding collisions.<br />Being a Christian is giving God the driver's seat. God isn't reckless with our lives, careering down the road like some joy-rider, but being His passenger can sometimes make uncomfortable driving. Being the Son of God didn't assure Jesus a cushy ride here on earth. You've probably recited The Lord's Prayer parrot-fashion a squillion times-but just what are those words you're giving to God, 'Your Kingdom come. Your will be done'? Jesus didn't include them because they make the rhyme. God's Kingdom can only come when we move out the way, and hand over the steering wheel so His will can be done.<br />Are you up for a God-driven bumpy ride through life? It's going to be exhilarating but it's the best life there is.<br />SoulFood: Neh 11-13, John 19:1-16, Ps 105:8-15, Pr 30:5-9]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Splash the cash<br />'...Freely you have received, freely give.' Matthew 10:8 NKJ<br />If you're the type of person who opens a birthday card and shakes the envelope for cash before you've even read the greeting, today's reading is for you. Jesus said, 'Give, and you will receive...much. Pressed down, shaken together, and running over, it will spill into your lap. The way you give to others is the way God will give to you.' (Luke 6:38 NCV)<br />Giving takes the spotlight off us. We can get so wrapped up needing that new album, those new boots, this new top, that we become 'me, me, me' bores. When we give, our eyes are taken off ourselves and shifted towards others and their needs. Like the price of that download could feed a starving family for a week. The money for those new boots could help educate a child in poverty. That new top could equate to clean water in Africa. (Seriously, check out charities like Compassion Australia.) Here's the win-win situation, the Bible promises that if we take care of others, God takes care of us: 'Whoever gives to the poor will lack nothing.' (Proverbs 28:27 NLT)<br />But how much should I give? 'You must decide in your heart how much to give. And don't give reluctantly or in response to pressure. &quot;For God loves a person who gives cheerfully.&quot;' (2 Corinthians 9:7 NLT) Did you get that, 'cheerfully'? There shouldn't be any dust blown off our wallets; we should have grins the size of Christmas as we dream up creative ways of splashing the cash for the sake of the Kingdom.<br />SoulFood: Eccl 11:7-12:1, Ps 39:4-13, 2 Tim 4:6-8]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Daydream believer (2)<br />'...The butler and the baker of the king...had a dream...' Genesis 40:5 NKJ<br />American poet Theodore Roethke wrote, 'What we need is more people who specialise in the impossible'. There's a recurring theme in the Bible about God choosing people to specialise in the impossible.<br />Moses specialised in water sculpture; he created a walkway through the Red Sea. Elijah specialised in barbecues; on Mount Carmel he called down fire from Heaven to barbecue the bull. And Joseph specialised in dreams; his God-given talent for knowing what dreams meant landed him a job equivalent to that of the Prime Minister.<br />With Joseph though, it was a long walk with God before his specialisation stopped landing him in trouble and landed him in the palace. His weird talent tore apart his family, took him from his home and got him locked up in prison. By this point you'd forgive him for not wanting to open his trap about his flair for dreams. But when a chance arises to interpret a dream for the most powerful man in the world, Joseph doesn't shirk his genius. Think about it, if he gets this one wrong, the penalty will be his life. Joseph forgets the past and opens the door to his future.<br />Paul tells us to do something similar: '... forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forward to those things which are ahead.' (Philippians 3:13 NKJ) Forget what the party-poopers have told you and reach out for the one who specialises in the impossible. Follow your dream.<br />SoulFood: Neh 8-10, John 18:25-40, Ps 105:1-7, Pr 30:1-4]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Daydream believer (1)<br />'He dreamed still another dream...' Genesis 37:9 NKJ<br />The lights go up. You assume centre-stage as the crowd sings your name. The first notes of your latest number one hit single fill the arena. You're just about to dedicate 'this next song to my pet budgie Ralph,' when BANG and...<br />...you get told off for day-dreaming at school!<br />God is the giver of dreams. The story of Joseph is sprinkled with them. It's his daydreaming that results in a bad bout of sibling rivalry. Here's little Joseph launching into his best 'Technicolour Dream Coat' tune, meanwhile his brothers are cooking up plans to sell him into slavery. All because they're threatened by what he's dreaming about.<br />There's a lesson for us: dreams often take a beating early on. Joseph teaches us to keep the dream alive. Not put off by his brothers' hatred, just four verses after his first dream, he's dreaming again. Only this time, bigger. Another lesson here: don't let your flame be snuffed out by your nearest and dearest; keep the faith. What big, bright idea keeps giving you that funny fluttery feeling in your stomach? What sends your heart racing at top speed? When your brain thinks about the future, what does it see? Joseph didn't let his dream die on the drawing board, he kept dreaming. Will you?<br />SoulFood: Neh 5-7, John 18:12-24, Ps 150, Pr 29:22-27]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Filthy feet<br />'Lord who may abide in Your tabernacle...?' Psalm 15:1 NKJ<br />Open up Exodus 30:18-20 and you may get kicked by pongy feet and slapped by dirty hands. 'The Lord said...&quot;Make a bronze washbasin... Aaron and his sons will wash their hands and feet there...whenever they...appear before the Lord...&quot;' (Exodus 30:18-20 NLT)<br />Why is this bit of hygiene detailed in the good book? Well, because the washing is symbolic of getting ourselves clean before God. Our hands represent our actions-all the bad stuff we've got our hands dirty with. Our feet represent walking; have we wandered off the path of righteousness and taken a dirt road to destination Sin? We're not talking about cleaning yourself up so God can love you (He loves you whatever state you've got into), we're talking about God cleaning you up so He can use you for His purposes.<br />The Psalmist writes, 'Lord, who may abide in Your tabernacle?... He who walks uprightly, and works righteousness.' (Psalm 15:1-2 NKJ) Paul points out: 'In a large house there are utensils... some for special use, some for ordinary.' (2 Timothy 2:20 NRS) This is not about salvation; as a Christian you're already in the house.<br />God loves to whisper his secrets to his friends. But to hear a whisper you need to get close. You need to shut out everything else and concentrate on the voice. Do you want to do great things for God? Well, wash that old dirt off, then cup your ear to the Father heart of God.<br />SoulFood: Neh 1-4, John 18:1-11, Ps 148:7-14, Pr 29:16-21]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Shout!<br />'...Shout; then the wall...will fall down...' Joshua 6:5 NKJ<br />That hole in your head isn't just for pushing food into, you know. It's for making noise (and not just those awful squelchy sounds you conjure up with old mash-potato-lips, either). God-noise. Prayer, praise, preaching and anything else that brings God's Kingdom closer begins in that little gap between your nose and chin.<br />When life is going well making God-noise can be easy. But what about when your world is a whirlwind? Are we still required to praise God when your life sucks? Worship is always a choice. Have you ever sung that song, Blessed be Your Name? What a challenge it lays down; to be gutsy enough to sing whether the sun is shining or whether the darkness is closing in!<br />It's easy to trust the God of calm, but what about the God of storm? Joshua faced this dilemma. He was about to take on Jericho, expecting a storm-and-a-half to erupt from their armies. And here was God arming him up with the weapon of the Word. There'd be no tanks to bulldoze walls down, no missiles strategically aimed at watchtowers. All Joshua had was the power of a shout. The mouth was going to be the secret weapon that brought down an entire city. And yet with a shout of faith, the walls came tumbling down. What about you? Will you choose a shout of faith to see your walls come tumbling down?<br />SoulFood: Col 3-4 + Philemon, John 17:13-26, Ps 148:1-6, Pr 29:11-15]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[God's Approval<br />'...we are God's masterpiece...' Ephesians 2:10 NLT<br />You'd think the last thing the rich and famous would want is poison and nasty bacteria pushed into their mushes. Yet botox is a must-have accessory. Why? Because youth and beauty is currency. We love our pop stars super-sleek, our movie stars ultra-unblemished, top models baby-skin smooth. The world seems to have a bigger pair of clapping hands if we are beautiful.<br />And so we get sucked in. We throw our allowance at the malls: a new pair of shoes, a designer hair-do, serious make-over, all in the hope that we might get the approval of others. Now there's nothing wrong with wanting to look your best, and a touch of retail therapy isn't necessarily wrong. But if we only feel like a somebody when we're wearing lippy, we've got problems.<br />You see, we can be approval-addicts. If we're getting applauded because we look good or we can kick a bag of air between some posts or we're top of the class, we feel great. But being pretty, sporty and clever is not the whole sum of us. We get our approval from God. Heaven applauds us, not for what we do, but because God shines through us. We want people to think well of us, and yet Almighty God always thinks well of us: 'How precious are Your thoughts about me, O God. They cannot be numbered.' (Psalm 139:17 NLT)<br />SoulFood: Col 1-2, John 17:1-12, Ps 147:12-20, Pr 29:6-10]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Heart of the matter (3)<br />'...Everyone who loves has been born of God...' 1 John 4:7 NIV<br />Guys have bizarre relationships with girls their own age. As kids, we start off well enough, but somewhere down the line, we go our separate ways, kicking footballs and punching our best mates. By the time we're in double figures we somehow believe that breaking wind in comedic fashion is a dead cert for wooing the opposite sex. We soon realise that men are from Mars and women are from, well, Valley Girl and City Beach... you get the idea.<br />Perhaps our relationship with God follows a similar path. We start off as tiny tots knowing that God is that great big man with the beard who lives in the sky, and then somewhere down the line, life happens and all of a sudden our idea of God that we have bottled up and kept on a shelf doesn't add up at all.<br />Any relationship needs to start by getting to know that special somebody personally and seeing what makes them tick. We do God a disservice when we treat Him like Captain Birdseye of the sky.<br />Perhaps, we need to grow up from our tiny tot mentality and learn what makes God tick: '...let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.'

<introtext><![CDATA[Heart of the matter (2)<br />'Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?' Romans 8:35 NIV<br />Ok guys, you don't need a rehearsed comedy routine up your sleeve to impress the girls. And girls, you don't need to resemble a starving, blank-eyed model to impress the guys. If they like you then they like you. It's the same with our relationship with God. You don't have to perfect 'Light of the World' on a keyboard to woo God into loving you; nor do you need to pray till you've lit up Heaven with your prayers to grab God's attention.<br />Facts are: God is so into you it's pretty somersaulting amazing. Like any relationship, we can get vulnerable and insecure; we believe our own stupid press: 'I'm not good enough,' 'how can you love me, when I do this...?', 'I'll try harder to be loveable by doing this and that.'<br />Think about it: is there anything particularly loveable about a person who just snores, whines and poops all over you. Not really. Yet mums of newborn babes all over the world would beg to differ. God is the ultimate in loving parents. Nothing you can say or do will alter God adoring you like a mother adores her child. Nothing: '...neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.' (Romans 8:38-39 NIV) Face facts: you're loveable.<br />SoulFood: Josh 1, Ps 27:11-14, 2 Tim 2:1-13, 1 Cor 16:1]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Heart of the matter (1)<br />'...keep it between yourself and God...' Romans 14:22 NIV<br />Relationships aren't the safest of hobbies. Think about it; your best mate's mascara streaming down her face in the girl's toilets, and why? All because her boyfriend has stamped over her heart. Or what about mums and dads who use words like a fighter uses fists-jabbing at each other, looking for that killer uppercut? Or maybe you yourself have done your fair share of bruising hearts. Yes, best to remain a little nervous when it comes to interacting with others.<br />Perhaps we carry our doubts and questions with us when it comes to this God stuff too. After all, God asks us to be in a relationship with Him and others. In Matthew 22:34-40 Jesus is asked what is the greatest commandment. He doesn't say 'watch out for the homicides', or 'cut down on the blasphemy.' He sums up the Christian faith with: 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind...and love your neighbour as yourself.'<br />Clearly, Jesus is bigger on relationships than He is on rules. Maybe, it's time for some of us to stop listing reasons why God wouldn't accept us; or stop trying to follow a set of rules for God's approval; or stop hiding behind theologies and clever thinking about God; and start opening up our heart before God. Yes, today, place your heart into the hands of God: cultivate a relationship.<br />SoulFood: Jos 19:24-21:45, John 16:12-18, Ps 2, Pr 28:25-28]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Men in black<br />'The door to Heaven is narrow. Work hard to get in...' Luke 13:24 NLT<br />You're minding your own business down the local shopping centre, when a mysterious man, dressed in black (it's always black, isn't it?) sidles up and whispers in a husky, secretive voice, 'This suitcase has a million dollars in it. It's yours if you want it.' And then he disappears as quickly as St. Kilda's chance of serious silverware.<br />What do you do? How do you react? Immediately your suspicion radar is alerted. Who is this guy? Where has this money come from? Is it for real? Is it a joke? Am I now caught up in one of those films where the innocent man framed for something he didn't do? Most of us would think there's something not right somewhere. Nothing in life comes for free. There's always a catch, right?<br />Here's the thing: we can have the same suspicions with God. So, you love me unconditionally, hey God? I don't have to up my holiness stakes before you'll love me? I don't have to give more money or pray till my forehead bleeds or learn the Sermon on the Mount in Aramaic; you just love me?!<br />God loves you full stop. No terms and conditions. No strings attached. No catch. Now picture scenario two: A mysterious God whispers to your soul, 'I've got a life far greater than any million dollars can buy you. It's yours, if you want it.' What do you do? Will you take up the offer?<br />SoulFood: Jos 16:1-19:23, John 16:1-11, Ps 130, Pr 28:21-24]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Full force fall<br />'...God demonstrates His own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.' Romans 5:8 NIV<br />Imagine your ear has been torn off by a psychotic possum, and the doctor 'fixes' it with a stapler from his stationery drawer, then tells you to take a little whisky for the pain. That's malpractice. He isn't dealing with your problem appropriately.<br />We can all be our own worst doctors with our sin. We bandage over our dirty dealings, plaster over our mess and expect that we're ok with God because really, deep down, we're good people. At heart, we need desperate attention to undo all our spiritual malpractice.<br />When you confess your sin to God, it's like admitting you're sick and that you want the medicine that will save you. Jesus takes our sin to the cross and save us from it. How? There's a true story about a man and a parachute instructor.<br />They both leapt from a plane, but the man's ripcord was faulty. His chute failed. He plummeted to the ground facing certain death. Seconds from impact, the instructor rolled over, hitting the ground first and taking the full force of the fall. By making himself a human crash-mat, the instructor died but the man lived. At the cross Jesus 'took the fall' for you. Today He asks you to live for Him. Will you?<br />SoulFood: Jos 14-15, John 15:18-27, Ps 65, Pr 28:17-20]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Make some waves<br />'You are the salt of the earth... You are the light of the world.' Matthew 5:13-14 NKJ<br />Were Jesus and his mates afraid of making waves? Not at all! They actually wanted to do that. Jesus would be pleased to read, 'He stirs up the people...' (Luke 23:5 NKJ), and the apostles would be chuffed to hear that they had '...turned the world upside down...' (Acts 17:6 NKJ) What about you? Are you excited that you could make waves with your mates, or does the thought of that scare you silly?<br />Jesus said: 'You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt loses its flavour...it is then good for nothing but to be thrown out... You are the light of the world... Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it gives light to all... Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father...' (Matthew 5:13-16 NKJ) Salt is meant to flavour; not sit on a shelf in a shaker. Light is meant to brighten, not just to look pretty. You are meant to tell people the good news of Jesus, not just know it yourself.<br />You might be thinking, 'But I'm so shy,' 'I don't know what to say' or 'I don't know the Bible enough.' They're all excuses, so get over it! You are the only Christian some of your mates will ever meet; a lot is riding on you. Get out there and make some waves.<br />SoulFood: Jos 11-13, John 15:5-17, Ps 14, Pr 28:13-16]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Lead me, O Lord... make Your way straight before my face.' Psalm 5:8 NKJ<br />Thank the Lord for the GPS. Once upon a time, we all planned our own routes painstakingly with maps and atlases; or simply jumped in the car and set off hoping that road signs would guide the way. Either way, if you got lost, getting back on track was hard work and you had to rely on your passengers for help.<br />The best thing about a GPS is that, should you ever go off track, it says 'recalculating', takes a few seconds then gives you a new route. It may take a bit longer than the original route, but you'll still get there eventually if you follow the directions. One thing a GPS can't do, though, is drive the car for you (not yet, anyway!) You have to do the driving, and you choose whether to follow the instructions or not.<br />God is a bit like a perfect GPS. If you go off course (which we all do at times) He'll lead you back on track but He won't take over driving the car. You can always choose to ignore Him. One big difference is that with God, you may not know your immediate destination. You've not programmed it in, God has. It may be a bit scary following directions when you're not sure where you're going but one thing you can be sure of is that it's the best place for you.<br />SoulFood: Jos 8:30-10:43, John 14:26-15:4, Ps 146, Pr 28:9-12]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Tough love<br />'Whoever says to the guilty, &quot;You are innocent,&quot; peoples will curse...' Proverbs 24:24 NIV<br />Have you ever lied to protect the reputation of someone you love, covered up for a mate or rushed in to 'help' without being asked? We're not talking about acts of compassion where help is genuinely needed here, but we're talking about a destructive kind of helping.<br />It's natural to want to protect someone you love from the painful consequences of their actions. But by letting them off the hook you might end up hurting them more, according to the Bible. Sometimes, people need to hit rock bottom before they'll let God help them back up; so you stepping in may not be helping in the long run.<br />You may know the story of the prodigal son; he ended up in a pigsty before he got serious about his sin problem. His dad didn't step in and interfere, though. Is that because he didn't care? No, of course not. It was tough for him to stand by and watch (it's called 'tough love' for a reason). When the son came to his senses, he said, '...here I am starving to death! I will...go back to my father and say...I have sinned.' (Luke 15:17-18 NIV) As a result of not being 'helped out' too early, his life was so much better in the end, and so were his relationships.<br />So maybe you need to back off, and place your loved one into God's hands. He loves them even more than you do.<br />SoulFood: Jos 5:1-8:29, John 14:15-25, Ps 118:19-29, Pr 28:5-8]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[God will take care of you!<br />'...He will take care of you...' Psalm 55:22 NLT<br />Gladys Aylward, missionary to China more than fifty years ago, was forced to flee when the Japanese invaded Yuncheng. With only one assistant, she led 100 orphans over the mountains towards free China. During the journey she was petrified. After a sleepless night she started the day with no hope of reaching safety. A thirteen-year-old girl in the group reminded her of the story of Moses and the Red Sea. 'But I'm not Moses,' Gladys sighed in despair. 'Of course you aren't,' the girl said, 'but God is still God!' They all made it through safely, and were reminded that no matter how inadequate they felt, God was still God, and they could still trust Him.<br />Sometimes God calms the storm; other times He lets the storm rage and calms us. If you're overboard in a stormy sea, are you going to sulk that it's still stormy, claiming God doesn't care, and try and swim to safety yourself? Or are you going to get in the lifeboat God's offering you, and let Him take you through the storm to the safety of the shore? What an opportunity to spend some quality time with Him on the way as He steers you through the waves!<br />Next time you feel like you're in a storm and it's not letting up; take a time-out, and ask God to help you calm down. Trust Him, knowing that whatever the situation, however small you feel, God is still God; and He's massive.<br />SoulFood: Gen 14:18, Ps 110, Heb 5:5-11]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Be like a bug<br />'Take a lesson from the ants...' Proverbs 6:6 NLT<br />'What on earth have ants got to teach me?' you might well be wondering right now. Quite a lot, as it turns out. And the main lesson we can draw out today concerns work.<br />Yep, work: that annoying thing that stops you sleeping all day and having fun all night. Whether it's at school, college or a job, there's no escaping work. But work is not a dirty word. God made work and He gave it to us to do. Having the right attitude to work is crucially important-without it, you could find yourself in a bit of trouble with exams, colleagues, money. So how can we get it right, starting now?<br />Over to our itsy-bitsy friends, the ants:<br />(1) If you want to play hard, you have to work hard. Check out Proverbs 6:6-11. If you want to enjoy your summer holiday, then don't slack off in lessons during this term. You need to work hard now to prepare for whatever job you may end up with in the future. If you're working, don't blow all your wages but save some for the future. Boring, maybe. But wise.<br />(2) Work together, and help others out. Ants work together to carry stuff that individually they wouldn't have a chance with. If there's something you're good at, offer to help out a friend who isn't so good. Maybe they can help you with something in return.<br />SoulFood: Jos 1-4, John 14:1-14, Ps 118:10-18, Pr 28:1-4]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Don't be a corroding bomb<br />'Cease from anger... it only causes harm.' Psalm 37:8 NKJ<br />When you hear the words 'World War 2', perhaps you think 'History, all in the past. Dull, dull, dull. Nothing to do with me.' But believe me, if someone says 'World War 2 bomb', you should sit up and listen.<br />That's because there are still heaps of WW2 bombs buried in the most random places; and just because they didn't explode way back then doesn't mean they won't now. Actually, the longer they're left, the more dangerous they are. Without getting too technical, the insides corrode, the detonator can be exposed so the bomb becomes unstable. This means it could go off at any time, posing a risk of destruction and death to anyone nearby: even now, all those years after the war.<br />A corroding bomb is a very dangerous bomb; and the same can be said for corroding anger. If you bury your anger and let it corrode away under the surface, it could explode at any time, when you least expect it. Don't be proud of anger, but pray about it.<br />It's dangerous; it hurts those closest to you; it causes you to lose respect in the eyes of others; it can slam doors of opportunity in your face; and God doesn't like it. Check out what He says about anger in Psalm 37:8, Proverbs 16:32 and Proverbs 19:11. Today, do your best to diffuse any corroding bombs of anger in your life before they go off.<br />SoulFood: 3 John + Jude, John 13:31-38, Ps 118:1-9, Pr 27: 23-27]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Perfect timing<br />'...It is wonderful to say the right thing at the right time!' Proverbs 15:23 NLT<br />Has someone ever said something to you at completely the wrong moment? Just before a date, your sister criticises your outfit and completely knocks the wind out of your sails. Or heading into an exam, your mate reminds you how you flunked last time. Confidence shattered!<br />Just remember the next time you're about to shoot your mouth off: do you really need to say that, and if you do, is right now the best time for it? Could it be worth taking a few seconds to pray about it? After all, your words could break someone's day.<br />But just as easily, they could make someone's day too. There's nothing better than someone saying something great at just the right time. You're having the worst day ever, everything's going wrong, then completely randomly someone says something really great and compliments you. It makes you smile all day (once you've got over the initial embarrassment), and when you're feeling down, you remember it. Or maybe a mate tells you how much your advice has helped them, just when you've been thinking you never had anything worth saying.<br />Remember: your words could make or break someone's day. Our challenge is to think and pray about how we can say the right thing at the right time today.<br />SoulFood: 2 Chron 35-36, John 13:18-30, Ps 114, Pr 27:20-22]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Soaking in the good stuff<br />'Whatever is in your heart determines what you say.' Matthew 12:34 NLT<br />Have you ever tried cleaning a car using a sponge and a bucket of dirty water? No matter how clean and nice the sponge is to start off with, as soon as it squelches in that mucky bucket, all you'll get out of it is gunky water. No matter how much you squeeze it out, it won't get clean again until you put it in some nice clean soapy water. Use that sort of water, and you'll get the car sparkling in no time. The sponge is only ever going to be as effective as what it soaks up.<br />What's that got to do with today's word? Think about it. We're that sponge and, if we soak up dirty stuff, we're going to give out dirty stuff. How can we hope to clean up our lives if we're not immersing ourselves in something sparkly and great? The only way to make sure we're saying the right stuff, acting the right way and living the way God wants, is to soak ourselves in Him, right to our core, our hearts.<br />Spend time reading the Bible. Make it a priority to pray. Fill yourself with God's goodness, and it'll spill over into your relationships, your life, just about everything. Today, make sure you're soaking up the good stuff, and filling your heart with God, so that everything that comes out of your mouth is good and godly.<br />SoulFood: 2 Chron 32-34, John 13:1-17, Ps 95, Pr 27:17-19]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[How does your garden grow?<br />'A farmer went out to sow his seed...' Luke 8:5 NIV<br />The seed of God's word is full of life, but the soil it's planted in is the main thing that affects how well it grows; whether that life is nurtured, or suffocated. Are you sucking the life out of God's seed when He plants it in your life or are you making space to let it grow?<br />If you're so tough and hard-packed the seed won't stand a chance and it'll just shrivel up and die. Maybe you think you're fine alone and you don't need God. Well, if that's you, use prayer as your plough to break up the hard earth.<br />Perhaps your soil is kind of superficial; it looks great at first glance, but dig a bit deeper and you'll soon see it doesn't go deep. You know how to talk the talk, but you're not really living the life. If that's you, use prayer as your spade to give you deeper roots and get you going with God.<br />Or is your soil heaving with weeds, like a messy bedroom that's such a tip you can't ever find what you're looking for? There's so much 'stuff' in your life, there's no space for God's seed to grow at all. If that's you, use prayer as your hoe to knock out all the weeds.<br />However your garden grows, get praying. Plough, dig and weed until your soil is good and God is alive in you.<br />SoulFood: 2 Chron 29-31, John 12:37-50, Ps 102:18-28, Pr 27:13-16]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Money rules, OK?<br />'Because you have been trustworthy...' Luke 19:17 NIV<br />Money! It's the answer to everything, right? Wrong. Money may buy you a bed but it won't get you sleep. It buys books but won't give you brains. It gets you medicine but not health. It could buy image but not character. It could even get you religion...but not salvation.<br />So, does that mean God doesn't want you to have money? No, not at all. He may choose to trust you with more money when you show that your trust isn't in your money, but in Him alone. (1 Timothy 6:17) When you become a good steward of what you have, God will entrust you with more. '...Then he sent for the servants to whom he had given the money, in order to find out what they had gained with it. The first one came and said, &quot;...Sir, your mina has earned ten more.&quot; &quot;Well done...&quot; his master replied. &quot;... Because you have been trustworthy in a very small matter, take charge of ten cities.&quot;' (Luke 19:15-17 NIV)<br />When you can walk away from material things to do God's will, God will trust you with more. Abraham left the security of his home to fulfil God's plan, and he ended up one of the world's wealthiest men.<br />Today, are you going to let money be your ruler, or God? I think you'll find life makes a lot more sense with God in charge, so trust Him today, and show Him He can trust you.<br />SoulFood: 2 Chron 25-28, John 12:20-36, Ps 102:12-17, Pr 27:10-12]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Go all the way<br />'I consider everything a loss compared to...knowing Christ...' Philippians 3:8 NIV<br />How far would you go to stick up for your mate? Would you tell someone to stop having a go at them? Would you step into a fight to take a punch instead of them? Would you spend time with them if they were feeling low? I'm guessing if they're a great mate, you'd probably at least have a think about doing that stuff for them.<br />But what about Jesus? Would you stick up for Him if you were being teased about being a Christian? Would you keep reading your Bible on the bus if you were getting laughed at? Would you tell people you're praying to Jesus for them when they're going through a tough time? Would you choose youth group over chilling out in town?<br />If you'd do it for your mates, how much more should you be willing to do it for Jesus, your best mate? Paul did; it was his biggest goal: '...everything else is worthless when compared with...knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. I have discarded everything else, counting it all as garbage, so that I may have Christ.' (Philippians 3:8 NLT) He didn't hold back, he didn't have any regrets; he was willing to go all the way for God.<br />So come on; reassess your priorities, and be willing to go all the way for Jesus today.<br />SoulFood: Lev 27:30-33, Num 31:48-54, 1 Cor 16:1-3, 2 Cor 9:15]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Go home (2): Do a U-turn<br />'...While he was still a long way off, his father...ran and embraced him...' Luke 15:20 NAS<br />James MacDonald writes: 'Maybe you've done something you think is beyond [God's] mercy...or someone hurt you and you don't understand why God let it happen... maybe you'd rather live by your own rules. I don't know why you're running, but I know one thing: you're tired... Jesus talked about a son taking off from his dad's house. After this runner's rise and fall, he woke up one day in a pig-sty wondering, &quot;How'd I get here? I need to go back but what'll my dad say?&quot; Have you ever thought, &quot;If I come back how will God receive me?&quot; Some people think He wouldn't care one way or the other... But that's not how Jesus described His Father... those feet pounding the pavement are God's feet running towards you. He's been scanning the horizon for a glimpse of you...and now that He sees you He's in a full run. &quot;While he was still a long way off, his father...ran and embraced him.&quot; God put that in the Bible so every runner will know what to expect when they reverse course.'<br />Are you running away from God today? Stop, turn around, come back home. He says, 'Turn to me again.' (Revelation 3:3 NLT) There's no sin He can't forgive. It's ok to do a U-turn. His promise is: '...Let him turn to the Lord, and He will have mercy on him...' (Isaiah 55:7 NIV)<br />SoulFood: 2 Chron 22-24, John 12:12-19, Ps 102:1-11, Pr 27:7-9]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Go home (1): Stop running<br />'...While he was still a long way off, his father...ran and embraced him...' Luke 15:20 NAS<br />Did you ever try and run away when you were little because your parents wouldn't let you do something? You packed up your favourite teddy and a box of bikkies in your Teletubbies rucksack and headed for the open road?<br />If you ever got that far, chances are that your mum and dad were straight out trying to find you, to bring you home. Not because they just wanted to scream and shout at you, but because they loved you. No doubt the situation would have involved a bit of a telling off; but the reason behind it was love. If you'd have succeeded in running away, what would your life have been like? Yeah, being told off wouldn't have been nice, and you might not have understood it back then, but for most people most times, discipline from parents makes sense when you look back.<br />So...why do you run away from God? He's your perfect Father. He wants the best for you, and will give you everything you need. He won't ever stop looking for you, and His discipline is always for the best. So stop wasting time running away from Him or sulking because things don't seem to be going your way. Instead, turn round and run into His arms-He's waiting for you. What are you waiting for?<br />SoulFood: 2 Chron 19-21, John 12:1-11, Ps 76, Pr 27:4-6]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[He's always looking out for you!<br />'...the Lord is in this place, and I was not aware of it.' Genesis 28:16 NIV<br />Aren't you glad God's presence isn't reserved for people who 'deserve it'? He visits whiners and complainers, the impatient, those who are fed up with life, the doubtful and indecisive. He visits people who don't even agree on His existence and He reveals Himself to those who've followed Him their whole lives-His kids who've been saved by His grace. For example, Jacob wasn't really spiritual. Running away after swindling his brother and lying to his father, he didn't deserve what God did for him. After stopping for the night, he dreamed he saw a ladder to Heaven with angels on it, ascending and descending. Then God gave him this promise: 'I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go.' (Genesis 28:15 NIV) When Jacob awoke next morning he said, 'The Lord is in this place, and I was not aware of it.' Pearl Bailey said, 'People see God every day, they just don't recognise Him.' Some of us are 'tuned in' when it comes to sensing His presence; others like Jacob can 'miss it' coz their focus is elsewhere.<br />Listen: 'Whether we're aware of it or not...every moment...we're encountering God...who is trying to catch our attention.' You never know how He'll make Himself known to you or who He'll speak through. After the resurrection Mary Magdalene thought Jesus was just the gardener! God can use all kinds of things to wake us up to Him-a miraculous healing, a restored relationship or even a really hard time. Later God revealed Himself to Jacob by wrestling with him and dislocating his hip. What will it take to get your attention?<br />SoulFood: 2 Chron 16-18, John 11:38-57, Ps 81, Pr 27:1-3]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Perfectionist?<br />'Even perfection has its limits...' Psalm 119:96 NLT<br />Don't let fear of failure stop you from trying something-give it a go! Remember these facts when you're worrying that you won't be good enough.<br />FACT: sorry to be the one to break it to you, but no matter how much you may think you're all that, you're not perfect and you never will be on this earth. Only Jesus managed that one. Yes, it's great to strive to be like Jesus in character and, through Him, we're made perfect in God's eyes; but that doesn't mean you have to be perfect at everything you do! Sometimes you just need to give yourself a break.<br />FACT: having said that, don't stop trying. God wants you to give things a go. If you make mistakes (which, believe me, you will-and that's fine), then learn from them and let Him help you. Ask Him what you can take away from the experience and grow from.<br />FACT: some things, you won't succeed in at all. That's to be expected, you're only human, and God's made us all different. Have reasonable expectations, and don't put too much pressure on yourself. And remember, the same is true for others. Stuff you are great at, they might not be, so don't be too hard on them if they just don't get it.<br />Remember, God doesn't expect you to be perfect; just to give things a go.<br />SoulFood: 2 Chron 12-15, John 11:28-37, Ps 50, Pr 26:27-28]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Faith<br />'Then he [Job] fell to the ground in worship.' Job 1:20 NIV<br />We can learn a lot from Job and his attitude despite having a seriously bad week! Every day God sends us opportunities to grow spiritually, disguised as problems! After losing his house, his children, his animals and his health, the Bible says Job '...fell to the ground in worship.' That's not the normal human response to tragedy, is it? Job didn't react that way because he understood what was happening or because he was nuts. No, he did it in spite of his circumstances! He was able to respond that way because: (a) He looked inside! He knew that God was teaching him something really valuable and important: '...and when He has tested me, I shall come forth as gold.' (Job 23:10 NIV) Job simply put his trust in God (b) He looked forward! He reminded himself that in the end it's all going to be ok when we stick with God (c) He looked up! In the middle of a nightmare, Job saw the God who promised to direct each step we take. More importantly, he trusted God's heart of love and knew that as God, what happens is His call. Don't make the mistake of thinking it was easier for Job to trust God than it is for you. Remember, Jesus hadn't even been born at that point so He didn't even have the same proof of God's love as we do! As humans we tend to go for what we know, even if it's rubbish. There's safety in the familiar but that's not God's plan for your life. So what should you do? Look forward and most of all look upwards!<br />SoulFood: 2 Chron 8-11, John 11:17-27, Ps 8, Pr 26:23-26]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Let God in<br />'...suffering produces perseverance...' Romans 5:3-4 NIV<br />At some point in life, you'll experience suffering. It's not nice, but you can choose how you're going to deal with it. You can either ignore God for letting it happen, or you can lean on Him to help you, ask Him what He wants you to learn, and how you can grow through it. That doesn't mean you have to be chirpy all the time; it's fine to cry with God, tell Him when you're feeling stressed, sad or just downright confused. Just make sure you don't ignore Him. He's there, waiting, with His arms wide open, to give you a big hug.<br />Dealing with suffering in a godly way really refines your character, and that can have a huge impact on other people too, often more than words alone could.<br />Sinclair Ferguson tells of a young Christian who contracted AIDS doing medical research in Zimbabwe, and was the first physician to die of AIDS in the UK. In his last days, he suffered so much so he could hardly communicate. His wife couldn't understand what he was trying to say. He wrote the letter 'J', so she went through all the words in his dictionary beginning with J, but they were all wrong. It was only when she tried 'Jesus' that she got it right. He wanted her to know that Jesus was with him in his suffering; and that was all either of them needed to know.<br />SoulFood: 2 Chron 5-7, John 11:1-16, Ps 83:9-18, Pr 26:17-22]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[For Heaven's sake!<br />'We are citizens of Heaven.' Philippians 3:20 NLT<br />Patrick Jenkins says, 'Having lived as missionaries, my family and I realised that moving to another jungle location meant a lot of work. We knew the discomforts of snakes and bugs. One morning, a few days after beginning to clean our temporary home, we were taking a short break. While we were drinking tea a large black beetle flew through the room making a loud buzzing noise. My wife let out a scream. Astonished more by her scream than by the beetle, my youngest daughter cried out, &quot;For heaven's sake, mum!&quot; After a moment's silence my wife replied, &quot;That's the only reason I'm here.&quot;'<br />Paul says, 'We are citizens of Heaven.' And Peter speaks of '...an inheritance that can never perish, spoil or fade-kept in Heaven for you.' (1 Peter 1:4 NIV) Don't forget that your life now is only the short story; the whole book is in Heaven. Make every decision, think every thought and do every action, remembering where you will be, not just how it will affect you now.<br />Don't wait until you're in God's presence before you think, 'Doh! I wish I'd done that before when He asked me to.' Yes, you might end up in the rainforest with yucky bugs; but if that's part of God's plan for you, do you really want to miss out on it? He really does know what He's asking you to do. So listen to God, and do what He asks; for Heaven's sake!<br />SoulFood: Num 9:15-23, Exodus 24:15-18, Matt 17:1-8, Acts 1:9-11]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Don't be sleepy<br />'Stay awake and pray for strength against temptation.' Matthew 26:41 NCV<br />You have heaps of potential; and probably have no idea of it. God wants to do so much in you, and through you. Even if you're not convinced of that, there's someone who is-the devil-and he'll do anything he can to stop you reaching that potential. So you need to start believing in yourself and get defending against the enemy.<br />What's the best defence? Prayer! You know the areas you struggle with, so get praying about them. Don't try and go it alone either. Find a couple of Christian mates you really trust, and get together every couple of weeks, share with each other honestly how you're doing, and commit to pray for each other. That's a great foundation to have, and the honesty will help you be aware of where the enemy is trying to get at you. Jesus knew we'd all struggle with temptation-today's word carries on: 'You want to do what is right, but you are weak.' (v.41)<br />If He's advising us to pray, then surely it's the right thing to do! Paul writes: 'Put on every piece of God's armour so you will be able to resist the enemy in the time of evil. Then after the battle you will still be standing firm... Pray in the Spirit at all times and on every occasion.' (Ephesians 6:13-18 NLT)<br />When your prayer life goes, so does your protection. So don't be sleepy-get praying.<br />SoulFood: 2 Chron 1-4, John 10:22-42, Ps 83:1-8, Pr 26:13-16]]></introtext>

Matthew 6:34 NKJ<br />It's easy when you're stressing about the future to turn into a green-eyed monster; but God doesn't want you to be jealous of your mates. His plan for you is perfect for you. His plan for your mate wouldn't be right for you; so don't go wanting it!<br />If you work hard and listen to God, you'll end up way better off than if you strive to be like someone else. Why bother wasting time trying to be a bad copy of your mate, when God's got plans for you to be a completely, totally, amazing, unique, priceless you?<br />Think of it a bit like a painting by Leonardo Da Vinci. Given the choice, would you rather have a really good copy of the Mona Lisa, or the original Last Supper? If you've got any sense, you'd go for the original! Why? Because no matter how good the copy is, under scrutiny by experts, it would still be declared a fake and would be worth way less than an original. The mistakes would show up.<br />Yes, they're completely different pictures-you may even think you like the other one better-but they're both amazing for different reasons. God is the artist, you're the painting. You're a work in progress; but you're a complete original. So don't go trying to get repainted to look like a different painting. Let God do His thing, and let Him take care of tomorrow.<br />SoulFood: 1 Chron 26:20-29:30, John 10:11-21, Ps 133, Pr 26:7-12]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Topsy-turvy<br />'...Do not worry about tomorrow...' Matthew 6:34 NKJ<br />Maybe you're a 'news junkie' but even if you only ever see the news before one of your favourite programmes, you'll know how depressing current affairs can be. It just seems like it's all bad news, doesn't it? And you're probably finding that as you're getting a bit older, it's harder to ignore. Bring back the good old days when you were a kid and no one expected you to have an opinion on it!<br />This last year or so, it's all been about the economy. It affects everything, doesn't it? Allowance cut; 'Sorry dear, it's the economy!' No summer holiday this year; 'Well, we can't afford it, what with the economy.' Those new boots you've had your eye on for weeks; 'Not right now, too expensive. Economy!'<br />It'd be easy to let your whole world be taken over worrying about the economy and spend hours grumbling about how much better it could be. It's all around you, and it seems almost impossible not to be ruled by it. But God says you have a choice of two economies; the world's, and His.<br />In God's topsy-turvy kingdom, the rules are reversed. He owns everything, He's in charge, and He'll give you everything you need. Choose not to give in to greed, but instead to give in to God. Trust Him, and know that He's got your future securely in His hands; He won't let you down.<br />SoulFood: 1 Chron 23:21-26:19, John 10:1-10, Ps 99, Pr 26:1-6]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Don't be a stress-head<br />'...Do not worry about tomorrow...' Matthew 6:34 NKJ<br />Dr Jay Adams tells the story of a guy who decided to quit worrying. When a friend noticed how chilled he looked and asked what he'd done, he said, 'It's simple; I just hired a guy to do my worrying for me.' Asked how much that cost, he replied, '$500 a day.'<br />'Where will you get the money?' his stressed friend asked. His reply? 'That's his worry, not mine!'<br />Jesus tells us to hand our worries over to Him; and He won't even charge us fifteen grand a month for the pleasure! He understands that we're anxious about money and clothes and having what we need. So He instructs us, 'Do not worry, saying, &quot;What shall we eat?&quot;...or &quot;What shall we wear?&quot;' (Matthew 6:31 NIV) He's basically saying to you, 'Don't be a stress-head!' Instead, see how much more God's in control: 'Look at the birds...your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? ...God clothes the grass of the field... will He not much more clothe you?' (Matthew 6:26-30 NIV)<br />God's a big God. He'll give you all you need. Stressing is for people who don't know Him, and don't have their security in Him. So today, instead of stressing about tomorrow, why don't you try focusing instead on 'His kingdom and His righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well...' (Matthew 6:33 NIV) Trust that He's got it all in control.<br />SoulFood: 1 Chron 19:1-23:20, John 9:24-41, Ps 115, Pr 25:26-28]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[What next?<br />'...Do not worry about tomorrow...' Matthew 6:34 NKJ<br />It's really easy to start to panic as you get a little bit older, thinking about the future. 'What on earth am I going to do with my life?' 'Will I ever find that special someone who makes my heart go aflutter?' (Yes, even you guys; we know you think about it really!) 'What if I get really ill; what will I do then?' 'Will I be able to get a job?' 'Will I have any friends?' 'Will I have enough money?'<br />All those things are perfectly normal things to think about; but here's the deal. You don't have to worry about it. At all. Finito. Stop. Seriously; I mean it! God says, '...Do not worry about tomorrow...' and He means it. He has got everything (yep, even that question that you haven't even dared ask your best mate!) under control. God's plan for your life doesn't stop five minutes ago, or even in five minutes time; it goes on, right until the end of your life.<br />And get this: it's a perfect plan! As planners go, God's the best. Let Him be your life-coach, trust that He's in control, know that He knows your questions and He's got them in hand. Read 2 Corinthians 9:8-'all things, at all times'; that applies to you too! Relax, knowing that God '...will meet all your needs according to His glorious riches in Christ Jesus.' (Philippians 4:19 NIV)<br />SoulFood: 1 Chron 16-18, John 9:13-23, Ps 105:1-15, Pr 25:23-25]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Are some more 'equal' than others?<br />'...as believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ, don't show favouritism.' James 2:1 NIV<br />We're told here to see everyone as equal, and not have favourites. Does that mean we suddenly have to be 'best mates' with everyone? No, not at all. But what it does mean is that we shouldn't judge other people at all; that should be left to God. We should give everyone an equal chance, not excluding people just because they may not seem like us.<br />Sarah was 15 and living rough in a tough city. She came along to a youth mission one day, where local teenagers were getting fake tattoos painted on their arms. As she hung back, it was obvious she wanted one but didn't dare ask; she expected to be told 'no'. One of the youth workers called her over, she joined a queue, and had a tattoo done. He'd never seen a smile so big as the one on her face.<br />It would have been easy to ignore her, but Jesus didn't want him to. Sarah got involved in a church afterwards, and started to learn more about Jesus. That's what it means to put the Bible into practice, and not show favouritism. Jesus offers us unconditional love, so shouldn't we do the same? It's not always easy if people are different from us; but we owe it to them to love them anyway, the way Jesus loves us, and welcome them into the church family with open arms. It could change their lives-and ours, too!<br />SoulFood: 1 Chron 12:23-15:29, John 9:1-12, Ps 15, Pr 25:21-22]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[No fear!<br />'I was afraid...' Luke 19:21 NIV<br />Imagine someone giving you a quarter of a million to look after for them, leaving you to do what you wanted with it. No strings, just an opportunity to make a profit. What would you do? I'm hoping you'd be like the first two servants in Jesus' parable of the talents, not the third one, who, quite frankly, was a wombat.<br />The first two tested their skills, used their initiative, took some risks, made some good investments and more than doubled their money. The boss-man was happy. But what did the other guy do? His idea: to wrap it up in his hanky and keep it safe in his pocket. What?!? Did you read right? Yup; he hid the cash in an old snot-rag. Boss-man was not a happy bunny with him. He'd completely wasted the opportunity-and so the cash was taken off him and given to the first guy who'd actually used his brains.<br />What was wombat-boy's reason? He was afraid. So afraid, that he did absolutely nothing. Don't be like that. God's given you some amazing talents, and He wants you to use them-not hide them away in a hanky. It's the only way to grow your talents and make them better-if you don't, you might find out that one day, like the third man, you don't have them anymore. What a tragedy. Don't let the fear stop you. Give it a go and make God smile.<br />SoulFood: Exodus 20:1-17, Matt 5:1-12]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Be a chain-link<br />'I am...the God of Abraham...Isaac, and...Jacob...' Exodus 3:6 NKJ<br />Did you ever make a paper chain for a party? You painstakingly cut out all the bits of paper, glue them all together, then hang it up. If you hung each loop individually, it wouldn't look anywhere near as impressive. The loops all needed each other for the chain to work. If just one of them broke, or wasn't stuck properly; the whole chain would fall down.<br />What's that got to do with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob? Simple. God's plan for your life is part of a much bigger plan, involving many other people. He might start something through you; but that doesn't always mean you'll get to see the end of it. Think of it like you being at one end of the chain, and you affect someone next to you in the chain, then they affect someone else and it goes on.<br />It'd be easy to say, 'Yeah, but if I'm not going to see the results, I don't wanna know,' wouldn't it? But think back to the paper chain-if you're the loop that breaks, the whole chain falls down. Don't be the one who makes it fall. Moses had to learn that he was part of a chain going back years and years and years. Paul got it too-check out 1 Corinthians 3:7-8. It's amazing what God can do through you, when you recognise that you're part of a bigger picture.<br />SoulFood: 1 Chron 10:1-12:22, John 8:42-59, Ps 123, Pr 25:18-20]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Be yourself!<br />'We have different gifts...' Romans 12:6 NIV<br />Have you ever had your French teacher instruct you in biology? Had the postman cut your hair? Seen an opera singer chase down a robber and make an arrest? Watched a pastry chef perform open heart surgery? I'm guessing not. Why? Because generally people are skilled in certain areas, and not others.<br />If we all went about trying to do everything, the world would be a bit of a mess. Imagine if only postmen cut hair; we'd all be wearing hats to cover the mess. Or French teachers taught biology; we'd all think the human skeleton looked like the Eiffel Tower! People being arrested wouldn't have a clue what their rights were if they were sung to them in Italian. And you really don't want a chocolate éclair in place of your heart, do you? But get them all doing what they're great at and we'd be entertained, get our mail on time, speak great French and have amazing desserts put in front of us.<br />The Bible says 'We have different gifts, according to the grace given us.' (Romans 12:6 NIV) It's time for you to hunt out your gift and develop it. Don't spend your life trying to be something you weren't meant to be. God made you who you are and when you try to be somebody else the best you can ever be is number two. So be yourself-after all, there's no one more qualified to be you than you!<br />SoulFood: 1 Chron 7:20-9:44, John 8:31-41, Ps 30, Pr 25:13-17]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Rebekah's story (3)<br />'...I will draw water for your camels also...' Genesis 24:19 NKJ<br />Rebekah's story teaches us a really important truth about life: when opportunity comes knocking, make sure you're ready to answer the door. Rebekah didn't think about all the hours it'd take to water ten thirsty camels. She didn't say, 'Er, sorry, no, I might break a fingernail.' She lived by the Biblical principle: 'Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might...' (Ecclesiastes 9:10 NKJ)<br />She didn't suddenly change when Eliezer showed up, thinking she could get something good out of him; she had the same 'servant heart' day in, day out. And boy did it pay off!<br />Faithfulness always brings rewards. God is watching your attitude and actions in small things. Big moments don't come to people who wait for them; they come from faithfulness in small moments, daily routine and service behind-the-scenes. Rebekah didn't try to be super-spiritual, she was just kind. As a result she got attention, earned respect, and ended up in the family of Abraham.<br />One more thing to learn from Rebekah: when she took Eliezer home to meet her family they wanted her to follow custom and wait ten days before going meet Isaac. But Rebekah said, 'I will go.' (Genesis 24:58 NKJ) When God opens the door, don't delay. And don't question if He's got the right person for the job. If God has called you, you're the right person. Be a Rebekah, and get going.<br />SoulFood: 1 Chron 6:1-7:19, John 8:21-30, Ps 86, Pr 25:8-12]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Rebekah's story (2)<br />'...I will draw water for your camels also...' Genesis 24:19 NKJ<br />So, Rebekah spends hours getting water for the camels, just coz she's nice and loves helping other people out. We could all learn a thing or two from Rebekah. She expects nothing at all in return for what she's done: amazing! How easy do we find it to do nice things for people when we know we won't get anything in return?<br />Anyway, back to Rebekah. Suddenly, the servant Eliezer brings out a nose ring and a couple of bracelets, and asks if he can stay the night. Would alarm bells be ringing for you? Not for Rebekah; she rushed home to try and help. What a woman! This time though, Rebekah did get rewarded for her kindness. We don't get told how many times she'd shown kindness to strangers before, but it seems like this wasn't the first time. When she stopped in her tracks to help Eliezer, she had no clue that he was going to make her an offer that would change her life; that those same camels would transport her back to Isaac, make her his bride, shower her with great wealth and make her a privileged ancestor of Christ.<br />Tip: if you want to get ahead in life, show up early, stay late, work hard, be honest and be a problem solver. Live by Christ's teaching to go the extra mile. (Matthew 5:41) Maybe people will be reading your story in years to come!<br />SoulFood: 1 Chron 3-5, John 8:1-20, Ps 96, Pr 25:1-7]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Rebekah's story (1)<br />'...I will draw water for your camels also...' Genesis 24:19 NKJ<br />Do you have any idea how much camels drink? One camel can drink about 180 litres! So ten camels... well, do the maths. That's a lot of water!<br />Now imagine you don't have a single tap in your town, just an old-fashioned well. If you popped out to get yourself a drink and just happened to see some bloke hanging out by the town well with ten camels, what would be the logical thing to do? Yes-run, quickly, before he has a chance to collar you to help!<br />But that's not what Rebekah did. Read the whole story in Genesis 24 to get the bigger picture. Basically, Abraham wanted to find his son Isaac a good wife (that's the way they did it in those days-less romance, more practicality). So he sent his old servant out, and he prayed that God would make it clear who she was. Rebekah came along and was willing not only to stop what she had been doing (getting her own water) so that the servant could have a drink, but also to stay and give all ten of his camels a drink of water. All 1800+ litres of it! That's not a small offer-it would have taken hours.<br />So why did she offer it? Because she was a kind, generous and godly woman, who saw that serving others was a great thing to do. Come back tomorrow to see what happened next.<br />SoulFood: 1 Chron 1-2, John 7:45-53, Ps 9, Pr 24:30-34]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Don't eat junk<br />'Your words were found, and I ate them...' Jeremiah 15:16 NKJ<br />A woman bought a parrot and then returned him to the pet shop the next day. 'This bird doesn't talk,' she told the owner.<br />'Does he have a mirror?' asked the owner. 'Parrots love mirrors. They see themselves and start up a conversation.' So the woman bought the mirror. Next day she returned. The bird still wasn't talking. 'How about a ladder? Parrots love walking up and down a ladder. A happy parrot is more likely to talk.' The woman bought a ladder. The third day, she was back again and the bird still wasn't talking. 'Does your parrot have a swing? If not, that's the problem. He'll relax and talk up a storm.' The woman reluctantly bought a swing and left. When she walked into the shop the next day, she wasn't impressed.<br />'The parrot died,' she said. The pet shop owner was shocked. 'I'm so sorry. Tell me, did he ever say a word?' he asked. 'Yes, right before he died,' the woman replied. 'He said, &quot;Don't they sell any food at that pet shop?&quot;'<br />Do you get it? You can spend your whole life on mirrors, focusing on appearance; on ladders, focusing on being the best or the most popular; on swings, focusing on entertainment-but starve to death spiritually. Don't fill up your life with so much junk that you forget about the most important thing: God's Word. Fill yourself up with that every day, and you'll thrive spiritually.<br />SoulFood: 1 Chron 17:1-20, Heb 11:4-12:3, Ps 18:20-29, Pr 4:18]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Hello-Jesus!<br />'...but the third day, He shall rise again' Matthew 20:19 NKJ<br />Halloween Night. That annual bit of so-called 'fun' when parents dress their children up as Satan's little helpers and demand treats from neighbours 'or else'!<br />It's true to say that Christians are known for being a tad sensitive when it comes to the subject of 'Halloween', but everyone with a brain cell between their ears ought to see that there are better things to throw a party over! And anyway, if it's out-of-this-world supernatural stuff you're looking for then crack open the party-poppers for Jesus; He's King of the supernatural:<br />(1) demons shrieked when He walked down the street-and ran from Him fearing His power to bind them in eternal chains with a single Word (2) the forces of nature obeyed His command, water turned to wine, crashing waves became gentle ripples and fish even coughed up coins! (3) He died, and then rose from the dead! This was no Shaun of the Dead situation, Jesus didn't return from the grave as a moaning, groaning half-dead shadow of His former self; His resurrected body was now fit for eternity, like ours will be when we're raised to reign with Him on the final day.<br />The most supernatural thing of all is that Jesus is here right now with you by His Holy Spirit. Say 'Hello' right now; ask Jesus to say, 'Hello' right back in your life. There's a prayer on the next page to introduce you to Jesus and make today Hello-Jesus, not Halloween.<br />SoulFood Reading: Deut 18:9-18, Dan 2, Isa 47:5-15, Acts 16:16-34 (Avoid the Occult)]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Bothered?<br />'...the very hairs on your head are all numbered. So don't be afraid; you are...valuable to God...' Luke 12:7 NLT<br />If you watch a couple who are totally in love, there's a certain sparkle in their eyes as they look at each other. It's their love language. Did you know that God had His own love language? Just check out the Bible. It's full of adventure stories about God saving His people as well as songs about how much He loves and longs to be loved. And the amazing thing is the Bible was written for you, so you could get to know God and how He feels about you. Bonus: check out Jeremiah 33:10-11.<br />Sometimes we think God will only speak to us in church, or if we've prayed for five hours. Some of us believe that unless the world is ending we shouldn't bother God. Guess what God is bothered about? He is bothered about what you've got to say. He's bothered about what kind of day you're having. And you know what? He'll keep on being bothered until the day you die! Listen: '...the very hairs on your head are all numbered. So don't be afraid; you are...valuable to God...' (Luke 12:7 NLT) If God can be bothered to keep a tab on how many hairs you've got growing out of your head then surely He wants to know about the choices you make, the stuff that hurts your feelings and what makes you really stoked! The thing is when you start to include God in the little things, you'll find that the bigger picture begins to become clearer and make more sense. So today don't just muddle through; get Him involved and take a moment to thank Him that He's bothered!<br />SoulFood Reading: 1 John 3:11-5:21, John 7:25-44, Ps 104:27-35, Pr 24:29]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[X Factor<br />'... be eager to do right and to change your hearts and lives.' Revelation 3:19 NCV<br />There are two types of 'Xs'. One kind of X is the kind the teacher marks in red on your exam sheet meaning 'you've got it wrong'. Another kind of X signals you've got the X-factor: 'you've got what it takes to be a winner!'<br />Which type of X marks your heart? God wants us to 'be eager to do right and to change your hearts and lives'. He wants us to have the X-factor marking our hearts. He wants us to be a winner.<br />But it's so easy to have the wrong X. Temptation is all around us all the time: to smoke, to drink, to swear, to have sex before marriage, to carry a knife, to steal, to fight, to lie, to cheat, to gossip, to disobey in any way we can!<br />God says, 'The temptations in your life are no different from what others experience. And God is faithful. He will not allow the temptation to be more than you can stand. When you are tempted, He will show you a way out.' (1 Corinthians 10:13 NLT)<br />Yes, we're tempted, every day, to say and do things we know we shouldn't. But God promises He'll never allow it to be too difficult for us to say 'no'. He'll always show us another way, a better way of doing things instead. So we've got no excuses for the wrong X marking our hearts! 'Be eager to do right!'<br />SoulFood Reading: 1 John 1:1-3:10, John 7:14-24, Ps 104:19-26, Pr 24:28]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Learn and reflect (3)<br />'Happy is the man who...gains understanding.' Proverbs 3:13 NKJ<br />There's a story of a fox, a wolf and a bear who went hunting together. After each of them caught a deer, the bear asked the wolf how they should divide up the spoils. He said, 'Everyone should get one deer.' At that point the bear ate the wolf. Then the bear asked the fox what he thought. The fox offered the bear his deer, and suggested the bear ought to take the wolf's deer as well. 'Where did you get such wisdom?' asked the bear. 'From the wolf,' replied the fox.<br />The school of life offers many difficult courses. Some we sign up for, others we find ourselves taking unexpectedly. All can teach us valuable lessons, but only if we desire to learn and are willing to reflect on these lessons. Also, not learning from experience is more costly. It's tragic to pay the price for experience and not learn the lesson. But that's often what happens. When an experience is negative we want to run away from it and say, 'I'll never do that again.' No, don't run away from your experiences; instead, evaluate and learn from them.<br />People who make it a practice to reflect on their experiences and learn from them are rare. But when you meet one, you know it. 'Cry out for insight, and ask for understanding. Search for them as you would for silver, seek them like hidden treasures.' (Proverbs 2:3-4 NLT)<br />SoulFood Reading: Ezra 9-10, John 7:1-13, Ps 104:1-18, Pr 24:26-27]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Learn and reflect (2)<br />'...if it costs everything you have, get understanding.' Proverbs 4:7 NCV<br />Christmas comes early if you're feathered. October is one long festive eat for turkeys. Each day the grain keeps coming, thicker and faster than the one before. Why, you've barely enough room to fit another seed in your gobbled gob but hey! It's that festive time again. Enjoy it while it lasts.<br />Now our feathered little friends are not wrong. It's just nobody has told them the fatter they are, the fitter they are for Christmas dinner. They don't have the full picture.<br />Are you a bit feather-brained? Here's what the Bible says about getting the full picture: 'If you are wise and understand God's ways, prove it by living an honourable life, doing good works with the humility that comes from wisdom. But if...there is selfish ambition in your heart, don't cover up the truth with boasting and lying. For jealousy and selfishness are not God's kind of wisdom. But the wisdom from above is first of all pure. It is also peace loving, gentle at all times, and willing to yield to others. It is full of mercy and good deeds. It shows no favouritism and is always sincere.' (James 3:13-17 NLT) Our own narrow-minded blinkered view of things isn't wisdom. To avoid being a bird-brain we need to get in step with God. When you know God, you know where to find wisdom. 'Your hands made me and formed me; give me understanding to learn Your commands.' (Psalm 119:73 NIV)<br />SoulFood Reading: Ezra 6-8, John 6:52-71, Ps 114, Pr 24:23-25]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Learn and reflect (1)<br />'...My power works best in weakness.' 2 Corinthians 12:9 NLT<br />At 19 months, Helen Keller contracted the illness that eventually left her without hearing and sight. Back then, those labelled 'deaf and dumb' were classified as idiots. But Helen's parents didn't agree. They hired a teacher to work with her and eventually she learned to read and write using Braille. Amazingly, in 1904 she graduated with honours from Radcliffe College, then devoted her life to helping others. A businessman called Andrew Carnegie paid her an annual wage. Writers Mark Twain and Robert Louis Stevenson praised her. Almost every President of her day invited her to The White House. Even though Helen died in 1968 her legacy of courage lives on. When asked if there was anything worse than being blind, Helen replied, 'Yes, having sight but no vision.'<br />At 12 Thomas Edison developed such severe hearing loss that his teachers recommended he leave school. Instead Edison used his handicap to drown out distractions and focus on his work. As a result the boy who was labelled 'a slow learner' gave the world over 1000 inventions, including the light bulb and the motion camera.<br />Who gets to decide what's 'normal' anyway? Is it being short versus tall or rich versus poor? The truth is, God's given all of us unique abilities that He expects us to explore. And interestingly, the real handicaps don't belong to those who are born with physical and mental challenges. No, they belong to the so-called normal people who've accepted lazy and 'can't be bothered' attitudes as part of life. God said, 'My power works best in weakness,' so you can let your difficulties stop or inspire you. Which will it be?<br />SoulFood Reading: Ezra 3-5, John 6:35-51, Ps 127, Pr 24:19-22]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Work experience<br />'...[His...experience] making Him perfectly [equipped]...' Hebrews 5:9 AMP<br />Maybe you're not quite there yet, but sooner or later you'll be asked to knock up a CV and one of the headings will be Work Experience. What are you supposed to put? What Work Experience? Does copying things from a blackboard and coughing them up in exams qualify as work experience?<br />Here's the thing: with God all your experiences can be used for His work. David's early CV read 'shepherd boy'. This gave him plenty of work experience firing stones with precision at dangerous beasts as he protected his flock. When a position came up involving protecting a nation from a danger named Goliath, who was better equipped for the job than David? God used his work experience for greater things.<br />Or what about technicoloured Joseph? His school report read 'Always daydreaming'. What kind of skill is that? Well, dream interpretation was exactly the kind of skill that Pharaoh was looking for in his new prime minister's post.<br />Now, what about you? What are your experiences? Maybe you think you'll never be used by God because your only experience is feeling guilt or insecure or fear-well, this is exactly what would qualify you to help others struggling with the same issues. Experience isn't what happens to you, as much as what you do with what happens to you.<br />SoulFood Reading: Ezra 1-2, John 6:25-34, Ps 98, Pr 24:15-18]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Foot-shaped mouth<br />'...be...gentle, showing...consideration for all.' Titus 3:1-2 NAS<br />Annoying, isn't it? Your Dad begins that over-practiced speech with the immortal words, 'Why, when I was your age...' accompanied by an exaggerated list of how tough things were back in those days.<br />'When I was your age we didn't have Playstations. We made our own fun. A length of string and a bit of lead piping and we were happy.' Yes, Dad. 'We didn't have soft drink or flavoured milk or anything. You held your tongue out while it was raining and you were grateful for the drink.' Yes, Dad. 'Kids today, you don't know you're born.' There isn't any room for how tough things might be for you today.<br />Well, maybe it's passed down in our genes or something, but sometimes we can be just like Dad. Example: your mate says to you, 'I'm really struggling with my coursework at the minute; I've just got too much on.' Now, your mate probably wants a word of reassurance or a shoulder to cry on or a bit of practical help. Instead, you choose to wade in with your Dad's size nine boots, and offer this piece of advice, 'You think that's bad. You're lucky you don't do Geography, that's twice as much coursework as anything you've got. And I've got swimming after school. And all my IT to catch up on...' STOP. This isn't a 'hardest life' competition. Other people's problems matter as much as yours. So '...be...gentle, showing...consideration for all.'<br />SoulFood Reading: Exod 34:29-35, Mk 9:2-27, 2 Cor 3:7-18 (Radiance)]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Sympathy for the devil<br />'...nor give place to the devil.' Ephesians 4:27 NKJ<br />Of course you'd never dust off the old welcome mat for the devil, so why is Paul spelling out the blatantly obvious to the Ephesians?<br />Well, we can certainly make ourselves a home for our secret little habits. We can all get quietly comfortable with our sins. We can all settle into a first-name basis with certain temptations; this is like bringing out tea and Tim-Tams for the devil and asking him to kick off his shoes in our living rooms. So, how do you show him the front door?<br />First, resist his invitations: '...submit to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you.' (James 4:7 NKJ) As you submit to God, and live by the Word, the devil can't get a foot in your front door. 'Put on the full armour of God so that you can...stand against the devil's schemes.' (Ephesians 6:11 NIV) With truth, faith, peace, salvation and God's Spirit wrapped around you, the devil has nowhere to aim his accusations. 'The temptations in your life are no different from what others experience. And God...will not allow the temptation to be more than you can stand...' (1 Corinthians 10:13 NLT) The devil may dangle the bait but it's up to you whether you bite.<br />SoulFood Reading: Zeph 1-3, John 6:1-24, Ps 85, Pr 24:11-14]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Toothaches 'n' heartaches<br />'Looking diligently lest any...root of bitterness springing up trouble you...' Hebrews 12:15 KJV<br />Gone are the days when dentists used string and pliers to yank out those toothy pegs. We're much more advanced now: we use pneumatic drills that sound like a mouse's motorbike. In order to dodge the dreaded drill we need to avoid fizzy drinks, candy floss and anything else that generally tastes like heaven on a stick. Turning away from the toothpaste inevitably means an extraction. The sugars just eat away our molars.<br />Far worse than glucose for eroding our insides is unforgiveness. It's a killer. Left untreated it can take a simple irritation and turn it into anger. The anger soon builds up into resentment. Resentment festers into retaliation. Retaliation equals extraction: the extraction of love and peace in your life. You can't control what other people do, but the 'inside' part-the part you can control-is the place God holds us accountable.<br />The Bible says, 'Looking diligently lest any...root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and...many be defiled.' (Hebrews 12:15 KJV) When you're faced with a hurtful, offensive situation, don't let a wrong attitude eat away your insides. Instead, ask God to help you replace those destructive thoughts with mercy and forgiveness towards the people who hurt you. The Bible says, 'Above all else, guard your heart, for it is the wellspring of life' (Proverbs 4:23 NIV) and 'The words of good people are a source of life.' (Proverbs 10:11 CEV)<br />SoulFood Reading: 1 Tim 4-6, John 5:31-47, Ps 126, Pr 24:10]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[You + Jesus = Heaven<br />'Come to Me...Let Me teach you...' Matthew 11:28-29 NLT<br />Anyone who begins a sentence with 'No offence but ...' can be counted on to say something majorly offensive. Just like 'Not to be rude but...' usually ends with something like '...your deodorant smells like a rat's nappy'. Or that priceless gem, 'I'm your friend, and you'll thank me for telling you this...' is bound to end with words you'd rather not hear.<br />You see, the only thing you can learn from some people is how to close your ears and run away fast. Not so with Jesus. The stuff He wants to tell us is good for us. It's meant to build us up not tear us down. See, the lowdown with Jesus doesn't involve trivial half truths; it involves downloading the blueprints of Heaven.<br />Jesus knows God's heartbeat and He invites us to get in sync with it: '...No one truly knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him.' (Matthew 11:27 NLT) Check out what He says next: 'Come to Me, all of you who are weary and carry heavy burdens... Let Me teach you...and you will find rest for your souls.' (Matthew 11:28-29 NLT)<br />Listen to those words, 'Let Me teach you.' Let Me teach you how to handle those mood swings. Let Me teach you how to rise above it all. Let Me teach you how to live the right way on Earth.<br />SoulFood Reading: 1 Tim 1-3, John 5:16-30, Ps 5, Pr 24:8-9]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Clean slate living (2)<br />'Behold, I make all things new...' Revelation 21:5 NKJ<br />You know when you're at a party with your oldies and someone grabs the karaoke and starts to croon the old song, 'Regrets, I've had a few, but then again, too few to mention...'? Well, maybe it's a good point. We've all got chapters in our lives we wish had never been written. But what's the use in dwelling on them? Rehashing old hurts or mistakes is like watching the same film over and over again hoping for a different ending.<br />So how do you bury your past? Firstly, don't play the blame game. Blame is a waste of time. When you blame yourself, you multiply guilt, chain yourself to the past, and still feel down on yourself. When you blame God you cut yourself off from His power: 'I-yes, I alone-will blot out your sins for My own sake and will never think of them again.' (Isaiah 43:25 NLT) Why cut off God to spite yourself?<br />When you blame others you add to the distance between them and you. You lose the only option that works: forgiveness. Instead, trust the One who promised to 'make all things new', and move into freedom from hurt and sin. 'Get rid of all bitterness, rage, anger, harsh words, and slander, as well as all types of evil behaviour.' (Ephesians 4:31 NLT) Don't dress yourself in unforgiveness; the person you'll most hurt is you.<br />SoulFood Reading: Habakkuk 1-3, John 5:1-15, Ps 15, Pr 24:7]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Clean slate living (1)<br />'...They shall obtain joy and gladness; sorrow and sighing shall flee away.' Isaiah 51:11 NKJ<br />'Confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so God can heal you. When a believing person prays, great things happen.' (James 5:15 NCV)<br />When you live with God's clean slate over your life you're a force to be reckoned with. You see, God's clean slate means He looks at you as if you've never been in the wrong. 'You are holy and blameless as you stand before Him without a single fault.' (Colossians 1:22 NLT) When God forgives, He's not resenting letting you off the hook, He's not storing up all your sins ready to throw back in your face at the first sign of your next slip up. He completely whitewashes them from His memory: '...though your sins are like scarlet, I will make them white as snow. Though they are red like crimson, I will make them as white as wool.' (Isaiah 1:18 NLT)<br />God's forgiveness isn't measured by what you've done. Nothing you've ever thought, said or done comes as too shocking for God to forgive. 'I tell you the truth, all sin...can be forgiven.' (Mark 3:28 NLT) What do you do to receive forgiveness? Earn brownie points with God? Give money to charity? Beat yourself up sufficiently with guilt? Nope. 'If we confess our sins to Him, He is faithful and just to forgive us.' (1 John 1:9 NLT) Are you getting the picture yet? God forgives you. Question is: do you forgive yourself?<br />SoulFood Reading: Nahum 1-3, John 4:39-54, Ps 41, Pr 24:5-6]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Hot passion<br />'I must work the works of Him who sent Me...' John 9:4 NKJ<br />Passion is the secret ingredient that will push you through the hard times and keep you pressing on until you've reached the prize. Nehemiah had passion. He's the guy who resigned from a top parliamentary job in order to walk across a desert just to build a wall.<br />We learn that Nehemiah was always TXTing God, always dependent on God and put to good use his God-given organisational skills. We learn that sometimes just moaning about how bad a situation is not good enough; sometimes we have to take action. But most of all, we see a burning passion that drove Nehemiah on. You see our biblical Bob the Builder had more than enough reasons to down tools and walk away.<br />In chapters 4 and 6 of the book named after him, Nehemiah ran into problems from foreign trouble-makers. His diary reads, 'Our enemies were trying to scare us, thinking, &quot;they will get too weak to work. Then the wall will not be finished.&quot; But I prayed, &quot;God make me strong.&quot;' (Nehemiah 6:9 NCV) That determined attitude ensured Nehemiah built the wall around Jerusalem in just 52 days. Is there something you believe God has called you to do, but your mind keeps throwing up reality checks and asking you 'who do you think you are?' Don't quit just yet. Pray 'God make me strong' and get a bit of fresh passion inside you.<br />SoulFood Reading: 2 Pet 1-3, John 4:27-38, Ps 87, Pr 24:1-4]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Tutti frutti (3)<br />'...Be fruitful...' Genesis 1:28 NKJ<br />Remember when Jesus was arrested and Peter does an audition for 'Kung Fu Panda'-crisscrossing the air with his sword? Or what about Saul holding the coats of the religious thugs as they threw stones at Stephen? Or Thomas and his world record-breaking bout of disbelief?<br />What would the church today look like if God hadn't pulled these boys up on their mistakes? We'd have youth leaders cutting off the ears of rowdy delinquents, pastors stoning their music leaders and no Easter because no one would believe Jesus is alive. God the gardener pruned these not-so-nice qualities out of our faith heroes for His, their and our good.<br />'We do not enjoy being disciplined. It is painful, but later, after we have learned from it, we have peace, because we start living in the right way.' (Hebrews 12:11 NCV) What child looks forward to an ear-bashing from Dad? But in order to grow up we need to leave our childish ways behind.<br />Peter spent hours and hours in the presence of God so by the time he wrote his letters in the New Testament he was no longer a sword-wielding ninja but an expert in submitting to authorities above him. Saul becomes Paul, defender of Christians, not their persecutor. These two Bible heavyweights prove that when God prunes you, everyone benefits.<br />SoulFood Reading: Esther 4:9-5:3, Heb 4:7-16 (Approach the King Boldly)]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Tutti frutti (2)<br />'...Be fruitful...' Genesis 1:28 NKJ<br />Vineyards have only one purpose: to produce grapes. Energy spent on anything else is wasted. The pruner has four things in mind: removing what's dead or dying; making sure sunlight gets to the fruit-bearing branches; increasing the size and quality of the grapes; encouraging new grapes to develop.<br />God does the same with you. He will cut away parts of your life that are no good to Him or anyone else. Sometimes God does it even though we don't understand what's happening. Maybe, you've been loved-up with someone and all of a sudden it's over. Maybe your Xbox has just blown up. Maybe your mate, the one mum says 'is a bad influence', has just moved to another part of the country. Maybe all this isn't just a long streak of bad luck. Maybe God the gardener has been pruning stuff off your life that isn't very helpful for you.<br />Whether it's a bad habit, wrong attitude or lesser priority, God cuts away anything that distracts you from living out who He made you to be. So don't blame all your pain on the devil. Don't throw the book at other people if you're facing tough times at the mo, it may just be God answering your prayer for greater blessing in your life. It may be God dealing with your sin. It may be God preparing you for your next exciting phase of life.<br />SoulFood Reading: 2 Sam 22:31-24:25, John 4:13-26, Ps 32, Pr 23:29-35]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Tutti frutti (1)<br />'...Be fruitful...' Genesis 1:28 NKJ<br />So what was the first thing God said to Adam? 'Keep your head down and get on with it', 'Stay away from that new girl Eve' or was it, 'Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it'? (You'll find your answer in Genesis 1:28.)<br />When God first shaped a pile of bones, blood and flesh into the likes of you and me, He took great care in filling us up with a double dose of potential. God made us as an expression of Himself which means we're loaded with God-given ability. So, when God says, 'Be fruitful,' He's talking about more than us just clinging to our own insignificant little agenda. He's saying, 'I believe in you.' He's saying we can be creative in how we look after His world.<br />Jesus stays on the same theme: 'I chose you...that you should...bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain...' (John 15:16 NKJ) In other words, Jesus gives us the go-ahead to make something out of our lives that expresses our image of God. Jesus also said, 'Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit He takes away...' (John 15:2 NKJ) Now He's not saying 'It's my way or the highway' here. No, He's saying that when part of you is off-track, God comes in to get you back on track with His pruning and cleaning.<br />SoulFood Reading: 2 Sam 20:1-22:30, John 4:1-12, Ps 100, Pr 23:22-28]]></introtext>

John 10:10 NLT<br />Jesus didn't come to this Earth so that you would get good grades or get into the university you want to or get you a good job. Jesus came so that you '...may have life, and have it to the full.' (John 10:10 NIV) Though getting good grades or landing that dream job are not bad things in themselves, getting bogged down with the worrying about them can be.<br />If we're not careful, we can be so wrapped up in 'doing tomorrow' that we miss out on living today. Isn't that what Jesus meant when He said, 'Can all your worries add a single moment to your life?' (Matthew 6:27 NLT) Instead of adding more time or giving you a better life, worry bleeds your happiness and sucks your health dry.<br />So, how about taking the time to detox your worry-life and reinvigorate your God given-life. Why not go for a walk without a reason? Turn off the iPod, put on your walking boots and go enjoy creation. Why not read for the fun of it and not for the exam at the end of it? Or why not paint a mural or join a band or...whatever it is that will start you treating life as a want-to-do-list rather than a have-to-do-list.<br />SoulFood Reading: 2 Sam 17:14-19:43, John 3:22-36, Ps 89:38-52, Pr 23:19-21]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Our God reigns<br />'In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord seated on a throne...' Isaiah 6:1 NIV<br />In the good old days, before a pile of bricks and a pickled shark passed for art, artists had an uncanny knack for recreating real life onto their canvases. No canvas has quite captured life with such accuracy as the Bible, however. Matthew 24 paints this: 'Nations and kingdoms will go to war against each other. People will starve to death, and in some places there will be earthquakes.' (Matthew 24:7 CEV)<br />Well, pickle my paintbrush, Jesus is spot on with His pictures of the future, isn't He?! Almost two millennia after Jesus' predictions, nation did fight nation in two world wars. Famines hit our headlines as we speak. Earthquakes and tsunamis seem to be occurring far too frequently. What does all this mean? Should we be marching around with a sandwich board strapped to our t-shirts saying, 'The end of the world is nigh'?<br />Well, just before you dig up your backyard to build an Armageddon hide-away, know that you're in good company wondering about the state of the world. Isaiah too lived in troubled times when he wrote, 'In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord seated on a throne, high and exalted...' (Isaiah 6:1 NIV)<br />Isaiah didn't see a twitchy God biting His nails worrying about what was happening. He saw a God that reigned. Guess what? God still reigns.<br />SoulFood Reading: 2 Sam 14:21-17:13, John 3:1-21, Ps 89:15-37, Pr 23:15-18]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Easy street<br />'We must go through many hardships to enter the Kingdom of God.' Acts 14:22 NIV<br />'And verily,' Jesus said unto them, 'whoever prays the prayer of commitment shall be well sorted. No troubles, no hassles, no nothing. Hey, I may even throw in the winning lottery numbers for anyone willing to take up their cross and follow Me.'<br />If you can find that verse anywhere in your Bible; your church is probably the type awaiting a giant UFO to descend and take you off to the promised land of Zogg.<br />Actually Jesus promised the opposite. 'In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.' (John 16:33 NIV) When Jesus explained the cost of following Him, some of His disciples walked away. Yet the impact of those who didn't is still felt in the world today. By the time they wrote their epistles, His apostles had learned to see every test in life as a chance to strengthen their faith and multiply their effectiveness.<br />Tests of faith are opportunities to surrender something of value to God. In a test of faith you'll feel assaulted and stretched by circumstances, yet not distant from God. You'll feel tried by them, but not judged or guilty. The Psalmist writes, 'For You, O God, tested us; You refined us like silver...You brought us to a place of abundance.' (Psalm 66:10-12 NIV) A test of faith doesn't really test anything unless it pushes you beyond your last test.<br />SoulFood Reading: 2 Sam 12:1-14:20, John 2:12-25, Ps 89:1-14, Pr 23:10-14]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Lift them!<br />'...Jesus stooped down...' John 8:6 NKJ<br />There's a story in John 8 of a woman caught red-handed in an extra-marital affair. The story isn't used to highlight the woman's relationship CV though; it's told to highlight our reactions to others' failings. In the red corner, we have the Pharisees, foaming at the mouth, veins pulsing in their necks, ready to lift an enormous collection of rockery in her direction. In the blue corner, we have Jesus ready to lift her up, full stop. Before we catch ourselves crying 'yeah' for Jesus and 'boo' for the baddies, we need to stop and recognise ourselves in the story.<br />Like, imagine your best mate has just cheated on her boyfriend and he's dumped her. Everyone at school is calling her... well, you fill in the blank. What do you do? (a) tell her she's only got herself to blame (b) tell her cheer up, plenty more fish in the sea (c) warn her she'd better keep away from your boyfriend.<br />If you did any of the above, you've just picked up a rock and thrown it in her face. We all have the power to build up or break down. Whose corner are you in? Jesus or the Pharisees?<br />SoulFood Reading: 2 Sam 7:18-11:27, John 2:1-11, Ps 110, Pr 23:6-9]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>Faithful friend (5)<br />'As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another.' Proverbs 27:17 NIV<br />What type of friend are you?<br />(1) The Control Freak. CFs go through their friends' diaries with a highlighter pen. If anyone dares make an appointment without their permission, it's nuclear war. (2) The Door Mat. DMs apologise for breathing too forcefully. Their idea of conflict involves beginning a sentence at the same time as another friend. (3) The Drama Queen. DQs demand airtime, every little episode in their lives is a full-on world catastrophe. Emergency meetings at Parliament House are called over the breaking of a fingernail or a newfound spilt-end. (4) The Two-Face. TFs offer a shoulder to cry on for a close mate whilst offering a sarcastic, spot-on impression of said mate to the rest of the friendship group. (5) The Emotional Rollercoaster. An afternoon in a morgue is like Disneyworld compared to one ten minute phone call with the rollercoaster. Better stock up on the Kleenex if ER is coming round for tea.<br />Did you recognise yourself or are you more like the Faithful Friend? FFs love their friends as much as they love themselves. You can count on an FF to listen without judging. FFs know that, 'Perfume and incense bring joy to your heart. And a friend is sweeter when he gives you honest advice.' (Proverbs 27:9 NIV)<br />SoulFood Reading: Ezek 37:1-14, Matt 27:50-53, 1 Thess 4:13-18 (Resurrection power)</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Faithful friend (4)<br />'...though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor...' 2 Corinthians 8:9 NLT<br />It's official; your best friends must have 'Philistine' stamped on their passport. For days you've been hinting about becoming a Christian. You've tried humming Light of the World in their faces; you've even planted copies of word4U2day in their lunchboxes. And yet no joy. You know, if it continues like this, you might just have to show them God's love yourself.<br />Now there's an idea: your life being a light to point your friends to Jesus. '...in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.' (Matthew 7:12 NIV) When we behave like this, our thoughts and actions shift away from ourselves (which is self-centred) and shift towards others (which expresses love and concern).<br />But wait a minute-this is going to cost, right? Giving always costs. Whether you're giving time, a shoulder to cry on, or a sum of cash, it always costs. Yep, love and compassion cost us, but that's Jesus' way. Out of love and compassion for you Jesus gave up His heavenly high position to come to earth. Are you willing to give little bit of yourself out of love and compassion?<br />SoulFood Reading: 2 Sam 3:22-7:17, John 1:43-51, Ps 23, Pr 23:4-5]]></introtext>

Add a jewel-encrusted WWJD bracelet. Attach bicycle clips to their socks. Drape a rainbow-strapped acoustic guitar over one shoulder. Spray a dose of camel breath liberally around the mouth. Now you've given them the chic retro Christian makeover, they'll be good enough for your Sunday pews, right?<br />Ok, so you'd never go to these extremes, but it's funny sometimes how we imagine our mates would have to have a serious attitude makeover before God could accept them. Wrong. 'God demonstrates His own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us... when we were God's enemies, we were reconciled to Him through the death of His Son...' (Romans 5:8-10 NIV)<br />God would still love you even if you'd never bothered with him. Equally, He'd still love your mates. Your job isn't to point out where your mates are going wrong. That's the Holy Spirit's job. Your only job is to love your mates, no strings attached. And you know how love works-what's that famous verse? 'Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous or boastful or proud or rude...' (1 Corinthians 13:4 NLT) If you put to use some of those qualities, your mates will be attracted to the God who gave you a spiritual makeover.<br />SoulFood Reading: 2 Sam 1:1-3:21, John 1:29-42, Ps 131, Pr 23:1-3]]></introtext>

You try and have a kind word for everyone. People should be queuing up to add you as a friend on Facebook, right? And yet no-one seems to be digging your new found niceness. In fact, they call you 'God Squad' and other assorted names from the book of unoriginal Bible-bashing clichés. You'd go as far as to say, they've got it in for you. What's the deal here?<br />'...everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted. ' (2 Timothy 3:12 NIV) What?! The more you try and do the right thing by God, the more you're going to land yourself in hot water? 'If you were of the world, the world would love its own. Yet because you are not of the world...the world hates you...If they persecuted Me, they will also persecute you...all these things they will do to you for My name's sake, because they do not know Him who sent Me.' (John 15:19-21 NKJ)<br />Don't take it personally. It's not about you, it's about Jesus. People get uncomfortable around truth and goodness. When people start on you it's because you're close to God's truth. That's why it's important to 'pray for those who persecute you' (Matt 5:44 NLT) because they're closer to God's truth than they think.<br />SoulFood Reading: Eph 4:17-6:24, John 1:14-28, Ps 29, Pr 22:26-29]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Faithful friend (1)<br />'Don't copy the behaviour and customs of this world...' Romans 12:2 NLT<br />How do your morals compare with those of your friends? When everyone's supermarket grazing (eating in the aisles with no intention of paying at the check-out), do you go along? When everyone's passing on the juicy lowdown about what happened at the year 12 camp, are you part of the crowd? When everyone's being creative with the truth to get out of trouble, are you backing them up?<br />You're supposed to be standing up for God by standing out from the crowd, aren't you? 'Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!' (2 Corinthians 5:17 NIV) Being the 'Bible Basher' in your crowd is going to be a challenge and an opportunity, especially when you feel all by yourself.<br />The challenge comes when your faith and your friends aren't mixing. When the school clown is in joke heaven making wise cracks at the expense of the school geek, the temptation is to laugh along. However your faith reminds you, 'Whatever you do or say, do it as a representative of the Lord Jesus.' (Colossians 3:17 NLT) Would Jesus be making bodily function jokes? Nope.<br />The opportunity comes in how you handle the situation. If you become known for being a fun person but without laughing at the expense of others, people will notice there's something different about you. How will you gain respect with your mates? By respecting God and respecting others.<br />SoulFood Reading: Eph 1:1-4:16, John 1:1-13, Ps 92, Pr 22:24-25]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Apply yourself gently<br />'God blesses those who are humble [gentle]...' Matthew 5:5 NLT<br />It takes an extra-special kind of person to be gentle. But where does 'being gentle' fit on the scale of wimp to bully? Nowhere! True heroes are measured on a different dimension-they don't have to show their power by beating people up (yes there are even Christian bullies!) and they don't have to cower either because Jesus tells them that they are the ultimate winners.<br />He said, 'Blessed are the meek [gentle], for they shall inherit the earth.' (Matthew 5:5 KJV) Notice, the gentle don't strive, manipulate or compete like others, yet they inherit everything. When you 'inherit' something you don't have to strive for it, you receive it because you're loved, valued, and part of the family.<br />Gentleness is part of the love family. It doesn't preach 'win at all costs'. It doesn't elbow its way to the top. It doesn't parade itself like a carnival float through town screaming, 'Look at me! Look at me!' It does what it says on the tin-applies itself gently. If you look before wading in with your boots, you're applying yourself gently. If you listen before spouting off, 'What you should do is ...', you're applying yourself gently. If you encourage rather than point out failure, you apply yourself gently. Apply yourself gently: in this tough old world, it's a reminder of how God is gentle with us.<br />SoulFood Reading: 1 Sam 27-31, Luke 24:45-53, Ps 63, Pr 22:17-23]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Hungry heart<br />'...the world offers...a craving for everything we see...' 1 John 2:16 NLT<br />'Mum knows best.' So what if your insides are rattling and you could eat a whole horse complete with cart? Mum still knows best. Half a block of chocolate is not going to satisfy that hunger in the same way as a healthy, nutritious dinner. In fact, when we pig out on 'treat foods' that aren't good for us, we're left feeling cheap, sick and curiously unfulfilled not long after.<br />If that's true of physical hunger, what of spiritual hunger? If we're filling up our God 'hunger spot' with junk, we'll also be left feeling cheap, sick and unfulfilled. It's possible to excel in school, church, sports, music and still be left feeling unfulfilled. It's common for people to desperately crave intimacy but end up being taken advantage of, and feeling cheap. It's likely that some of the number one mirror-gazers, those we think have got it all together, are actually sick to the stomach of how they look.<br />You see, all of us looking for something that will truly satisfy. Fame, money, approval and romance still leave us empty. They're like chocolate before dinner. Jesus says He's 'the Bread of Life'. If you're hungry right now fill that emptiness with the Bread of Life. Only God can fill that 'God hole' in your appetite.<br />SoulFood Reading: 1 Sam 24-26, Luke 24:36-44, Ps 51, Pr 22:12-16]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[It's the Message, Not the Messenger<br />'Anyone who welcomes My messenger is welcoming Me...' John 13:20 NLT<br />Today's word is dead simple: focus on the message, not the messenger! 'But shouldn't leaders set a good example; shouldn't they be called to a higher standard?' Yes, those trusted with great responsibility experience greater discipline. But God does that; not you. The Bible gives an extreme example: King Saul repeatedly tried to kill David, yet David realised that God had chosen Saul. Yes, King Saul had blown it, and God's new plan was in motion, but David didn't have the right to press fast-forward on that plan! This may come as a shock: God has no perfect messengers (we're not counting angels here)! He uses ordinary people who have made themselves available to Him. And many of them are still struggling in certain areas. They're being developed even while they're delivering the message God wants you to hear.<br />A perfect word from imperfect lips-that's how God does it. The great prophet Samuel led Israel for 40 years. He even anointed David to be king. Yet Sam's own sons went astray. David, who God called a man after His own heart, lost the plot for a while and got himself into a shady love triangle that ended up getting a guy killed. Yet the Bible says, he '...served God's purpose in his own generation...' (Acts 13:36 NIV) And remember, Peter's dark hour of denial didn't prevent him from winning thousands to Christ. So, when you see your leader's imperfections what should you do? (a) learn from their mistakes (b) pray for them. After all, if you can't find mercy in the house of God, where are you going to find it? (c) keep listening to their message. Jesus said, '...anyone who welcomes My messenger is welcoming Me...' (John 13:20 NLT)<br />SoulFood Reading: Gen 1:1-2:3, John 1:1-18 (In the Beginning)]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Be determined<br />'...we must be determined to run the race that is ahead of us.' Hebrews 12:1 CEV<br />Moving forward in your Christian life means being sensitive to His voice. God's voice isn't like a hammer pounding on your head; it's more like a gentle tap on your heart. When you know you've heard from God, be determined not to let it go. Things worth having never come easy. If you find your grip on that promise weakening, remind yourself that God has given you the grace to succeed at whatever He's called you to do! The worst thing you can do is ignore His taps, disobey them, argue with them or even try to put them off until tomorrow. The word 'determined' can be a real turn-off for some people. It's a 'hard work' word. It doesn't sit well alongside 'comfy' and 'easy'. You can't claim any ownership of the word 'determined' if you can't turn off your television and spend a few minutes with God every day. Start out by obeying God in little things: it's the key to developing a determined attitude and lifestyle. For example, when He taps you to shut your mouth but you keep on talking-that's when you get into trouble, right? Check this out-long long ago God made a promise to Israel: 'If you listen to these commands of the Lord your God...and...carefully obey them, the Lord will make you the head and not the tail, and you will always have the upper hand...' (Deuteronomy 28:13 NLT) You can claim that promise for yourself today if you will put your faith in Him and be determined about doing what He says.<br />SoulFood Reading: 1 Sam 20:30-23:29, Luke 24:25-35, Ps 60, Pr 22:7-11]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[The future's bright; the future is you<br />'...If God has given you leadership ability...' Romans 12:8 NLT<br />Skip through your mum's iPod tracks and, chances are, it won't be long before you come across a cheese-tastic tearjerker with the opening line, 'I believe the children are the future...' Now before you sue your mum for polluting your airwaves, just sit on that thought a minute; you are the future.<br />God has an amazing future mapped out for you. (Jeremiah 29:11) You could be this country's future prime minister. You could be the future's most-sung songwriter. You could be a future Nobel peace prize winner. You are called to excel and lead for a better future. Check out these famous God-chasers for your inspiration in how to lead and excel:<br />(1) Moses. The Bible says that God spoke to Moses 'as a man speaks with his friend'. If you want to lead big-time, you need to talk with your friend God. Prayer makes famous leaders.<br />(2) David (AKA a man 'after God's own heart'). David messed up in king-size ways at times, but his heartbeat was to worship, repent and obey. God's heartbeat makes famous leaders.<br />(3) Daniel. This awesome guy left even the angels awestruck! They greeted him as one who was 'highly esteemed'. Daniel had a strong character that wouldn't back down in the face of hungry lions. Strong character makes famous leaders.<br />So start improving on your 1-2-1s with God. Get in time with his heartbeat. Fine-tune your character. The future's yours-let God shape it.<br />SoulFood Reading: 1 Sam 14-15, Luke 23:44-56, Ps 91, Pr 21:28-31]]></introtext>

Are you sure you haven't? What about that exam you'd been praying about-when you got your grades did you big yourself up? Or God? When you'd been arguing with your mates and loads of people were praying that it'd get sorted, did you think it was all because of you that you were back as buddies again? Or did you give God the glory?<br />Giving the credit where it's due doesn't make you worth any less, it just puts the focus on the source of your worth: almighty God. 'It is God who makes us able to do all that we do.' Yeah, there are times when you do things in your own strength, and you can take all the credit you like then. But when you have to rely on God (and that's what He wants you to do, by the way-in everything, not just the big things), you need to make sure you give Him the credit He's due.<br />God wants to minimise you alone, and maximise Christ in you. Your life should be a team effort, not a solo. If you're not getting the picture, God will take the initiative, and make it so you have to depend on Him. Don't let it get that far; start giving God the credit He deserves now, and don't try to go it alone.<br />SoulFood Reading: 1 Sam 11-13, Luke 23:35-43, Ps 13, Pr 21:22-27]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Alone with God<br />'...the Lord...is a jealous God.' Exodus 34:14 NKJ<br />Did you know that God gets jealous? Not in a green-eyed monster kind of way, but of anything that takes His place in your life-especially the lie that convinces you your happiness depends on another person. When you look to somebody other than God for all the things He gladly provides like security, purpose, self-worth and contentment, He's jealous. So don't do it!<br />Being alone with God can be amazing. Yes, it's hard if all your mates are paired up and gazing lovingly in each other's eyes. But actually, being single has its bonuses too. Maybe you're not hooked up right now because God really wants to talk to you. Maybe He doesn't want you distracted. Maybe God wants you to get intimate with Him, to trust Him, to tell Him your secrets, and let Him be there for you. Joshua was alone when God gave him the plan for conquering Jericho. John was alone on an island when Heaven opened and he wrote the book of Revelation.<br />When you're not sure who you are in God, it's easy to get swept away in the lives of other people. It's tempting to try to find your value and fulfilment there. But what happens if that relationship breaks down? God is the only one who will never let you go. With God as your Rock, you can enjoy being you. So let Him tell you who you are. He knows you better than anyone.<br />SoulFood Reading: Gen 24:1-51, 2 Cor 6:14-7:1 (Marry within the Faith)]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Let Him lead you<br />'The Lord will guide you always...' Isaiah 58:11 NIV<br />If you were playing a new game on a PS3, DS or Wii, who would you want to show you how it was done? Who would you want to lead you through, to show you the ropes? Would you want someone who's never played it before? Someone who's played it, got stuck halfway and always gives up? Or the guy who designed the game?<br />If you've got any sense, you'd choose the guy who designed it. After all, he'll know the shortcuts and cheat codes. He'll know what's coming and can warn you if there's a tough bit. He'll advise on how to get through it to the end, so you can win. So why is life any different? Why would you choose anyone other than God to lead you through, to guide you? He's the creator, the designer. He knows what's coming and what you need to get through life. He's there to help you in the tough bits, and get you back on track if you take a wrong turn.<br />No-one else has lived your life, so they can't know where it's going. Only the designer knows that. If you let someone else guide you, you'll just get lost. So why don't you follow God's lead, let Him guide you through the obstacles of life? You'll find that you won't keep on 'dying at the end of level one' and having to start again, but you'll quickly get back on the right track.<br />SoulFood Reading: 1 Sam 4-7, Luke 23:13-25, Ps 52, Pr 21:17]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[He lives where?<br />'It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.' Galatians 2:20 NKJ<br />Bet you didn't realise your body was a house, did you? No, we're not talking three bedrooms, bathroom, lounge-diner, kitchen and a backyard! We're talking about a house for Jesus. Did you know that He lives in you? When you give your life to God, He gives you Jesus to help guide you as part of the deal, and Jesus lives in you.<br />Now, it's not like He takes you over in a weird sort of mind-body-soul invasion like you see in some science fiction. In fact it isn't an alien thing at all, God designed us to have Christ live in us!<br />When Jesus is 'in' you, it means He's become part of the core of your being, He wants to be a part of every decision you make, and He's there for good. Nothing will get rid of Him, and He's there to help you-not hinder you. Think of Him a bit like a best friend, always there to talk to and ask advice from! Or like a compass there to give you the best directions. But whatever you do-don't ignore Him. He's there to help, so make the most of it.<br />SoulFood Reading: 1 Sam 1-3, Luke 23:1-12, Ps 34, Pr 21:14-16]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[The ultimate trophy (2)<br />'...what is our...crown in which we will glory...?' 1 Thessalonians 2:19 NIV<br />A trophy is a prize that impresses people enough to say, 'Wow! You're amazing!' Solomon said '...riches do not endure...a crown is not secure for all generations.' (Proverbs 27:24 NIV) When we try to impress people we think are important, we're trophy-collecting.<br />It's so easy to get it wrong, to think you know what the best trophies are. What about knowing all the words to the songs-that'll impress people, right? Or having the most friends on Facebook-then I've made it, ok? Or if my Bible is really battered and ripped, that shows I read it loads, and everyone will be amazed. Being the youth leader's favourite, that's gotta be worth something, right? Or hang on, what about learning Bible verses and spouting them out in every sentence I breathe? No, wait, I've got it! Having the most PUSH or FROG or WWJD bands-that would impress people, surely?<br />Well, there's nothing especially wrong with any of those things in themselves, but they're not the trophy Paul tells us to focus on. He was collecting a different kind of 'crown'. As he told the Thessalonians: '...what is our...crown in which we will glory in the presence of our Lord...Is it not you?'<br />Paul's crown or trophy wasn't anything to do with his own personal achievement. Instead it was the people he witnessed to, and discipled.<br />SoulFood Reading: Lev 23: 33-44, Jn 7:1-40, Zech 14:16-21, Heb 11:8-16 (Tabernacles)]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[The ultimate trophy (1)<br />'...Enoch...had this testimony, that he pleased God.' Hebrews 11:5 NKJ<br />What's your aim in life? Do you want to be famous? Have lots of money? Own a big house?<br />What trophy are you trying to get? And is that all that matters to you? Jesus talks a lot about rewards. But going after the trophy every time can hurt us if we want it for the wrong reasons. Striving to achieve just so you can show off, put another medal in your cabinet or get admiring glances, is the wrong reason. The medal or trophy isn't the be-all and end-all. It's just a symbol of achievement.<br />What about the process that got you there-all the training and practice? Isn't that as important, if not more, than the final result? If you feel like you'll only succeed if you're 'the best', then you're missing out on so much. In Revelation 4:10-11 NIV we see 24 leaders '...lay their crowns before the throne and say: &quot;You are worthy, our Lord and God ...''' They got it that the crown wasn't what it was all about. Yes, it's great that they got a crown but, more importantly, they gave the glory to God. Another example is Enoch. In Hebrews 11, we read that he was known for pleasing God. Not for having medals or coming first in a race, but simply for pleasing God. That's the trophy we should be aiming for in life.<br />SoulFood Reading: Song of Sol 5-8, Luke 22:63-71, Ps 39, Pr 21:9-13]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Is God a spoilsport?<br />'You treat us with kindness and with honour, never denying any good thing to those who live right.' Psalm 84:11 CEV<br />'Wait'. 'Not yet'. 'Later'. Three things a child hates hearing. But are they always said just because mum and dad feel like being spoilsports? Is waiting sometimes a good thing?<br />What if the kid's rushing to cross a busy road when mum says 'wait' because she's seen a car? Or when dad says 'later' to an ice-cream, coz he knows how much the kid's already eaten, and he doesn't want them throwing up all over themselves. Surely in those cases, waiting is a good thing-and by following the advice to wait, children learn patience, and some other key life survival tips too.<br />Can the same be said for God when He asks us to wait? Of course. There are great benefits to waiting. For example, if you learn to wait and observe others in similar situations, you'll make better choices. That thing you think you can't live without today, you may be glad to live without tomorrow: '...never denying any good thing to those who live right.' So when God says, 'Wait,' trust Him. Either it's not what you need right now, or He has something better sorted for you.<br />You say, 'But what am I going to do in the meantime?' The Bible says, 'Wait on the Lord...and He shall strengthen your heart...' (Psalm 27:14 NKJ) So stop pushing, and let God do it in His time-you'll be better off.<br />SoulFood Reading: Song of Sol 1-4, Luke 22:54-62, Ps 3, Pr 21:4-8]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Fighting and praying are a bad combo<br />'...that your prayers may not be hindered.' 1 Peter 3:7 NKJ<br />When you're on a footy team, you and your teammates want the same thing-to win! If you spend all your time fighting and arguing instead of training, do you think you'll win as much as you could? As if!<br />When you want something, you need to work together to get it, not against each other. The same goes for prayer. If you want to see prayers answered, then the right place to be is without '... anger or disputing.' (1 Timothy 2:8 NIV) When you fight or argue, do you always win? No. James says that sometimes the sole reason for that is because you should have been praying, not fighting. 'What is causing the quarrels and fights among you?...You want what you don't have, so you scheme and kill to get it. You are jealous of what others have...so you fight and wage war to take it away from them. Yet you don't have what you want because you don't ask God for it. And even when you ask, you don't get it because your motives are all wrong...' (James 4:1-3 NLT) Another reason for unsuccessful prayer is selfishness. Are you asking for something that will benefit you but hold others back? Chances are, it won't work!<br />So whatever you're praying for, make sure you're not having a barney with your mum or your mate at the same time-praying and fighting don't mix.<br />SoulFood Reading: 2 Cor 11:16-13:14, Luke 22:39-53, Ps 19, Pr 21:3]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Keep hope alive<br />'...these three remain: faith, hope and love...' 1 Corinthians 13:13 NIV<br />In 1914, Sir Ernest Shackleton attempted the first land crossing of Antarctica. But his ship, the Endurance, got stuck in ice and was crushed. All 28 crew were stranded 1900 km from civilisation, drifting on ice with just three rickety lifeboats, a few tents and limited supplies. Eventually they reached a small island and waited while Shackleton and a few men took one of the lifeboats 1300 km over stormy seas to a whaling station. He returned with a rescue ship, and every man survived the 18-month ordeal.<br />How did he keep everybody's hopes alive? First, optimism. Shackleton always believed that he and his crew would survive, and he spread that optimism to everyone around him. Second, he nurtured their sense of significance. He kept everyone involved by seeking their opinions and giving them tasks that made them feel part of the solution. Third, he encouraged them. He used humour and promoted a light-hearted atmosphere, recognising that under extreme pressure, the ability to lighten the mood neutralises fear and helps people to focus and re-energise.<br />One of the few items Shackleton rescued from the sinking ship was a banjo! Why? So the group could have music. Shackleton was a prime example of how one person can keep hope alive. If you know someone who's in the middle of a difficult time, your words of kindness and love, your confidence in them and your ability to lighten their load can keep hope alive.<br />SoulFood Reading: Gen 2:7-25, 1 Cor 15:39-55 (Adam/Jesus)]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Don't devour, delight<br />'...a foolish man devours all he has.' Proverbs 21:20 NIV<br />God has given us an amazing world to live in, and we're doing a pretty good job of devouring it, which means destroying it completely. We shouldn't be devouring what God has given us, but instead delighting in it and looking after it. Do you think God wants His creation destroyed? No! So what can you do about it?<br />There are problems with polluted rivers and seas full of chemicals, chopped-down forests, extinction of rare animals for sport and fur, melting ice caps with global warming, the poor getting poorer and the rich richer with unfair trade...the list goes on. What a depressing list-it's easy to feel helpless, like you could never make a difference. Do you just decide not to bother?<br />Stop and think-could you make a difference to some of these things? Here are a few hints of how you can change things: (a) recycle; don't chuck your drink cans in the bin, but collect and recycle them (b) buy fair-trade chocolate; some major brands are now fair-trade, so there's no excuse! You can make sure that people in the Third World get a good deal for their crops (c) cycle, walk or use public transport; instead of getting a lift those short distances coz you're feeling lazy or want five minutes more in bed!<br />Three really simple things you can do to make a difference-but don't stop there. Keep on thinking.<br />SoulFood Reading: Lev 16, Lev 23:26-32, Heb 9:1-14, Heb 13:11-16]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[God and your money (2)<br />'Honour the Lord with your possessions...' Proverbs 3:9 NKJ<br />Another thing that can be helpful when you're thinking about money is to remember that:<br />(1) God owns everything. You may get given pocket money by your parents or a wage from your employer, but actually the Bible tells us that '...all things come from You, and out of Your own [hand] we have given You.' (1 Chronicles 29:14 AMP) That means that your money comes from God-so if He does ask you to do something with it, it's best to be obedient. There's a bonus if you are, too: '...you will eat the best from the land.' (Isaiah 1:19 NIV) Sounds like a good deal-you do what God asks, and He blesses you-rock on!<br />(2) God gives you what you have. So not only is your money God's, but He's the One who gives you everything you need. It's a bit confusing, isn't it? Especially if you've seen Dad get the money out of his wallet or you've unwrapped an iPod from your aunty! But whatever you've got-it's a present from God. 'Every good gift...is from above, and comes down from the Father...' (James 1:17 NKJ)<br />(3) Every time you spend, it's a spiritual decision. Remembering points (1) and (2), it makes sense really, doesn't it? You're never too young to start thanking God for what He's given you, and asking Him what He wants you to do with it.<br />SoulFood Reading: 2 Cor 9:1-11:15, Luke 22:24-38, Ps 24, Pr 21:1-2]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[God and your money (1)<br />'... where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.' Matthew 6:21 NIV<br />Now, you may not have a lot of money but you've probably got plans for what you do have. So how do you intend to spend it? Write a list now.<br />Done it? Ok-how much of what you spent was on yourself, and how much was on other people? Do you ever ask God what you should do with your money? If you don't, then maybe now is a good time to start. God loves generosity. That doesn't mean you have to give everything you have away-but just think about how you could use your money better. God won't measure you by how much you give (that wouldn't really be very fair, would it, as some people have so much more than others), but by what you have, and what you keep. So, bearing all that in mind-where should your treasure be?<br />Jesus says, 'Store up for yourselves treasures in heaven...' (Matthew 6:20 NIV) So maybe it's a good idea to give a bit of money towards the work that Christians do for God, to build up His Kingdom in the world-there are loads of great charities out there. Your church could give you some ideas too.<br />There's nothing attractive about selfishness. There's a saying that you can tell what's important to someone by looking at how they spend their money. What would that say about you?<br />SoulFood Reading: 2 Cor 5-8, Luke 22:14-23, Ps 78:65-72, Pr 20:26-30]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Balancing act<br />'...I have set my face like flint...' Isaiah 50:7 NKJ<br />Have you got one of those 'needy' friends? You know the sort-they only call when they want something. They never ask how you're doing (or if they do, within three seconds they're back talking about themselves again). They have no clue what's going on in your life. They ask you for advice, then do the opposite-but still come to you when it all goes pear-shaped. You're the first person they come to with any problem at all-and they expect you to be able to sort it and always be on 'their side'.<br />Maybe it's time to look at that friendship a bit more deeply. Ask if you can really sustain it without putting yourself, or them, at risk. Are they looking to you, instead of God, to meet their needs? If they are, they'll end up disappointed, and you'll end up exhausted. No matter how hard you try, you're not God, so you won't always know the right answer.<br />Isaiah wrote, 'I have set my face like a flint, and I know I will not be ashamed.' He was talking about not letting people take all your time and energy or stand in the way of what God's called you to do. Your first priority always needs to be God-then others. Have you got the balance right of serving God and serving your friends-or has something got to give?<br />SoulFood Reading: 2 Cor 1-4, Luke 22:1-13, Ps 78:56-64, Pr 20:25]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Huge hands<br />'Give your burdens to the Lord, and He will take care of you.' Psalm 55:22 NLT<br />God's got big hands, and He really wants you to use them! When you've got something eating away at you that feels like it's taking over your brain, all He wants is for you to give it to Him. If you're really bothered about something, and think only you can sort it out-put it in His hands. He's even more bothered by it, and even more capable of sorting it. If you're feeling like it's too small to bother God with, but it's making you worry-there's space in His hands for it.<br />No matter how big or small, whether you're responsible for it or not, He can take care of it. If it feels out of control, keeps you awake at night or takes away your joy, you're instructed to 'Cast all your anxiety on Him because He cares for you.' (1 Peter 5:7 NIV) Put it all in His hands, and then let go of it. Stop worrying about it. Pray about it instead.<br />The Bible says, 'Don't worry about anything; instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need, and thank Him for all He has done. Then you will experience God's peace...'

<introtext><![CDATA[Friend or fake? (3)<br />'A man who has friends must himself be friendly...' Proverbs 18:24 NKJ<br />No matter how good a friend you are, even if you master trust completely, not every friendship you have will last forever. The other person may have issues (reasonable or not), or maybe for purely practical reasons (like they're moving to the South Pole and won't be contactable other than by penguin-post), you'll eventually lose some friends. When the relationship is over, you'll go one way and they'll go another-and you can choose whether you deal with that in a positive or negative way.<br />If a friendship does go bad for whatever reason, one good thing to do is take some responsibility for it. Make the first move in saying 'sorry' and trying to sort it out. That'll set a great example and result in less bitterness. It will also show your other friends that you can be mature when things go wrong. It means you're more likely to be remembered as a good friend too, and the happy memories and fun times won't go away with the friend.<br />Another top tip is to ask your friends (and you have to be brave to do this one!) how they think you could be a better friend-it's always good to have goals and to want to grow. Be willing to listen to what they say, and act on it, so you can be a valued and trusted friend who people won't want to lose.<br />SoulFood Reading: Ezek 43-45, Luke 21:12-24, Ps 78:32-39, Pr 20:20-21]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Friend or fake? (2)<br />'A man who has friends must himself be friendly...' Proverbs 18:24 NKJ<br />Trust is a massive issue in friendships. How awful when you tell a friend something secret, and next thing people are sniggering behind your back because your mate 'just let it slip, sorry.' Or what about when a mate says they'll meet you in town, then leave you standing around for an hour because they 'made other plans and forgot, sorry.' Or when you ask you best bud round to play on the Xbox, and he says he can't coz he's got to help his mum-but then your sister sees him in town, and he says he 'got his days mixed up-and didn't think you'd want to go anyway.'<br />When people are like that, you stop trusting them, and the friendship won't be the same again. So watch it if you're thinking about lying to a mate, or saying one thing and doing another. You might think it's just a little fib-but friendships are built on trust, not fibs.<br />Trust is like a mirror-when it's shattered it can be pieced back together again, but the cracks usually show. You may well cut yourself and end up hurt when you're gluing it back together. The reflection is never quite the same either-it's distorted and imperfect. So place value on your friends, trust them, and make sure they can trust you.<br />SoulFood Reading: Jonah 1:10-2:10, Matt 12:38-42 (Jonah)]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Friend or fake? (1)<br />'A man who has friends must himself be friendly...' Proverbs 18:24 NKJ<br />Are your friends falling like flies? Your best buddies heading away from you? There'll be a reason for it if they are. If you're not letting your mates know that you value them, they may just get fed up, and wander off to find someone else.<br />Have you ever had someone make friends with you, and you hang out together for a few weeks-until you've helped them complete that maths project, or they've finished all the levels on your new game, or they've got an invite to the party your brother's throwing-then suddenly, they're not interested in you? You feel used, don't you? And if they started to hang out with you again, your first thought would be: 'What do they want this time?'<br />People need to know you're mates with them not just for what you can get out of it. Friendship is a two-way thing, and it works best when you both give and take. It's a bit like a see-saw at the kiddies' playground. It's most fun when both kids put in some effort. If one refuses to push off, the other is left stranded in the sky, or if one jumps off without warning, the other lands with a bump.<br />Think about why you like your mates, and what you give to the friendship. Then go and give your mates your best.<br />SoulFood Reading: Ezek 40:10-42:20, Luke 21:1-11, Ps 78:17-31, Pr 20:15-19]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Take a break from the past<br />'...the people of Gibeon had made a peace treaty...they were living among the people of Israel.' Joshua 10:1 NIV<br />The Gibeonites were a bunch of people most definitely going against God, so God told Joshua to kill them (check out Joshua 9 for the story). They realised soon enough that they were on the wrong side, and were about to get done over-so they disguised themselves, and conned Josh into promising not to kill them by saying they'd be his servants.<br />When Josh found out he'd been tricked, he still stuck to his promise. He didn't kill them-he even fought to protect them. But they did end up as the lowest servants, chopping wood and carrying water for the rest of their lives. We can learn two things from the Gibs:<br />(1) When you choose to follow God, you have to make a break from the past. 'This means that anyone who belongs to Christ has become a new person. The old life is gone; a new life has begun!' (2 Cor 5:17 NLT) For the Gibs, staying as they were would have meant certain death. Being a servant was a better option. For you, it may mean you have to stop hanging around with that old crowd who keep influencing you to do stuff you know you shouldn't be doing. (2) It's ok to ask for help. Don't leave it as long as they did before you admit you're struggling. There's power in asking your Christian mates to help you and pray with you.<br />SoulFood Reading: Ezek 37:1-40:9, Luke 20:41-47, Ps 78:9-16, Pr 20:11-14]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Big issue? Take it to Jesus<br />'...behold, a woman...with an issue...' Matthew 9:20 KJV<br />This woman suffered for 12 years with a physical 'issue of blood' ailment. But we've all got 'issues' of one type or another-whether it's self-esteem ('I'm worthless'), lust ('phwoar, I fancy a bit of that'), jealousy ('I wish that was mine'), anger ('I'm gonna deck him') or something else completely, we've all got something that keeps on rearing its ugly head and reminding us that we don't always get it right. The woman in this story's issue was a physical problem that had been bugging her for 12 years. When she came across Jesus she had three options. She could have thought: (1) 'Nothing's gonna change. Why bother?' (2) 'I've heard good things but, with this many people, Jesus'll never notice me' or (3) 'If I could just touch Him, I'd be sorted.' She chose the third option, hunted out Jesus, touched Him-and miraculously, her issue was gone.<br />We all have issues. So what are you going to do with yours? Keep it to yourself, thinking you can never change? Think that Jesus won't notice it because He's got so many other people to worry about? Or ask Him to help you fight it, believing that He will, so you can come out the other side a better person, having dealt with it and moving on? You know the right answer.<br />SoulFood Reading: Num 29:1-6, Matt 24, Rev 11:15-19, 1Cor 15:50-58, Trumpets]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Story time<br />'Your word is...a light to my path.' Psalm 119:105 NKJ<br />If you were asked what book had changed your life most, what would you say? Most church goers would answer that question with 'The Bible'-but only about one in five of them read it every day. Here are some of the favourite excuses why:<br />(1) 'I've got no time.' Really? Loads of the books in the Bible can be read in under 45 minutes-that's less than most TV episodes! (2) 'I don't know where to start.' Break it into bite-sized chunks, and start with a gospel, looking at the life of Jesus. (3) 'It's boring'. Want to read about a chick hero? Then read Ruth or Esther. An adventure guy? Check out Judges or Acts. Whatever you like, it's there if you look. (4) 'But I go to church-isn't that enough?' In a word-no! (5) 'It makes me uncomfortable.' When you don't know or completely understand what it says, it's easy to assume that it's all negative, but it's not.<br />You'll only start to make sense of the Bible by reading it. You wouldn't expect to get a 'Teach Yourself Japanese' CD and learn the language without listening to it, would you? If you never look at and study the Bible, those five excuses may seem true-but if you make the time to give it a go, the more you read, the more sense it'll make. So get yourself in gear, dust off your Bible and get reading!<br />SoulFood Reading: Ezek 34-36, Luke 20:27-40, Ps 78:1-8, Pr 20:7-10]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Don't walk backwards!<br />'By faith Abraham...went out, not knowing where he was going.' Hebrews 11:8 NKJ<br />When Jennie and Matt got married, they had no idea where they were going for their honeymoon. Matt's sister had offered to organise it for them as a wedding present. They didn't even know how long they'd be away. Did they say, 'No thanks, it's right sis, we'll do it'? Did they insist on knowing all the details beforehand? Did they decide to stay at home instead, because at least then they'd know where they were going? No! Of course they didn't.<br />They followed her instructions about what to pack for the holiday, waited to get the tickets at the wedding reception, and then flew off for an amazing time at an all-inclusive luxury hotel in the Caribbean. It was more than they could have hoped for. They trusted that because she loved them, she'd send them somewhere nice. They trusted that because she knew them, she'd organise somewhere they could enjoy themselves. And she did.<br />How much more does God love and know you? So how much should you trust Him with where He wants to take you? You could stubbornly decide to stay exactly where you are and not move forwards, or even worse go backwards in your faith life, because the future is uncertain. But God has so much more planned for you! So follow old Abe's example, and trust that no matter what happens on the way, God is taking you to a good place.<br />SoulFood Reading: Ezek 31-33, Luke 20:20-26, Ps 27, Pr 20:5-6]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[You don't have to be old to be wise<br />'...I will give you words and wisdom...' Luke 21:15 NIV<br />When you become a Christian, the light doesn't suddenly come on giving you the right words to say in every situation, and wise words for those tough times. A shiny white angel won't suddenly appear with a magic wand, say 'ping!' and suddenly you're some great wise guru who gets everything right, and always knows what to say.<br />But we do find out: 'If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives generously to all...' (James 1:5 NIV) It's a pretty fair bet that most of us do lack wisdom-but there's a simple solution to that problem-ask God for some. There's nothing wrong with admitting that you don't always know what to do-after all, there are so many different opinions surrounding us about pretty much anything.<br />It's easy to stress, panicking because a magazine says one thing, a friend says another and your favourite TV programme says something completely different. Even at church, your pastor says one thing and your youth leader says something else. So many opinions-they can't all be right, can they? That's where wisdom comes in. Ask God for the wisdom to work out right from wrong, and look to the life of Jesus as a perfect example of words being spoken with complete wisdom. Think about what you're saying today, and make sure your words are spoken with wisdom too.<br />SoulFood Reading: Ezek 27:25-30:26, Luke 20:9-19, Ps 112, Pr 20:1-4]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[God's got it right<br />'Love never fails...' 1 Corinthians 13:8 NKJ<br />This is a tough passage to read if you've had a bad experience of 'love'. Maybe someone told you they loved you, then left you all alone and hurting. Maybe someone you loved lied to you, and you still don't understand why. Maybe you've lost someone close to you, and you just don't get it. If that's love, how can it 'never fail'?<br />Well, the first thing to realise is that we humans don't always get it right-but God does. Where we fail in love, He perfects. Where we get it wrong, He succeeds.<br />But then you might think: if God's love is so perfect, why does He let bad stuff happen? Well, if a parent and child are walking along the road next to each other, and the kid trips and gets hurt-did the parent let that happen? Whose fault is it? Does the kid think the parent isn't showing love? No-not when the parent picks the kid up and tries to make it better!<br />The truth about God's perfect love isn't that He never allows bad things to happen to us. What we need to grasp is His promise that when they do, He'll be with us to pick us up, carry us and help us through. His love is perfect, and it never fails. He's always there right next to you, loving you, when you need Him most.<br />SoulFood Reading: Judges 16:23-31, 2 Cor 12:7-10 (Strength in Weakness)]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Living by faith<br />'...all these...gained [God's] approval.' Hebrews 11:39 NAS<br />We read in Hebrews 11 about two types of people-those who escaped the sword, and those who were killed by it. Both groups gained God's approval because of their faith. Ok, so it's easy to make sense of that for those who survived. If you were one of those people God saved from death, you'd probably find it pretty easy to have faith in Him too. But what about those who 'did not receive the things promised; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance.' (Hebrews 11:13 NIV) How did they do it? If you're facing death and it doesn't look like God is going to save you, is it still possible to have faith in Him?<br />On 20 April 1999, two students at a high school in Columbine USA opened fire on their classmates. Witnesses reported that, during the massacre, one stopped and asked a girl, Cassie Bernall, if she believed in God. She replied 'yes' and they asked her why, then shot her dead before she had a chance to answer. For Cassie, the Bible was real, and God was real. She trusted Him and was going to live out her faith no matter what. She knew she'd almost certainly get shot if she said 'yes'-but still she had faith that 'God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God and are called according to His purpose.' (Romans 8:28 NLT) Try to live by faith today, whatever comes your way.<br />SoulFood Reading: Ezek 24:1-27:24, Luke 20:1-8, Ps 20, Pr 19:24-29]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Are you a stream or a pond?<br />'...the Spirit of God moved...' Genesis 1:2 KJV<br />Imagine that human beings are just water. Without God in our lives, we are like a pond. The water is still, and it doesn't lead anywhere. Yes, it has some uses but it can go stagnant easily and end up with manky green algae all over it. Would you want to take a drink from a pond covered in green gunk and goo? Not likely!<br />When we ask God's Spirit into our lives, we become more like a mountain stream. Suddenly there's movement and life in the water. It's going somewhere and has direction. It's permanently refreshed; it goes through different purifying soils and rocks and comes out the other side filtered and clean. Would you drink water from a mountain stream? Well, if ever you buy a bottle of mineral water, that's what you're doing! It pretty much all comes from mountain streams.<br />As well as all that, moving water has power to change things, to help shift things along and even to generate electricity. That's just like you, with God's Spirit in you! You have the power to change things for the better, to help others on their journey as Christians, and to generate goodness. So let God's Spirit move in you today. Be a stream, not a pond!<br />SoulFood Reading: Ezek 22-23, Luke 19:41-48, Ps 142, Pr 19:21-23]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[God's victory<br />'...These two forces are constantly fighting each other...' Galatians 5:17 NLT<br />Did you know your life is a war-zone? We're not talking Afghanistan or Iraq, but the battle going on for your life between God and the devil. And you have the power to help God win. How? Well, in a battle, each side has strongholds-in other words, bits that belong to them. If you can identify where the devil has a stronghold in your life-the things you struggle with, the times you always mess up-you can ask the Holy Spirit to go into those areas and fight alongside you. He will, and God will get the victory there.<br />No war is won overnight-it takes time to identify the strongholds, seek them out, move forward and bit-by-bit claim back the land. Don't get fed up or give up if things don't suddenly get all fine and dandy within minutes of you praying-it may well take a bit of time. Make sure you go to God each day, and ask for His help to fight it out in those tough areas.<br />Remember that no battle is too big for God. Check out the story of David and Goliath. (1 Samuel 17) It was only by asking for God's help that David won when it looked like an already-lost battle. Let God help you. Let Him claim back those areas in your life that He's not ruling over any more. Then you can enjoy living in His victory.<br />SoulFood Reading: Ezek 20-21, Luke 19:28-40, Ps 111, Pr 19:18-20]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Stay where you are<br />'Live under the protection of God Most High and stay in the shadow of God All-Powerful.' Psalm 91:1 CEV<br />Why would the prodigal son walk out on his dad when he already had everything he needed? Because:<br />(1) He got used to the good stuff and took it for granted. That's why God told His people, 'Be careful that you do not forget the Lord, who brought you...out of...slavery.' (Deuteronomy 6:12 NIV) At one point God told His people to take 12 stones, one for each tribe, and build a memorial. It might have looked like just a pile of stones but there was a reason it stood there year after year. It reminded them of who they were, who He was, and the promises that bound them together. What could YOU do to help you remember?<br />(2) He didn't know what was 'out there'. The path that takes us away from God leads to pain, not gain. Ask those who've walked it. They'll say, 'don't go there'.<br />(3) He wanted his father's blessings but not his rules. He didn't like his dad telling him what to do. Sound familiar? Jesus said: 'Why do you call me, &quot;Lord&quot;...and do not do what I say?' (Luke 6:46 NIV)<br />Sometimes we can be so sure of what we want that we ditch God, determined that we know best. You can imagine the prodigal son, storming out of his dad's house saying-'I'll show you, just wait and see.' Then we mess up and have to find the guts to fess up. One of the hardest things to deal with is knowing we are wrong. The Bible says the prodigal 'came to his senses' and knew he should head home. Do you?<br />SoulFood Reading: Ezek 16:53-19:14, Luke 19:11-27, Ps 103:13-22, Pr 19:17]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[God-given greats (2)<br />'...All peoples on earth will be blessed through you...' Genesis 28:14 NIV<br />Still not convinced that God could use 'little old you' to change things? Maybe Louis Braille thought the same before he came up with the idea of dots on paper to help blind people read. Samuel Morse probably never thought his work would change the world so much-but he enabled super-speedy overseas messages. Before him, there were no texts or emails to pass on urgent news and it took over a month to get to from England to Australia or NZ. Or there's Louis Pasteur, who brought in sterilisation to kill germs and viruses that weren't visible to the eye-which has saved gazillions of lives!<br />What do those guys all have in common? They were Christians who claimed God gave them their ideas and helped them work them through, even when it got tough. Morse was asked if he ever got so stuck when he was experimenting that he had no clue what to do. He did, many times. What did he do? 'I got down on my knees and prayed for light, and light came, and when my inventions were acknowledged...I said, &quot;Not unto me, O Lord...but unto Thy name give the glory.&quot;' He asked God for help and got it-and he gave the glory to God.<br />With God huge things are possible. He's not run out of good ideas to give-He's just waiting for you to ask for one. Why not give it a go, and see what happens?<br />SoulFood Reading: Ezek 14:1-16:52, Luke 19:1-10, Ps 103:1-12, Pr 19:12-16]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[God-given greats (1)<br />'...All peoples on earth will be blessed through you...' Genesis 28:14 NIV<br />Imagine having your tonsils out when you're wide awake, or having a tooth out without that jab in your gum to send it numb. Like the sound of that? Uh-uh, no thanks. But that's what they used to do in the days before anaesthetic. A Scottish guy called James Young Simpson didn't like the idea of so much pain due to ops gone wrong. So did he: (a) just think 'Och aye, I canna do anything about it,' or (b) look to God for help?<br />The answer is (b); he looked to the Bible to see if God could help him sort the problem out. God gave him an idea through Genesis 2:21; when God 'operated' on Adam (that's when He nicked a rib to make Eve), He put him into a deep sleep first. James decided to try and copy that, using chloroform. Yes, people tried to say he was wrong and that it'd never work. But he knew God had given him the idea, so he stuck with it, and eventually it paid off. It was widely accepted after Queen Victoria had her 8th child using chloroform and said she was 'greatly pleased with its effect'.<br />What can we learn from James Young Simpson? To ask God for good ideas that will help and bless others, and to keep working on them when He does. Who knows what great breakthrough God may use you for?<br />SoulFood Reading: Ezek 10-13, Luke 18:31-43, Ps 84, Pr 19:11]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Belt up!<br />'...Judge me, O Lord...according to my...integrity.' Psalm 7:8 NIV<br />If we're going to be judged by our integrity, we should know what it means, right? The Cambridge Dictionary says it's 'being honest...having strong moral principles that you refuse to change'. So how do we go about that then? Paul advises us to: 'Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist...' (Ephesians 6:14 NIV) He was talking about a leather girdle Roman soldiers wore around their waist to protect their loins (that's the bit above your legs and below your waist), carry weapons, and also hold their tunic together so it wouldn't get snagged and hold them back. Get the point? Just like a belt can hold your trousers up to stop you tripping over, integrity can help you not to trip over in your spiritual life. Be honest in everything, starting with the very small things and sticking to the guidelines the Bible gives you on how to live life! This will act like spiritual armour. It'll protect you and mean you're prepared when tough stuff comes your way, so you'll find it easier to survive the bigger things. A belt may seem small or uninteresting-like the foundations of a house. They're unseen, but without them, the house will fall down. Integrity is vital for a good life reflecting Jesus. So what are you waiting for-belt up!<br />SoulFood Reading: Gen 6:9-8:4, Matt 24:37-51 (Days of Noah)]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[You are qualified!<br />'...The Lord doesn't see things the way you see them...' 1 Samuel 16:7 NLT<br />'Could do better!' Ever had that written on your school report by a well-meaning teacher? Ever been told by a parent that you need to 'try harder?' Has someone called you a 'waste of space' or told you 'you're not good enough'?<br />It can be really difficult to walk around carrying other people's opinions about yourself. Maybe you say to yourself, 'It doesn't matter what they think, what do they know?' But truthfully we all know that words sometimes stick to us like glue and we very easily end up agreeing with them.<br />What do you believe about yourself today? How many negative things do you say about yourself, or worse, actually believe to be true? When people put us down or when we don't fit in with the stereotypes of perfection that the media portrays, we can start to believe that we are 'nothing' or 'nobody'. We can feel unloved, unwanted, useless, an 'it'-something of no significance.<br />'...The Lord doesn't see things the way you see them...' He sees you as you really are: His perfect creation packed full of potential! You are someone He has chosen. He has things only you can do-there's no one else better for the job! That's how brilliant you are to God. Look at yourself through God's eyes today-see how terrific you really are.<br />SoulFood Reading: Ezek 5-9, Luke 18:18-30, Ps 119:169-176, Pr 19:9-10]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[God experiences<br />'...Didn't our hearts burn within us as He talked with us on the road?' Luke 24:32 NLT<br />We don't have to be at some massive Christian festival or involved in something out of the ordinary to experience God. He turns up in our lives all the time. He promises, 'I will not in any way fail you nor give you up nor leave you without support. [I will] not, [I will] not, [I will] not in any degree leave you helpless nor forsake nor let [you] down...' (Hebrews 13:5 AMP) In the daily humdrum of life God is right there with you. Are you ready to have 'God experiences' every day?<br />In Luke 24 we read about two guys who were just walking home. They were on their way back from Jerusalem having witnessed Jesus die, crucified. They'd totally given up. They thought they'd never see Jesus ever again. How wrong they were! 'Didn't our hearts burn within us as He talked with us on the road?' They suddenly realised that they hadn't just walked home, they'd walked with Jesus!<br />So while you're out and about this week, walking down the road, sitting on a bus, playing on your Wii or getting bored in maths-expect a 'God experience'.<br />God is around you all the time, communicating with you. He wants to teach you some amazing stuff that will help you get a grip on your life and turn it around for the better.<br />SoulFood Reading: Ezek 1-4, Luke 18:1-17, Ps 119:161-168, Pr 19:3-8]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Emotional lockdown<br />'...Jericho was tightly shut up...' Joshua 6:1 NIV<br />Tough stuff happens and being a Christian doesn't mean that you get to escape it: '...You may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials.' (1 Peter 1:6 NIV) And the tough stuff can be really hard to deal with.<br />The Bible says, '...Jericho was tightly shut up... No one went out and no one came in.' Jericho was a well-guarded city, impossible to break into-great for a city at that time in history, not so great when you're an exceptional human being, created by God. We can only get hurt so much before we end up on 'emotional lockdown'-afraid to reach out or let anybody in. We build up walls thinking, 'I'm a rock, no-one can hurt me, I'm unbreakable, I'm in control.'<br />When we build up walls inside, what we're actually building is a prison, and locking ourselves in. Sure, maybe we do stop some of the bad stuff affecting us, but we also stop the good stuff getting in too. We begin to lose our identity, because our walls eventually stop us being who we're made to be.<br />God wants you to live in His freedom. Even though Jericho was a tough city, God literally knocked its walls down so Joshua could get in. Today, give your hurts to God. Let Him begin to heal you, allow Him to knock down your 'walls' so you can live in freedom with Him in charge.<br />SoulFood Reading: Amos 5:18-9:15, Luke 17:20-37, Ps 119:145-160, Pr 19:1-2]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Learning from others<br />'A king rejoices in wise servants...' Proverbs 14:35 NLT<br />Ok, so none of us likes other people butting into our lives where they're not wanted, chipping in with their opinion and advice about what we're doing or how we're doing it. Rather than listen we tell people to 'shut it'. Rather than ask, we say, 'I know.'<br />1 Peter 4:10 NLT says, 'God has given each of you a gift from His great variety of spiritual gifts. Use them well to serve one another.' This means you are able to help others with the things you can do, and others are able to help you with the things they can do. This is how God intended us to live. So we need to throw off any 'shut it, I know!' attitude. The Bible calls this being wise-something God wants us all to be. 'Wisdom is supreme; therefore get wisdom.' (Proverbs 4:7 NIV)<br />There are over 200 references to wisdom in the Bible-so we can safely say it's important to God. Being wise isn't about being really clever. It's about gaining an understanding of God and how He wants us to live. And guess what? God's got wisdom in bucket-loads and He gives it for free-as much as we want! All we need to do is ask; 'If you need wisdom, ask our generous God, and He will give it to you.' (James 1:5 NLT) Well what are you waiting for-ask!<br />SoulFood Reading: Amos 1:1-5:17, Luke 17:11-19, Ps 119:137-144, Pr 18:22-24]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Think again<br />'Stand against the devil, and the devil will run from you.' James 4:7 NCV<br />A pastor called Jon Walker writes about a boy who started 'The White Polar Bear Club'. To become a member you had to stand for 30 minutes and not think of a white polar bear. Try it. It sounds simple, but if you have ever intentionally tried not to think about something, you'll know it's almost impossible! That boy was tempting people to do something they shouldn't do if they wanted to win the game.<br />In Matthew 4 you can read how the devil tries to tempt Jesus into doing things to make Him lose. He can do the same to us too. 'Stay alert! Watch out for your great enemy, the devil. He prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour.' (1 Peter 5:8 NLT) He 'disguises himself' (2 Corinthians 11:14 NLT) so don't be looking out for a cartoon character with horns, wearing a red cape and carrying a pitchfork. He is extremely cunning and full of lies. When you find yourself thinking about things you know are wrong, do these two things:<br />(1) 'So give yourselves completely to God. Stand against the devil...' (James 4:7 NCV) Don't allow the devil to win you over, keep your focus on God.<br />(2) 'Put on all the armour that God gives, so you can defend yourself against the devil's tricks.' (Ephesians 6:11 CEV)<br />SoulFood Reading: Lam 3:40-5:22, Luke 17:1-10, Ps 119:129-136, Pr 18:21]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Loved up<br />'Love each other in the same way I have loved you.' John 15:12 NLT<br />On October 14, 2009, the singer Leona Lewis was attacked by a fan. One newspaper reported, 'He waited patiently for three hours and when Leona autographed his book, he suddenly leapt over the desk and punched her in the head. Guards immediately wrestled the maniac to the ground, with him yelling: &quot;I love you, Leona!&quot;' But there was no 'love' in his actions.'...Love is patient and kind...not jealous or boastful or proud or rude. It does not demand its own way. It is not irritable, and it keeps no record of being wronged. Love never gives up...and endures through every circumstance...love will last forever!' (1 Corinthians 13: 4-8 NLT)<br />This is the way Jesus loves you and He says, 'Love each other in the same way I have loved you.' So next time you're about to lose patience with someone, complain because you want what someone else has got, shoot your mouth off, be cheeky or throw a hissy fit to get your own way, remember Jesus says, 'Love each other in the same way I have loved you'. Next time you're about to get revenge, lie, gossip, or give up on someone-get loved up, Jesus-style!<br />SoulFood Reading: Lam 1:1-3:39, Luke 16:19-31, Ps 119:121-128, Pr 18:13-20]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Defining moments<br />'...choose today whom you will serve...' Joshua 24:15 NLT<br />Two sisters queuing in a fish n chip shop looked outside and discovered their car was gone, stolen. They felt sick; hearts racing, they ran outside where they saw the car just disappearing around the corner.<br />How they reacted next said much about their different personalities. One sister immediately gave chase ready to dive on the bonnet, or do whatever she could to single-handedly stop the thief. The other sister immediately walked back into the fish n chip shop shouting, 'Cancel the order, the car's been stolen.' It was a defining moment: their reaction taught them much about themselves. Thankfully for them, the thief turned out to be their brother playing a prank. Both car and sisters came off unscathed!<br />Read the book of Joshua and you'll discover he had many defining moments in his life-moments that revealed his true character and what his life was about. Just before he dies he creates a defining moment for all the people of Israel, saying to them, 'Choose today whom you will serve.'<br />They had to make a choice-there was no more sitting on the fence. Then he told them his answer: 'As for me and my family, we will serve the Lord.' If Joshua was to give you the same defining moment today-what would your answer be? There's no more sitting on the fence for you. Choose this day to live for God.<br />SoulFood Reading: Josh 2:1-24, Acts 9:20-30 (Narrow Escape)]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Don't let others hold you back<br />'...they were deeply offended and refused to believe in Him.' Matthew 13:57 NLT<br />'How can God exist?' they ask. 'There is too much suffering in the world,' they continue. 'If He does exist, I don't want to know Him, because He must be cruel, sitting up there in the lap of luxury while people die through lack of food and water or from disease,' they conclude. So many people become offended by God, without even trying to get to know Him.<br />Sometimes bad experiences-death, illness, abuse, bullying, pressure-can cause someone to believe that God couldn't possibly love them. Sometimes people believe the negative gossip about God and choose to believe He's not there. They never search for the truth. Sometimes a person can have a negative experience of Church and, just like the people in Jesus' town, refuse to believe in Him.<br />What about you? Do you ever doubt the existence of God? Are you easily persuaded by the opinions of your friends or family? Or have you got to know the greatest Friend of all, Jesus? Be encouraged today. God doesn't stop existing when people decide He's not real! He doesn't panic when you struggle to believe in Him some days.<br />'Don't worry about anything; instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need, and thank Him for all He has done. Then you will experience God's peace, which exceeds anything we can understand. His peace will guard your hearts and minds as you live in Christ Jesus.' (Philippians 4:6 NLT)<br />SoulFood Reading: Gal 4-6, Luke 16:1-18, Ps 119:113-120, Pr 18:10-12]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Thank God for the Blood<br />'... [you were purchased] with the precious blood of Christ...' 1 Peter 1:19 AMP<br />It was a defining moment when you were born.<br />When we become Christians, the Bible describes it like a second birth: 'For you have been born again, but not to a life that will quickly end. Your new life will last forever because it comes from the eternal, living Word of God.' (1 Peter 1:23 NLT)<br />The second birth is the defining moment of your new spiritual life. And just as it was with your natural birth, you can't give life to yourself. It was all up to Jesus: '...[you were purchased] with the precious blood of Christ.' That's why Jesus' death is spoken about so much in church. At first it can appear strange to celebrate a death and it can all sound a bit weird drinking wine to remember His blood. But it was something Jesus asked us to do: 'Jesus picked up a cup of wine and gave thanks to God. He...said, &quot;Take this and drink it. This is My blood, and with it God makes His agreement with you. It will be poured out, so that many people will have their sins forgiven.&quot;' (Matthew 26:27-28 CEV)<br />Thank God today for Jesus. Thank Him for dying for you. Thank Him for His blood. It is only because of Jesus that we can be forgiven and be born again with a new identity.<br />SoulFood Reading: Gal 1-3, Luke 15:11-32, Ps 119:105-112, Pr 18:9]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Get compassionate<br />'Blessed is he who considers the poor...' Psalm 41:1 NKJ<br />You know the ads: they let us look into the lives of people living in extreme difficulty or unimaginable poverty. Young and old, without food or clean water or opportunities to be educated-all asking for our help. Or you've seen the Compassion guys at the back of the concert asking for sponsors. But what do you do? Change the channel without as much as a second thought? Walk past?<br />Do you care what will happen to them if we don't help? God does! And He says to us, 'Blessed is he who considers the poor; The Lord will deliver him in time of trouble.' (Psalm 41:1 NKJ) Basically, 'You watch their backs and I'll watch yours.' Isn't that a massive incentive for us to help?<br />Be careful not to get so wrapped up in your own little world that you find you haven't even got the headspace to think about anyone else...let alone help them. Because if God sorts out all the troubles of those who help the poor then surely the opposite is also true: those who aren't bothered about the poor discover they have to wait for God to change their selfishness before answering their prayers.<br />If we think about sorting out world poverty for too long it can bust our brain. We can come to the conclusion, 'I'm just little old me-I can't make a difference'. But today, know that you can make a difference, decide today what you can do, then do it.<br />SoulFood Reading: Judges 19:16-21:25, Luke 15:1-10, Ps 119:97-104, Pr 18:6-8]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Full stop<br />'God ended His work...and He rested...' Genesis 2:2 NKJ<br />We live in an action-packed world; there is always something else to do and no time to properly rest.<br />But God showed us that it's very important to take time out, to put your feet up and chill. 'God ended His work...and He rested...' If God Himself took a break and had a rest-then it shouldn't surprise us that we need to do the same too. In fact, rest is so important to God that He commanded us to do it: 'You have six days when you can do your work, but the seventh...belongs to Me... No one is to work on that day. In six days I made...everything...but on the seventh day I rested. That's why I made the Sabbath...special...' (Exodus 20:8-11 CEV) Rest is something we have to do; it's not an option!<br />Taking time out is not a luxury: it is the way we were meant to exist. It's good for our health and stops us repeating mistakes. When we stop it's easier to see where we're going wrong and put it right. Rest re-energises us and helps us keep God in the number one spot.<br />By the way, in order to rest one day a week it means we need to be working productively the other six days. You can't rest from doing nothing! So if you're sitting around on your backside most of the week you need to redress the balance. Get a God-styled week-six days of working hard and one day just resting.<br />SoulFood Reading: Judges 16:1-19:15, Luke 14:25-35, Ps 119:89-96, Pr 18:1-5]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Totally potty<br />'...we have this treasure in earthen vessels...' 2 Corinthians 4:7 NKJ<br />Have you got a downer on yourself today? Ever felt useless, pathetic, a waste of space? Do you think God might feel the same about you? Well, think again! God is positively potty about you! Nothing about you surprises God. He knows you're not perfect. To Him you're a work in progress and He loves your imperfections-yes, all of them! No ifs, buts or maybes. His love is unconditional. In fact, 'He gave His life to free us from every kind of sin, to cleanse us, and to make us His very own people, totally committed to doing good deeds.' (Titus 2:14 NLT)<br />Even if you feel as useless as a mobile phone without a SIM card, God chooses to use you. You are loved and chosen by God, to be used by Him just as you are.<br />The Bible says God works through us '...clay jars...the real power comes from God and not from us.' (2 Corinthians 4: 7 CEV) This way, when people see good things in us, they know it's actually God working in us. Grab hold of that 'potty confidence' God has in you: you're never useless to God.<br />SoulFood Reading: Judges 12-15, Luke 14:15-24, Ps 119:81-88, Pr 17:27-28]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[Stop complaining and start gaining (6)<br />'Do everything without complaining...' Philippians 2:14 NIV<br />Here are three final thoughts on complaining:<br />SALSA: Stop Accusing Loudly, Start Asking. No one likes it when we go about shooting our mouths off. People either become aggressive towards us or completely ignore us. However legitimate your gripe, all people will hear and see is a complainer. This will greatly reduce the chance of a good outcome. Whatever the cause: 'SALSA!' You're more likely to get what you ask for if you do it graciously, rather than beef on about it. Asking for help-or for understanding, or to share how you feel, or for someone to do things differently-avoids arguments, stops you wasting time raking over the past about things that can't be changed and always brings a better result.<br />Back off: Once you've said it, now let God work. Changing people is God's job, so back off, be patient and give Him a chance. Get out of God's way and let Him do what you can't. He has ways and means you've never dreamed of. When He's allowed to take over the job, it gets done properly.<br />Do a Joey: No sitting around biting your tongue, seething when things don't go to plan. Take a lesson from Joseph. He had every reason to complain about his family and to take revenge. Instead, he kept focused on God and looked to see how he could become part of the solution. It works! Joseph's family was reunited, and God gave him some amazing things to do with his life.<br />SoulFood Reading: Jdg 9:34-11:40, Lk 14:1-14, Ps 119:73-80, Pr 17:27-2, Ecc 5:4-6]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Stop complaining and start gaining (5)<br />'Do everything without complaining...' Philippians 2:14 NIV<br />When someone hurts you, your temptation will be to tell everybody and have a right good moan! It feels acceptable, justified, and even therapeutic. Well-meaning friends will encourage it and maybe even help you publicise it. 'You'll feel better when you've got it off your chest,' they'll say. But God says, 'Do everything without complaining...' Even when you're cheesed off, had enough and just can't take it anymore! When someone hurts you, God says we need to have some 1-2-1 time and wrap it in kindness:<br />(1) 1-2-1 time: In other words, no putting an ad in the paper 'naming and shaming'. 'If another believer sins against you, go privately and point out the offence. If the other person listens and confesses it, you have won that person back.' (Matthew 18:15 NLT)<br />(2) Wrapped in kindness: So, no barging in like Mr Angry, shouting in their face, ready to head-butt them. '...speak the truth in love, growing in every way more and more like Christ...' (Ephesians 4:15 NLT)<br />Remember your goal is not to humiliate them or to get revenge, but rather to sort out the problem, resolve your differences, strengthen your relationship, and honour God.<br />Even when we do everything right and deliver the best 1-2-1 time wrapped in kindness ever, it will only resolve itself if the other person responds well. But this doesn't mean you now have a right to get all stroppy. God always has the best next step, so listen to Him.<br />SoulFood Reading: Ezek 47:1-12, Rev 21:22-22:5 (Healing River)]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Stop complaining and start gaining (4)<br />'Do everything without complaining...' Philippians 2:14 NIV<br />What's your attitude been like this week? Have you honestly been trying to 'Do everything without complaining'? Has it been easy to do? Or are you thinking, 'It's impossible, I can't do it! See-I'm even moaning about moaning now!'<br />Well, be encouraged today. You need to remember that God never asks us to do anything without helping us to do it. 'You are tempted in the same way all other human beings are. God is faithful. He will not let you be tempted any more than you can take. But when you are tempted, God will give you a way out so that you can stand up under it.' (1 Corinthians 10:13 NIV) So next time you're about to get in a strop, simmer down and talk to God first. Ask Him to show you a better way, then take it.<br />But what if your complaint is legit? After all, injustice, abuse, betrayal, robbery, gossip, lies, prejudice, physical harm against you or your family are legitimate causes for complaint, right? So you can't just sit back and do nothing, can you? Jesus says, 'You are the light of the world...people do not light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead, they put it on its stand. Then it gives light to everyone... In the same way, let your light shine in front of others.' (Matthew 5:14-16 NIV) We need to always do things God's way. So, don't 'mouth off' without first talking to God about the best thing to do in your situation.<br />SoulFood Reading: Judges 7:1-9:33, Luke 13:18-35, Ps 119:65-72, Pr 17:23-26]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Stop complaining and start gaining (3)<br />'Do everything without complaining ...' Philippians 2:14 NIV<br />Come on, be honest-did you read the verse for today and think: 'They're not still on about complaining, are they?' And then did you have a quick look, see that we're going to be reading the same verse for another three days and think, 'You've got to be kidding! Do we really have to hear about it for a whole six days? Enough already! &quot;Stop moaning&quot;-I get it!'<br />Well, if that's the case, you'll know why we're keeping at it! Because it's so easy to moan about anything! Even word4U2day!<br />In order to start or stop doing anything, we need to know why. What's the point? What's in it for me? God never asks us to do something without it benefiting us. Listen: 'Do everything without complaining or arguing, so that you may become blameless and pure, children of God without fault in a crooked and depraved generation, in which you shine like stars in the universe.' (Philippians 2:14-15 NIV)<br />When the stars are out, it is impossible not to notice them. They look amazing, they stand out! You don't just glance at them. You watch them because they are truly beautiful. When we pack in our moaning, sulky, argumentative behaviour, God says we will stand out. We'll be noticed, we'll be as impressive as the stars. Everyone will be able to see God in us. Now that's worth doing, right?<br />SoulFood Reading: Judges 4-6, Luke 13:1-17, Ps 119:57-64, Pr 17:22]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Stop complaining and start gaining (2)<br />'Do everything without complaining...' Philippians 2:14 NIV<br />God says: 'Do everything without complaining ...' because complaining is toxic. It's poisonous! It damages and contaminates! There is nothing good about it. It acts like a drug dealer, giving people a taste so before they know it, they're hooked. The more you do it, the more you want to do it, and the harder it is to stop-it's addictive. Inject 'complaint poison' into your life and eventually it will 'toxify' every bit of it. Subtly, it will pollute all your relationships, your church, your family, your neighbourhood.<br />Sometimes we think we have to moan and complain. We think there is only one option and that's to sound off. But do the maths-nothing positive can come from a negative.<br />Complaining is a cop-out, it's what we do to avoid facing a problem. It actually makes us part of the problem instead of the solution. And ultimately, your complaining affects you more than anyone else. The Psalmist said, '...I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed...' (Psalm 77:3 NKJ) Every time you act like a Moaning Minnie you reinforce the power of 'complaint poison' over you, making yourself the victim of your own lethal complaints. Before you say anything stop and think. Then 'do all things without complaining...'<br />SoulFood Reading: Judges 1-3, Luke 12:49-59, Ps 119:49-56, Pr 17:18-21]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Stop complaining and start gaining (1)<br />'Do everything without complaining...' Philippians 2:14 NIV<br />Moan, moan, moan, whinge, whinge, whinge, whine, whine, whine! Complaining; we hear it all the time and come on, be honest, you do it too, right?<br />'Oh no I don't!' we protest to anyone who dares accuse us of arguing. We can do it so often we don't even realise we're doing it. 'It wasn't me, it was her.' Or, 'He made me do it, it's not my fault.' Sound familiar? They're actually excuses like those used by Adam and Eve. Can you believe it? Even the first two humans, living in the lap of luxury with God, found something to beef about!<br />As soon as they ate that forbidden fruit they were arguing and moaning about whose fault it was. It didn't help then (they both got chucked out of paradise) and it doesn't help now either. That's why God says to you today, 'Do everything without complaining...' He knows it gets us nowhere. He knows we'll only end up making things worse for ourselves.<br />Read Exodus or Numbers, and you'll hear God's people whinging big time! Paul warns us not to fall into the same trap: 'Do not complain as some of them did; they were killed by the angel that destroys. The things that happened to those people are examples...written down to teach us...' (1 Corinthians 10:10-11 NCV) So clean up your verbal act! Decide to detect, reject and eject all complaining language from your vocabulary.<br />SoulFood Reading: Ruth 1-4, Luke 12:35-48, Ps 119:41-48, Pr 17:17]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Let's stick together<br />'He raised us up together...' Ephesians 2:6 AMP<br />Hang around some people long enough and it's easy to get irritated, even in church. Sometimes other Christians can really get on our nerves. We can become so frustrated, fed-up or bored with church that we want to get as far away from it as possible. We begin to think, 'I don't need them, I can do without church.' We even start believing, 'It's ok to be a Christian and not go to church.'<br />God says, 'He raised us up together...' We're not meant to go it alone. God wants us to stick together, support, encourage and help each other.<br />Can you imagine trying to get around today without your skeleton? Leaving all your bones behind in your wardrobe? Without your bones you'd fall to the floor in some kind of blobby mess. You wouldn't get very far. Keeping your skeleton intact, people get to see the real you. They get to see how great you are, how you move, what you can do. Take away those bones and the you they see would be very different.<br />Church is a bit like your Christian skeleton. Without it people don't get to see the real Jesus. Church community can be really challenging, it can feel difficult or seem unimportant. But God can only be truly seen when we stand together, grow together, learn together, work together and worship Him together.<br />SoulFood Reading: Obadiah, 2 John, Luke 12:22-34, Ps 119:33-40, Pr 17:16]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Caught in the headlights<br />'Tell...the mighty things I have done...' Exodus 10:2 NKJ<br />Have you seen police helicopters out at night, spotlight on the suspect, following their every move, chasing them wherever? Imagine being the suspect, your heart pounding, your legs flying, your brain in overdrive trying to think: where now, what next, is there any escape? It doesn't matter what alley you run down, what garden you hide in or car you hide under. It doesn't even matter how fast you run, what amount of distance you put between you and that helicopter; it is going to catch up with you again. There is no escape!<br />Sometimes it feels like your past is chasing you just like that police helicopter. You thought it was all over, but then you find yourself caught in the headlights again. That past experience raises its ugly head, stares you in the face, leaving you reliving the same hurt, shame and mess again: 'Will this ever go away, will this ever leave me alone? Is there any escape?'<br />Great news today: the answer is yes! Jesus said, 'With God all things are possible.' (Matthew 19:26 NKJ) When you put your trust in Him, your past has to back off. God says, 'Tell...the mighty things I have done'-talk about all the times He's won in the past, know that the battles are easy for God to win, even the battle you have with your past. Give your past to God, and don't stay caught in the headlights.<br />SoulFood Reading: 1 Pet 1-5, Luke 12:13-21, Ps 119:25-32, Pr 17:11-15]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['After you'<br />'...honour others more than you do yourself.' Romans 12:10 CEV<br />'You are the Weakest Link-goodbye!' Even if you haven't seen the show you know the catchphrase, right? It comes from the quiz show The Weakest Link, where all the contestants try to out-do each other in order to win the cash and avoid the 'walk of shame'. No one wants it; they want to win so much they're quite prepared to vote other people off, whether they deserve it or not, to get that prize.<br />God tells us to do the opposite: '...honour others more than you do yourself.' But who wants to come second, not first? It can make us feel like we have to lie down and let people walk all over us! Hmph! Not good!<br />Well, just before you fly off the handle in protest, or refuse to listen, know this: God is not asking you to be a doormat. He loves you too much to allow you to go through any unnecessary pain. He wants you to know you are extremely valuable. So what does He mean when He asks us to 'honour others more'? A few things: (1) Don't use people to get what you want (2) Don't compete to try and make yourself look good (3) Stop judging others and believing you're better than everyone else (4) Accept people just as they are and put their needs first (5) Love as God loves-unconditionally.<br />SoulFood Reading: Esther 4:13-5:3, Matt 6:16-21, Mark 2:18-22 (Fasting)]]></introtext>
