<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 32: 3-4 NAS <br /></span>A woman who completed a walk around the world confessed she travelled part-way in a support truck. ‘I shouldn't be remembered as the first woman to walk round the world when I cheated,' she said. How many of us would even have admitted our deception?<br />The Psalmist said, ‘When I kept silent about my sin...Your hand was heavy upon me.' Confessing your sins: (1) lets you experience God's forgiveness: He already knows about them anyway, but how can He forgive you while you're busy making excuses and blame-shifting? John says, ‘...if we confess...he will forgive our sins...' (1 John 1: 9 NCV) The first move is up to you. (2) restores your emotional and physical energy: Nothing's more draining than denial and nothing gives you energy and enthusiasm like having a clean slate. David said, ‘I am weak from sin...' (Psalm 31:10 CEV) Reflecting on his affair with Bathsheba, he said, ‘When I kept silent... my vitality was drained...I acknowledged my sin...and You forgave the guilt.' (Psalm 32: 3-5 NAS) (3) allows you to move on: Confession allows you to hit the ‘reset' button and start again. It draws a line between the past and future. (4) lets you grow: Thomas Edison said failure taught him over a thousand ways not to make a light bulb! Your mistakes work for you instead of against you when you start confessing them to God and accepting His forgiveness. <br />SoulFood reading: Philip 4:4-13, Gen 11:1-9</p>]]></introtext>
