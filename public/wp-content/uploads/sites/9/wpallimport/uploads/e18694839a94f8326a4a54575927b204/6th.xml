<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...LET US LAY ASIDE EVERY WEIGHT.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HEBREWS 12:1 KJV</span><br>Have you ever been in a church where the meeting is run almost entirely on the PowerPoint (tm) presentation prepared by the minister? Do you remember the week when the projector or laptop chose not to work and the whole meeting collapsed as a result? Can you remember when you lost a really important document because the computer crashed? Can you remember missing that important phone call because your mobile died? The world has gone technology crazy, and the best bit is you can almost guarantee it will fail you at that most crucial moment. Technology isn't bad, in fact most of the time it's fantastic! But we do need to make sure we don't become so obsessed by it and dependent on it that the world falls apart when it breaks! Sometimes, a pen and paper, believe it or not, is quicker. Sometimes a friend really would appreciate a face to face chat rather than a quick text or email message. And let's not forget, your evangelistic talk won't fail just because your (slightly irrelevant) Simpsons movie clip crashed!    
Technology is great but we also need to make sure we don't get too carried away. Think about how much time you've spent this week on technology - your PC, MP3 player, TV, Xbox 360, mobile, and how much time you've spent on your relationships - with God, your family or your mates. Listen to your mum, she's right; sometimes their really ARE more important things to spend your money, your time, your energy and your efforts on.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THEY DROVE OUT MANY DEMONS AND ANOINTED MANY SICK PEOPLE WITH OIL AND HEALED THEM.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MARK 6:13 NIV</span><br>The shops are full of masks, costumes, blood and other 'fun' items to help little kids enjoy Halloween. Some Christians will be having meetings to declare 'victory over the darkness' and others will be taking their kids out 'trick or treating'. Whatever you think about Halloween there is no question that it's a night of celebration for satan and as much 'fun' as it may be it is a very important night for those involved with witchcraft and the occult. 
Halloween is not a night to be feared as many Christians do, but how about seeing it as a wonderful opportunity to introduce people to Jesus? It's one night of the year that everyone wants to believe in the supernatural so rather than rant about Scream masks and slam the door in little children's faces, lets show them the power we have! How about door knocking and asking if they would like prayer for something instead of trick or treating? How about a party to celebrate Jesus, dress the kids as angels and things from the Bible (Jesus, an ark, a whale, a dove, a fish etc!)? Lets not teach people what we're against but show them what we have - a magnificent, glorious and beautiful God that has totally beaten satan already! Harry Potter may be able to manage a few magic tricks but our God can heal the sick, cast out demons, raise the dead to life, give us eternal life AND he's not just a made up character from a fantasy book - He's alive and with us right now! Beat that JK Rowling...

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...GIVE WITHOUT EXPECTING A RETURN...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 6:35 TM</span><br>If you're serious about becoming like Jesus, pay careful attention to His words: '...Ask yourself what you want people to do for you; then grab the initiative and do it for them!...give without expecting a return. You'll never - I promise - regret it...' (Luke 6:31-35 TM). Love, expecting nothing in return. Give, though they'll never say thanks. Forgive, even though they won't forgive you. Come early, stay late, invest everything you've got even though nobody notices. Paul calls this '...the high calling...' (Philippians 3:14 KJV). And there's a reason: none of us would be daft enough to set such a standard for ourselves! If you think some people are just naturally more loving than others, think again. Love is a choice; one that costs! You can't love others while you're staring into a mirror or give to others while you're clinging to what you've got. Love will cost you your time, your money and yourself. If you think you'll just go to church some Sunday morning, read a book or attend a bible-study and turn into the kind of person we're talking about; good luck! There are no pre-packaged saints; no 'add-and-stir' formula that makes God's love suddenly flow through you. To be loving you've got to take up your cross, deny yourself and make others your priority. 
    Remember the woman caught in adultery? Jesus stooped down to reach her, stood by her under attack, then sent her home new and refocused. Do you want to be like Him? Go and find people who are hurting, hopeless, and even wrong. When you do, be with them until they're new, restored and right. That's living unselfishly!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...THEY WERE ALL FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ACTS 4:31 NIV</span><br>There's loads of pictures of ways we can be filled with the Holy Spirit. There's the giant cup waiting to be filled, the rain on your head, the river through your veins, the fire in your heart and a million more. However you understand it, it's a matter of capacity, availability, and how much you want it. When the disciples were first filled with the Holy Spirit we read that He '...sat upon each of them' (Acts 2:3 KJV). What a descriptive phrase! When we were about to have a fight, the Holy Spirit sat on us. When we were about to cheat in a test, He sat on us. When we were about to sack it all in, He sat on us. When we were about to flip out, He sat on us. The Holy Spirit can keep us in balance, in peace, and on track. 
Here are three things that the Holy Spirit does for us: a) He gives us direction when we feel lost: '...all who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God' (Romans 8:14 NLT) b) when others put us down, He reminds us who we are. '...His Holy Spirit speaks to us deep in our hearts and tells us that we are God's children' (Romans 8:16 NLT) c) He steps in when we don't know how to pray about the situation: '...We don't even know what we should pray for...but the Holy Spirit prays for us...in harmony with God's own will' (Romans 8:26-27 TLB). 
So what should our attitude be toward the Holy Spirit? 'Do not grieve the Holy Spirit...' (Ephesians 4:30 NIV). The Bible likens the Holy Spirit to a dove, and a dove is gentle. It won't land on a nest that's out of order. Think about it!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...CONFESS YOUR SINS TO EACH OTHER...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JAMES 5:16 NIV</span><br>Why are there so many perfect people around? You know the sort, nothing goes wrong for them, they live on a little cloud where they chatter with God all day long. All their problems are used to 'test them' and of course they never ever fail that test! Here's a little secret, they're not so perfect! In fact, they probably struggle with exactly the same things you do and just maybe, one of their biggest problems is that they can't admit their weaknesses! 
The Bible says we need to 'confess your sins to each other'. For most of us this is a terrifying prospect and the total opposite of we want to do which is hide at the bottom of a cupboard and pray no one ever finds out what we've done! This verse doesn't actually mean that we need to spend all our days living under a cloud of guilt telling everyone we meet everything we've ever done wrong. That's ridiculous! After all, the Bible also says once we've confessed our sins to God and said sorry, they are totally forgotten! When we confess our sins, it's more about confessing our faults and weaknesses than a specific event or thought. Choose who you talk to carefully, pick someone older, wiser, someone not known for gossiping! We chat about the things we struggle with so we know it's not just us, we're not freaks. We can pray together and figure out how to solve that particular problem. Remember, honesty is a strength, not a weakness. Our sins are forgiven, so we don't need to be ashamed of working on our weaknesses!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...ON HIS LAW HE MEDITATES DAY AND NIGHT.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALMS 1:2 NIV</span><br>If you've never meditated perhaps you think it's too difficult; or weird. For most of us meditating is a weird thing you do sat cross legged with your fingers in that weird position going 'ohhhhmmm'...but even the Bible talks about meditation like it's a good thing! Answer this: do you know how to worry? Then you know how to meditate! because meditating is just: 
1) Thinking deeply and continuously about something
2) Memorizing it
3) Letting it sink deep inside you. 
The point isn't how much Scripture you can memorise or quote, but what happens to you in the process. You can meditate on just a sentence or a single word. Meditating on God's Word builds you up, teaches, corrects, directs and challenges you by making you think different thoughts than if you were watching TV, talking on your mobile or shopping in town. Jesus once asked his followers, 'Why do you keep on saying that I am your Lord, when you refuse to do what I say?' (Luke 6:46 CEV). That's a question He asks all of us. Mentally those dudes knew the truth, but they weren't ready to act on it. How many times have you wanted to pray something but in your heart thought 'not just yet'. For example, 'Lord, I want to get up at 5am every day to spend three hours with you (in a few years time when I'm older and much more holy...)'.
Meditating on God's Word will help you to figure out what's important, to not put things off until tomorrow, bring you much closer to God and help you understand God in a far deeper way.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>LET THE WISE LISTEN AND ADD TO THEIR LEARNING...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 1:5 NIV</span><br>Here are 3 reasons why growth should matter to you:
1) Gifting without growth produces nothing. Albert Schweitzer said, 'The secret of success is to go through life as a person who never gets used up.' But how do you do that? The answer lies in how you approach talent. If you use your talent a bit but never sharpen it, you're headed for trouble because nobody's that talented. But if you take the time to sharpen your axe, God can call on you at a moment's notice.
2) Growth stops you festering. Do you feel stuck in your life, like it's going nowhere? You won't get unstuck by making changes, looking for a job, leaving home or changing churches. The truth is, nobody's keeping you down but yourself. The lid on your life is you! In order to do more, you've got to grow more. So, if you're serious about getting unstuck, stop looking for quick fixes, take a long hard look at yourself, accept responsibility for what you see, pray, then commit yourself to doing something about it
3) Continuous improvement guarantees success! The Tartar tribes of central Asia used to pronounce a certain curse over their enemies. They didn't shout words calling for their enemy's swords to rust or their people to die of disease. No, they said, 'May you stay in one place forever.' If you don't work on improving yourself every day that could be your fate. You'll be stuck in the same place, doing the same things, hoping the same hopes, but never actually getting anywhere or developing spiritually. So, commit yourself to growth!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...WE CAN COMFORT THOSE IN ANY TROUBLE WITH THE COMFORT WE OURSELVES HAVE RECEIVED FROM GOD.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 1:4 NIV</span><br>The most loving thing we can do when someone is in pain is to share the pain; to 'be there,' even when we've nothing to offer except our presence, even when being there is painful to ourselves.
Paul says that God 'comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves have received from God.' One of the fastest and best ways to be spiritually healthy, is taking the focus off ourselves and helping others. In fact we were born with a natural empathy for those who are hurting. Ever notice that babies in a nursery start crying when other infants cry? Compassion, which literally means, 'to suffer with' is the ability to be moved by the troubles of others. When we reach out from our own pain to help others it comes back to us in healing, fulfillment and a sense of worth. 
One cancer patient said, 'What helps me most is just to have somebody try and understand what I'm feeling.' Another said, 'Just sit here and let me hold your hand. It helps when someone's close.' It doesn't just have to be a major life or death thing, it could just be a friend struggling with their parents. Today ask God to make you more sensitive to the needs and hurts of those around you. And when He answers your prayer and puts someone into your path, don't be too busy to care. In other words, 'be there!'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>IT IS NOT GOOD TO HAVE ZEAL WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE, NOR BE HASTY AND MISS THE WAY.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 19:2 NIV</span><br>There seem to be two types of teenagers. One type spends most of the holidays wondering what to do and complaining that regardless of where they live there's 'never anything to do around here'. The other type is half man, half mattress. They emerge from under the duvet only for a 16 hour shift in front of the X-box, then back to the duvet. Sometimes they even play X-Box while under the duvet! 
There's a little story in Matthew 17 about the collectors of the temple tax - a two drachma (an ancient Greek coin) tax. They come to ask Peter whether Jesus has paid it. Jesus then does something really bizarre... he sends Peter to catch a fish saying, '...open its mouth and you will find a four-drachma coin... give it to them for my tax and yours.' (Matthew 17:27 NIV) So here's a thought, there were 12 disciples and Jesus. Why didn't they need 26 drachmas? The answer's pretty simple. The other disciples probably weren't old enough to pay the tax, they were probably teenagers!  
God's got a plan for you whether you're 14 or 40 and I can almost guarantee it doesn't involve an X-box! Wherever you're at, there are things you can do. Spend time with God. Visit elderly relatives, figure out ways to bless people without anyone ever knowing it was you! Don't be so driven that you can't enjoy what's going on now, but don't be so lazy that you do nothing. God doesn't think you're too young for anything. Mary, and the disciples were young - and look at all they did. God loves teenagers!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I CAN DO ALL THINGS BECAUSE CHRIST GIVES ME THE STRENGTH</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PHILIPPIANS 4:13 NLV</span><br>In a certain episode of the 'Catherine Tate show' the schoolgirl character is going on a school trip and her teacher walks in wearing ordinary 'teacher' clothes. The character immediately jumps to the conclusion that 'Miss' is a Christian and asks 'are you a Christian though Miss? Does Jesus live in your heart though Miss? Is the Lord your shepherd Miss?' How we dress certainly has an impact on the way we are seen as Christians but the Bible is more concerned with us dressing up our character by '...[putting] on the Lord Jesus...' (see Romans 13:14 KJV). Thankfully this doesn't involve wearing sandles and growing a beard!
The world is confused about who Christians actually are. Everyone knows what we're against and everyone has an idea about how we ought to act. Some people have such as distorted view that they are surprised to discover Christians occasionally may even break wind! People don't need a sermon from us, they don't need to be told what they're doing wrong. How you act needs to reflect what you believe and who you belong to. Most of the time we want to fit in but when people are doing wrong do you have the strength to stand out, be different and speak about what you believe? Your actions will say more to people about Jesus than anything else. 'Little old you' can change someone's total perception of God and what it means to be a follower of Jesus. And remember, 'I can do all things because Christ gives me the strength.'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>&quot;THE LORD HIMSELF GOES BEFORE YOU AND WILL BE WITH YOU...&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>DEUTERONOMY 31:8 NIV</span><br>Surely God would only send those He could trust into enemy territory. Understand this: God cares about where you are. He has selected you for your school, college or work environment. He has already, or is currently equipping you. Your parents wouldn't send you off on a school trip away without packing your bags and thinking of everything you would need while your away. And God wouldn't either. Sometimes nasty environments can be overwhelming; but by God's grace we can thrive in them! If you'll take God with you and keep your identity in one piece, the enemy will lose ground. Don't let him keep you focused on everything that's doing your head in: gossip, peer pressure, being bullied, friends falling out, incorrect homework or a nasty teacher. The danger is that you'll focus on the discomfort of the moment and miss the blessings that lie beyond it. While you're praying for God to change your circumstances and take away your problems, He's saying, 'If only you knew what was waiting for you. Your purpose and destiny are only moments away, and, though not wrapped in shiny paper, they contain all you'll ever need to reach your goal and bring Me glory.' God understands us so well. He knows all about our desire to stay in one place when things become so comfortable, that we just don't want to move! Often He has to trouble the waters so that we'll reach out to Him in desperation, and as a result, tap into strength and success we never knew possible.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...THE SON OF GOD [CAME]...TO DESTROY THE DEVIL'S WORK.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 JOHN 3:8 NIV</span><br>How often do you look at somebody and think you're not as bad as they are? After all, you haven't cheated on a test or your mate (or at least been found out!) Wrong! While you may not have done the same thing, you've probably thought about it. And if you haven't yet, chances are that given the right set of circumstances you would! The Bible says, 'All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God' (Romans 3:23 KJV). Note that word 'all.' Without safeguards in place we all come up short. Until you confront your total capacity for sin and admit your weakness in certain areas, you'll always be a target for the enemy. And you'll fall! Your issue may appear to be anger or lust or jealousy, but the underlying problem is plain old sin. What else would make a married man kick-off like a teenager? Or a Mum neglect her kids? Or an A-grade student do drugs? The Bible says, 'The devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God [came] was to destroy the devil's work.' The bottom line is, sin makes us want to go our own way instead of God's.
In the hard-hitting introduction to his letter to the church in Rome Paul talks about those who reject God's dealings. He describes how God '...he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done' (Romans 1:28 NIV). Be thankful that God hasn't turned you over to yourself! At least not yet! Recognise that He's giving you another chance. So, admit your sin and receive His forgiveness; turn to Him while you still can!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...&quot;MY POWER WORKS BEST IN YOUR WEAKNESS.&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 12:9 NLT</span><br>At 19 months, Helen Keller contracted the illness that eventually left her without hearing and sight. Back then those labeled 'deaf and dumb,' were classified as idiots. But Helen's parents didn't agree. They hired a teacher to work with her and eventually she learned to read and write using Braille. Amazingly, in 1904 she graduated with honors from Radcliffe College, then devoted her life to helping others. A businessman called Andrew Carnegie paid her an annual wage; writers Mark Twain and Robert Louis Stevenson praised her and almost every President of her day invited her to The White House. Even though Helen died in 1968 her legacy of courage lives on. When asked if there was anything worse than being blind, Helen replied, 'Yes, having sight but no vision.' At 12 Thomas Edison developed such severe hearing loss that his teachers recommended he be taken out of school. Instead Edison used his handicap to drown out distractions and focus on his work. As a result the boy who was labeled 'a slow learner' gave the world over 1,000 inventions, including the light bulb, the phonograph and the motion camera.
Who gets to decide what's 'normal' anyway? Is it being short versus tall, or rich versus poor? The truth is, God's given all of us unique abilities that He expects us to explore. And interestingly, the real handicaps don't belong to those who are born with physical and mental challenges. No, they belong to the so-called normal people who've accepted being lazy and 'can't be bothered' attitudes' as part of life. God said, 'My power works best in your weakness,' so you can let your difficulties stop or inspire you. Which will it be?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...DESPITE ALL THESE THINGS...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 8:37 NLT </span><br>Composer Gian Carlo Menotti said, 'Hell begins the day God grants us a vision of...the gifts we've wasted, of all we might have done but we didn't do.' Wilma Rudolph, who won three gold medals at the 1960 Olympics would agree. What she accomplished isn't as impressive as what she overcame. As a child 'Willie' contracted polio and couldn't walk without braces. Then at age 13 she regained the use of her legs and went on to become the fastest woman alive. But her challenges weren't just physical. One of 22 children born to a poor black family, she inspired us by overcoming poverty and many racial problems. She said, '&quot;I can't&quot; has never been in my vocabulary.' At age two, Scott Hamilton, another famous Olympic skater, stopped growing because of a childhood illness that almost killed him. But his parents encouraged his rehabilitation by teaching him to skate - and the rest is history! In 1976 when Brad Parks was injured in an accident that left him in a wheelchair, he strengthened his arm by whacking tennis balls against his garage door. Three years later he formed the National Foundation of Wheelchair Tennis. The Apostle Paul said, 'Despite all these things...victory is ours through Christ.' Pastor and best-selling author Rick Warren writes: 'Why does God use our weaknesses? Because when he does, he gets all the glory. If God only used your strengths, others would look at you and be jealous...or discouraged. But when God uses you in spite of your weaknesses...they realise 'God could use me too!' Your weaknesses aren't an accident. God...allowed them for the purpose of demonstrating his power through you.'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>LOVE SHOULD ALWAYS MAKE US TELL THE TRUTH...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS4:15 CEV</span><br>Read 1 Timothy 1:18-20 and 2 Timothy 4:14-15. How do you think Paul would've handled the following inquiry: 'Dear Paul: We're thinking about hiring Alexander the coppersmith to manage our company, and because you know him well we'd appreciate your opinion?' Knowing the problems Alexander had caused him in the past, how would Paul respond? Or how about this one: 'Dear Abraham: Lot has applied for a loan to expand his cattle ranch on the land he inherited from you in the Jordan Valley near Sodom. So we're writing to ask you for a character reference?' Would Abraham, who was well aware of his nephew's dodgy business practices (see Genesis 13:11-13), fudge the facts to keep peace in the family? It's doubtful. Or what about this one: 'Dear John: We need a mature Christian to fill a slot on our church board. Based on your dealings with Diotrephes, do you think he's the right person?' John knew the trouble this guy (with a very funny name) had already caused and his need for power and control (see 3 John 9-10). But would he choose his words carefully to keep the peace? Probably not; knowing John he'd be honest and tell the truth. 
So, what would you do? Remember, the Bible says that love should always make us tell the truth. Following Christ means being honest when it would be easier to avoid confrontation and not give all the facts. Hopefully you'd find the courage to be straightforward - and gracious. Yes, gracious! Why? Because being asked for your input doesn't give you a right to start banging on about someone's mistakes and publicly embarrass them. The Bible says, 'Let your conversation be gracious and effective...' (Colossians 4:6 NLT).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...THE RICH ARE ALWAYS WORRYING AND SELDOM GET A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ECCLESIASTES 5:12</span><br>Is it possible to ever have enough? A mega-rich American tycoon called Rockefeller was asked 'how much does it take to satisfy a man?' Rockefeller very wisely replied 'a little more than he has now'. While our worlds evolve around 'stuff' we will never, ever have enough. No matter what mobile phone, games console, TV, iPod, clothes or hair straighteners you have, you will always want the one that comes out in a few weeks. These things will not bring you happiness or satisfaction, they will only every remind you that the upgrade is due out anytime now. 
The message isn't new; Solomon said, 'The rich are always worrying and seldom get a good nights sleep.' Your worries about whether you're going to get an Xbox 360 anytime soon may not keep you awake now but as you get older and your concerns turn to cars, houses, a new kitchen or conservatory, then it will begin to take it's toll. It's important that you really begin to understand where your happiness and contentment comes from now so you're free from that stuff later on.    
So how do you get free from the need for more stuff? Well it starts by being totally convinced that everything you have is a gift from God, and it's there to be shared with others. Contentment simply frees you to enjoy what He's provided. Don't be lured by advertising and glitz. Make a habit of giving stuff away. Learn to enjoy things without having to own them. Above all, make God the number one priority in your life!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...I HAVE LEARNED TO BE CONTENT...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PHILIPPIANS 4:11 NAS</span><br>A rich man decided to have all he owned converted into gold bars and he held them close as he breathed his last breath. The man gripped his treasure tightly as he found himself before the pearly gates and St Peter himself. St Peter told him he could enter the gates but couldn't take his sack with him. Saddened, the man told Peter he couldn't leave it behind but Peter replied that in that case he would have to go to the other place. The man turned to walk away and Peter couldn't help wondering what was so special that the man would give up his seat in heaven for it. Peter looked in the sack and with a confused expression exclaimed... &quot;paving slabs!!??&quot;' 
The average person is bombarded with about 300 advertisements a day. It's a mega-billion-dollar industry designed to make us want what they're selling. But there's a subtle message being conveyed. In a word, it's dis-satisfaction, and it eats away at us by creating a desire for bigger, better, more. The Bible says, 'We...brought nothing into the world, so we cannot take anything out...If we have food and covering...be content' (1 Timothy 6:7-8 NAS). 
So does satisfaction mean not setting goals or aiming higher? Does it mean not enjoying nice things? No, it just means not letting all those nice things 'own' you. Paul said, '...I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want.' (Philippians 4:12 NIV).  Paul mastered the art of enjoying whatever came along by learning to say, 'That's not essential. I can live without it.' His focus was right on target. He held every earthly 'thing' loosely. So should you!

How many times have you seen gameshow contestants buzz in to answer before the end of the question and find they've got it wrong? Life can be the same. 'Foot-in-mouth disease' or speaking before we think, is a hugely common thing and the truth is, sometimes we all do it! How many friends have you upset by answering a question too quickly, maybe because you could have put the answer in a slightly nicer way or simply because you didn't let them finish?! 
The book of Proverbs is full of what can seem like obvious wisdom, so why don't we put it into practice? People and relationships are important. Taking your time to listen to a question fully and thinking through your answer is a really great way to improve your social skills and relationships. Remember, real listening involves more than keeping your own mouth shut. You actually need to pay attention, make sure you're really understanding what's being said and carefully think through your response.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...&quot;HE HAS SCATTERED ABROAD HIS GIFTS TO THE POOR...&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 9:9 NIV</span><br>Giving, particularly when you're young, can be tough to do. As little kids we don't need to give, we just demand everything we want and need and most of the time we get it. But where's that changeover point? At what age do we stop demanding our rights from our parents and family and start to think about what we can give to others? It's interesting that the Bible doesn't seem to think there is an age thing. It simply tells us we should give; especially to the poorest of the poor. 
'He has scattered abroad his gifts to the poor; his righteousness endures forever.' At first you may wonder what on earth that's about. A lot! God is totally committed to loving and healing a hurting world, and the most exciting part is He's got a part for little old you to play in that plan. God's concerned about the poor and making sure that everyone gets a chance to hear the amazing news of the gospel. And He has chosen you to be a part of His strategy to take care of this messed up world; what an opportunity! Can you really believe that God doesn't want to just do it all Himself, He wants to partner with you?
So think today about what part God wants you to play. Think you have no cash? How about off loading some old computer games on ebay, or maybe run a sponsored event to do what you can. There are a thousand great causes to give to, just ask God which one He wants you to partner with Him on.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>JOSEPH DREAMED A DREAM...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 37:5 NIV</span><br>Pursue the dream God has given you no matter how crazy it may seem, because dreams are like your children; they're the joy of your present and the hope of your future. Protect them. Feed them. Encourage them to grow, for as long as you have a dream you'll never be old. 
Joseph was betrayed by his family, wrongly imprisoned and accused of trying to seduce his boss's wife... but despite all this Joseph's dream carried him all the way to his destiny as ruler of Egypt. Remember, we're talking about God-given dreams that lead to God-honouring results, not selfish ambition. Paul writes, 'Long before we first heard of Christ...He had...designs on us for glorious living...' (Ephesians 1:11-12 TM). God has a dream for you and if you want Him to and you're willing to go for it He'll reveal it to you. When He does, remember three things: 
1) Dreams are specific and personal, not public and general. God won't give somebody else your dream, He'll give it to you. He may confirm it through others, but He'll reveal it to you. When He does, don't share it with the wrong people or you'll get hurt. Like Joseph's brothers, they won't be able to handle it, especially if it doesn't include them
2) Dreams are usually a bit beyond belief. Often your dream will make sensible people say, 'You've got to be kidding!' Remember, that's their opinion, not God's; with Him 'all things are possible' 
3) Dreams separate winners from losers. Dreamers are always a minority. Those who walk by sight will always outnumber those who walk by faith. So today, follow your God-given dream.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...FAITH WITHOUT WORKS IS DEAD.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JAMES 2:20 KJV</span><br>When you dream you move closer to the way God sees things; you see beyond your limitations; you move from where you are to where He wants you to be; you begin to see your goals in their completed state. The question isn't 'can you dream', but 'do you have the courage to act on it'? If your dream doesn't stretch you to the point of discomfort it's probably not of God. What's more, God won't miraculously lift you out of your dream and land you in the middle of it happening. The children of Israel dreamed of living in the Promised Land but the only way to get there was through the wilderness and that took 40 years! In the wilderness they learned to a) trust God daily for the food they needed b) discovered His power in the Red Sea dead end fiasco c) be led by Him when there are no sign posts d) get up every morning with their eyes fixed on their dream and moved steadily towards it e) refuse to become like those who complain and never make it out of the wilderness.
Now for a warning: someone will always try to steal your dream. Always! Often it'll be someone who never had their own dream, or if they did they abandoned it. It could even be a family member who reminds you of what God couldn't or wouldn't do through someone like you. What do you dream about? What has God let you see that doesn't yet exist? You'll never out-dream God! For: '...By His mighty power at work within us, He is able to accomplish infinitely more than we would ever dare to ask or hope' (Ephesians 3:20 NLT).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...DON'T BE SURPRISED...THAT YOU ARE GOING THROUGH TESTING...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 PETER 4:12 CEV</span><br>Have you ever had a teacher tell you at the beginning of a school term that there would be tests without any warning?' Maybe you didn't like it, but at least you know to be prepared by doing your homework and completing your coursework on time. As unfair as it seemed you knew the tests were coming so you couldn't say you hadn't been warned. God operates on the same principle. His Word says, 'Don't be surprised...that you are going through testing.' Now, God's tests aren't necessarily ones you'd have chosen for yourself because they never seem to come at the right time and always seem to be on a subject you're worst at! That's because they're not for the teacher's benefit, they're for yours! The tests of life are designed to sharpen us mentally and strengthen us spiritually. When tests come, and they will, you've got two choices. One: act like a victim, moan, mope about and complain that you've been singled out and that life's 'just not fair'. Two: let them teach you more about yourself and the God you serve.  
Often when we're in the middle of being tested it can feel like there's no way we can possibly get through it! But here's a comforting thought: God will never give you more than you can handle, or a test you can't pass. His Word says He'll '...never let you down...let you be pushed past your limit; He'll always be there to help you...' (1 Corinthians 10:13 TM). So the Word 4U 2day is; be prepared! The test could come at anytime.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>PAY...YOUR DEBTS...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 13:8 NLT </span><br>Every week a little boy used to go to church with his Grandma and every week after church they would call at the corner shop and buy an ice cream. One day his Grandma was unwell so she sent the boy to church by himself with two pound coins - one for the offering and the other for an ice cream. On the way the boy crossed an old wooden bridge and decided to jump up and down to shake it. He heard a clunk as one of the pound coins fell from his pocket into the water. 'O well' the boy said, 'there goes God's pound!' 
Despite what we may passionately sing on a Sunday morning, for most of us God takes second place. Like the little boy in the story, what we need or want it usually a higher priority than say the offering plate at church. God promises to supply all our needs but the problem is that most of us confuse what we need with what we want! In the world we live in it's easy to get money. Many young people reach 18 and find that in a very short space of time they have managed to run up all sorts of debt. That's why it's important that today you get your priorities straight and figure out what God would have you do with your money. 
The Bible says: a) '...restrain yourself! Riches disappear in the blink of an eye...' (Proverbs 23:4-5 TM) b) 'Honour God with everything...give him the first and...best' (Proverbs 3:9 TM) c) 'Don't be obsessed with getting more...things...' (Hebrews 13:5 TM). Are you getting the message?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...YOU BELONG HERE...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 2:19 TM</span><br>Ever notice when somebody sins or screws up in an area that we struggle with, we're quick to give thanks that Jesus' blood covers all our sins! But if that person happens to fail in an area where we're strong, often our first thought is to think they're a bit rubbish and want to stop them being easily forgiven. 
Sin affects each of us differently according to our background and personality. But regardless of the symptoms it's the same disease, and there's only one remedy - the blood of Jesus. Without that we're all in trouble; black, white, rich, poor, homosexual, heterosexual, drug addict and alcoholic alike. Jesus' blood is the only thing that makes forgiveness and a clean slate possible, regardless of what we've done. The Bible says that Jesus 'created...a fresh start for everybody...through his death...Christ came and preached peace to...outsiders and...insiders...treated us as equals...through Him we...have equal access to the Father...You belong here, with as much right to the name Christian as anyone...He's using us all - irrespective of how we got here...' (Ephesians 2:15-20 TM) Don't for a second think that you have unlimited access to God's mercy and forgiveness, then deny that same access to someone else! The Bible says, 'If someone falls into sin, forgivingly restore him, saving your critical comments for yourself.' Why? Because, '...You might be needing forgiveness before the day's out' (Galations 6:1 TM). In other words, don't burn the bridge you yourself might need to cross some day. If you've secretly got an 'I'm better than them' attitude about somebody else's failures today, you need to say sorry and allow the blood of Jesus to cleanse you.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...HIS BLOOD...MAKES OUR CONSCIENCES CLEAR...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HEBREWS 9:14 CEV</span><br>God designed blood to deliver oxygen and nutrition to your cells; without it your limbs and organs die. Your blood flows around the body giving life to the different parts. Paul says, 'A body is made up of many parts, and each...has its own use. That's how it is with us...we...are...part of the body of Christ, as well as...of one another' (Romans 12:4-5 CEV). If we are parts of the body, the life-giving blood belongs to Jesus.  No matter who you are, what you do or what part you play, we all need the blood of Jesus to cleanse our sins and bring life. A doctor will do a blood test to prove who a child's father is and in the same way the blood of Jesus proves He is our Father which makes us '...no longer a slave but God's own child. And since you are his child, everything he has belongs to you.' (Galatians 4:7 NLT). 
Satan hates the blood because not only does it save us, it '...[purifies] our hearts from deeds that lead to death...' (Hebrews 9:14 NLT). One Christian teacher writes: 'We've toned down our teaching of the blood...We've learned about the Spirit...but failed to teach about the blood. Consequently we've produced a generation of believers who are empowered by the Spirit but don't feel forgiven...They're exercising spiritual gifts, but living in guilt...The blood must be preached. Without it we've no life.' So let's emphasize the power of the blood. Why? '...Without the...blood, there is no forgiveness of sins...' (Hebrews 9:22 NLT).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE TONGUE OF THE WISE MAKES KNOWLEDGE ACCEPTABLE...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 15:2 NIV</span><br>Did you hear about the husband who was totally clueless? The day his wife left on a business trip their dog died. That night she called home and he blurted out, 'Your dog's dead!' Angry with him for being insensitive she said, 'You should've broken it to me gently. You could have said, &quot;The dog's on the roof.&quot; Then next day added, &quot;He fell off.&quot; The following day you could've said, &quot;He's at the vet.&quot; And the day after that you could have told me he died.' While her husband paused to consider this she asked, 'By the way, how's my mother?'  Cautiously he replied, 'Well dear...she's on the roof!' One dictionary definition of tact is: skill in situations where people's feelings need to be considered...an intuitive sense of what's right or appropriate. Whatever you may have been led to believe, tact is not about being deceptive or insincere. It's about being considerate and not hurting others unnecessarily. 
A bloke once wrote: 'I used to sell shoes years ago... a seasoned employee told me never to say, &quot;Lady, your foot's too big for this shoe!&quot; Instead I should say, &quot;I'm sorry, ma'am, but this shoe's just a little too small for your foot.&quot;' Both expressed the facts, but one was an insult...the other a tactful compliment.' A number of people are of the opinion that telling the truth means that no tact is needed, just the bare facts. But, in sensitive situations engage your brain before opening your mouth. Remember, 'Reckless words pierce like a sword, but the tongue of the wise brings healing,' and 'makes knowledge acceptable.'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...AS THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD WORKS WITHIN US, WE BECOME MORE AND MORE LIKE HIM.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 3:18 TLB</span><br>Did you hear about the frog that fell into a big hole and couldn't get out? Several of his friends tried to help but finally gave up. 'As you're gonna be there for a while...' they said, '...we'll go and get some food.' But no sooner had they left than the frog came hopping up behind them. 'We thought you couldn't get out!' they exclaimed. 'Oh, I couldn't,' he replied, 'but suddenly there was a big truck coming right at me - and I discovered I could.' Usually it's only when we're forced to change that we discover we can. That's because we're more comfortable with old problems than trying out new solutions. The saying goes 'there's a first time for everything' but if you don't believe and live like it, you'll never see anything done - and nothing will change.
There are three times in our lives when we're most likely to change: 
1) When our pain levels get so high we're forced to 
2) When we accept the fact that what we're doing no longer works. 
3) When we realise that by God's grace we can change. Nothing builds our faith to change more than the sudden realisation that 'I don't have to stay this way anymore.' And you don't! Stand on these two Scriptures: '...God'[s]...gracious Word can make you into what he wants you to be and give you everything you could possibly need...' (Acts 20:32 TM): '...as the spirit of the Lord works within us, we become more and more like Him' (2 Corinthians 3:18 TLB). So, do you want to change?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS...TO TELL PEOPLE...ABOUT GOD'S GRACE</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ACTS 20:24 NCV</span><br>Billy Graham was born in Charlotte, North Carolina to hard-working parents. When he was a teenager some Christian businessmen held a prayer meeting in his father's farm. When somebody asked, 'Who are those men making all that noise?' Billy replied, 'Fanatics who talked daddy into using the place.' That day a businessman called Vernon Patterson asked God to raise up somebody from Charlotte to 'preach the Gospel to the ends of the earth.' Billy just didn't know he'd be the one! Later, evangelist Mordecai Ham came to town for an evangelistic crusade, and although Billy vowed not to attend, he ended up going and giving his life to Christ. A few years later Paul's words captured Billy's heart: 'The most important thing is...to tell people...about God's grace.' Billy Graham has preached to more people than anyone else in history. He's been welcomed on every continent - no matter how anti-Christian the country may be. Yet he says, 'The first thing I'm gonna do when I get to heaven is ask, &quot;Why me Lord? Why'd you choose a farm boy from North Carolina to preach to so many people?'' Billy Graham's life proves that in God's eyes the greatest ability is - availability.	
Paul writes: '...the kindness of God has been poured out upon us...and now He is sending us...to tell...people everywhere the great things God has done...so that they, too, will believe...' (Romans 1:5 TLB). And God has also called you 'to tell...so they too will believe!' Don't worry about closing the deal; they'll come when God draws them. Just tell them the story - and let God do the rest.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...I NEVER KNEW YOU, GO AWAY...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 7:23 NLT</span><br>The most important relationship you will ever have for the rest of your life is the one you have with God Himself. It's one you will be in for all eternity and it's the very reason you were created in the first place. So the question is, on a busy day when your mum wants to chat about school and your friend calls to invite you round but your youth club is about to start, which relationship is dropped first? Would it even cross your mind that you've spent no time with God today?
For centuries Bible boffins have argued the question about at what point someone gets 'saved' and whether you can lose your place in heaven once you've got it. The truth of the matter is, on the final day when you're stood face to face with Jesus, the simple question will be 'do you know me?' You see it doesn't matter what we've done, what we've said and possibly even whether once upon a time we prayed the right sequence of words in a 'sinners prayer'. The question is do you have a real relationship with Jesus? When you look into someone's eyes, you both know whether or not you have a relationship. There's only two of you, you can't fake it or pretend you have if you've not. Nothing needs to be said, you both know exactly where you stand.   
So remember, you can busy yourself here and look like a fantastic Christian on paper but it's all about you and Jesus, nothing else matters. So make that your priority today. Get to know Jesus just for the sake of knowing Him. Hang out with Him, chat with Him, sing with Him, laugh with Him, cry with Him, but, whatever you do, get to know Him!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>BE...HUMBLE AND GENTLE. BE PATIENT WITH EACH OTHER, MAKING ALLOWANCE FOR EACH OTHER'S FAULTS BECAUSE OF YOUR LOVE</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 4:2 NLT</span><br>Your peer group will probably have more influence on your actions than any other group of people. They are your friends, your enemies, your girl or boyfriend, your support network, your encouragers, your competition, and, very often, the people who's opinion counts most. You will wear what they wear, talk how they talk and do what they say. These relationships matter. 
The people you choose to be your friends will have a massive impact on your life. How they act and how you treat them will determine what kind of group of friends you end up with. Choose your friends very carefully. So often we fall into the trap of hanging out with those it's most convenient to see, but ask yourself this, that group may be convenient but are they good for you? Friends should be there to love, to encourage, to support and to build you up. A group of people who constantly knock you down and hinder your faith are not people you should be with. The Apostle Paul wrote 'Be humble and gentle. Be patient with each other, making allowance for each other's faults because of your love' (Ephesians 4:2 NLT). 
Make a list of some of the qualities that are important to you in a friendship. Now think about your current friendship group. Your challenge for today is to find a 'dream team'. Identify some people of any age who you know will be good for you; people who can challenge you but in the right way. They should be humble, gentle, patient and loving and arrange to spend some time with those people!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>DO EVERYTHING WITHOUT COMPLAINING OR ARGUING</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PHILIPPIANS 2:14 NIV</span><br>Do you find it hard to do what you're told? Being asked to do something you don't really want to do is a real pain in the neck and most of us are so independent that we want to react with a big fat 'NO!' Respecting the authority of people above you, can be really tough, especially if you don't really like them. But, doing as you're asked totally honours God. The Bible talks about doing everything as though you're doing it for God; this includes the washing up!  
It's also worth remembering that the people in authority over you, particularly Church Leaders will have to answer for the way they treat you. This means if you're asked to do something by someone in a position of authority and you think it's out of order, make sure you do as God has asked; 'do everything without complaining or arguing' (Philippians 2:14 NIV). 
So what about the people under your authority? You may be thinking 'But there aren't any...'  But if you know people younger than you, or have little brothers or sisters, then you need to watch how you treat those people! No matter what you think those kids will look up to you as a role model. They will learn from you, copy your behaviour and be very hurt when you get bored with them and start blanking them in the street! Treat those kids with love and respect. Imagine you were in their shoes, how would you want you to be treated?   Remember, you have to answer for how you treat those kids too!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>MAY...GOD...GIVE YOU A SPIRIT OF UNITY...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 15:5 NIV</span><br>Are you a people watcher? If you spend an hour sat on a bench watching the world go by, what is it you think about people? A few years ago the launch of 'Big Brother' started a national phenomenon of reality TV shows, and we just can't get enough! But who came up with the idea that watching a bunch of people stuck inside a house for ten weeks could possibly be entertaining? Yet it seems every week there's a new show with a new angle where we can watch people try to dance, sing, ice skate or even survive the jungle! 
We love to watch other people's lives and relationships - because it's easy! We can joke about their problems, discuss their arguments and laugh out loud at totally broken and hurting celebrities crying in the diary room! We don't need to be involved or support these people, so we don't care. 
But real life's not like that. Life is all about relationships, whether it's with your best mate, the school bully or your cat! These relationships are not a joke and not something for us to laugh about and switch off when we're bored. God created us to be in relationship with one another and with Him. We were told to love one another, no matter who that one another is! Sure relationships are hard work, they can hurt us and cause all sorts of strong emotions but when they are good, strong and healthy there is nothing better in the world than to be united in God! Over the next few days we're going to look at our relationships and what God thinks about them.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WHATEVER YOU DO, WORK AT IT WITH ALL YOUR HEART, AS WORKING FOR THE LORD, NOT FOR MEN.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>COLOSSIANS 3:23 NIV</span><br>
When Nicholas Herman entered the Carmelite monastery in Paris in 1666, he expected to live a life of penance (self-punishment) because of his wild and sinful past. But instead Herman, who was given a new name - Brother Lawrence, found God's forgiveness and peace, plus a happiness he could never have imagined. But his faith was majorly stretched in the process. Clumsy by nature, he was pretty annoyed at being assigned to the monastery kitchen. Then something happened. There in the grotty kitchen he found that even the crappiest jobs become enjoyable; when they're done out of love for God! In his classic little book, The Practice of the Presence of God, he wrote: 'The time of business does not with me differ from the time of prayer...in the noise and clatter of my kitchen while several persons are at the same time calling for different things, I possess God in as great tranquility as if I were upon my knees...We ought not to be weary of doing little things, for God regards not the greatness of the work but the love with which it is performed.' 
So, what's the job you hate most? Cutting the grass? Putting out the bin out? Walking the dog? Washing the pots? Keeping your room tidy? Looking after a younger brother or sister? Homework?!! Paul said, 'Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart as working for the Lord, not for men' (Colossians 3:23 NIV). The truth is, there's no difference between being a binman or a supermodel when it's done 'as working for the Lord, not for men.'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WE SHOULD MAKE PLAN - COUNTING ON GOD TO DIRECT US.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 16:9 TLB</span><br>There are several reasons why we fail to set goals for our lives: 
1) We haven't been taught why it's important.
2) We don't know how to go about it. 
3) We are afraid of failing. If we don't have a goal there's no guilt or embarrassment over not reaching it. 
4) We feel put off by previous failures. 
Solomon wrote: 'We should make plans - counting on God to direct us.' Jesus said: '&quot;Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Will he not first sit down and estimate the cost to see if he has enough money to complete it?&quot;' (Luke 14:28 NIV). Goal setting takes time, discipline, courage and stickability. Between you and your goal there'll be roadblocks, enemy attacks and temptations designed to derail and throw you off track.  'So, what should I do': 
a) Talk to God. Get into agreement with His will for you
b) Write your goals down. The shortest pencil is better than the longest memory. God told the prophet, 'Write the vision, and make it plain...' (Habakkuk 2:2 KJV). Without written goals you have no compass and you can get swept off course 
c) Focus on your top goals. If you attempt everything you'll accomplish nothing. Remember, a big success is simply several little successes strung together 
d) Be alert to those God sends into your life to help you fulfil His purposes. Draw on the wisdom of experienced people; stand on their shoulders. Even your critics can sharpen you. God has a plan for your life; seek Him and He'll reveal it to you!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...WHAT WE WILL BE HAS NOT YET BEEN MADE KNOWN...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 JOHN 3:2 NIV</span><br>Today you might be feeling like, 'My life is so messed up at the moment.' John replies: 'Now we are children of God, what we will be has not yet been known.' Have you ever been to a building site? It looks like anything but a building, doesn't it? That's because 'what we will be has not YET been made known.' But bit-by-bit under the architect's supervision, bricks, beams and piles of sand start taking shape.
You may be a mess right now. In fact if the church is doing its job there should be lots of messy people in it: people being pulled out of rough situations, people in the process of being restored. No baby comes out of the womb clean and dressed up; birth is painful and messy. But the good news is you have been spiritually reborn. You are under construction. There is a plan and purpose behind what's going on in your life. Things will come together. You see, when Christ comes into your life your spirit is immediately changed, but your emotions, appetites and attitudes still need work - lots of it. In each of us there are areas that need to be corrected and redirected. And until they are we struggle to handle them. Those who say, 'If you were really a Christian you wouldn't act like that,' tend to forget that falling down is just part of learning to walk. You can know what to do yet struggle to do it. Relax! God is at work in your life. He won't give up on you!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>MOSES WAS...MORE HUMBLE THAN ANYONE ELSE ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>NUMBERS 12:3 NIV</span><br>It took 40 years of living like a shepherd (and oh, how the Egyptians despised shepherds!) to sort out Moses' ego. Only then, at age 80, was he ready to live life on God's terms. The Moses who emerged from the desert was very different from the Moses who entered it. It's our desert experiences that keep our egos in check. Without them, we start believing our own hype and get into trouble. God told King Saul, '[When]...you were [little] in your own eyes [I was able to use you...]' (paraphrase see 1 Samuel 15:17 NIV). When Colonel Samuel Logan Brengle of The Salvation Army was once introduced as 'the great Colonel Brengle' he wrote in his journal: 'If I appear great in their eyes, the Lord is most gracious in helping me to see how absolutely nothing I am without him. He does use me. But I'm so conscious that He uses me, and that it's not of me that the work is done. The axe cannot boast of the trees it has cut down. It could do nothing without the woodsman. He made it, he sharpened it, he used it, and the moment he throws it aside it becomes only old used iron. Oh, that I may never lose sight of this.'
A young English man once came to live in the community led by Gandhi. When assigned to clean toilets, he protested, 'Don't you know who I am? I have great things to do.' Gandhi replied, 'I know you can do great things; what I don't know is if you can do little things.' Check your ego!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...HE HAD COMPASSION ON THEM AND HEALED THEIR SICK.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 14:14 NIV</span><br>Before you congratulate yourself on having your emotions in check, understand that there's another side to the coin - you can have control but no compassion - you can get worked up about human suffering but not do anything. James talks about the people who are churchgoers, who feel sorry for others but don't act. They see the pain and unmet needs of people. They have the ability to do something about it. They feel sorry but they walk away muttering about being too busy. Or they try to relieve their conscience with a token gift. James says, '...faith without works is dead' (James 2:20 KJV) If we are not responsible, who is? If we don't do something, who will? 
You're only disciplining your emotions; if you translate them into responsible action. And your 'somebody ought to do something about this' rants won't get YOU off the hook. William Barclay wrote: 'There is nothing more dangerous than the repeated experience of a fine emotion with no attempt to put it into action. It is a fact that every time a man feels a noble impulse without taking action, he becomes less likely ever to take action. In a sense it is true to say that a man has no right to feel sympathy, unless he at least tries to put that sympathy into action. An emotion is not something in which to luxuriate (enjoy as a luxury); it is something which at the cost of effort and of toil, of discipline and of sacrifice, must be turned into the stuff of life.' That just about says it all doesn't it?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>DON'T BE ANGRY OR FURIOUS. ANGER CAN LEAD TO SIN</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 37:8 CEV</span><br>Mike Singleterry, who played for the Chicago Bears American Football team, was a star player - and a Christian. One day, however, while they were losing, the hometown fans got really aggressive and started dissing him. He didn't like it. The TV cameras trained on Singleterry's face as he glowered at the crowd. Suddenly he lost his temper and started toward the stands, shouting back. It wasn't his finest hour. But after the game may have been one of Mike's finest hours. That's when he met with the press and apologized. No excuses, no blaming: just an apology. His emotions had got out of control and he took responsibility. Perhaps Singleterry had read these words: 'A man's wisdom gives him patience; it is to his glory to overlook an offence' (Proverbs 19:11 NIV). As you go through life people will offend you. Sometimes it will be deliberate, other times they won't even realize. The question is; what are you going to do about it? 
Spiritually mature people discipline their emotions and make sure they accurately reflect reality. They can be sad, joyful, angry or elated in appropriate ways at appropriate times. They refuse to allow their emotions to determine their actions, attitude, or choices. One Christian author writes: 'When I feel things going against me, when feelings of anger and resentment begin to rise it's time to stop and ask what's happening. Is this for the greater good, or not? Is God speaking to me, or isn't He? Will my flesh rule this moment, or my spirit?' That's good advice for you too!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...CAIN, &quot;WHY ARE YOU ANGRY?&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 4:6 NIV</span><br>Unless you learn to control your emotions you'll lose credibility, push people away, and miss great opportunities. Your emotions are like a car: properly understood and directed it can take you places; out of control it can destroy you. When God asked Cain, 'Why are you angry with your brother?' He was saying: 'Listen up, Cain! Your emotions are sending you a message. If you don't get a handle on this you'll create a mess you won't be able to live with. Yes, you'll repent and regret it, but you won't be able to undo it.' But Cain wouldn't listen. The situation seemed unfair; he felt unappreciated. He thought his brother's blessing had come at his expense. What emotions were at work here? Jealousy. Resentment. Competitiveness. Feeling like the victim. These unchecked forces caused him to murder his brother Abel and cross a line he couldn't come back from.
Most of us have a knee jerk reaction that isn't necessarily controlled by the rational or sensible side of our brain. It reacts to people and events, and like a sudden storm rises with strength from within, sometimes overwhelming us. The author Gordon McDonald writes: 'I used to pride myself on the fact that I kept my emotions to myself. I never saw myself as an angry person...Then I got married and my wife informed me that I had plenty of anger after all. While it rarely came out in words it showed itself in full colour in facial expressions (the gift of glare, we called it) I never knew I had. I had work to do. I had emotions that needed to be disciplined.' How about you?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>HE MUST BECOME GREATER; I MUST BECOME LESS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 3:30 NIV</span><br>The Bible describes the call of God as '...the high calling...' (Philippians 3:14 KJV). Yet the higher your calling takes you the lower you must become in your own eyes. That means taking all the big-ups and praise that comes your way and passing them on to God. Jesus said of John the Baptist, '...there is not a greater prophet...' (Luke 7:28 KJV). Yet John said of Jesus, 'He must become greater, I must become less.' When God called Ezekiel to be someone who would speak his words to the people he felt so inadequate that he fell on his face and God had to say, '...stand up on your feet, and I will speak to you' (Ezekiel 2:1 NIV). 
Paul had something tricky in his life that he struggled to cope with, he called it '...a thorn in the flesh...' (2 Corinthians 12:7 NIV). We don't know exactly what the 'thorn' in Paul's life was but we know why he had it. '...so I won't get a big head...' (2 Corinthians 12:7 TM). Paul also writes: 'It is not that we think we can do anything of lasting value by ourselves. Our only power and success come from God' (2 Corinthians 3:5 NLT). Being humble isn't saying 'oh I'm rubbish, I can't do anything' It's when we know that our gifts come from God and even with those gifts we need His help. If we do things without God, even the things we are good at, it doesn't take long before we can't handle it. 'First pride, then the crash - the bigger the ego, the harder the fall' (Proverbs 16:18 TM). It's our neediness that forces us to rely on God for strength. That's a difficult concept for our ego to accept! But when we do, we become effective in His service.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>PUT ON THE WHOLE ARMOUR OF GOD...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 6:11 NIV</span><br>The devil isn't going to send you a congratulations card because you've decided to live for Jesus. No, every chance he gets he's going to attack you. 'Attack me where?' In your areas of vulnerability! 'But I don't believe in the devil' you say. He'll be glad to hear that; he does his best work in disguise.
Paul writes, 'Put on the whole armour of God, that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes' (Ephesians 6:11 NIV). Notice the words, 'that you can take your stand.' The armour is God's; the stand is yours! God's armour is for those who are willing to stand for what's important; like the salvation of your family, the success of your friendships, your walk with God, or anything else that's of value to you. The message is clear: suit up, stand up and hold your ground! Pay particular attention to Paul's words in Ephesians 6:17: 'Take...the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.' The sword referred to here is a large dagger used for fighting at close range. Understand this: some days you'll have to go toe-to-toe with the devil. To defeat him you'll need to know how to use God's Word, which is described as '...living...Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates...it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart' (Hebrews 4:12 NIV). Your Bible can determine with pinpoint accuracy what's going on in your life. When you come face to face with the devil it's the only weapon capable of rendering him powerless. So, prepare for attack by living in God's Word!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>&quot;...I WILL PERSONALLY GO WITH YOU, MOSES. I WILL GIVE YOU REST...&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EXODUS 33:14 NLT</span><br>Has success brought pressures you can't cope with? Has the thing you got proper excited about yesterday got you all stressed out today? We think we know what we want - usually because we see it in somebody else's life. But God knows what we need - what we can live with and not fall apart. Children don't know what they don't need. Their favourite word is 'gimme.' When we're tiny and don't get something we want, we stomp our feet and throw a fit. When we're in our teens and don't get our own way, we rebel and scream, 'You're ruining my life!' When we're older and wiser (and even get our own kids) we start to understand why Mum and Dad said no. When God says no it's because He sees down the road. Sometimes we do get what we want but watch out! 
Here are some harsh words for want-it-alls: '...they believed His words...But it wasn't long before they forgot the whole thing...[they] wouldn't wait...They only cared about pleasing themselves in that desert, provoked God with their insistent demands. He gave them exactly what they asked for--but along with it they got an empty heart' (Psalm 106:12-15 TM). They got what they wanted, but they didn't grow spiritually. That's a battle you'll fight too! Do you feel empty? Or spiritually dry? Are you so busy thinking about what God can give you that you are forgetting the giver? Sometimes we need to wait. Don't rush ahead trying to get what you want without God. Wait for Him and God will go with you.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...THE KINDNESS OF GOD LEADS...TO REPENTANCE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 2:4 NAS</span><br>We live a world where the better you do the bigger the reward! For example, football clubs will give their players a bonus if they win their match with extra cash given to anyone who scores a goal - which is a good job because they don't get paid much, so every little helps!!! 
Loads of people think this is how God works too. They think that if they do the right things then they have 'earned their place in heaven.' Maybe it's getting christened, and once they've been 'done' they are sorted. Maybe it's 'living a good life' or even 'going to church'. But God doesn't dish out bonus places for heaven to everyone who performs well or does the right things. We could never DO enough to be saved. Jesus has done everything. He has scored all the goals and won all the matches, we just get the rewards. Isn't that amazing! 
 Paul says, '...the kindness of God leads...to repentance.' Notice, he didn't say the scare tactics of a preacher or people in churches looking down their noses. No, genuine repentance (changing our lives) is our response to the unconditional love of a perfect God. Who loved us before we loved Him. When you encounter a Saviour like that, you want to please Him. It's like the footy team getting all their bonuses before they even played but then running their hearts out on the pitch because they are grateful to play for such a great club. 
Today live a life for God not because it will get you anything but because you've already been given it!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>..LET US NOT LOVE WITH WORDS...BUT WITH ACTIONS...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 JOHN 3:18 NIV </span><br>
'James and John (the sons of Zebedee, but Jesus nicknamed them &quot;Sons of Thunder&quot;)' (Mark 3:17 NLT). You can imagine a 80s heavy band being called 'SONS OF THUNDER' but why did Jesus give his two mates this nickname? They were fishermen not weathermen. In the gospels James and John come across as being hardcore, fired up, passionate, 100% committed but maybe didn't have a lot of time for anyone who wasn't as mad for it as they were. Check what Luke says:
'...The people of the village refused to have anything to do with Jesus... When James and John heard about it, they said to Jesus, &quot;Lord, should we order down fire from heaven to burn them up&quot;' (Luke 9:53-54 NLT). Jesus pulls them up on this, they had lots of zeal but not much love.  John's nickname changes over time and later he is known as the apostle of Love. Had John gone soft? Had the 'son of thunder' downgraded to become a brother of breeze? His nickname might have changed but John was still just as hardcore! Check this out what he says about loving others:
'If anyone says, &quot;I love God&quot; yet hates his brother, he is a liar...' (1 John 4:20 NLT) - wow John, tell us what you really think! Don't beat abound the bush!  John is passionate about Christians living lives of love and words aren't enough! Jesus didn't just say 'God loves you' he put those words into action and '...laid down his life for us...' (1 John 3:16 NIV). Today put some words into action. Don't just say I love God or even I love others, do something about it!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>&quot;I HAVE LOVED YOU EVEN AS THE FATHER HAS LOVED ME. REMAIN IN MY LOVE&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 15:9 NLT</span><br>Ever met someone who is so obsessed with something they don't stop talking about it? Maybe it's a new boyfriend, or a football team, a band or a computer game. John was obsessed with LOVE. In the one gospel, three letters and not forgetting the book of Revelation - all written by John - he writes the word LOVE one hundred and one times! He even got known as the apostle of love. Why? Because LOVE changed him. In his gospel he calls himself 'the one Jesus loved'. Was he being big headed? No, John had simply been blown away by the unconditional, no strings attached, undeserving love that Jesus had shown him - and shows everyone. Jesus had shown John what love looks like, and John was hooked! 
'...so we know and rely on the love that God has for us. God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in Him' (1 John 4:16 NIV). No wonder John thinks love is so important! He knew love wasn't just an emotion or something that made God do kind things every now and then. He knew that love summed up the very nature of God, describing who God is: GOD IS LOVE. John even says this: 'Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love' (1 John 4:8 NIV). Think about that for a second, if you don't love then you don't know God! That's why John is so obsessed with love: 
1) Because God '...first loved us' (1 John 4:19 NIV) 
2) Because he wants to remain in God's love (John 15:9 NIV) 
3) Because he wants to know God by loving others (1 John 4:8 NIV). 
So how's your love life?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>YOU...KNOW ALL ABOUT MY TEACHING, MY WAY OF LIFE, MY PURPOSE, FAITH, PATIENCE, LOVE, ENDURANCE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 TIMOTHY 3:10 NIV</span><br>Living a disciplined and controlled life does three things for you: 
1) It strengthens you on the inside! Discipline doesn't make you some geek, it makes you strong. It provides you with shock absorbers for the potholes of life. And there will be lots of them. It enlarges your ability to summon up courage when life gets tough. Look at Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego: the blokes who refused to bow to a pagan king's statue even when threatened with a fiery furnace: '&quot;...the God we serve is able to save us from it...But even if He does not...we will not serve your gods...&quot;' (Daniel 3:17-18 NIV). All of their lives these guys had toughened themselves through discipline, in order to face such a supreme moment of test. And you'll face that moment too! 
2) It brings your gifts to their highest level of effectiveness. 'How do you get to be number 1?' is a question every wannabe sports star or musician would ask their hero. Answer: 'You practice, practice, practice.' David's first victory wasn't over Goliath. His years of practice as a shepherd defending his sheep against wolves, a lion and a bear, had prepared him for this moment. It had given him the spirit and the skill needed to take on the Philistine champion. 
3) It inspires others. Paul writes to Timothy, 'You...know all about my teaching, my way of life [living it is harder than teaching it], my purpose, faith, patience, love, endurance, persecutions, sufferings...' (2 Timothy 3:10 NIV). Paul's greatest gift to Timothy was the example of a disciplined life. Now Timothy had something to copy - a role model of excellent living. And there's no better gift!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>BUT MARY TREASURED UP ALL THESE THINGS AND PONDERED THEM IN HER HEART.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 2:19 NIV</span><br>After thoroughly washing their clothes, the old timers would wring as much water out of them as possible so they would dry quickly. There's a lesson there: growing in character and maturity calls for more than just letting life happen. No, it calls for wringing the wisdom out of each experience by asking, 'What's to be learned here? How could it have been done differently?' Check out the great chess players. They win because they think several moves ahead. 
Before doing something in life Wisdom asks, 'Where does this lead? What are the possible unintended consequences?' Wise people realise that what they do today will affect tomorrow. Wisdom comes from figuring out where things are going. Talk to people whose lives are lived purely on the surface and ask, 'Have you thought about...?' No, they haven't. 'Well, what do you think this will do to...?' They have no idea. 'Have you ever asked yourself what God...?' Never thought of that.
 'But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart.' This is a picture of someone who takes the time to wring out events and tests them for insight and understanding. Sooner or later Mary may have something to say, but when she says it her words will have substance. In days to come her family will have to flee from Herod's thugs and spend years living in exile in Egypt. All of this will demand courage, depth of spirit, and trust in the purposes of God. And that's what comes to a person like Mary, who takes time to 'wring' the wisdom out of the event.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WHEN I REFUSED TO CONFESS MY SIN, I WAS...MISERABLE...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 32:3 NLT</span><br>Are you holding on to sin? Are you refusing get issues sorted? David did, and he slipped into hell-deep depression. After having a seedy affair with Bathsheba he arranged to have her husband killed, then he married her - and his world caved in! 'I was...miserable.' What stops good people from cleaning up their act? Spiritual illusions! Damaging beliefs! See if you recognise any: 
1) Negative consequences are just part of life; they're not connected to my choices. 
2) God's much too forgiving to allow things to go wrong or allow me to experience pain just to get me to stop sinning. 
3) The enjoyment I get from my so-called sin outweighs the benefit of stopping. Anyway, my sin isn't really hurting anyone. 
4) I can't help myself. The problem goes back to my childhood, surely God understands that, so why would He discipline me?
5) Just because I sin doesn't mean I can't do something for God. Hey, God uses crooked sticks - we can't all be the Apostle Paul. 
6) Anyway it's not a sin, it's just a part of my personality that I struggle with. 
Do you see what you're really saying? 'My sin doesn't have consequences... God won't pursue this... I like my sin too much to give it up... I've convinced myself that I can't quit... My sin won't diminish my effectiveness... My problem isn't even a sin...' If this describes you, embrace the truth, sack off the lies that have kept you stuck in unnecessary pain and repent. Yes, repent and stop doing it! The moment you do you'll receive God's forgiveness - and the heaviness you're living under will lift!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I HAVE BROUGHT YOU GLORY ON EARTH BY COMPLETING THE WORK YOU GAVE ME TO DO.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 17: 4 NIV </span><br>Commenting upon the undisciplined life of the famous poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, William Barclay (a famous Bible boffin) writes: 'Never did so great a mind produce so little. He left Cambridge University to join the army; he left the army because he could not rub down a horse; he returned to Oxford and left without a degree. He began a newspaper called The Watchman, which lived for ten editions then died. It could be said of him &quot;He lost himself in visions of work to be done, that always remained to be done.&quot;
Jesus understood His mission and He never deviated from it. He refused to be the victim of peer pressure or the expectations of others. He sought the approval of one person only - His Father! Just before His ministry went public, He spent 40 days in the wilderness consulting with His Father. And don't forget the night He spent in prayer before choosing His 12 disciples. Finally, there was Gethsemane. 
Because Jesus was spiritually sharpened by moments alone with the Father, it was never difficult for Him to say 'no' to invitations and demands which might have looked good or acceptable to us. Here's a life-changing insight: you always have the time to do what God wants done. And you don't burn out in the process. You may not get done what you want done, or what others think needs done. But so what? Your goal should be to reach the end of life and say like Jesus, 'I have brought You glory on earth by completing the work You gave me to do.'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THIS IS THE ASSIGNED MOMENT FOR HIM TO MOVE INTO THE CENTRE...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 3:30 TM</span><br>When the crowds left John the Baptist to follow Jesus, he said: 'This is the assigned moment for him to move into the centre, while I slip off to the sidelines' (John 3:30 TM). 
John knew that the crowd leaving him for Christ was never his to begin with. God had simply placed them under his care for a period of time. For John this was just fine. 
John's view of the crowd presents us with an important principle. John could have said 'I'm a preacher, I NEED people to listen to me' or 'I'm the one who has done all the work why should He get all the credit'. But John knew that for Jesus to increase in the minds and hearts of the people, He must decrease. It was time to duck.  
Maybe you lead/or would like to lead worship. Maybe you're a preacher or performer. If God has given you gifts it can be easy to stand up and get noticed. But do you need to be noticed? Or do you see the gifts and opportunities God has given you as way of helping others get what they need...JESUS.
Even in the Church, with 'famous' preachers, bands and leaders it's easy to think that success is a big crowd, lots of people at your gig, church or festival. 
But what is success, as God counts success? It's when others hear you, but follow Jesus. It's when others see some quality in you that causes them to fall more in love with Him. Only when that happens, and you feel like you've lost nothing in the process, can you truly say, 'Father, I've done what you called me to do.'

<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>MY COMMAND IS THIS: LOVE EACH OTHER AS I HAVE LOVED YOU</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 15:12 NIV</span><br>There's an old French saying which goes like this: 'It is not only necessary to love, it is necessary to say so using words if we have to.' You know, Jesus is pretty serious about this love thing, He commands us to love. 'Yeah but Jesus... you've not met my brother!' This is what the Bible says about true love:
'Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous, it does not boast, and it is not proud.
Love is not rude, is not selfish, and does not get upset with others. Love does not count up wrongs that have been done. Love is not happy with evil but is happy with the truth. Love patiently accepts all things. It always trusts, always hopes, and always remains strong. Love never ends...' (1 Corinthians 13:4-8 NCV).
When we read those verses it is a real challenge to be able to swap the word love with your own name. Could you say that about yourself and your relationship with your family? Tough isn't it? Maybe you could start with the little things. If you normally wake up with a scowl and a grunt and trundle into the bathroom to find your mum has given you a clean towel, say thank you to her. Little things like this can change a whole person's day and make life more bearable for them. Make someone a cup of tea without being asked. Tidy your room, do your homework, put the bin out. You might make your mum cry - in a good way!

<title><![CDATA[FAMILY- HOUSE OF HONOURS ]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>HONOUR YOUR FATHER AND YOUR MOTHER...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EXODUS 20:12 NIV </span><br>What does it mean to honour someone? This is what the dictionary says: 'Honour: high respect, a feeling of pride or pleasure from being shown such respect, a person or thing that brings credit'
There are ways that we can honour and love our parents whilst recognising that they are far from perfect. It is possible to strongly disagree with someone about something and yet maintain a respectful attitude to them. God wants us to be able to love and respect those people who brought us into the world. If parents feel dishonoured or disrespected, they can make others around them miserable too: 'You never listen to me!'  'I'm fed up with being spoken to like that.' 'How dare you lie to me!' 'While you're under this roof you will do what I say!' Sound familiar?
Now, we may find loving our parents very difficult indeed. Particularly if we feel that they have ill-treated us or show some major failing. But honouring them is what we need to aim for. So as hard as it may be, we have to do something about it. It's kind of part of the deal. We all find it hard to be the perfect person to live with. And we also find it very easy to blame anyone/everyone else when things go wrong. Often we feel the solution to our family problems is that other people need to change. But the 'If she stopped doing that' or 'If only he didn't do this' may be just an excuse.  The Bible challenges us to be the one who changes. Would your family life be better if you loved your mum and dad differently?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>GOD PLACES THE LONELY IN FAMILIES...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 68:6 NLT</span><br>It's was a great idea for a TV show, stick a bunch of over pampered (but publicity hungry) celebs in a jungle and get them to eat bugs, swim through swamps and perform survival challenges. And the moment it gets too much they shout 'I'm a celebrity...get me out of here!'  We can sometimes feel like this with our families. How many times have you wanted to shout 'I'm a Teenager...get me out of here'  when you were with your family. When your dad is in a mood, your mum is pecking your head and your brother is winding you up: sometimes it's hard to imagine a good reason for having a family. 
When God created people he designed them to live in peace with Him and each other, but sin soon messed that up. Check out Genesis 4 to see the impact sin had on families. Anger, jealously, cruelty and scandal quickly become part of family life. It breaks God's heart when families act like this. God knows how this can damage lives and He offers His love and healing to anyone who lives with the wounds or scars of a broken and hurting family.
God knows that families can go wrong but He also knows they can work. They can protect us, teach us, love us and help us. God hasn't given up on family! It's so important to God that He has adopted us into His OWN family and calls us His children. He even tells the church to love each other like a family especially those who have lost or been let down by their own families. FAMILY IS IMPORTANT.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...BE ZEALOUS...AND...BE SO ALWAYS...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GALATIANS 4:18 NIV</span><br>Admiral Hyman Rickover, who was once head of the United States Nuclear Navy, personally interviewed every officer on board his nuclear submarines. Among them was former President-to-be Jimmy Carter. This is Carter's account of the interview: 'He looked straight into my eyes. He never smiled. I was saturated with cold sweat. Finally he asked a question and I thought I could redeem myself. 'How did you stand in your class at the Naval Academy?' I had done very well so I swelled my chest with pride and answered, 'Sir, I stood fifty-ninth out of a class of eight hundred and twenty!' I sat back waiting for congratulations - which never came. Instead, the question: 'Did you do your best?' I started to say, 'Yes, sir,' but I remembered who this was and recalled several times at the Academy when I could have learned more about our allies, our enemies, weapons, strategy, and so forth. I was just human. I finally gulped and said, 'No, sir, I didn't always do my best.' He looked at me for a long time, then turned his chair around to end the interview. He asked one final question, which I have never been able to forget - or to answer. He said, 'Why not?' I sat there for a while, shaken, then slowly left the room.'
That's a question we need to ask ourselves at the end of each day: 'Did I do my best?' You can be certain it's a question you'll face when you stand at the Judgment Seat of Christ to be evaluated and rewarded. If you can't answer yes, the question then will be, 'Why not?'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...LORD TEACH US TO PRAY...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Luke 11: 1 NIV</span><br>A lot of us struggle with prayer. You set aside some time, you start talking but before you know it your mind has wandered and instead of praying you are wondering 'what's the collective noun for hamsters' (apparently it's a horde of hamsters by the way). Sometimes after two minutes you have run out of things to say. Or you give God a list of things you want Him to do and that's it! 
The disciples needed help with prayer and so do we: 
1) Before you start ask the Holy Spirit to come and help you focus your mind, guide your thoughts and draw you close to Jesus. Jesus called the Spirit &quot;the helper&quot; -so ask for help. 
2) Try using some structure: Look at the Lords prayer in Luke 11 - we covered it last month - remember?! Take each line and use it as spring board for your prayers. Another structure to use is A.C.T.S. A=adoration C=confession T=thanks S=supplication (which means asking for things) Try and spend 5 minutes on each letter.  
3) Write stuff down: Buy a notebook and start to write your prayers out instead of saying them. It can really help stop your mind from wandering. Also it's a really good thing to look back on and see how God has answered your prayers. 
God doesn't give us points for prayer. You don't pass or fail. He just loves it when we are praying. So see if any of these tips can help your prayer this week.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>PRAY WITHOUT CEASING.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 THESSALONIANS 5:17 KJV</span><br>
If you're the kind of person who will always turn up for any social event but think you can cancel your daily prayer time at a moment's notice, ask yourself: a) has my love for Jesus grown cold? b) do I believe I can handle life on my own? (except for emergencies of course) c) do I know how much God longs to spend time with me? 
'But I'm so busy!' That's the lamest excuse you can offer; how you spend your time reveals what's important to you! The truth is, if you don't pray it's because you don't realize its potential, or you're unaware of the condition of your heart. John Wesley (a famous old skool preacher) said, 'God does nothing except in answer to prayer.' If you don't pray the best thing that can happen - is nothing. Prayer puts the situation into God's hands, otherwise whose hands is it in? Yours? Now that's a scary thought!
Paul says, 'Pray without ceasing.' You can pray anywhere, anytime, about anything. Your prayers can be out loud or silent, long or short, public or private. 'Pray without ceasing' just means to be chatting with God wherever and whenever. Does your prayer life need a tune-up? Answer these three questions: 
1) How often do I pray? If you can't remember when you last spent time in prayer, you're living undirected, uncorrected and unprotected. 
2) How's my sincerity?  Are you just going through the motions? That's because you don't know enough about who you're talking to, or how He feels about you. 
3) How's my faith level? Do you wonder if prayer really changes anything? After all, if God decides everything, why bother? Why? Because prayer isn't just for God's benefit - it's for yours!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>YOU WILL BE MADE RICH IN EVERY WAY SO THAT YOU CAN BE GENEROUS ON EVERY OCCASION...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 9:11 NIV</span><br>Check out what Paul says to his mates at the church in Corinth about giving: 
'Remember: A stingy planter gets a stingy crop; a lavish planter gets a lavish crop. I want each of you to take plenty of time to think it over, and make up your own mind what you will give. That will protect you against sob stories and arm-twisting. God loves it when the giver delights in the giving' (2 Corinthians 9:6-7 TM).
Be honest, are you stingy with what God has given you? When was the last time you got well excited about giving? Have you ever sat down and got creative, planning and thinking about outrageous ways to bless people?  Paul says that giving shouldn't be something we only think about when the offering comes round and we check what's in our jeans' pocket. God wants us to be considerate and cheerful givers.  
Consider what you can afford. Be honest how much you spend on yourself, what do you really need and what could you do without? Consider whose world could be rocked by your gift. Remember, its not just about money, Paul says you are made rich in every way. Do you have time or talents that you can give as well as your dosh? Think about what God has been saying to you recently, what or who has He highlighted? Then make a decision about what and to whom you are going give. That will protect you from sob stories and arm-twisting. Once you've decided make sure you enjoy it! Be cheerful.  For example, you could have a right laugh by trying to bless people secretly! Don't hold back! Go for it!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...WE FELT LIKE GRASSHOPPERS NEXT TO THEM...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>NUMBERS 13:33 NLT</span><br>
When you come up against a giant, either your faith will cause you to soar or your fear will cause you to sink. The Israelites died 21 miles from the Promised Land, walking around the desert in circles. Why? Because they let their fear get the better of them: 'We even saw giants there... We felt like grasshoppers next to them.' If you're to see (and seize) what God's promised you, you'll have to conquer your giants. Now, you have the power to, but do you have the guts to? Joshua and Caleb looked upwards with the eyes of faith, even when everyone else started to look down and get depressed 'The whole congregation...said...&quot;Would to God that we had died...in the land of Egypt...&quot;' (Exodus 16:2-3 KJV). These guys were on a serious downer!
This is someone with a 'grasshopper mentality':
1) They constantly talk about life's injustices; about how they've been mistreated and misunderstood. To them Paul answers, '...endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ' (2 Timothy 2:3 KJV).
2) They make excuses for not conquering in life. Sometimes they even put others down because they are stepping out in faith. To them Paul writes, '...in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us' (Romans 8:37 NIV). 
3) They complain about what they don't have instead of focusing on what they do. To them Peter writes, 'His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through our knowledge of him who called us...' (2 Peter 1:3 NIV). 
Sound like anyone you know (including yourself)? Get to know God better. That's how to move from a grasshopper mentality to a giant killer mentality!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...WE FELT LIKE GRASSHOPPERS NEXT TO THEM...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>NUMBERS 13:33 NLT</span><br>You'll never know what you're made of spiritually until you come against something too big to handle alone. That's when you discover what you really believe. Moses sent twelve scouts to the promised land. They weren't the kind with badges on their sleeves for making campfires and tying knots, but spies sent to check out Israel's new homeland. They all saw the same thing: a land rich in honey, milk - and giants! Now that was literally a big problem!  Acknowledging or knowing there's a problem isn't lack of faith. And it's not a sin. Paul said, '...we wanted to come to you...but satan stopped us' (1 Thessalonians 2:18 NIV). He knew there was a problem! The difference between the scouts was in how they saw the problem. Ten said, 'We saw the giants...and we were in our own eyes as grasshoppers,' but two scouts called Joshua and Caleb said, '&quot;...do not fear the people of the land...The Lord is with us...&quot;' (Numbers 14:9 TLB). Real faith feeds off the stuff the enemy throws at you. Like the scene with Neo from the matrix, faith has its arm stretched and beckons with its fingers: 'Bring it on! The Lord is with me' 
The negative report of the ten spies caused three reactions in the people:
1) Fear. Fear is irrational. It can make you forget every good thing God's promised, or done for you. 
2) Some wanted to go back to Egypt - back to how things used to be 'Er HELLO!' 3) Others wanted to settle in the wilderness. You've got to move with the cloud, otherwise today's manna is the last you'll see. 
So, is the God you serve bigger than the giant you see? He says He is.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>KEEP YOUR WORD EVEN WHEN IT COSTS YOU...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 15:5 TM</span><br>On my notepad, at the very bottom of the cover in small black letters it says: 'OUR PROMISE: Satisfaction guaranteed or your money back' I'm not entirely sure why someone wouldn't be satisfied with a notepad. But if the pages were made of thin layers of jelly instead of paper you might find yourself waving a receipt confident that the company would fulfil their 'money back' promise even at the great cost of 79p!
Unlike companies, keeping our promises might not cost us cash. But often it CAN be costly. It might mean you miss out or have to put yourself out to keep your word. It might be a lot harder that you thought (ever promised God you would get up earlier to pray?)  Solomon says it's '...better not to vow than to...not fulfil it' (Ecclesiastes 5:5 NIV)! God doesn't want us to avoid making promises he just wants us to be committed to keeping them, and not make them lightly. In Psalms David asks: 'Lord, who may...find refuge...on your holy hill?' Here's the answer: 'Anyone who leads a blameless life...is truly sincere...[and] keeps a promise even if it ruins him' (Psalm 15:2 TLB). So how about it, do you keep your word even when it costs you? For example, when you promise to pray for somebody - do you? When you say you'll be somewhere on time - are you? When you tell people they can depend on you - can they? When you agree to repay that cash you borrowed on time- do you? Of Course, nobody's perfect. But when you fail, do you admit your mistake without making excuses? As Christ's disciple you should.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...HONOUR ONE ANOTHER ABOVE YOURSELVES.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 12:10 NIV</span><br>Lots of people fancy the idea of being a leader. After all, we love the thought of being given respect, being listened to, and most of all...being in charge. But there's more to being a leader that getting your own way or the buzz of wearing the captain's band on your arm. Often it's more about showing respect than getting it, listening rather than always being listened to.
Jesus said some serious sit-up-and-listen things about leadership when he was lecturing on one of his training and development seminars for emerging leaders (in other words when he was hanging out with his mates, a bunch of flimsy followers who one day would end up being the world leaders of His church!). Jesus said:
'&quot;You've observed how godless rulers throw their weight around, how quickly a little power goes to their heads. It's not going to be that way with you. Whoever wants to be great must become a servant&quot;' (Matthew 20:25-26 TM).
You might fancy being a leader but do you fancy leading the way in being a servant? Being the first to put others first?
Paul, who wrote massive chunks of the Bible, as a writer filled his letters with instructions about how to live Jesus filled lives. But as a leader he knew that it's not just about telling people what to do. Check this out: 'I'm not, you know, asking you to do anything I'm not already doing myself.' (1 Corinthians 4:16 TM) Paul knew that leadership means being a solid example. Make sure you're a solid example and God will use you to lead others, whether you get called a leader or not.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...HIS UNFAILING LOVE... IS AS GREAT AS THE HEIGHT OF THE HEAVENS ABOVE...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 103:11 NLT</span><br>No matter what the other disciples told him about the resurrection, Thomas wanted to see for himself; so for 7 days he waited. He needed firsthand evidence. And Jesus gave it to him. '&quot;Put your finger here and see my hands. Put your hand into the wound in my side. Don't be faithless any longer. Believe!&quot;' (John 20:27 NLT). And Thomas did; '&quot;My Lord and my God!&quot;' (John 20:28 NLT). Only God could come back from the dead. And only a God of love would come back for a doubter. 
Did you know what... your doubts don't separate you from God's love! Listen: 'For his unfailing love toward those who fear Him is as great as the height of the heavens above...' (Psalm 103:11 NLT). The big mind blowing news of the Bible is not that you love God; but that He loves you! He says your name is engraved on the palm of His hand (see Isaiah 49:16). His thoughts of you outnumber the grains of sand on the beach (see Psalm 139:17-18). He sees the worst in you yet still believes the best. Your sins and mess ups from the last few weeks - and even your failings in the future don't surprise Him; He knows them all. God's not like someone blinded by love, unable to see the real deal. He knows you better than you know yourself. And He's reached His verdict: 'I love you!' No discovery will disillusion Him, no rebellion dissuade Him. He loves you with an unfailing love, and that knowledge can lift you, restore you and put you back on your feet.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…HOLY AND BLAMELESS IN HIS SIGHT...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 1:4 NIV</span><br>The word ‘holiness’ is a turn-off to a lot of people. It reminds them of finger-pointing religion and negative experiences they’ve had in church. They immediately think of the top-ten things you can’t do.  Nothing could be further from the truth. Holiness is not what we do; it’s what God sees.  God has a vision for your life, a picture of the perfect you, and everyday he brings you opportunities that – if you take them – will make you a bit more like that perfect you.  As you serve, and worship and pray, God will show you more and more of what the perfect you looks like.  That’s when His vision for your life starts becoming your vision for your life too.  True holiness if having the faith to work at bringing every aspect of your life in line with God’s perfect vision.  You work out what please God and what offends God.  Put simply, you decide that your life will only be used for one purpose: WORSHIPPING GOD.  In the Old Testament, the priests used knives, forks, jugs and basins for the temple sacrifices. They were just ordinary kitchen utensils until they were set aside for God’s use, then they became holy knives, holy forks, holy jugs and holy basins! But check this out: contamination disqualified them from being used, so they had to be protected. Are you getting the idea? When God chose you He had a specific vision of you, and for you.  You might think that you’re just Jo/Joe, but now you’re holy Jo/Joe!  Like a sim card, you can be used on one network, Godcom!   Once you understand that and fully accept it, you’ll never be scared off by the word ‘holiness’ again.

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…A GREAT DOOR…HAS OPENED TO ME…</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 CORINTHIANS 16:9 NIV</span><br>Yesterday we looked at a chat that Moses had with God.  Here’s another important bit of the conversation: Moses told God: ‘…If your Presence does not go with us, do not send us…’ (Exodus 33:15 NIV).  What old Mo’ was getting at here is still massively important for us today; we need to know that the things we do in life are not totally random ideas off at a tangent from God’s big plan.  If God’s not behind it, you don’t want to be involved in it. Sometimes we need to stop and say ‘Oops, that was me, not God.’ 
So does this mean that as long as we pray, the right prayers we’ll sail gently in to our God-given destiny? No. Even when God is right at the heart of your mission you’ll still deal with delays, discouragement and setbacks. Opportunities and obstacles seem to come together. 
Some of you will be at the other extreme here.  Rather than being happy-go-lucky and wrongly assuming God’s in everything you do, you’re always asking paranoid questions.  ‘Does God love me? Has He really chosen me? Am I in His will?’ Listen, there are some basic promises that you can ALWAYS trust: 
1) He always loves you (see Jeremiah 31:3)   
2) He chose us before the creation of the world (see Ephesians 1:4)   
3) He assures us that if we resist the mindsets of the world, we will know what he wants for us (See Romans 12:2).  So live today with a healthy mix of confidence and caution.  Don’t get an over-inflated ego and think that every good idea you have is a direct download from God.  But don’t go the other way and get paralyzed at the pants drawer because God hasn’t revealed whether he wants you to wear black or white today!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…ANYONE ENQUIRING OF THE LORD WOULD GO TO THE TENT...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EXODUS 33:7 NIV</span><br>Moses did something we can learn from today: ‘Moses used to take a tent and pitch it outside the camp some distance away, calling it the ‘tent of meeting.’…Anyone enquiring of the Lord would go to the tent…’ (Exodus 33:7 NIV). And what would happen in that tent? ‘The Lord would speak to Moses face to face, as a man speaks with his friend…’ (Exodus 33:11 NIV). Face to face time with God! That’s what we need. Turn off your mobile phone. Sell your TV on Ebay and buy a tent!  Ok – maybe you don’t really need the tent – underneath your duvet will do just fine &amp;#61514;. 
So what did they talk about in that tent? Moses prayed: a) ‘…Let me know whom you will send with me…’ (Exodus 33:12 NIV). Some of the problems you’re experiencing are because of the people who are influencing you b) ‘…teach me your ways…’ (Exodus 33:13 NIV). Your way of doing things doesn’t seem to be working too well, so get God’s input! c) ‘…so I may know you…’ (Exodus 33:13 NIV). This word ‘know’ isn’t a casual matey-thing; it’s proper intimacy between two people. d) ‘…so I may…continue to find favour with you…’ (Exodus 33:13 NIV). God’s favour; you need it because it opens doors, gives you the edge, and influences people before you speak a word. And what did God say back to Moses in that tent? ‘…I will do the very thing you have asked, because I am pleased with you and I know you by name’ (Exodus 33:17 NIV). Would you like to be on a first name basis with God? Get in that tent!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…THE HOLY SPIRIT…WILL PRODUCE THIS KIND OF FRUIT IN US...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GALATIANS 5:22 NLT</span><br>We all like our gadgets… Our mobile phone, MP3 player, PSP!  Well, all these gadgets are useless without power.  You could say the same about us too.  It’s the power of the Holy Spirit that fires us up and makes us function. Here’s three ways the Holy Spirit works: 
 1) He moves us. When Jesus was born Mary and Joseph wanted to make sure they didn’t stuff things up.  It was the custom to get kids blessed at the temple so that’s where they headed.  They didn’t know it but an old priest called Simeon had been waiting his whole life for them to arrive.  ‘That day the Holy Spirit led him to the Temple.  So when Mary and Joseph came to present the baby Jesus…Simeon was there.  He took the child in his arms and praised God saying, “Lord, now I can die in peace!  As you promised me, I have seen the Saviour...”’  (Luke 2:27 – 30 NLT)  The Holy Spirit will move you so that you don’t miss these destiny moments!  
2) He comforts us. Jesus referred to the Holy Spirit as the ‘comforter’ who would never leave us (See John 14:16). When you wake up worried about your day He whispers, ‘I’ve got everything under control.’ When you feel like you can’t go on, He holds your hand, and says ‘I’m right here with you.’ You’re not alone in this life; you’ve got God’s help! 
3) He protects us. Paul said to Timothy ‘With the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us, carefully guard what has been entrusted to you‘. When the enemy moves against you to steal the good things God has given you, pray, ‘Holy Spirit, be my bodyguard.’ You can count on this; the Holy Spirit will do a better job than Kevin Costner!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…YOURS IS THE KINGDOM, AND THE POWER, AND THE GLORY, FOR EVER, AMEN.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 6:13 NKJV</span><br>This is the great big ‘KABOOM’ at the end of the prayer.  It echoes down the centuries like a firework exploding down a narrow alley!  ‘Yours is the Kingdom,’ reminds us that if Jesus is not the boss of all, He’s not Boss at all. When you wake up in the morning you should pray: ‘Father, make my life like an advert today to everyone I meet I want them to see how much better life works when it’s lived in your kingdom instead of the kingdom of self.’ ‘Yours is…the power’ reminds us that God’s destiny for our lives can only be fulfilled through God’s power at work in our lives.  The Apostle Paul took time to explain the tug of war that we often feel going on inside us. In his usual matter of fact way he puts it like this, ‘…people who are ruled by their sinful selves cannot please God.’ (Romans 8:8 NCV). Elsewhere he expands on that saying, ‘Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified their own sinful selves.  They have given up their old selfish feelings and the evil things they wanted to do.  We get our new life from the Spirit, so we should follow the Spirit’ (Galations 5:24-25 NCV). ‘Yours is…the glory,’ reminds us that the credit always goes to the One Who truly deserves it. – The One who gave us this fantastic life in the first place!  This final line of the Lord’s Prayer simply means ‘Lord, You are in charge, not me; You are infinitely strong, I’m not.  And I will live my life to make you famous’.  So that’s the end of our Lord’s Prayer marathon.  Make sure you use it again and again and again.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION, BUT DELIVER US FROM THE EVIL ONE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 6:13 NIV</span><br>When Jesus taught us to pray ‘…lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one,’ He was teaching us to pray for His protection. Does satan have power? Look back. Haven’t you played into his hands more than once? His objective is to ‘…kill, steal and destroy…’ (John 10:10). But check out these words: ‘…God’s Spirit, who is in you, is greater than the devil, who is in the world’ (1John 4:4 NCV). God sent an urgent message to a first century church in Smyrna (part of Greece then – now part of Turkey), ‘Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer. I tell you, the devil will put some of you in prison to test you, and you will suffer for ten days. But be faithful, even if you have to die, and I will give you the crown of life’ (Revelation 2:10 NCV). This is an amazing example of the way God allows certain things to happen because he knows the final outcome, God tells them how long the attack will last (‘ten days’), the reason for the attack (‘to test you’), and the outcome of the attack (‘a crown of life’). Every time satan tries to score – we win! When satan knocks us down, God picks us up. David, who’d experienced more than his fair share of attacks, writes, ‘The steps of the godly are directed by the Lord…Though they stumble, they will not fall, for the Lord holds them by the hand’ (Psalm 37:23-24 NLT). Jesus lets us know in this line of the prayer just how important it is for us to pray for protection.  So pray today.  Place your small hand into God’s big hand and face the problems of the day together.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…FORGIVE US OUR SINS, JUST AS WE HAVE FORGIVEN THOSE WHO HAVE SINNED AGAINST US.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 6:12 NLT</span><br>This is a pretty extreme part of the Lord’s Prayer. When we pray it, we give away our right to rage, revenge and resentment.  But this is the line that rescues us from our inbuilt tendency to kid ourselves that we can live by one set of standard but expect something different from other people.  In this line of the prayer the shadow of the cross falls onto the page.  Ultimately Jesus forgave His enemies when He had the power to destroy them. Think about this - if God: a) was a bit choosy in forgiving like you are b) took His time before forgiving just to rub it in c) told everybody who’d listen what you’ve done to Him d) forgave, but refused to give you another chance e) made up His mind to blank you and avoid you f) next time you were in trouble, refused to help you saying, ‘You should’ve learned your lesson last time,’ could you live with that? No? Then offer to other people the same forgiveness God offers to you. When you pray ‘Forgive us our sins, just as we have forgiven those who have sinned against us’ you’re asking for a change of heart! Nehemiah writes, ‘…you are a forgiving God…‘ (Nehemiah 9:17 NIV). Aren’t you glad he didn’t write, ‘you are a God ready to put us on probation.’ No, forgiveness is God’s generous attitude toward us. His forgiveness was assured before we even went out and did those sins. Wow! Doesn’t that make you want to live life God’s way!  The only place unforgiveness belongs is in the wheely bin!  That’s where we put all the rubbish that stinks the house out. Remember that, next time you pray The Lord’s Prayer.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>GIVE US TODAY OUR DAILY BREAD.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 6:11 NIV</span><br>Did you know there are two reasons for praying, ‘Give us today our daily bread’. First there is the natural reason:  while we may have so much food that our prayer is, ‘Lord, help me to lose some weight,’ millions still go to bed hungry. They pray this same prayer but without an answer they won’t make it. And we dare not turn away from them because: ‘God blesses those who are kind to the poor. He helps them out of their troubles. He protects them…he publicly honours them and destroys the power of their enemies’ (Psalm 41:1-2 TLB). 
Secondly there is the spiritual reason: When he was being tempted by the devil Jesus said, ‘…Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God’ (Matthew 4:4 NIV). Note the phrase ‘every word.’ Some words God feeds us are pleasant; some are painful. And we need both. ‘Ice cream Christians’ pick Scriptures that taste sweet but as a result they don’t develop the spiritual muscle required to stand strong in the hard times. It’s easy to tell when you’re not eating right. People get on your nerves, you go through mood swings, you cave into fear. Don’t let that happen; sort your spiritual diet out! 
So we can see that this bit of the Lord’s Prayer works on two levels, we are asking God to take care of our needs in a natural way and a spiritual way. Either way, the truth is, without your daily bread you won’t make it!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…YOUR KINGDOM COME...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 6:10</span><br>We live in the United Kingdom – but it doesn’t always seem united, does it?!  That’s because everybody wants to have their own little kingdom, the kingdom of self.  In the kingdom of self, you rule. And what’s life like in the kingdom of self?  It’s generally a total mess - because the wrong person’s in charge! In the Kingdom of God, Jesus rules. His Word settles every issue. No, ‘Yeah, but…’.  The fastest route to success in any job is to find out what the boss wants, and do it with excellence. Well Jesus said, ‘…make the kingdom of God your primary concern’ (Matthew 6:33 NLT).
Did you know that the gravity is different in God’s kingdom? Everything is upside down. 
1) The way up, is down. ‘Humble yourselves…that he may lift you up in due time’ (1Peter 5:6 NIV). Note the words, ‘due time.’ Your blessing is already scheduled on God’s calendar. Just keep your head down. 
2) By forgiving others you free yourself. Holding on to bad feelings about somebody is so tiring.  When you choose to forgive someone, all the energy you lost to self-pity and bitterness comes flooding back.  
Jesus made it clear on the cross that forgiveness is at the heart of his mission.  And in the Kingdom of God we do things His way. Each time we take a step in Jesus’ footsteps, God’s will is done, a little more of His Kingdom comes. So why bother praying, ‘Your kingdom come, Your will be done on earth, as it is in heaven’? Because the kingdom of God is so massive that we can only see a tiny bit of it.  We need God’s inspiration to show us which boundaries he wants us to push back.  So pray it today and play your part in making god’s kingdom grow.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…MAY YOUR NAME BE HONOURED.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 6:9 NLT</span><br>If you ever get invited to Buckingham Palace and have the privilege of meeting the Queen, don’t show up in sawn-off jeans and a raggedy T-shirt. They won’t let you in. You’re not going to your mate’s house, you’re meeting royalty! Likewise, when Jesus told us to pray, ‘May your name be honoured,’ He was teaching us that there’s only one way to enter God’s presence. And it’s not with a shopping list of all the things you want. If the only time someone comes to visit you is when they need something, you’ll soon stop answering the door.  So, when you pray to him, big him up!  David tells us more about how to approach God: ‘Know that the Lord is God: It is he who made us, and we are his…Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and his courts with praise: give thanks to him, and praise his name’ (Psalm 100:3-4 NIV). When we close our eyes in prayer, we imagine our self walking through those great big fancy gates.  God can hear us coming through because we’re making a Rukus about all the top stuff he’s done for us! Then we walk across His courtyard making a big fuss about  Who He is: ‘My Saviour, my defender, my provider, my source of strength,  the giver of my joy, the lover of my soul, the author and finisher of my faith.’ If you can express yourself when your favourite team’s winning or when your favourite X-Factor finalist wins the competition then you can definitely praise God! Whether you’re a morning person or a night person, the Bible says, ‘From the rising of the sun to the place where it sets, the name of the Lord is to be praised’ (Psalm 113:3 NIV). The way to enter and to enjoy God’s presence – is by honouring His name.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…“OUR FATHER IN HEAVEN...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 6:9 NIV</span><br>When we pray to our Father God, we recognize His position. Daniel said, ‘…the Most High rules over the kingdom of the world…’ (Daniel 4:17 NLT). That’s the ultimate reality that we need to remember when we see frightening headlines.  This rebellious world has been wrestling against God for thousands of years.  The prophet Isaiah cried, ‘Oh, the raging of many nations – they rage like the raging sea!...’ (Isaiah 17:12) If God isn’t in control – who is? The Prime Minister? Well, he wears smart suits and always has a smile for the camera, but that’s not good enough if you really want to sleep peacefully in your bed at night. The Psalmist said, ‘My help comes from the Lord…’ (Psalm 121:2 NIV). Think: if He really is King over everything that’s going on, and if He’s promised to help us when we call on Him, what do we have to worry about?
You say, ‘What about terrorism? What about The Middle East?’ God’s heart breaks over the hatred and violence that human beings inflict on each other – but Jesus told us that it would be this way as the end comes near: ‘You will hear of wars and rumours of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed – such things must happen, but the end is still to come...’  (Matthew 24:6 NIV)  Still think God’s not running the show? He’s God, and He has a master plan.  The exciting bit of that plan is that it’s not a big secret; He’s already told us the way it ends: ‘…at the Name of Jesus every knee should bow…and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father’ (Philippians 2:10-11 NIV).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…OUR FATHER...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 6:9</span><br>Jesus taught His disciples to pray: ‘This, then, is how you should pray: “Our Father…”’ (Matthew 6:9 NIV). The relationship you have with someone has a massive effect on the amount of security and confidence you feel when you approach them. So Jesus begins by getting this sorted out right at the start by saying: 
‘Our Father.’ Now, if you, like so many nowadays, have a father who was never there for you, or an abusive father who hurt you, or an emotionally vacant father who never showed you much love or acceptance, then there’s a whole new dimension of fatherhood waiting for you here.  Don’t let your past rob you of this revelation. You can trust God.  He really, really loves you.  And the more you start believing that, the more you’ll open up to Him. Only as you do that can your wounded areas be healed. ‘Our Father’ – you are part of a massive global family who all find peace in His arms.  So now you understand Who you’re talking to, and the relationship you have with Him, you can approach God as a child, knowing that He’ll be delighted to hear your voice. Your Heavenly Father is a promise making, promise keeping God. When two people in Bible days made a promise, it wasn’t a casual ‘call me sometime’ with no commitment. No, they sealed it with blood, meaning, ‘I’ll give my life for you if necessary.’ And we know that if wasn’t an empty promise.  The cross of Jesus proves that God keeps his word.
So, to really enter into the Lord’s Prayer and find its source of power, we must be ready to speak those first two words loud and proud – Our Father.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…LORD, TEACH US TO PRAY...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 11:1</span><br>Jesus always led by example. One day Jesus’ disciples watched him praying.  Afterwards they said: ‘Lord, teach us to pray.’ It was then that He gave them what’s become known as ‘The Lord’s Prayer.’ Can you remember when you last prayed it? If not, how come? Did you grow up saying it so often that it’s become boring?  Or have you never actually taken the time to learn it off by heart?  You should – it’s amazing – and powerful!  ‘Well, the Lord’s prayer’s a bit old fashioned – a bit traditional – I just like to freewheel when I chat with God’.  Fair enough, but in all your laid back matey-ness with God watch out because ‘When you pray, don’t babble on and on…’ (Matthew 6:7 NLT). There are actually lots of models of prayer in the Bible: prayers for guidance, for forgiveness, for unity, and none of them include waffle or babble! Here’s the score: when you pray it should be a) passionate b) scriptural c) intimate d) unhurried e) faith-filled. Take a moment to chew on each of those five things. They’re your keys to effective prayer. 
We only tend to keep doing stuff that we feel there’s a point to, so when prayer feels like it’s got no point, we quit. If that’s why you never pray The Lord’s Prayer, the look at it again and take up the challenge. For the next few days we’re going to go back to the only prayer Jesus Himself gave us to pray. And let’s face it, who knows more about prayer? Can you imagine Jesus giving us a prayer that wouldn’t move us, move God, or move and of the mountains we face?  Exactly, so let’s get moving!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…NAMAAN TOLD THE KING WHAT THE GIRL HAD SAID</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 KINGS 5:4 CEV</span><br>God used a cleaning maid to reach an army general, and introduce him to a God who could heal him of his leprosy. Her story’s recorded in 2 Kings, chapter 5. Dig your Bible out and take a look at it. There are two important lessons in it for you:
1) There’s a purpose in your being where you are! Instead of complaining, start looking for somebody who needs what God’s given you. This girl wasn’t there just to make the beds and sweep the floors; she was there because God specially arranged it. Think: all of your life can be training for one shot, one opportunity, one moment. Peter writes, '…Always be prepared to give an answer…' (1 Peter 3:15 NIV). Will you capture it or just let it slip?
2) What a difference a day can make! Yesterday she was a nobody; today she’s a gift from God, and the most popular person in the house. The world focuses on the big names, but when they’ve run out of answers and out of hope, God says ‘I’ll even pour out my Spirit on the servants, men and women both’ (Joel 2:29 TM). When He does, people who normally just blank you in the street will suddenly begin to listen, because you’re in the right place, at the right time with the right answer. Don’t allow your lack of experience, your postcode or the naff grades you got in your last exam to silence you. Keep your mind fresh and your faith strong! Just be available for God to use you today as only He can!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…EVEN BEFORE HE MADE THE WORLD, GOD LOVED US AND CHOSE US IN CHRIST TO BE HOLY...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 1:4 NLT</span><br>The world’s attitude is to be able to brag to other people: ‘I did it my way’ and  ‘nobody tells me what to do’.  It’s an independent streak which is breaking apart families and communities.  But here Paul shows us that God’s best for us is to be holy in Jesus – something we can’t do on our own!  And this didn’t start with us making one or two good decisions – God had it in mind even before he made the world!  Paul writes later, ‘…put off your old self…put on the new self…’ (Ephesians 4:22-24 NIV). When you first start letting go of the self-made you and putting on the god-made you, it’ll feel strange. But just as new shoes don’t feel comfortable at first, so your new way of approaching life will also take a bit of getting used to. As you continue to ‘put on the new self’ you’ll become more and more at home with it.
It works like this. You have to: a) practice doing the right thing until you automatically do the right thing b) practice turning up on time for youth group until it feels weird to ever be late for anything c) practice giving some of your spending money to the needy in the world d) practice telling the truth until the smallest lie troubles your conscience and sticks in your throat e) practice speaking encouragement until every cynical word is deleted from your vocabulary. By taking practical steps like these, you are re-training yourself to walk God’s way – and restraining yourself from walking any other way. You are saying to God, ‘Ok boss, it’s no longer a matter of me making up my own rules, it’s about what You say and direct me to do.’

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…“SIR, WE WANT TO MEET JESUS”</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 12:21 NLT</span><br>One day some Greeks came to Philip saying, ‘…“Sir, we want to meet Jesus”’  If you listen carefully – that’s what people around you are still saying today.  You might suggest: ‘Telling them to go to church and they’ll see Jesus.’  Maybe, maybe not.  Get close enough to some people who fill a pew every Sunday and it might put you off for life!  When we recognise that somebody is looking for Jesus, we should not need to send them anywhere.  When we made our decision to give our lives to Him, He came and made His home in our heart (see Ephesians 3:17).  Yes, they may have questions that you can’t answer yourself, but you have the power of prayer.  If someone is genuinely seeking for God, they won’t decline your offer of prayer.  Ask them gently if you can put your hand on their arm while you pray.  Then invite Jesus to come and flood their life with His love.  And when you get to the ‘Amen’, ask them if they would like to add anything – they need to know that the door is open for them too.  So whatever you think you are or aren’t good at - listen; your gifts and abilities are secondary to this – people want to see Jesus in you.  Sure, invite your friends to church, but when the meeting’s over people want to see Jesus - in you.  When you get through telling your schoolmates what you believe, they want to see Jesus – in you.  You don’t have to defend Him, just display Him through your attitudes and actions each day.  Jesus said, ‘…I, when I am lifted up…will draw all me to myself’ (John 12:32 NIV).  We do the lifting; Jesus does the drawing – that’s how it works!

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…“I AM DOING GREAT WORK!...”</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>NEHEMIAH 6:3 NLT</span><br>We all know people who are unwilling to take responsibility for their life, so they plough through each day complaining about everything and blaming everyone else for things that go wrong. Because they’re incapable of loving themselves, they can’t extend love to others. Often their negativity is a sign that a really deep struggle is going on. Deep down their afraid of being rejected, so they just have a very small circle of friends – who are equally mixed up!
So how should you respond to such people? Well be careful – if you can’t lift them up, make sure they don’t drag you down. Nehemiah got a lot of hassle from shady people who criticized the wall he was building. He put it to them straight: ‘…”I am doing great work! I cannot stop to come and meet with you”’ (Nehemiah 6:3 NLT). He didn’t get sidetracked, and ‘…the wall was…finished - just fifty-two days after we had begun. When our enemies…heard about it, they were…humiliated. They realised that this work had been done with the help of our God’ (Nehemiah 6:15-16 NLT). Was it easy working around neggy people like that? No. How did Nehemiah do it? When he started getting discouraged he prayed to the  Lord God to strengthen him! (See Nehemiah 6:9 NLT). Notice he didn’t day, ‘Lord, zap them. ‘Or, ‘Lord make them nice to me.’ No, he asked for strength, maintained a good attitude and prayed that God would take care of his critics. And God did. So remember Nehemiah and don’t develop a ‘victim mentality’. Many of the people who aggravate you don’t do it on purpose – it’s just their nature.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…ON THOSE LIVING IN THE LAND OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH A LIGHT HAS DAWNED.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ISAIAH 9:2 NIV</span><br>Have you seen Groundhog Day? The film where a guy gets stuck in the same day again and again. At first he thinks it’s just a weird phase he’s going through. Eventually he starts freaking out because he feels so trapped. Life loses its meaning because he‘s living without a future. Well, the world is full of people really living like that. And that’s why the message of Jesus’ resurrection is so amazing!
You see the resurrection proves that Jesus wasn’t just some good bloke or wise teacher. He was God the Son – sent from heaven to earth when there was no hope of a better tomorrow. The whole world needed a breakthrough. And the Bible says: ‘…on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned’ (Isaiah 9:2 NIV). Jesus’ resurrection was like the sun coming up over the horizon after the endless night that had hung over the earth. When he broke through death itself he not only dealt with all the sins of the past but he blazed a trail for us into a new future. So listen…The resurrection is absolutely at the heart of our Christian faith and it is an invitation to everyone who feels like they’re stuck in Groundhog day; 
1) To everyone who feels trapped in a life that is less than God’s best  
2) To everyone who has tried to change but failed again and again  
3) To everyone who has given up hope that tomorrow can be different to today. 
The resurrection says: ‘…if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!’ (2 Corinthians 5:17 NIV).

<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…I…CRIED OUT TO MY GOD; HE HEARD MY VOICE…</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 18:6 NKJV</span><br>In his book, The Power Of Crying Out, Bill Gothard writes: ‘The most significant difference between the prayers of God’s people in scripture (so powerfully effective) and our prayers today (so seemingly ineffective) is this: there was a fervency in the prayer of biblical saints – a fervency that is inherent in crying out. When we grasp this fact, the pages of scripture come alive with sound!’
The Oxford dictionary defines ‘fervent’ as: ‘having or displaying passionate intensity’ David gives us a picture of this when he says: ‘…I called upon the Lord, and cried out to my God; He heard my voice…’ (Psalm 18:6 NKJV) The Hebrew word that describes David’s outcry is shava, a higher pitched cry for help. Again he says: ‘…I called to you for help and you healed me’ (Psalm 30:2 NIV). A true father’s heart hears his children’s cries, and lovingly responds. In the same way crying out to God is our impulse, planted within us by the Holy Spirit. John says, ‘See how much our heavenly Father loves us, for he allows us to be called his children, and we really are!...’ (1 John 3:1 NLT) God loves you so much – you should never be embarrassed about calling out for His help. He longs to get involved in every aspect of your life, yes, even the messy stuff. Especially the messy stuff! Desperate situations call for desperate measures. Did you know we can also allow the Holy Spirit to cry out from within us? Have you ever found yourself deliberately suppressing an urge to cry out to God? Could you be quenching the Spirit of God? If so, its time to make a change; forget about your inhibitions and start ‘crying out.’

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>HE MADE HIMSELF NOTHING; HE TOOK THE HUMBLE POSITION OF A SLAVE…</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Philippians 2:7 NTL</span><br>It’s dangerous when someone ends up in leadership simply because they’ve got a big personality or because they get good marks in their exams. Before anyone becomes a leader their character needs to be seen. If someone is unwilling to wait, or won’t serve in a lower spot, they probably don’t have the maturity to handle a higher one. True leaders follow in the footsteps of the One who ‘…made himself nothing…’ (Philippians 2:7), they nail their ego to the cross and humbly serve because they are concerned about other people – not themselves. The apostle Paul warned his apprentice Timothy, ‘Don’t appoint people to church leader positions too hastily…’ (1 Timothy 5:22 TM). It’s a lot easier to get someone into a job than it is to get them out of it! Meanwhile God’s work is held up while the mess gets sorted out.
When Philip the evangelist went to Samaria to preach, a whole city was blessed by the things he said and did. If ever a church needed leadership in a hurry, they did. And that’s when a guy called Simon the sorcerer showed up. The Bible says ‘…all the people, both high and low gave him their attention…’ (Acts 8:10 NIV). But then, just when you think he’s a really genuine guy who really wants to be a disciple of Jesus, the mask comes off and he offers Peter money saying, ‘…Give me this power…’ (Acts 8:19 NKJV). Peter replied, ‘…May your money perish with you… your heart is not right before God...’ (Acts 8:20-22 NIV). People’s true character can’t stay hidden for ever. Who we are deep down will always be seen eventually.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…LET PATIENCE HAVE ITS PERFECT WORK, THAT YOU MAY BE PERFECT AND COMPLETE, LACKING NOTHING.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JAMES 1:4 NKJV</span><br>Are you hoping – maybe even praying – for something?  Are you starting to get fed up of waiting?  Listen, just because it hasn’t happened yet doesn’t mean it won’t, or that God has changed His mind.  While you are waiting; God is working.  The timing may not be right for Him to get the ultimate fame and you the ultimate gain.  That’s why James writes: ‘Let patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing.  You may not want to hear this; but impatience is a sign of immaturity.  You know what kids are like, they can’t wait for anything!  But a good parent knows what’s best.  God has got all sorts of amazing stuff in store for you.  We call this His purpose, for our lives.  Paul writes: ‘…we know that all things work…according to His purpose’ (see Romans 8:28 NKJV).  When you really believe God has a purpose for you, you won’t let things get in the way of it, including hurry and worry.  You’ll also have a clearer idea of what to do with your energy and even your money.  
God says, ‘I make known the end from the beginning…’ (Isaiah 46:10 NIV).  First God sets the goal, then He plans a journey towards.  And what are we supposed to do while we are waiting?  We look after our attitude and use the extra time to praise him.  Listen: ‘Though the cherry trees don’t blossom and the strawberries don’t ripen, though the apples are worm eaten…I’m singing joyful praise to God.  I’m turning cartwheels of joy to my Saviour Lord.’  (Habakkuk 3:17-18 TM).  Begin praising God today for what He’s going to do – because He absolutely will come through for you!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…WE MUST NOT PURSUE THE KIND OF SEX THAT AVOIDS COMMITMENT AND INTIMACY, LEAVING US MORE LONELY THAN EVER...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 CORINTHIANS 6:17 TM</span><br>There was this famous American newspaper columnist called Ann Landers, she wrote every week for years and years; right up until she died in fact.  She wrote about all sorts of things; and was very outspoken on subjects other people would shy away from. She wrote on one occasion for girls whose boyfriends ask them to ‘prove their love’ through sex, check her out:
‘Why not prove your love by sticking your head in the oven and turning on the gas? Or how about playing leap-frog in traffic? It’s about as safe. Clear the cobwebs out of your head. Anybody who asks you to prove your love is trying to take you for the biggest, most gullible fool that ever walked. That ‘proving it’ bit is one of the rottenest lines ever invented. Does he love you? It doesn’t sound like it. Someone who loves you wants whatever’s best for you. Figure it out. He wants you to commit an immoral act, surrender your virtue, compromise your character, throw away your self respect, risk the loss of your reputation and risk getting pregnant, getting diseased or getting into trouble. Wise up! He wants what’s best for him! He wants a thrill he can brag about at your expense. Love? Who’s kidding who? A guy who loves a girl would sooner cut off his right arm than hurt her. The truth is, this self-serving individual has proved that he doesn’t love you at all. That’s when he drops you, picks up his line and goes casting elsewhere for another equally gullible fish. If he loves you, let him prove it – at the altar.’

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…JESUS, TIRED AS HE WAS FROM THE JOURNEY, SAT DOWN BY THE WELL...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 4:6 NIV</span><br>Jesus had an amazing way of making every minute of His life count. 2000 years ago they had no cars and they didn’t even have decent shoes; so people walked everywhere. In this story Jesus is halfway through a long, tiring journey. This well He stopped at was a bit like stopping at the motorway services today. But as we read on we see that Jesus wasn’t protective of His ‘downtime’ every minute of His life was available for God to use. The most noticeable thing about Jesus was that He always had time for people. And He wasn’t simply available or approachable. He would kickstart conversations with complete strangers! So who did He meet at this pit-stop? Some famous personality with all the right connections? Somebody with a big cheque book ready to make a donation to His ministry? No, she was a no-name, five times divorced, floozy woman with a bad reputation and a live-in boyfriend. Did that bother JC? No, because even if all the other people tut-tut at your past, Jesus has his eye on your future. Whatever you’ve done, God’s not holding it against you. Jesus didn’t see this woman as bad; He saw her as lost. Big difference! Once she was ‘found’ she was the kind of person who’d be full on for God – gossiping the gospel on every street corner. This woman was destined to shake up her neighbourhood: ‘Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman’s testimony…’ (John 4:39 NIV). So there are two lessons here today:
1)	Be ready for God to use you at any minute.
2) Neither you, nor anyone you meet, is beyond the love of God.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…ANYONE WHO WELCOMES MY MESSENGER IS WELCOMING ME...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 13:20 NLT</span><br>Today’s word is dead simple: focus on the message, not the messenger! ‘But shouldn’t leaders set a good example; shouldn’t they be called to a higher standard?’ Yes, those trusted with great responsibility experience greater discipline. But God does that; not you. The Bible gives an extreme example: King Saul repeatedly tried to kill David, yet David realised that God had chosen Saul. Yes, King Saul had blown it, and God’s new plan was in motion, but David didn’t have the right to press fast-forward on that plan! This may come as a shock; God has no perfect messengers (we’re not counting angels here)! He uses ordinary people who have made themselves available to Him. And many of them are still struggling in certain areas. They’re being developed even while they’re delivering the message God wants you to hear.
A perfect word from imperfect lips – that’s how God does it. The great prophet Samuel led Israel for 40 years. He even anointed David to be King. Yet Sam’s own sons went astray. David, who God called a man after His own heart, lost the plot for a while and got himself into a shady love triangle that ended up getting a guy killed. Yet the Bible says, he ’…served God’s purpose in his own generation…’ (see Acts 13:36 NIV). And remember, Peter’s dark hour of denial didn’t prevent him from winning thousands to Christ. So, when you see your leader’s imperfections what should you do? a) learn from their mistakes b) pray for them. After all, if you can’t find mercy in the house of God where are you going to find it? c) keep listening to their message. Jesus said, ‘…anyone who welcomes my messenger is welcoming me…’ (John 13:20 NLT).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…AND THE BONES CAME TOGETHER...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EZEKIAL 37:7 NIV</span><br>If you think your life is too messed up for God to do anything about? Then visit Ezekiel in The Valley of Dry Bones: ‘He led me around among the old, dry bones that covered the valley floor’ (Ezekiel 37:2 NLT). God gave Ezekiel his Word to speak over them: ‘…I will put breath into you, and you will come to life. Then you will know that I am the Lord’ (Ezekiel 37:6 NIV). Suddenly, ‘…there was a rattling noise. The bones…came together...’ (Ezekiel 37:7 NLT) Next we read that: ‘…[Breath entered them] They all came to life and stood up on their feet - a great army of them’ (Ezekiel 37:10 NLT). Are you trying every way you know to put your life together? Do you long to get back on your feet? Then open the windows of your soul and let the wind of God blow in! And did you notice the role God’s Word played in this miracle? It all started with the Word. Nothing will bring order to your chaotic world like getting the truth of the Scriptures into your life.
Now take a closer look: God told Ezekiel, ‘Speak to the winds and say… Come… Breathe into these dead bodies so that they may live…’ (Ezekiel 37:9 NLT). God didn’t tell Ezekiel to speak to the bones; they couldn’t respond. They were too dead and too dry. You don’t organise a group therapy session for skeletons! No, they needed raw power. So God tells Ezekiel, ‘Speak to the wind.’ Cry out for the Spirit of God to come because without Him there’s no hope, no change, no future. Today God says, ‘Come on – cry out to Me and I’ll move on your behalf!’

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…BE TRANSFORMED BY THE RENEWING OF YOUR MIND...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 12:2 NIV</span><br>Verses from different parts of the bible often go really well together, like these: First: ‘…Be transformed by the renewing of your mind…’. Second: ‘…Though our bodies are dying, our spirits are being renewed every day’ (2 Corinthians 4:16 NLT). Your mind is a bit like a computer; it responds to what’s programmed into it. Having a spiritual mindset is like having top-notch Anti-Virus software installed. And you need to do the update ‘day by day’. Someone who has an earthly mind is wide open to all sorts of damaging influences. And some people are in between; frustrated because one moment they’re talking out of a spiritual mindset, the next they’re talking out of an earthly one. They haven’t learned to let the Holy Spirit do His work ‘day by day’. It’s important that you understand this because:
1)	A spiritual mindset gives you God’s input. What an advantage! God can reveal to you why people act the way they do, He can help you sense trouble coming before it arrives. He can tell you when to speak up and when to chill out, when to get involved and when to walk away. Through His Holy Spirit in your life God will help you in every situation.
2)	A spiritual mindset gives you victory where you’ve known only defeat. This is especially important for those who struggle with addictive behaviours and are likely to be ‘easily led’. The earthly mindset has proven it can’t cope with the temptations of the world. Without God’s Spirit we’ll go back to the chaos we came from. That’s why we need to allow Him day by day to flood our lives especially; that big grey lump between our ears!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…YOU MUST BE BORN AGAIN.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 3:7 TLB</span><br>When Jesus started talking to Nic, about being ‘born again’, Nic didn’t get it: ‘What do you mean?...How can an old man go back into his mother’s womb…’  (John 3:4 NLT).  Sometimes being clever doesn’t help!  Jesus told Nicodemus, ‘…you can hear the wind but can’t tell where it comes from or where it is going, so you can’t explain how people are born of the Spirit’ (John 3:8 NLT).  In other words, ‘You didn’t have a clue what was going on at your first birth, so why do you expect your second one to be any different?’
Some people have tried to turn Christianity into a pre-packed product.  Do this, don’t do this.  Believe this, don’t read this, don’t read that.  But how did Paul describe it to the churches he planted?  Listen, ‘the mystery that has been kept hidden for ages and generations, but is now disclosed to the saints’ (Colossians 1:26 NIV).  Who does he mean when he says ‘saints’?  Us!  You and me – anyone who will simply believe.  And what’s this mystery he’s talking about? ‘…God has chosen to make known… the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory’ (Colossians 1:27 NIV). You could spend your whole life thinking about that and never get to the bottom of it; it’s just too deep!  The things of God cannot be explained, only revealed.  Jesus said unless we become as little children, we won’t even be aware of His kingdom. Our biggest struggles come from wanting a reason for everything.  All God asks is that we trust Him.  When we do, life works the way it’s supposed to.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>TRUST IN THE LORD WITH ALL YOUR HEART; DO NOT DEPEND ON YOUR OWN UNDERSTANDING.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 3:5 NLT</span><br>Are you obsessed with trying to figure out things that should be left in God’s hands?  When you’ve been working through some questions but have come to the point of deciding that you are going to do, stop fretting and just trust God. And don’t get stressed again a week later because you don’t like the way He’s handling it!  Are you expecting God to just wave a magic wand over your life so that everything suddenly becomes all neat and tidy?  Maybe as He takes you through the process of sorting out the mess you’ll discover valuable things hidden and forgotten.  Paul says, ‘Do not be anxious about anything…’ (Philippians 4:6 NIV).  That’s hard to swallow if you’re a bit insecure, or you like to organize things; to find a place to put them so they make sense and feel ‘taken care of’.  But how do you file unanswered questions?  They annoy you like a crackly earpiece in your headphones or a scratch on your favourite CD!  But when you have a crackle or a scratch in your faith, you can’t just go down the shops and get a replacement.  Instead you have to talk to God about it and ask Him what He’s gonna do about it.  You might find out that the things you think are high priority may not be anywhere near the top of God’s list for your life.  So learn to live with loose ends and trust God!  If you want growth, you’ve got to be at peace with the messiness and mistakes that accompany it.  If you’re one of those people who needs to put everything into a neat little box, this Scripture is especially for you: ‘Trust in the Lord with all your heart; do not depend on your own understanding.’

<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>CONSIDER HIM WHO HAS ENDURED SUCH HOSTILITY...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HEBREWS 12:3 NAS</span><br>Today we’re going to think about the best way to handle ‘issues’ with people!  Firstly, make sure the issue you’re dealing with is worth your time and energy.  Often it isn’t.  Ask yourself, ‘Have I got myself worked up by something petty?’ Remember: It’s always easier to be critical than creative, so don’t get involved unless you’re willing to help.  Secondly, if you are sure that you do need to get involved in an issue, remember that your aim is to find God‘s perfect way together.  Watch out that you don’t destroy the other person’s self-confidence.  Stay away from statements like ‘you always’ or ‘you never’.  Assure them that you see loads of potential in them and be really practical about how they can do things better next time… that’s what God does with you!  Finally deal with people as unique individuals; it’s a bad idea to start down the track of ‘suchabody is really good at this’.  Comparisons always cause resentment.  Why make the problem bigger?  
If you do feel like it’s all going Pete Tong and the conversation becomes a confrontation you probably need to call Time-out before you end up in a major no-win situation.  Your goal should be to leave them with three things:
1)	A clearer understanding of the issue.
2)	The complete assurance of your love and support.
3)	Encouragement and confidence that with God’s help they can turn things around.
Are these three things easy to do?  No.  But with plenty of faith, grace and Holy Spirit wisdom, you can do it!  Living the Jesus life means getting involved in people’s mess so that His amazing transforming power can be displayed again and again.  It’s the only kind of life worth living!

<title><![CDATA[Learning from The Lost Son]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>FATHER, I HAVE SINNED...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 15.18 NLT</span><br>The Lost Son didn’t get into trouble until he left home and started to live his life by just doing whatever felt good at the time.  There are three really important keys in the story Jesus told about him.
Vs 13) ‘…he wasted all his money…’  This story is 2000 years old but it’s so relevant it could’ve been on the news last night.  Every weekend young people follow this guy’s example of ‘getting wasted’; and the first place it hits you is in the pocket!
Vs14) He ‘…began to starve.’  Something’s gone majorly wrong!  The situation changed really quickly, one minute he was loving it, living large, life and soul of the party.  But eventually the music stops.  The music always stops sooner or later.  It’s then that you start to realise the emptiness inside.  Are you doing that?  David said, ‘The Lord is my shepherd; I have everything I need’ (Psalm 23:1 NCV).  Who’s that promise for?  For all those who have decided to follow the shepherd and stay as close to him as possible.
Vs 17) ‘…he finally came to his senses…’ When his life could go no lower, he had a moment of clarity.  God has an amazing way of bringing those moments to us.  He is desperate for us to be in relationship with him.  He calls out ‘My daughter, My son, I love you, come home!’  The Bible says: ‘…Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts…’ (Hebrews 3:15 NIV).  It wasn’t too late for the guy in the story; and it’s not too late for you.  When he came home his father opened his arms, welcomed him home and threw a massive party.  And God will do the same for you, if you let him.

<title><![CDATA[Kodak Christians]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…YOU WILL RECEIVE POWER AND YOU WILL TELL PEOPLE ABOUT ME EVERYWHERE...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ACTS 1:8 NLT</span><br>It’s possible to be so concerned with what happened in the past, or so caught up in what’s happening in the present – that we pay no attention to what God  has for us next.   Look at the early church in the weeks and months after Pentecost: Jerusalem was an exciting place to be: ‘All the believers met together constantly and shared everything with each other, selling their possessions and dividing with those in need. They worshipped together regularly…met in small groups in homes for [Communion], and shared their meals with great joy…The whole city was favourable to them’ (Acts 2:44-47 TLB).  Can you see the problem here?   It’s too cosy!  Who would want to leave Jerusalem to carry the message to the rest of the world? So how did God get them out of their comfort zone to fulfil His purposes?   Well in this instance the answer was persecution which basically means severe agro, prejudice and bullying!   No wonder it’s an idea we don’t like because we tend to be Kodak Christians.  CONFUSED?   Well, there was this Kodak Camera advert which had a famous catchphrase: ‘Freeze the moment!’   The problem is – no matter how much we want to be a  Kodak Christian and just enjoy one long summer festival buzz all the way to heaven, that’s not the kind of life God promises.   But check this out:  even through the painful persecution; ‘Those who had been scattered preached the word wherever they went’ (see Acts 8:4 NIV).
Here’s a thought: God could be permitting the tough time you’re going through to: a) dig you out of the past or  b) make sure you don’t get stuck in a moment you can’t get out of. Bottom line: God’s always on the move – so don’t get left behind.

<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>“IF EACH PART OF THE BODY WERE THE SAME PART, THERE WOULD BE NO BODY…”</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>I CORINTHIANS 12:18 NCV</span><br>Everybody needs to find their part in God’s big story.  So here’s three things you need to know:
1) Every Christian has a ministry but less than 10% of Christians have bothered to find out what it is!  They go to church ‘for what they can get out of it.’ Giving your time and talents to God isn’t optional. We must all get our boots on and get stuck in; Christianity is not a spectator sport! 
2) Every ministry is important. Listen: ‘…God has arranged the parts in the body, every one of them, just as He wanted them to be…The eye cannot say to the hand, “I don’t need you!”’ (1 Corinthians 12:18-21 NIV). 
3) We all depend on each other. No single ministry can has everything stitched up. Like a jigsaw, each piece is needed to complete the picture. Or think about it this way: When one part of a car malfunctions, the other parts don’t work as well. It’s the same in our Christian life. The modern lie of individualism must be replaced with the eternal truth that we need each other, that we’ve been called to work together. That doesn’t mean you should try to be like somebody else; be who God made you to be and do what He wants you to do. And one last thing – doing something is better than doing nothing! You might not find a perfect fit for your gifts straight away. You might feel like a square peg in a round hole. If so, just do your best for a season, give it six months then try something else.  Let’s face it, if you never try, you’ll never know.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>“DOOM TO HIM WHO BUILDS PALACES BUT BULLIES PEOPLE…”</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JEREMIAH 22:13 TM</span><br>When Hurricane Katrina hit the USA almost a year ago it was a catastrophe on a scale we could hardly imagine.  What made everything worse was the fact that the city’s flood defences had not been properly invested in.  The result? The walls broke and New Orleans went under.
In our lives we can build flood defences.  We build one brick at a time.  Each brick has one word imprinted on it: INTEGRITY; the way we take care of the little things.  But a lot of us don’t bother building at all.  We think we can do whatever we want when it comes to small things; we believe so long as we don’t have any major lapses we’re doing well. But that’s not the way it works. A little white lie is still a lie. Theft is still theft, whether it’s your sister’s CD or an old lady’s handbag. The truth is, if you can’t be trusted at all points you probably can’t be trusted at any point. Each time you do something shifty or shady you create a crack in the wall of your character. And when times get tough it becomes harder to act with integrity – not easier. When you’re under pressure everything you’ve done in the past, and the things you’ve neglected to do, come to a head. One Christian leader writes, ‘Integrity commits itself to character over personal gain, people over things, service over power, discipline over impulse, commitment over convenience, and the long view over the immediate.’ Which is just a fancy way of saying ‘integrity is the bricks in the wall, not the icing on the cake.’

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…WE MUST BE DETERMINED TO RUN THE RACE THAT IS AHEAD OF US</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HEBREWS 12:1 NIV</span><br>Moving forward in your Christian life means being sensitive to His voice. God’s voice isn’t like a hammer pounding on your head; it’s more like a little prod in your heart. When you know you’ve heard from God, be determined not to let it go. Things worth having never come easy. If you find your grip on that promise weakening, remind yourself that God has given you the grace to succeed at whatever He’s called you to do!  The worst thing you can do is ignore His prods, disobey them, argue with them or even try to put them off until tomorrow. The word ‘determined’ can be a real turn-off for some people.  It’s a ‘hard work’ word.  It doesn’t sit well alongside ‘comfy’ and ‘easy’.  You can’t claim any ownership of the word ‘determined’ if you can’t turn off your television and spend a few minutes with God every day.  Starting out by obeying God in little things, not big ones, is the key to developing a determined attitude and lifestyle.  For example, when He prods you to shut your mouth but you keep on talking – that’s when you get into trouble, right? Check this out; long long ago God made a promise to Israel: ‘If you listen to these commands of the LORD your God and carefully obey them the LORD will make you the head and not the tail , and you will always have the upper hand’ (Deuteronomy 28:13 NLT). You can claim that promise for yourself today if you will put your faith in Him and be determined about doing what He says.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>NONE OF THIS FAZES US BECAUSE JESUS LOVES US</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 8:37 TM</span><br>Have you heard the story of the grumpy old farmer whose donkey fell into a well? Since there was no way to get him out the farmer decided to bury him there. Poor donkey! When the shovels of dirt began landing on him he started freaking out. Then this thought struck him; ‘Just shake it off and step on it.’ So he did. Hour after hour as the dirt fell on him he kept telling himself, ‘Just shake it off and step on it.’ No matter how much dirt the farmer threw on him, he just kept shaking it off and stepping on it – until finally and triumphantly he stepped out of the well! 
Life can easily bury you – if you don’t have the right attitude. When they throw mud at you, and they will, just shake it off and step on it. No one can make you feel inferior if you don’t let them. What’s important is not what other people say about you – it’s what you say to yourself after they get through talking! Jesus said, ‘….count yourselves blessed every time people put you down or throw you out or speak lies about you to discredit me. What it means is that the truth is too close for comfort and they are uncomfortable’ (Matthew 5:11 TM). So expect a bit of mudslinging; but don’t let it stick.  You’ve decided to move ahead in life and you‘re leaving others behind; some of them aren’t too happy about it.  The only way to avoid trouble is to do nothing and stay where you are.  And that’s just not acceptable for a child of God – is it?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…“THE LORD KNOWS THOSE THAT BELONG TO HIM”…</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 TIMOTHY 2:19 NCV</span><br>Just as your beliefs can move you forward, ‘The Judges’ in your head can hold you back. ‘The Judges?’ Yeah, you know, like Pop Idol, The Judges are those annoying, criticizing voices in your head telling you you’re not good enough, not talented enough. Today God is challenging you to stop performing for these Judges in your imagination. Don’t let them control you or decide your future. Refuse to allow any word to find a home in you if it contradicts what God says about you. You can’t continually speak failure over your future and then expect good things to happen. Paul says, ‘…He chose us before the world was made…’ (Ephesians1 1:4 NCV). If nobody seems to value you or show you love in any way, this verse still explodes any kind of rejection by letting you know that God chose you! You weren’t just some wonky brick in the pile and God said, ‘Oh, alright, let’s go ahead and add it to the building.’ No, you came pre-cut to fit a particular slot that nobody else can fill. Stop trying to be like other people! If you give up being who you are in order to become like them, you’ll end up being somebody God doesn’t need one more of. Listen: ‘…The Lord knows those that belong to him…’  (2 Timothy 2:19 NCV). The prophet Samuel may have wanted to pick one of Jesse’s other sons to be king, but he couldn’t because God had already chosen David. So stop listening to those Judges.  Nobody else can be you and nobody can take what God has reserved for you!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>“…I AM ABOUT TO DO A BRAND-NEW THING…”</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ISAIAH 43:19 NLT</span><br>God says He wants to ‘…do a brand-new thing…’ That means that the ‘old’ stuff in your life will need to move out of the way for it.  If you haven’t noticed it yet, God first works IN US then works THROUGH US.  For amazing new things to start happening in our schools and colleges, and towns and cities, new things have to happen deep in our lives.  Sometimes these ‘new things’ happen in amazing mountain-top moments.  Sometimes they only come as we are brought through the valley.  
OK – let’s take a really good look at this verse then: ‘…I am about to do a brand-new thing.  See, I have already begun!  Do you not see it?...’  From your perspective it may feel like you’ve been waiting for ever.  That’s because so often don’t see that God has already started something – behind our backs!  To make the most of all the awesome things God plans to do in us and through us we’ve got to be sensitive to his voice, alert to his movements and live in expectation.  After praying and waiting in their prayer room for ten long days we read, ‘Suddenly, there came a sound from heaven…’ (Acts 2:2), and the Holy Spirit touched the crowd of frightened disciples and gave them power that would change the world. When God miraculously brought Paul and Silas out of prison we read, ‘…suddenly there was a great earthquake…and immediately all the doors were opened…’ (Acts 16:26 KJV). God may be getting ready to open some doors for you – make sure you’re ready; because it could happen suddenly!

<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>“HE GIVES POWER TO THOSE WHO ARE TIRED AND WORN OUT…”</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ISAIAH 40:29 NLT</span><br>We can start to self-destruct if we don’t know how to take care of ourselves spiritually. Samson is a prime example.  He was a fighter with amazing strength and courage but his personal life was a mess.  His weakness was for women. He couldn’t handle the loneliness that so often follows great victories. In his story we find no evidence of a life of prayer or worship; only the numbness and inner void of a violent man.  In contrast King David, who was also a fighter, loved to be in God’s presence.  But David also went through a time in his life when he fell out of step with God and let human passions take over. Are you in danger of that happening to you?
There’s all sorts of stuff that can divert your attention away from God.  A hot girl or guy giving you the eye.  A bad habit that’s becoming an addiction.  An important project that’s becoming an obsession.  Watch out!  What delights you tonight might destroy you tomorrow.  Get real about your life today.  Don’t build your life on sand; build it on rock (see Matthew 7:26). Why would anyone look for satisfaction anywhere else but God anyway? ‘He gives power to those who are tired and worn out; he offers strength to the weak. Even youths will become exhausted, and young men will give up. But those who wait on the LORD will find new strength. They will fly high on wings like eagles. They will run and not grow weary. They will walk and not faint’ (Isaiah 40:29-31 NLT).

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>“…IT’S TIME TO CHANGE YOUR WAYS! TURN TO FACE GOD SO HE CAN WIPE AWAY YOUR SINS…”</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ACTS 3:19 TM</span><br>It could be by thought, word or action, but, we all sin more than we care to admit. And there are three ways of dealing with it and only one of them is right! 
1) Brush it off. Don’t think about it; don’t ask if there is mopping up to do. Bury yesterday in all sorts of distracting experiences. Just keep on running. Maybe the past won’t have time to catch up with you.
2) Accept the burden and get used to it. This means living with an increasing weight of guilt, recognizing that life will get slower and slower as the burden gets heavier and heavier. That’s a recipe for depression.
3) Deal with it. A lot of us spend our lives feeling bad about our habits and hang-ups; but we never do anything about them! We need to learn about ‘repentance’; deciding to ‘change your ways’. Jesus told a story about a lad who left home with a load of his dad’s money and made a total mess of his life. When he reached his lowest point, he finally admitted that he was lost: ‘How many of my father’s hired men have food to spare, and here I am starving to death! I will…go back to my father and say to him: ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you’ (Luke 15:17-18 NIV). He was scared that his dad wouldn’t accept him back as a son but instead his father opened his heart and his arms and welcomed him back home. And God will do that for you too, if you’ll just be brave enough to repent.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THOSE WHO LIVE IN THE SHELTER OF THE MOST HIGH WILL FIND REST IN THE SHADOW OF THE ALMIGHTY.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 91:1 NLT</span><br>So there you are, out and about in your coolest T-shirt and suddenly you feel it – splat! – a raindrop dribbles down the back of your neck sending a shiver down your spine.  You were having such a great time with your mates but now the rain intends to spoil your fun. Let’s face it, we are complete wussies in this country when it comes to the weather.  People in other parts of the world have to deal with monsoons and tornados!  Listen: ‘Those who live in the shelter of the Most High will find rest in the shadow of the Almighty.  This I declare of the LORD: “He alone is my refuge, my place of safety; He is my God, and I am trusting him.”’  (Psalm 91:1-2 NLT)
This Psalm is saying that in the storms of life – not rain and sleet and snow – but storms of family problems, health issues and all that stuff, God wants to offer us shelter. There are two ways to go through a storm: in panic or in peace. When a storm suddenly threatened their boat the disciples screamed, ‘…don’t you care if we drown?’  (Mark 4:38 NIV). And where was Jesus? Chilling out on a cushion in the back of the boat! That’s because He understood: a) to get to where God wants to take you, you have to go through storms b) when you’re on God’s business He will get you through c) when it’s over you come out knowing God better, with a story that will inspire and encourage other people.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…BE QUICK TO LISTEN, SLOW TO SPEAK.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JAMES 1:19 NIV</span><br>Want to become a good leader? Become a good listener! Here are two stories of what happens when leaders don’t take time to listen. The first is from a young woman hurt by a manager who constantly cut her off: ‘I expected he would wait and give me answers to serious questions about my work. Many times he walked off when I was in mid-sentence, having heard nothing.’ The next is from a church youth leader who was fired: ‘After serving God there for two years, I was called into an elders’ meeting. They took out a list of all the things I’d done wrong in the past two years. Most of what they said was true, after all, I was brand new in this work. Then they called for my resignation. But not once did one of them care enough to coach or shepherd me. I’d no idea or warning that I was doing anything wrong. 
Why is it so hard for leaders to listen? Because leaders love to talk, they have been blessed with vision and wisdom, but as they gain more authority they think they have less reason to listen. Leaders can easily fail to lead by example when they become removed from the frontlines where the action is.  To keep their edge they must constantly listen to those who are out there in the real world and rely on that information to make wise decisions. When James advised that we should ‘be quick to listen, slow to speak’ he was speaking to everyone; but it is especially relevant for people who want to become leaders.  Two ears, one tongue; it makes sense really doesn’t it!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>“…YOU HAVE A SPECIAL PLACE IN MY HEART…”</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PHILIPPIANS 1:7-8 CEV</span><br>Think back to your best moments: your highest highs, your greatest achievements, your biggest obstacles overcome. How many happened to you alone? Not many, right? When you understand that being connected to other people is one of life’s greatest pleasures, you realize that life’s best comes when we invest in solid relationships. Of the people you know, who seems to enjoy life more – the negative, suspicious and anti-social? No way! The Scrooges of life don’t enjoy much of anything. Jesus summed life up like this: ‘Love the Lord…with all your heart…Love your neighbour as yourself’ (Matthew 22:37-39 NIV). On the other hand, people who love God and love people, live with a smile on their face. If you love God and people you’ll find friends wherever you go. And you’ll get further in life too! There’s no substitute for a positive friendly attitude when it comes to getting on in life. People who alienate themselves have a hard time. Here’s why: a) if people feel like you’re ignoring them, they’ll ignore you back b) if no relationship exists they’re less likely to help you out c) if they think you’re selfish they’ll hope you don’t succeed. So, if you want to get on in life, start investing in solid relationships.  Make it your goal to build friendships like the Apostle Paul did, people about whom he could say ‘…you have a very special place in my heart…I love you…with the tender compassion of Christ Jesus’ (Philippians 1:7-8  NLT).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>“…BE DETERMINED TO RUN THE RACE THAT IS AHEAD…”</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HEBREWS 12:1 CEV</span><br>No British sports fan will forget the shock story of the 2004 Olympics in Athens – Paula Radcliffe was a dead cert to bring home a medal from the marathon.  Suddenly, having reached 23 out of 26 miles her body just seemed to give up on her.  You could see the distressed look on her face as she struggled to come to terms with the fact that she couldn’t go on.  She wouldn’t even be able to finish the race, never mind winning a medal.  The blazing heat and humidity combined with a course that involved several steep hills just got the better of her.  The lesson for us all is – it doesn’t matter how spiritually fit or experienced we think we are, the harsh conditions of life can have a deadly effect on us.  When the heat is on we can’t crash on as if it’s business as usual.  We must learn to pace ourselves so that we reach the finish line and don’t end up left by the roadside.  You don’t want to ruin great opportunities, because you underestimated what it would take to get you to your destination.
Don’t get so spiritual that you overlook the simple things that God has established for us to live healthy lives – the basics like food, sleep, and exercise. Some of us take better care of our dogs and cats than we do of ourselves. Too often we don’t see the link between sleep and exercise and the quality of our relationship with God.  How can you pray when you’re tired? How can you worship when you’re ratty?  If you want to reach your destiny, you must pay attention to your running conditions and learn to pace yourself.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>“…FROM THE ONE WHO HAS BEEN ENTRUSTED WITH MUCH, MUCH MORE WILL BE ASKED.”</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 12:48 NIV</span><br>Christians can be some of the most annoying people on earth! How often do we show our faith by criticizing the people around us, rather than loving them and looking for a chance to say something encouraging. We can ruin our testimony when we give people the impression that we are happy to talk about Jesus but we don’t seem to act like Jesus. The next step from here is to alienate ourselves as an ‘elite group’ looking down on other people who we see as ‘less than’ us. Not Jesus! He rubbed shoulders with everybody. He was amazing at reaching out to those who religious society looked down upon; the prostitutes, the tax collectors, the lepers.
 We like to put people into two boxes: the ones we like and the ones we don’t. Jesus said, ‘From the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked.’ Hey, just because you’ve been called to a higher standard it doesn’t mean you are suddenly ‘better’ than everyone else.  It means you will be expected to show greater wisdom, humility, and grace in the midst of all sorts of hassles and tension. If your family and friends aren’t part of a Christian community, the only chance they have of seeing the fruit of the Holy Spirit in operation, is in your life. By responding with patience, love and grace you’ll make a lasting impact on them – one that could lift them up into the arms of the Jesus you claim to serve.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>BE PREPARED...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 6:13 TM</span><br>The pollution in our environment is not just to do with acid rain, exhaust fumes and industrial waste.  There’s also a kind of pollution which can invade our attitudes, thoughts and behaviour.  You can find a list of this bad stuff in Colossians 3:5-9. But God has given us protective clothing so that we won’t get contaminated.  Listen: ‘…clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience.  Bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances you may have against oneanother…And over all these virtues put on love…’  (Colossians 3:12-14 NIV).  Learn how to get dressed in these holy clothes every day.  Maybe you’d like to pray the following prayer to get you started:  ‘Father, thank you for all the blessings in my life.  As I get ready for today, protect me, strengthen me, use me to bless the people around me.  Let me see the world through Your eyes.  May Your Word and Your presence overflow from my life, neutralizing all the pollution of pride, insensitivity, anger and failure. My hope is in You, not anything in this world, so I step out in the knowledge that you see all I do, and that my life will make a difference.  Amen’ 
Ships sail on water, but if the water starts getting in, even a battleship will sink. So today, go forward through the murky waters of life without allowing them to get into your hull.  God’s destiny for you is that you would go the distance and get safely to your final destination.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I APPEAL TO YOU…THAT YOU MAY BE PERFECTLY UNITED IN MIND AND THOUGHT.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 CORINTHIANS 1:10 NIV</span><br>A bloke walking down a street one day noticed a woman struggling with a washing machine in the doorway of a house. When he volunteered to help, the struggling woman was overjoyed. After several minutes of struggling but getting nowhere the man said to the woman, ‘We’ll never get this washing machine in there.’ To which the woman replied in amazement, ‘In? I’m trying to get it out!’ Cooperation is impossible without good communication. And that principle holds whether it’s with your family, your friends or your church. Never assume that anybody ‘knows’ anything! The truth is, some people are afraid to admit that they don’t know stuff because they feel embarrassed. Others need more time and personal attention before they ‘get it.’ If you have a reputation for being a fast-mover with a short fuse, people won’t feel comfortable asking for your help. So, if everything’s going Pete Tong the problem could be your inability to communicate clearly, rather than their inability to do listen properly. 
Without clear communication two things happen: 
1) People get discouraged and depressed, like one person who complained, ‘I feel like I’m part of a mushroom farm; left completely in the dark and fed manure from time to time! 
2) People make up their own rules, and chaos results. So, if there’s strife and confusion around you, rather than harmony and understanding, go back and read Paul’s thoughts on good communication: ‘I appeal to you…that you may be perfectly united in mind and thought.’

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…FOOLS SPEND WHATEVER THEY GET.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 21:20 NLT</span><br>The Bible says loads about cash; there are promises of being blessed and warnings about being greedy.  It’s clear that God wants us to have the right attitude to money. Listen to this: ‘…Fools spend whatever they get.’ So how does God want us to live?
Here’s three Ca$h Attitudes: 
1) ‘I’m okay, I’m making ends meet.’ That’s like saying you feel great doing the splits, which for 99.9% of people is extremely painful – if not impossible!  God says, ‘Pay all your debts…’ (Romans 13:8 NLT), because when you’re in it up to your neck one little wave can spell disaster 
2) ‘I plan to work till I drop.’ What’ll happen if you can’t work? What if you ‘drop’ sooner than you expect?  Trusting in your ability to earn a living is just a form of arrogance.  Do you think God will be impressed if you start clocking up 60 hours a week at the cost of your relationship with Him? 
3) ‘I earned it so I’ll spend it!’  God’s generosity is one of His most amazing qualities. So how can we claim to belong to Him if there is no evidence of generosity in our life?  If money is getting a hold of your heart there’s one really easy way to break its grip – give it away!  The Bible says: ‘…God loves people who love to give’ (2 Corinthians 9:7 CEV) and ‘Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over…’  (Luke 6:38 NIV). That’s the kind of Ca$h Attitude to have!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>PRAY ALL THE TIME.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 THESSALONIANS 5:17 TM</span><br>OK - so today we’ll cover some practical stuff to help you with your daily rhythm of prayer: 
1) Start your day right. When you first wake up and you’re enjoying your duvet more than you’re looking forward to the world outside, pray! ‘God, thanks for a new day, help me make the most of it – let it be a day of destiny!’ Then instead of clicking on the TV or radio, open your Bible, read a Psalm or something from the life of Jesus.  Let the words inspire you and challenge you. 
2) Tune in to visual clues. Use your daily routine as a trigger for prayer. For example, when you’re showering, pray, ‘Jesus, give me a clean heart and a right attitude’ (Paraphrase, see Psalm 51:10). Whenever you meet somebody, silently ask God to bless them. When your school or college friends are being idiots pray, ‘Lord, give me grace, help me be a light where it’s dark.’ That’s how you ‘pray all the time.’ 
3) Invent ways to stay focused. Ever notice how your mind wanders the minute you start praying? Try using a note pad while you pray, just jot down the things that are distracting you under the headline ‘I’ll get to that later’ then talk to God with an uncluttered mind. And remember, God wants to talk to you too, so be alert and listen. What He tells you will be more important than anything else you’ll hear that day. With a bit of rhythm, creativity and determination you can ‘pray all the time.’ But first you have to want to.  Do you?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>PRAY ALL THE TIME.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 THESSALONIANS 5:17 TM</span><br>Paul says, ‘Pray all the time.’ Why? Because whether you’re exercising, chilling out, shopping, or sitting at an exam desk, God loves to hear from you; He really does. Author Cheri Fuller writes: ‘I used to think if I didn’t pray at a certain time each day, my prayers didn’t count. Then I discovered that Paul’s command to ‘Pray all the time,’ means more than just spending a lot of time on your knees; it means having constant communication with God, and an increasing awareness of His presence. This didn’t really sink in until my son left for college. Busy with his studies, he didn’t call home often. But when he did I’d drop everything just to hear his voice! Now I realize that God feels the same way about me, only 100 times more! I also noticed throughout the Bible God used short prayers to accomplish great things – like raising the dead and parting the Red Sea. Then it dawned on me that thoughts such as, ‘If I can’t pray for an hour, why bother?’ are foolish. It’s wonderful to have longer prayer sessions when I can, but knowing short prayers have a big impact, encourages me to pray throughout the day.’ 
Everyone has their own rhythm of prayer.  Some people pray really well early in the morning.  Some find it more exciting late at night.  Some pray like Daniel, three times a day.  Pay attention to your pattern of prayer today.  How is the quality?  How is the quantity?  Are you really opening up or just going through the motions?  God loves to hear your voice, so stay in touch today.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>“…IF YOU OPEN YOUR EYES WIDE IN WONDER AND BELIEF, YOUR BODY FILLS UP WITH LIGHT.”</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 6:22 TM</span><br>You’re at the cinema watching the latest blockbuster… there’s a moment when everything goes quiet then ‘AAAAAGGHH!’ the bad guy suddenly appears on the screen and you jump right out of your seat!  Why? Because your eyes are wired right into the core of your brain and you have built-in reactions which you have very little control over. Jesus said ‘Your eyes are windows into your body. If you open your eyes wide in wonder and belief, your body fills up with light.’ (Matthew 6:22 TM) We live in a hugely visual culture. It seems that everywhere you look these days there is a new advertising display unit or TV screen. You only have to walk into a newsagent and scan the shelves briefly to see that the magazine publishers will do all they can to appeal to the most basic human impulses. 
You see, pictures work like a springboard to a new level of thought. Do you have a treasured photo album? Why is it so important to you? It's because of the memories and emotions those images trigger. But the even more amazing thing about the brain God’s given us is - we can 'see' even with our eyes closed - our mind can create mental movies! Christian monks do this quite a lot in their prayers, they call it ‘visualisation’. It’s about forming an image that inspires your mind – an ocean of God’s love – His promises as firm as a mountain.  The Apostle Paul told his mates, ‘…Think about things that are pure and lovely and admirable. Think about things that are excellent and worthy of praise’ (Philippians 4:8 NLT). What will you visualise today?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>SAY TO THOSE WHO ARE FEARFUL-HEARTED, “BE STRONG…”</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ISAIAH 35:4 NKJV</span><br>An old man was asked what had stolen most of his life’s joy. He replied, ‘Things that never happened!’ Sad isn’t it. You see, our fears are the worst liars in the world; we should never make decisions based on them. Instead we should: 
1) Tackle them head-on. King David did: ‘When I am afraid, I put my trust in you’ (Psalm 56:3 NLT). Bill Hybels is pastor of one of the world’s biggest churches.  As a kid he was very timid, but his dad kept challenging him. Bill says, ‘He’d take me down to our produce company and bark out, “Billy, reverse that lorry!” …I’d drag myself into the cab of that 40-foot artic, shaking with fear. Sometimes it would take me 45 minutes and the lorry would be half jackknifed…but when I crawled out, dad would say, “Good job.” And next time…it would be easier.’ How do you conquer your fear? By confronting it! 
2) Hang out with brave people. Solomon said, ‘He who walks with the wise grows wise…’ (Proverbs 13:20 NIV). Success rubs off; so does failure! Don’t hang out with people who habitually cave in or play it safe. Hang out with brave people. If you can’t find any, read up on Bible characters like Daniel, Deborah, Esther and Peter 
3) Go for it. Dealing with fear isn’t optional, it’s foundational. You need it to live each day for Jesus, to build better relationships, to reach the lost, and care for the broken. Today God says to those who are fearful: ‘Be strong.’ But you can’t sit back and expect Him to do all the work; you’ve got to deal with your fears!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…GOD WILL HEAR OUR PRAYERS WHEN WE ASK FOR WHAT PLEASES HIM</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>I JOHN 5.14. CEV</span><br>Reality check today: are your prayers ever self-centred?  Is there a possibility that your prayer is going off at a tangent from God’s destiny for you? ‘…God will hear our prayers when we ask for what pleases Him.’ God isn’t some kind of genie that comes out of a bottle to grant your every wish. Too many prayers are about our human wishes not God’s holy plans.
Three examples: 
1) The trivial. We pray for good weather for our day out when maybe it hasn’t rained for ages and the farmer down the road needs water! If you remember when you pray that your life is part of God’s bigger picture, then your prayers will become stepping stones to wisdom and maturity. 
2) The selfish. Listen: ‘…your prayers are not answered, because you pray…for selfish reasons’ (James 4:3 CEV). One young woman at a prayer group said, ‘My boyfriend’s army unit just got called to the Middle East. Please pray he won’t have to go.’ It’s easy to understand her worries, but her request is a bit selfish. He’s a soldier who has signed up for a very dangerous job. Our lives often include risk and hardship, so God promises peace and protection, not immunity and comfort. 
3) The controlling. Jesus said, ‘Don’t bargain with God. Be direct. Ask for what you need…’ (Luke 11:10 TM). Why ask God to make the people in your life conform to your wishes, when He doesn’t even force them to conform to His? Jesus taught us to pray ‘…your will be done…’ God always answers when we ask ‘for what pleases him’.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…INSTEAD OF WORRYING, PRAY...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PHILIPPIANS 4:6 TM</span><br>Striving to do better is a good thing, but perfectionism isn’t.  A mother of three children complained to her doctor, ‘I just can’t get the house cleaned the way I like it before everyone leaves in the morning.’ She was so stressed out, he put her on antidepressants. But why? Nobody was holding a gun to her head saying, ‘Every dish must be put away and every towel folded – or else!’ Life had become one big ‘to-do list’ and she could never get to the bottom of it. Yet no one but herself had created the stress she was experiencing – and passing on to her family!
Answer these questions: 
1) Have my ambitions become so all consuming that I’ve forgotten how to just chill and be happy? 
2) Have I made ‘having everything under control’ a condition for my happiness? 
3) Do I beat myself (or other people) up when I can’t meet my own stupidly unrealistic expectations? 
The first step toward recovering your peace is to make sure that none of the stress in your life is self-inflicted.  The second is realizing that life will not pay any attention to your fancy plans anyway.  So don’t risk losing your friends or making yourself ill.  Whether it’s obsessing over your looks, or your performance at school or college, the roots of perfectionism grow in the soil of insecurity. Don’t listen to any voice that whispers, ‘You’ll never measure up!’ That’s a lie; don’t believe it. You are loved, approved and accepted – by God! Your worth comes from Him, and His opinion of you never changes!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>“…I SEARCHED FOR SOMEONE TO STAND IN THE GAP…BUT I FOUND NO ONE.”</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EZEKIEL 22:30 NLT</span><br>When Chris Milbrath went to work with Co-Mission in the Ukraine, the last thing he envisioned was being hospitalized. He had a constant hardcore stomach-ache. His doctor diagnosed a ruptured appendix and told him that without surgery he’d die. Things didn’t go well and infection set in. Then halfway across the world a lady who was one of Chris’s prayer supporters woke suddenly during the night. She didn’t know why, but she knew she had to pray for him. Within 24 hours a missions group in Moscow heard about the situation. A small jet ‘just happened to be available’ to airlift Chris to Geneva where one of Switzerland’s best surgeons ‘just happened to be available’ to perform additional surgery that saved his life. Later, comparing notes and making adjustments for the different time zones, they discovered that her prayer-burden ‘just happened to coincide’ with the time he was clinging to life. Chris said, ‘I can’t help wondering what would’ve happened to me if that woman had just rolled over and said, “I’ll pray for Chris tomorrow.’’ God says, ‘“I searched for someone to stand in the gap…but I found no one.”’ Prayer can be a lonely business with very anti-social hours! Prayer warriors realize what’s at stake and stay on their knees until they sense they’ve broken through and God’s heard them. James writes, ‘…When a believing person prays, great things happen’ (James 5:16 NCV). So when God prompts you to pray for somebody, don’t wait – do it! Your prayers may be the only thing standing between that person and catastrophe.

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…A WOMAN WHO FEARS THE LORD IS TO BE PRAISED.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 31:30 NIV</span><br>Amy Carmichael was born in Ireland in 1867. She was one of those people who didn’t fit the mould. Her unconventional outlook was a problem for those who were more dedicated to maintaining tradition than to reaching a lost world. During her early years as a missionary, a ‘Get-Amy-out-of-India’ movement was started by people who didn’t understand her unwavering obedience to what she believed to be God’s will for her life. In her book, Roots, she writes: ‘It’s not that we think…ours is the only way of living, but we are sure…it’s the way meant for us.’ Amy served God in Japan, China and Sri Lanka before being called to India where she spent her time working with children, especially young girls forced into temple prostitution. Tenderness marked her life, but not weakness. She had an ‘iron fist in a velvet glove’ approach. Burning with holy anger she’d storm into a mob to rescue a little girl, then weep openly about the child’s situation. When she died in 1951 she was buried under a tamarind tree in a grave marked by the Indian word for mother: Amma. Have you ever noticed how often single women are called to do some of the toughest jobs? Did you know that the majority (though certainly not all) of missionaries are women? The Bible says, ‘Charm is deceptive, and beauty…fleeting; but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised.’ Today if God’s calling you to be another Amy Carmichael, don’t be scared of saying ‘yes’, because the safest place in the world is right in the centre of His will.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…WE ARE HIS PEOPLE, THE SHEEP HE TENDS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 100:3 NCV</span><br>Sheep are not the cleverest of animals; so it’s not very flattering when the Bible compares us to them!  But there is stuff we can learn.  So just for now, get creative and imagine you’re a sheep, living in the middle-eastern landscape of the Bible. Thorns prick. Rocks cut. Mosquitoes bite. So the shepherd regularly inspects his sheep searching for wounds. That’s because he doesn’t want today’s wound to become tomorrow’s infection. King David, who was a teenage shepherd writes: ‘We are his people, the sheep he tends.’ He was referring to God. 
Right, you can stop being a sheep now, but listen; God does care for you, and actually much more than he cares about sheep!  God has a whole load of special soul-remedies that heal and protect.   Like a sheep you need to stand still for a minute and let the shepherd do his work. Peter writes, ‘Be humble under God’s powerful hand so He will lift you up when the right time comes’ (1 Peter 5:6 NCV).
Are you one of those people who asks lots of questions; you need to work it all out in your head?  Great; as long as that doesn’t stop you simply trusting God. God will always give what is right to his people. (See Luke 18:7 NCV). Sheep don’t understand how the smelly ointment repels mosquitoes or heals wounds. All the sheep know is that something happens in the presence of their shepherd, that doesn’t happen anywhere else. And when push comes to shove that’s all we need to know as well.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>LET’S KEEP FOCUSED ON THAT GOAL, THOSE OF US WHO WANT EVERYTHING GOD HAS FOR US...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PHILIPPIANS 3:15 TM</span><br>Following Jesus means getting involved in the business of change; changing lives, changing families, changing communities… but not everyone likes change. In 1829, Martin Van Buren, Governor of New York, wrote to President Andrew Jackson warning him about the future.
‘President Jackson, the canal system of this country is being threatened by the spread of railroads. We must preserve the canals for the following reasons: 
1) If canal boats are supplanted by railroads, serious unemployment will result. Captains, cooks, repairmen and lock tenders will be left without jobs, not to mention farmers now employed in growing hay for horses.
2) Boat builders would suffer, whip and harness makers would be left destitute.
3) Canal boats are absolutely essential to the defence of the United States. In the event of the expected trouble with England, the Erie Canal would be the only means by which we could ever move the supplies so vital to waging modern war. As you may well know, Mr. President, railroad carriages are pulled at the enormous speed of 15 mph by engines, which, in addition to endangering life and limb, snort their way through the countryside belching out smoke, setting fire to crops, scaring the livestock and frightening women and children. Surely the Almighty never intended people should travel at such breakneck speed.’
You might think that’s just a funny story from a long time ago but even in these times of rapidly advancing technology people still don’t like change.  And sadly, the church has lost its revolutionary edge over the years.  It probably needs to embrace change now more than ever.  Will you be one of the change-makers?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>“…I HAVE LONGED TO GATHER YOUR CHILDREN TOGETHER, AS A HEN GATHERS HER CHICKS UNDER HER WINGS…”</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 23:37 NIV</span><br>We hear a lot about God being our Father and Jesus being His Son. Does this mean that women are kind of spiritually sidelined then? Not at all. When we speak of God as Father we don’t actually mean He’s a bloke – it’s not a reference to maleness – in fact it’s nothing to do with gender at all. And Jesus, all though he actually did become a man in every sense of the word, could still see the world in amazingly female ways. Here’s a great example
In the event of a fire on the farm a mother hen has  an innate response: to gather her chicks tightly under her wings. When the fire has done it's worst all that's left is the blackened embers. Sifting through the smouldering debris afterwards you would find the charred remains of that mother hen. But if you were then to lift what's left of its matted carcass, underneath you'd find, preserved and eagerly chattering, every one of that mother hen’s little brood.
In the days before His death, Jesus cried ‘“O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing.”’ You see, He saw the danger of the flames of judgement coming, and was yearning for us to enter the protection of His embrace. Like that mother hen He made the ultimate sacrifice so that we could live.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>“…WHATEVER YOU DID FOR ONE OF THE LEAST OF THESE…YOU DID IT FOR ME.”</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 25:40 NIV</span><br>Her parents didn’t want her, so at birth they put her in foster care. Shuffled from place to place, she dreamed of the day they’d return. It never happened. So, she lashed out at the world by attempting suicide. Then through a series of events she found her parents again. She lived with them but things were strained. When they told her they wanted to adopt a baby and ‘start over,’ she longed to be included. But when she said, ‘I don’t want to be a burden, so maybe I should go’ her dad helped her pack. Cramming her possessions into a bin bag, he pressed a tenner into her hand and said goodbye. Today she lives on the streets, sleeps in doorways and scrounges just enough food to live on. Sadly, her story’s not unique. It’s been multiplied into infinity. In fact, there’s probably somebody just like her in your town or city; forgotten, unloved and isolated. They’re usually the hardest to reach because they feel unwanted and useless. They wrestle with inferiority, poor self-image and lack of self-respect. What do we do? Instead of loving them we label them. Instead of caring, we criticize. What should we do? Open our hearts. Love is much more than giving a bit of your loose change.  It takes time to develop and grow. So start early. Remember, that tough exterior is just a cover up. Every day look for new ways to reach out, encourage, and show hurting people you care. Why? Because Jesus said, ‘“…whatever you did for one of the least of these…you did it for Me.”’ And you won’t get a better reason than that!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>“…WHERE ARE THE OTHER NINE?”</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 17:17 NIV</span><br>One day ten men with the deadly disease leprosy came to Jesus saying, ‘…have pity on us…!’  It was obvious that they were desperate for whatever charity Jesus might provide. ‘…Go show yourselves to the priests…’ was Jesus’ response. ‘As they went,’ the Bible says, ‘they were cleansed’ (Luke 17:12-14). But the story doesn’t end there. ‘One of them, when he saw he was healed, came back, praising God in a loud voice. He threw himself at Jesus’ feet and thanked him – and he was a Samaritan’ (Luke 17:15-16 NIV). Great isn’t it; but the story doesn’t end there. Jesus asks, ‘…Where are the other nine?’ (Luke 17:17 NIV). Jesus is making a point: saying thank you is important to Him.
This story is in our Bibles to point out the importance of getting verbal with our thanks.  Just feeling grateful isn’t enough – you have to say it – and this guy said it loud! The words ‘He came back’, are worth underlining. When was the last time you ‘came back’ to say thanks to the One who made it all possible. Thanks isn’t a natural thing for most of us, so we need to practice – lots! ‘Thanks’ shows humility: that I can’t get along by myself. ‘Thanks’ shows reliance: that I need people around me, and that I need God. ‘Thanks’ shows value: that I recognize the cost involved in giving. ‘Thanks’ shows gladness: that my life has been filled with a joy that only comes when I reach out to others with grace.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>“FORGET THE FORMER THINGS; DO NOT DWELL ON THE PAST. SEE, I AM DOING A NEW THING!”</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ISAIAH 43:18-19 NIV</span><br>Christian author Gordon Macdonald wrote, ‘When I asked a ninety-three-year-old man if he and his ninety year old wife ever have conflict, he assured me they do. I asked him how they treat each other in such moments, and he told me how important it is that he speaks tenderly to her. When I asked why, he told me that when his wife was a girl her father always spoke to her in a harsh and hurtful tone of voice. “Now whenever she hears any man speak in an angry manner, the feelings of hurt and fear return.”’ I said “are you telling me that she still remembers”’ “More than ever!” he responded. When we are little kids we watch those who are the most significant people in our lives and see how they act, how they express anger, joy, sadness or fear. We react now to what we saw then. So what should you do with those painful memories? The Bible gives us some pretty good suggestions: 
1) Practise repentance, in other words admit when you’re wrong and say sorry! We often inherit the behaviour of people who brought us up so if you do stuff wrong say sorry
2) Have grace. Forgive people when they hurt you and forgive yourself! 
3) Be thankful, focus on the good stuff rather than the bad. Everyone will make mistakes so let it go and move on
4) Be wise, find a way to turn your tough experiences into pain into learning experiences

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>“…IF I HAVE CHEATED ANYBODY OUT OF ANYTHING, I WILL PAY BACK FOUR TIMES THE AMOUNT.”</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 19:8 NIV</span><br>Zacchaeus discovered that you can’t be right with God until you’re right with those you’ve hurt. Relationships are like a house. If you don’t look after it and fix stuff straight away, you won’t be doing repairs you’ll be rebuilding it! Everything that happens in the past makes us the people we become. The past will influence our relationships, our choices, our view of ourselves and even how we see God. You can’t live a spiritually healthy life if your past isn’t repaired. 
For a long time Jacob lived that way. He took advantage of his brother Esau, ripping him off with inheritance money that Jacob wasn’t entitled to. After that he did a runner. Eventually (years later) Jacob came home, terrified of what his brother would do. In that case Esau forgave his brother and the relationship was sorted but that’s not always the case. Repairing the past is better done straight away. Fixing up wounded relationships, dealing with regrets, letting go of feelings towards someone who’s betrayed you; these things will stay inside as though we’re asleep. Suddenly they will be triggered by a song on the radio or face in a crowd or a date on the calendar.  They won’t go away until we deal with them. How? By forgiving. Forgiveness isn’t for the other person’s benefit – it’s for yours. So is there a relationship you need to repair today? If so, take care of it, God will help you.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>MAY THE LORD MAKE YOUR LOVE INCREASE AND OVERFLOW FOR EACH OTHER...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 THESSALONIANS 3:12 NIV</span><br>So, what does it mean to be generous? And generous with…what? 
1) Your time. Listen to what Paul said about his mate Onesiphorus. ‘May the Lord show mercy to …Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains…he searched hard for me until he found me’ (2 Timothy 1:16-17). Doesn’t he sound like a good bloke? He’s the type who will stand by you and go out of his way to be there no matter what
2) Your encouragement. Paul had a mate called Barnabas (which means ‘son of encouragement’). Barny was the one who played a huge role in Paul’s success and when everyone else doubted he was even a Christian, Barnabas welcomed him in. The last mention of Barny is of defending another guy who needed a second chance, John Mark. Are you willing to do that for others? 
3) Your cash. Jesus watched loads of people giving money to look good but none of them impressed him at all. The one who caught his eye was a poor widow. Jesus called his disciples over and explained that she had given more than the others. The bit she gave was all she had whereas the others gave their left-overs (see Mark 12:43-44). We may love glamour and power but Jesus looks for true generosity. So you think you’re generous? Generous with…what?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I PRESS ON TOWARDS THE GOAL TO WIN THE PRIZE...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PHILIPPIANS 3:14 NIV</span><br>Here’s a little history from across the pond…right across America lies the Transcontinental Railroad. When the railroad was started some people thought it would be a great idea to hold a ceremony and loads of important people were invited to the place where the first rail was to be laid. One of the West Coast’s biggest backers of the railroad was invited to the ceremony but he refused to go. Instead he said ‘Anybody can drive the first spike, but there are months of labour and unrest between the first and last spike.’ The railroad was finally completed in May 1869 with a golden spike and a telegram informing the President. 
Starting something new is never difficult; it’s finishing that’s the problem! Imagine how many people have a half written book sat in their bottom drawer or have a half decorated room in their house. How many people have started to learn instruments or a language or bought expensive running shoes determined to get fit? Everyday thousands of us start new things but never even see the end in sight. Paul said ‘I press on toward the goal to win the prize…’ Instead of starting something you have no intention of finishing how about asking God today what He wants you to do, and do it with all your energy and might? With God’s help you may just reach your goal, win the prize and it will be seriously worth all the effort.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…I LIFT UP MY EYES TO YOU, TO YOU WHO’S THRONE IS IN HEAVEN.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 123:1 NIV</span><br>Ever had one of those days when everything seems to be going wrong, life has a distinct feeling of rubbishness about it and God seems to have vanished entirely? Those are the days that generally go one of two ways. Either you wake up the next morning and everything feels ok again or you wake up and everything seems ten times worse! Satan will use these times to bring up your insecurities, tell you lies about your relationships or the way you spend your time or your church. Suddenly everything is about you. Nothing EVER goes right for you, God loves everyone EXCEPT you, everyone else is joyful and happy and you’re left wondering what on earth life is about. 
The reality is God does love you and He does care. You’re not so special that you’re the only one to get left out! You see it’s these moments in life that challenge, change and grow us. How you react to those days will have a lasting impact on how you live your life. If you believe the lies and spend the day wallowing in self-pity, that will carry on until you lift your head and chose not to believe that stuff. But, to lift your head and say ‘God, I feel rubbish. I don’t understand you but I know you are God, I know you love me and I’m going to worship you anyway’, takes a lot of faith and a new way of thinking. But it’s guaranteed, you won’t feel rubbish for long and you will learn an awful lot about God very very quickly!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THAT I MAY KNOW HIM…</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PHILIPPIANS 3:10 KJV</span><br>Luke gives us an amazing description of a lady called Anna, who recognised Jesus as being the Son of God: ‘Anna the prophetess was also there…by now a very old woman. She had been married seven years and a widow eighty four. She never left the temple area, worshipping night and day…At the very time Simeon was praying, she showed up, broke into an anthem of praise to God, and talked about the (Christ) child to all’ (Luke 2:36-37 TM). Anna never stopped searching for God! What a challenge to people who get older and never get any further or deeper with God! Sadly as many people ‘grow up’ and get older the fire begins to burn out and they can easily spend the second half of their life never moving forward, never going deeper and never reclaiming their lost passion. 
This happens for loads of reasons. It may be caused by disappointment – they haven’t seen promises of God happen or feel they’ve been let down by Him some way. It may be that other things, relationships, children, work etc, just take a higher priority! The crazy thing is that it’s obvious if you want to stop a fire going out, you put more fuel on it! Anna never left the temple for 84 years, now that’s stoking the fire! As youngsters you have a choice about the way you live your life. You can put things in place to make sure that fire keeps being stoked. Set aside time to seek God and make sure that’s your no.1 priority, for the rest of your life!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WATCH YOUR LIFE AND DOCTRINE CLOSELY..</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 TIMOTHY 4:15 NIV</span><br>‘Spiritual discipline’ – two words most of us hate. What does it mean? It means making ourselves do stuff that doesn’t come easily in order to know God more. It doesn’t sound like much fun, and often it’s not but it’s absolutely essential if we want to get anywhere with God! It’s important to remember that satan will make you think it’s really hard and not worth it so you don’t even try. In reality though, when you’re closer to God and growing it’s totally worth everything you found hard to get there! Developing spiritual discipline is demanding, mostly done in secret and usually humbling. 
Demanding? Absolutely. It means being harder on yourself than you want to be. You need to think about your speech, relationships, life choices and if they’re not good enough, change them! Done in secret? Too right. Talk is cheap. Telling everyone everything that’s going on is not wise. How do you know someone’s wise? A good sign of wisdom is someone who thinks carefully before they speak! Humbling? O yes! Realising your weaknesses and all the areas you need to change and grow is never going to make you feel great! Spiritual discipline means that you stick with it while others make excuses and fall away. Listen to Paul: ‘…I’m running hard for the finish line. I’m giving it everything I’ve got. No sloppy living for me! I’m staying alert and in top condition. I’m not going to get caught napping, telling everyone else all about it and then missing out myself’ (1 Corinthians 9:26-27 TM).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>“…HE CALLS HIS OWN SHEEP BY NAME AND LEADS THEM OUT.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 10:3 NLT</span><br>When we see a flock of sheep, we see exactly that – a flock. All the same. Shepherds disagree; to them every sheep has a story and every face a name. When we see a crowd of people, we can think like we do about that flock of sheep - all the same. Jesus disagrees; to him every person has a story and every face a name. ‘“I have written your name on My hand…”’ (Isaiah 49:16 NLT). How good is that? Your name – on God’s hand where He sees it constantly. You may have seen your name on some impressive things – a trophy or certificate or maybe in your local newspaper but on God’s hands and lips – quite a thought isn’t it!
That means what matters to you, matters to God. You probably think that’s true when it comes to big stuff like death, illness, sin or disaster. But what about the little stuff like driving lessons, arguments with your friends or a little cold? Get this: you are God’s child. John writes: ‘…we really are His children…’ (1 John 3:1 NCV). It’s almost like John knew some of us we shake our heads and think ‘Don’t be daft. Maybe Mother Teresa or Billy Graham is, but not me!' If that is what you think then this word really is for you: ‘We really are His children’. That means He’s your parent. As a parent it is important to your kids then it’s important to you.  How much more is that true when God is the parent! Try to hold onto that truth today.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…FOR THE PEOPLE WORKED WITH ALL THEIR HEART</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>NEHEMIAH 4:6 NIV</span><br>Read Nehemiah chapter three. In this story Nehemiah has been given permission to rebuild the broken walls of Jerusalem, and chapter three shows us how he did it. Team work. Nehemiah brought together every group he could find from priests to perfume-makers and each group rebuilt their own section of the wall. Alone it was impossible but together, they achieved what everyone said they couldn’t. Notice some things about teamwork: 
1) The team members must care for one another. In football you have to pass the ball! If a player goes for glory, refusing to pass to an unmarked man in better position, the chances are he will lose the ball. No one is more important than another 2) The team must communicate. In Hurricane Katrina, hundreds died while those who could have been rescued them stood by. Why? Communication broke down
3) ‘Your rights’ must take second place. The success of the team will always be more important than the success of the individual. If you think ‘I’ll do it myself so I know it’s done right you’re robbing others of the chance to take part, learn and grow.
If Nehemiah had tried to build the wall himself with his own team, it wouldn’t have happened. It was only through encouraging everyone to play their own unique part that the wall got built. Sure, every section probably looked a bit different but the city was secure again, and that was the goal! The bottom line, God blesses those who work together in unity.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>ENCOURAGE ONE ANOTHER AND BUILD EACH OTHER UP...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 THESSALONIANS 5:11 NIV</span><br>After 30 years of marriage his wife was ready to throw in the towel. ‘I have had it, living with you. You never tell me you love me anymore.’ The husband replied, ‘I told you I loved you when we got married; if I change my mind I’ll let you know.’ Way too many leaders expect their followers to run on autopilot like the guy in the story. They don’t get that people do much better if they think they’re appreciated. Comments like ‘don’t worry, you’ll get your reward in the end’ don’t help! We are all working for a ‘well done’ on that final day but still, God expects us to pat each other on the back along the way. Paul wrote ‘Encourage one another and build one another up...’
It may well look as though some people don’t need encouragement, like they can just keep working away but even the strongest person needs a little something every now and then. Often as you encourage someone they won’t know what to do with it, probably give an uncomfortable smile, a quick ‘thanks’ and change subject. These are the people that don’t believe much good about them selves and need even more love – until it goes in! Go out of your way to encourage your leaders! These people often need it most! No matter who you are, I guarantee a little email of ‘you’re doing a good job’ or pat on the back when you see them could be just the thing they need. Compliments disappear pretty soon after we’ve said them which is why you can never give enough!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I WILL SING OF YOUR LOVE AND JUSTICE...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 101:1 NLT</span><br>Today we’re going to take a look at the five ‘I wills’ of David in Psalm 101: 
1) ‘I will sing of your love and justice...’ (v1.) When dealing with others, some of us are all mercy and no justice; others are all justice with no mercy. God needs both. 
2) ‘I will be careful to live a blameless life…’ (v2). How you behave will impact someone much more than what you believe. Even if someone doesn’t hold the same beliefs as you and can still be won over by your love and lifestyle. 
3) ‘…I will lead a life of integrity in my own home’ (v2). How many of us struggle to live right more at home than anywhere? If your family thinks you’re joyless and judgmental you’ll never see them become Christians. David prayed, ‘…how I need Your help, especially in my own home, where I long to act as I should’ (Psalm 101:2 TLB). 
4) ‘I will refuse to look at anything vile or vulgar…’ (v3). Get real. TV is on 7 hours a day in most homes. Look at some of the things you’re watching – violence, sex, abuse, bad language etc. You may say you’ve no time to hang with God and pray but is the truth that you don’t really want to? 
5) ‘I will not tolerate people who slander their neighbours…’ (v5). How many times a day do you hear people moaning or badmouthing about someone else? How about just for once you don’t accept it. Even if they have a point, defend the person, correct their comments then walk away. Those are five fantastic ‘I wills’ to live by today!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>TO YOU, O LORD, I LIFT UP MY SOUL.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 25:1 NIV</span><br>Read Psalm 25. It describes a person who’s chosen the right road, yet not found it easy to walk. In the first ten verses we learn five things about the person who prays:
1) (v1) They know where to go for help ‘To You, O LORD, I lift up my soul’ Others can help us and we often go for help everywhere we can think of before God but only He can truly help and sustain us 
2) (v2) They know who to trust. ‘In you I trust…do not let me be put to shame, nor let my enemies triumph over me,’ Love your enemies, because God does. Whatever others say or do to you it’s them that will be answerable to God. Pray for them, give them to God, then move on 
3) (v4) They know what prayer’s all about. ‘Show me your ways, O Lord, teach me your paths.’ When we pray we change. We get some of Gods heart, we learn His ways, we find out who He is and we realise our weaknesses and need of Him. It’s one of the main tools God uses to transform us. When we pray life, choices and paths become clear. At that point we have a choice whether to go deeper with God or to abandon it and refuse to change 
4) (v7) They know why they’re saved. ‘…According to your love remember me…’ We can’t get to God because of what we’ve done, it’s all about His grace and love! 
5) (v9) They know prayer works. ‘He guides the humble in what is right…’ When you can’t see the way forward, pray. God will show you one step at a time.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE RIGHTEOUS MAN WALKS IN...INTEGRITY; BLESSED ARE HIS CHILDREN AFTER HIM.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 20:7 AMP</span><br>Author Max Lucado writes: ‘Today’s my first [Father’s Day] without a father. For 31 years I had one of the best but now he’s...buried under an oak tree in a west Texas cemetery. Strange he isn’t here...because he was always available. His words were nothing novel; his achievements, though admirable, were nothing extraordinary. But his presence was. 
Because he was there life went smoothly...the future was secure...and my growing up was what God intended. He taught me how to shave and how to pray. Helped me memorize verses for Sunday school, and taught me that wrong should be punished...that rightness has its own reward. He modeled... the elusive balance between ambition and self-acceptance. 
I knew if I ever needed him he’d be there. Like a warm fireplace. Maybe that’s why this Father’s Day’s a bit chilly. The fire’s gone out. The winds of age swallowed the splendid flame, leaving only golden embers. But there’s a strange thing about those embers, stir them...and the flame will dance...and knock just enough chill out of the air to remind me that he’s still... present.’
Compare that to an interview with actor Gene Hackman who remembered: ‘I was just 13, but that Saturday morning is still vivid. I was playing down the street...when I saw my father drive by and give me a light wave. Somehow I knew that gesture meant he was going away forever. To this day, the memory’s a ghost that never seems to fade.’
Think today about who has taught you the things a father should. Whether it’s your dad or someone else take the time to thank God for that person, and tell them too!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>“…I WILL STRENGTHEN AND HELP YOU; I WILL UPHOLD YOU WITH MY RIGHTEOUS RIGHT HAND.”</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ISAIAH 41:10 NIV</span><br>Labels tend to stick. When we’re young our parents tend to say things like ‘oh, she’s just a plain Jane,’ or, ‘He’ll never be as smart as his brother.’ We drag those comments around with us like a ball and chain for the rest of our lives. Fortunately God sees your potential differently. Listen: ‘God can pour on the blessings in astonishing ways so that you’re…more than…ready to do what needs to be done’ (2 Corinthians 9:8 TM). Seventy five years ago Johnnie Weismuller, better known as Tarzan to film-lovers, was called the greatest swimmer in the world. Doctors and coaches said, ‘Nobody will ever break Johnnie’s records.’ He held more than 50 of them. Today 13-year-old girls break them on a regular basis! For decades experts declared nobody would break the 4-minute mile. Roger Bannister refused to believe it and as a result became the first man to run a mile in under 4 minutes. Today hundreds of runners do it every year. The words of others can stop you temporarily, but you are the only one that can do it permanently. If God says you can – you can! And His opinion is the only one that counts. Edgar Guest wrote, ‘There are thousands to tell you it cannot be done, there are thousands to prophesy failure, there are thousands to point out, one by one, that dangers want to assail you. So buckle right in with a bit of a grin, take off your coat and go to it; just start to sing as you tackle the thing that ‘cannot be done’ and you’ll do it.’

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…THOSE WHO WAIT ON THE LORD WILL FIND NEW STRENGTH…</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ISAIAH 40:31 NLT</span><br>God doesn’t tell us how he’ll answer our prayers or even when. But He does promise one thing to those who wait on Him – strength. The Bible word ‘wait’ comes from a Hebrew word used in the making of rope. Every rope starts as a thread, and every thread added increases it’s strength. You see every time you wait on the Lord it’s like another thread being added to the rope, you get a bit stronger and a little bit more able to cope. 
So what does it mean to ‘wait on the Lord’? If you’re waiting for a bus you literally just stand, do nothing and wait for the bus to arrive. But what about a waiter? Waiters do a little standing around but their job is to serve, to be on the ball and be available at all times to make sure the customers have everything they need. The job of a waiter is to be active; ready for action at any time. Whether its sitting prayerfully in God’s presence or actively carrying out His will, you have His word that strength will be renewed. Listen to these promises: ‘Wait patiently for the LORD. Be brave and courageous. Yes, wait patiently for the LORD’ (Psalm 27:14 NLT). ‘I wait quietly before God, for my hope is in him.’ (Psalm 62:5 NLT) ‘As the eyes of slaves look to the hand of their master…so our eyes look to the LORD our God…’ (Psalm 123:2 NIV). Need more strength? Wait on God more!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…AND THE SPIRIT OF GOD WAS HOVERING OVER THE FACE OF THE WATERS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 1:2 NKJ</span><br>Before God completed His creation, the Bible says His Spirit ‘hovered’ over it. You get the feeling of anticipation, of something beautiful about to be revealed. The Spirit hovered; watching, protecting, nourishing and preparing for what was to come. We need to do the same in our own lives. 
If something incredible is going to happen, you can be sure it will take time. The great King David spent many years alone on a hillside watching sheep. No one saw any potential in him, his gifts weren’t being fully expressed.  He hadn’t had his shepherd-boy annual appraisal with targets and goals set for the next year! Only God saw the potential in David and as David patiently waited, trained, developed and grew in his relationship with God, all the foundations were set in place. During that hillside time David would have perfected the harp; which was used to calm the King Saul. He would have learned to use a slingshot; the skill used to bring down Goliath. All the time David was being prepared while the Spirit ‘hovered’ and God knew the exact time he would leave that hillside. 
Don’t get impatient and rush the work God is preparing you for. God will prepare each of us in the right amount of time and if you seem to be taking longer than others, chances are he is preparing you for greater things! So make the most of your hillside time while it’s there, you’re going to need it!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…WE HAVE SHARED TOGETHER THE BLESSINGS OF GOD…</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PHILIPPIANS 1:7 TLB</span><br>‘You can’t whistle a symphony, it takes an orchestra’. This means that we all need to realise that we can do a much better job with other people than we can by ourselves. 
Your future is connected to certain people and without them your destiny won’t be complete. If you can actually accept that, your possibilities are unlimited! 
A key bloke in the Billy Graham association (Billy Graham being the most famous evangelist of the 20th century) was his childhood friend, Grady Wilson. In 1948 Billy asked Grady to come and work with him. At first he said no, but Billy went on: ‘God’s told me you’re to come and work with me. I need an evangelist; somebody who knows me and my ministry, somebody I can trust.’ Speaking later Wilson remembered ‘I didn’t want to come. After all, I already had a successful ministry of my own holding citywide crusades.’ After praying, he made the decision to follow Billy Graham (and God). He set aside his own dreams to be part of another man’s. That decision made a huge difference, not only in his life but also in the lives of the people they reached together until Grady Wilson’s death.
Sometimes you have to sacrifice a smaller dream to fulfil a bigger one. You may even be asked to lay down your dreams not knowing what other thing is ahead and it takes a lot of strength and courage to do that. But look at the results. Heaven alone knows the impact that Grady Wilson and Billy Graham had together.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>“LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART…”</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>DEUTERONOMY 6:5 NIV</span><br>Is your life like a wardrobe with a separate compartment for each area of your life? One for school or college, one for work, one for home, one for each set of friends, one for church. Each one means that you talk and act a different way and even have a different set of values. You may find that the behaviour or language you use with one set of friends would be shocking to your church friends! Every time you start a new thing with different people you start a new compartment and reinvent yourself. What happens is that rather than having openness and honesty, your life is split into so many different roles that no one quite knows who you really are, including yourself. 
God doesn’t see you as a collection of compartments or a cast of different characters. He sees you as a whole person, no matter which group you are with, what part of your character you’re putting across today or the person you are when no one’s looking. God wants to bring wholeness and completeness to your life. Don’t live and talk a certain way around Christians and act differently with other mates. You can’t fool God, He sees everything you do and think. Trying to be several different people just doesn’t work’. We were made with one mind, one heart and one spirit. So what’s the answer? ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength’ (Deuteronomy 6:5 NIV). Refuse to live ‘compartmentalised’ lives!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I CAN DO EVERYTHING THROUGH HIM WHO GIVES ME STRENGTH</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PHILIPPIANS 4:13 NIV</span><br>You don’t have to search the internet for very long before coming up with an enormous list of websites dedicated to providing you with excuses for just about everything. These range from the clever ‘Mum ate my homework, she's heavily pregnant and having very odd cravings’ to the naughty ‘I can’t go to church today, I come out in a rash when I hear ‘Shine Jesus Shine’ to the utterly ridiculous ‘I’d love to but the man on TV told me to stay tuned.’ Whether they are true or totally made up, we can come up with an excuse for everything. 
Very often the problem is not that other people don’t believe our excuses, but the fact we do believe them ourselves. We convince ourselves we can’t do more with our lives because we need to be taller or thinner or smarter or faster or better-looking or funnier. The Bible says that ‘I can do everything through him who gives me strength’. This means we need to do our best and where we’re lacking God will give us the rest. So what’s your excuse? With Gods help you can rise above any circumstances or challenges that seem to guarantee failure. The real problem is not about the way we look or our intelligence, it’s negativity, self-pity and an attitude that ‘I’m not good enough so it’s not even worth trying.’ When God says He will give you strength, take Him at His word! Put aside your doubts and any negative attitudes and then see what you can’t do!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>“IF A FELLOW BELIEVER HURTS YOU, GO AND TELL HIM--WORK IT OUT BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU…”</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 18:15 TM</span><br>Working out your differences requires a few ground-rules: 
1) Clarify in your own mind exactly what the problem is. Carefully figure out how you see things and ask yourself if you might be missing anything. Is this a mountain or a molehill? Temporary or long-term? Avoidable or unavoidable? 
2) Sort your attitude. Jesus asked how you take a speck out of your brother’s eye? The answer was to take the huge great log out of your own so you can see clearly to sort your brother’s eye! Give your attitude to God. When you’re angry it’s easy to wreak havoc and do more harm than good
3) Think about where to meet. Have plenty of time, when you’re not tired, in a fairly private place and try to meet on neutral territory
4) Make sure they know you’re not trying to give them a last chance – it’s not ‘my way or the highway’, you just want to make things better 
5) Try to chat. Don’t make strong comments like ‘you always’ or ‘you never’. When you say something important stop and ask if you have your facts straight or if you’re missing something.   When they say something, don’t react off the cuff, repeat back what you heard – it might be different from what they thought they said!
Let’s face it; sometimes confrontation will end in division. That’s why Paul said, ‘Do your part to live in peace with everyone, as much as possible.’ (Romans 12:18 NLT). Too many of us just give up when things get rocky. Relationships are very valuable; they take years to build. That’s why real love keeps on hanging in there and works through them.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…SPEAK THE TRUTH…</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 4:25 NRS</span><br>The things we say are really important.  And the way we say them is really important too.  Even when it’s done out of love, telling someone the truth can still create tension. That’s why we’ll do anything to avoid confrontation. Our heads say ‘why rock the boat’ and as a result we let things go that really should be dealt with. The problem with this is that a) the problem always comes back b) untreated, it gets worse c) disappointment can wreck the relationship d) unexpressed anger makes you bitter e) our love goes cold. 
If we don’t confront people we’re not using the tools that God’s given us. ‘Peace at any price’ is a tactic of satan. If you actually care enough to confront someone he’ll whisper, ‘Why bother? It’ll just make trouble. It’ll sort itself out’. Listening to those lies will kill the relationship for certain! The Bible says, ‘If a fellow believer hurts you…work it out between the two of you…’ (Matthew 18:15 TM). The same goes for confronting a friend who maybe hurting themselves. Phrases like ‘I care too much to stand by and watch you…’ show you’re not saying it for your own benefit. Speaking the truth means taking a risk and will only work if you believe two things:
1) That honesty is more important than avoiding conflict
2) That the other person’s well-being is more important than being comfortable. God says ‘…speak the truth…’ because any other way destroys relationships. So – is there somebody you need to speak to today? If so, pray, then do it!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I PRESS ON TOWARDS THE GOAL TO WIN THE PRIZE FOR WHICH GOD HAS CALLED ME…</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PHILIPPIANS 3:14 NIV</span><br>Japan has always had a reputation for crazy game shows like ‘Takeshi’s Castle’. The programme begins with 100 bonkers contestants all aiming to get through each crazy round in order to storm the castle at the end. Each round generally involves muddy water and normally sees contestants trying to balance on things, hang from things and jump over things. The result is normally that contestants fail quite spectacularly and obviously do themselves a serious injury. Eventually a few make it through to the final and, on the very rare occasion that they successfully storm the castle, receive absolutely nothing! 
Many people live their lives as though they are on Takeshi’s castle. They follow the crowd and like the 100 nutty people in the first round run like maniacs to try and be the first to climb a huge slippery wall. No one really knows why they are doing it, but it looks fun so they do it anyway. As life goes on people get more hurt along the way and wonder what the point is. The survivors make it through to the end, battered, bruised, alone and exhausted and win absolutely nothing. 
The Bible makes it clear that life does have a point, to know Jesus and make Him known.  It’s life lived for an eternal goal and for heavenly rewards.  If we live the Jesus life, we won’t get to the end and find we have nothing.  But if we go along with the crowd just because that’s what they do and it looks fun, we’re in trouble. Chances are you will get seriously hurt along the way too.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WE ARE GOD’S WORKMANSHIP, CREATED IN CHRIST JESUS TO DO GOOD WORKS, WHICH GOD PREPARED IN ADVANCE FOR US TO DO.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 2:10 NIV</span><br>‘Calling’ is a funny word that’s used a lot by Christians. But what exactly does that mean? Well if someone calls you to wash the dishes they want you to wash the dishes. It’s the same with God. Your call is simply anything He’s asked you to do. So how do you find your ‘calling’? It normally comes in several ways. 
1) You feel ‘moved’. You will see something, often a need that no one seems to be doing anything about and something inside just tells you to go and do something about it
2) It’s confirmed by others. People will see God at work in your life. People who know you well will say stuff like ‘you come alive when you…’ or ‘You’re at your best when you…’ 
3) You’ll be good at it. Occasionally someone will start out with no obvious gifts but that’s a bit rare. When God calls you He also gives you all you need to do that job. Sure you’re going to have to take some risks, learn some new skills and have a go at some scary stuff you’ve never done before but if God’s called you, you will get good and quick! When you’re in your calling and going for it you will soar like an eagle no matter what obstacles might be in your way. People will stand back in amazement and you will know God’s pleasure
4) You’ll see results! You’ll change things, touch lives and glorify God. If you’re walking in God’s call the results may not be exactly what you thought or planned, but at the end of the day that’s not your problem!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>“I HAVE FILLED HIM WITH…SKILL, ABILITY AND KNOWLEDGE IN ALL KINDS OF CRAFTS.”</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EXODUS 31:3 NIV</span><br>Have you ever thought that may be your ‘call’ does not necessarily mean you are going to be a full-time worship leader or world evangelist? Often we can think that to live for God means doing a full-time job for a church but that’s totally not always the case. Check out Nehemiah – called to build walls, Daniel – called to work for the government, Luke – a first century doctor. Your job could well be part of your calling! Many jobs involve having influence whether you are in teaching, in health care, in social care in media and arts or in the government. When you demonstrate your faith and Christian character and use your income to fulfil God’s purpose, you are as called as any full-time pastor – maybe more!       
Remember, your past doesn’t disqualify you from fulfilling your God-given destiny. Paul wrote, ‘…I used to scoff at the name of Christ. I hunted down his people, harming them in every way I could…’ (1 Timothy 1:13 NLT). The good news is God doesn’t need to see our CV to give us our future! Also, the chances are God will call you to a job that looks too big for you. Why? That way you’ll never forget where your strength and success comes from. Your call is not a general advert for anyone who fancies it to respond to, it’s specifically for you. If you go off and do your own thing, chances are you’re stealing someone else’s! Everything you achieve yourself will eventually leave you empty. When you do something you are truly called to do you will know and experience the real lasting pleasure of God.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>“THE OLDER BROTHER BECAME ANGRY AND REFUSED TO GO IN...”</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 15:28 NIV</span><br>In this story the younger brother has gone way off track, lost everything and come home again. The older brother stayed at home, was good and faithful yet at the end of the parable it’s him who’s left out in the cold. You see, while the older brother didn’t run around obviously sinning like the younger, his attitude was rubbish. He was jealous and selfish and couldn’t stand the thought of his naughty little brother being welcomed home. When we focus on ourselves, working for number one, we become like the older brother. This ‘older brother’ attitude has three possible results:
1) He was a son but refused to act like a brother. Be careful about your attitude towards other Christians, your brothers and sisters! A wrong relationship with them can cause a real strain on your relationship with your Heavenly Father
2) It’s possible to serve God faithfully but with the wrong motives and attitude. If you’re not serving God out of love, you will never understand why a father would throw a huge party for the return of someone who’s gone miles off track
3) It’s possible to be first in line to receive everything from your father yet have less joy and freedom than someone who will get nothing. Even the hired servants were happier than the older brother. They ate, laughed, partied and celebrated while the older brother stood outside demanding his rights. His attitude robbed him of his relationship with his dad, the love of his brother and the joy of the servants. Don’t let the ‘older brother’ attitude rob you of relationship, love and joy too.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>“DO WHATEVER HE TELLS YOU.”</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 2:5 NIV</span><br>Do you need a miracle? Reread the story of Jesus turning water into wine. Look at what Mary tells the attendants at the wedding reception: ‘Do whatever he [Jesus] tells you.’ Do it, even though:
1) You’re not in the right place. When Jesus performed this miracle they were at a wedding, not in a church. If we’re sensitive and obedient to God He will work wherever we are 
2) You’ve got a lot of problems. Embarrassingly they had run out of wine at a wedding! When we have problems we often turn anywhere but to God. When something hurts is the first place you go to the Bible or the chemist? Miracles start when we focus on Gods power instead of our own problems 
3) You’re not being encouraged. When Mary turned to Jesus for help, He tested her faith saying, ‘Dear woman, why do you involve Me?…My time has not yet come’ (John 2:4 NIV). But she passed the test. Instead of being put off she pressed in, believed God and saw a miracle
4) You’ve not been a Christian very long. The servants who obeyed Jesus had just met Him and His disciples had only just been recruited. But, they were still expected to obey Him. So are you
5) You haven’t seen Him do miracles in your life yet. This was Jesus first miracle. They had to obey Him even without a long track record. That’s always tough! 
6) You don’t understand the process. Why pour water into empty containers? Answer: give Jesus what you’ve got and He’ll give you back what you need. That’s how to experience the miraculous!

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>DON’T LET THE WORLD…SQUEEZE YOU INTO ITS…MOULD...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 12:2 PHPS</span><br>A clever bloke once said, ‘A belief is something you’ll argue about. But a conviction is something you’ll die for.’ A conviction is something you are so utterly convinced about that your mind can’t be changed. Conviction is what makes us stand out from the crowd, stand for what we believe in and what makes us who we are. People without conviction follow the crowd. They have no opinions of their own and do what they are told. If we don’t stand for something, we’ll fall for anything! 
Loads of us have strong convictions on issues like who should win X Factor or the footie but we don’t have much of an opinion about what’s right or wrong before God. Without a deep conviction from God about the way we live our lives we won’t grow and we’ll end up doing the exact opposite of what he wants. For example, without the conviction that sex outside of marriage is wrong, there’s no reason to keep yourself pure! No one keeps doing something unless there is a really good reason. 
Jesus’ life was dominated by a conviction that He was living to do His Father’s will. This conviction stopped Him from being distracted by other people. Look out for the number of times Jesus says ‘I must’.
It’s been said ‘You’re not really living unless you find something worth dying for’. Without clear, strong convictions we’ll never deliver the level of devotion Christ deserves.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>HE MADE KNOWN HIS WAYS TO MOSES, HIS DEEDS TO THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 103:7</span><br>Have you ever known someone to do something that made absolutely no sense until they explained it to you? God can be just like that. Sometimes He does things we don’t get, sometimes he doesn’t do things we think He should. Like when He told Noah to build a boat, Abraham to sacrifice his only son, and Moses to cross the sea on foot. None of those things make any sense until you look at the whole story, from God’s perspective. Then we can see He totally knew what he was doing! 
When we are able to stop looking at things through our own eyes and see God’s perspective it changes the way we see everything. When we understand Him better we learn to love Him more. When we see why He has asked us not to do certain things we naturally find quite appealing, it’s much easier to do as He asks. ‘There is a way that seems right to man, but in the end it leads to death’ (Proverbs 14:12 NIV). Just because something feels right, it doesn’t mean it is. If it’s not God’s plan, it’s a dead end!
Understanding God’s point of view keeps us on track. We live in a world that has come to the conclusion that there is no truth and everyone’s opinion is valid. The problem isn’t that our culture doesn’t believe anything, it’s that it believes everything. Many say ‘It doesn’t matter what you believe as long as you’re sincere.’ Rubbish! Hitler was sincere; and that definitely mattered. Seeing life from God’s perspective keeps us stable, focussed and stops us being fooled by the latest fads!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>REMEMBER TODAY WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNED ABOUT THE LORD THROUGH YOUR EXPERIENCES WITH HIM…</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>DEUTERONOMY 11:2 TEV</span><br>A woman was recently in a local newspaper announcing with immense pride that after years of study and hard work she had achieved a Phd in her greatest passion; air guitar. There was nothing she didn’t know about the history, the various stances and how to identify a truly great air guitarist. Most people reading that article had identical reactions; what a tremendous waste of time! Sadly, for many Christians the same can be said of their Bible study. You see in churches we love Bible Studies. They are less effort than prayer meetings and certainly easier than making any attempt to meet people outside of church. You sit, you listen, you drink tea, you go home. 
Now of course Bible study is absolutely essential to our faith! Without gaining God’s wisdom from his word we’re absolutely stuffed. But, if we take His word and don’t act upon it, it’s as useless as a Phd in air guitar. In fact it’s worse because we can become judgmental and very proud. By taking a scripture we know from the Bible, applying it to our lives then living an experience, the Word comes alive! We can relate to the characters, we can understand the tests of faith. James writes ‘Do not deceive yourselves by just listening to His word; instead put it into practise’ (James 1:22 TEV). You wouldn’t read a holiday guide and think ‘I’ve read the book, now I don’t need to go’, you read the guide to get the best possible experience from your adventure! The Bible is exactly the same - a guide book to living life to the max, not a substitute for it!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…THEY WILL FLY HIGH ON WINGS LIKE EAGLES…</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ISAIAH 40:31 NLT</span><br>In the film ‘Troy’ there is scene where the warrior Achilles’ cousin is killed in a fight. Desperate for revenge, Achilles (Brad Pitt) challenges the killer –the Trojan prince Hector. They have a big fight and Achilles wins. The whole city of Troy is devastated by the loss but in his anger Achilles refuses to return the body of their prince. Instead he ties Hector to the back of his chariot and rides around dragging him behind on the ground. 
Does your life sometimes feel like an impossible fight? Are you facing a personal struggle or battling at school or college? Maybe you feel that you’ve lost your battle so many times you can’t fight anymore and you’re just being dragged around.  Maybe you wish they would just cut you lose and leave you there. 
If you feel tired today, don’t be afraid to take some time out with God. Remember He is the only one who can restore and strengthen you. He loves to do that; He promises to do it. Taking time out just to rest in the presence of God, to be with Him and to let Him love you is the only way you will get back on your feet. Wherever you are up to in the marathon of life, whether you’ve just started, whether you’re powering on or whether you’re totally worn out remember these words. ‘…Those who wait on the LORD will find new strength. They will fly high on wings like eagles. They will run and not grow weary. They will walk and not faint.’ Isaiah 40:31 NLT

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THERE ARE THOSE WHO CURSE THEIR FATHERS AND DO NOT BLESS THEIR MOTHERS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 30:11 NIV</span><br>Dr Christian Barnard, the world-renowned heart transplant surgeon, tells of leaving Minneapolis to return to his wife and children in Cape Town after being gone for months. ‘I was unprepared for her greeting. “Why did you come back?” There was no longer a smile in her eyes. Oh God, I thought, I’ve made the most horrible mistake of my life. “Don’t look so surprised” she said. “We gave up on you.” I responded, “It was only a little delay. I wrote you about it.” “No, you wrote once to say you weren’t coming home.” I answered, “But we were building aortic valves to save lives.” “No, you were building a family. That is, until you dumped it into my lap” she said bitterly. “We have ceased to exist for you.” I wanted to say I’d come home because I love my children and I loved her. I wanted to because I felt it, but what could I say now that would not sound meaningless.’ Dr. James Dobson writes, ‘A sixth grade teacher in an upper-middle-class neighborhood was shocked to see the results of a creative writing task about their family, assigned to her students. A few of their actual sentences read: I wish my mother didn’t have a boyfriend… I wish I could get straight ‘A’s’ so my father would love me… I wish I’d one mum and one dad so that kids wouldn’t make fun of me. I have three mums and three dads and they botch up my life.’ Parent, wise up. Put your family first or you’ll live to regret it!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>HOW DELIGHTFUL IS A TIMELY WORD.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 15:23 NAS</span><br>Some of the people around you, even successful ones, are dying on the vine for lack of encouragement. Solomon writes, ‘…how delightful is a timely word.’ Isn’t that true? It’s delightful to receive a timely word. The Message says, ‘The right word at the right time – beautiful!’ Encouragement brings emotional healing, restores hope by putting the problem into perspective, and makes the day more bearable. Is there someone you know who needs encouragement? A prisoner trying to stay strong in a hostile environment, while repaying his debt to society? A divorcee trying to rebuild their life? A breadwinner who’s out of work, worried about their family? A widow who needs companionship? A servant of God laboring in an obscure and difficult ministry? Everyone is struggling with something; so everyone needs encouragement.
William Barclay writes, ‘One of the highest of human duties is the duty of encouragement… it is easy to laugh at men’s ideals; it is easy to pour cold water on their enthusiasm; it is easy to discourage others. The world is full of such discouragers. But we have a duty to encourage one another. Many a time a word of praise or thanks or appreciation or cheer, has kept a man on his feet. Blessed is the man who speaks such a word.’ Paul writes: ‘…Outside, trouble was on every hand…within us, our hearts were full of dread and fear. Then God who cheers those who are discouraged refreshed us by the arrival of Titus. Not only was his presence a joy, but also the news that he brought…’ (2 Corinthians 7:5-7 TLB). So, be a Titus; encourage someone today.

<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>“GREATER LOVE HAS NO ONE THAN THIS, THAT ONE LAY DOWN HIS LIFE FOR HIS FRIENDS.”</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 15:13 NAS</span><br>The phone rang in a high society Boston home. A son who’d just returned from Vietnam was calling from California. His folks were the cocktail-circuit, party kind. The boy said, ‘I just called to tell you that I want to bring a buddy home with me.’ His mother said, ‘Sure, bring him along for a few days.’ ‘But mother, there’s something you need to know about him. One leg’s gone, one arm’s gone, one eye’s gone, and his face is disfigured.’ His mother said, ‘It’s okay, bring him home for a few days anyway.’ The son said, ‘You don’t understand, I want to bring him home to live with us.’ After a long pause the mother began to make excuses, ‘What would people think? How could we take care of him, given our busy lives?’ and the phone clicked. A few hours later the California Police Department called. Again the mother picked up the phone; a voice said, ‘We have found a boy with one arm, one leg, one eye and a mangled face. He just committed suicide. His identification papers say he’s your son.’ 
Showing compassion demands dying to self-interest. It disrupts our well-ordered lives. It costs us money we planned to use for other things. It calls for time, often years of care giving, when we feel like we’ve hardly enough time for ourselves. What is compassion? Laying down your life for others! That’s why Jesus said, ‘Greater love has no man than this, that one lay down his life for his friends.’ Do you practice compassion?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…CHRIST…MADE HIMSELF OF NO REPUTATION…</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PHILIPPIANS 2:5-7 KJV</span><br>If He Who is called ‘Lord of Lords’ became a servant of all, how can you in your right mind, think you should be served by those you lead? Paul writes: ‘…Christ…made Himself of no reputation…’ (Philippians 2:5-7). Reputation is so important to us. We want to be seen with the right people, remembered in the right light, live in the right neighborhood and drive the right car. Not Christ. He made Himself of no reputation. If you’re obsessed with the size of your congregation (or business), the famous people you can reach on speed-dial, the trappings of your lifestyle or the image you’ve carefully cultivated, read John, Chapter 13. Jesus stooped low enough to wash the feet of crude Galilean fishermen, then said, ‘I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done…’ (John 13:15). Whose feet did He wash? The feet of common people. Surely those people walked away changed, humbled by a lesson they’d never forget; one we all need to learn!
Peter writes, ‘I have a special concern for you church leaders…Here’s my concern: that you care for God’s flock with all the diligence of a shepherd. Not because you have to, but because you want to please God. Not calculating what you can get out of it, but acting spontaneously. Not bossily telling others what to do, but tenderly showing them the way…“God has had it with the proud, but takes delight in just plain people.” So be content with who you are, and don’t put on airs. God’s strong hand is on you; he’ll promote you at the right time’ (1 Peter 5:1-6 TM).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>NEITHER…BEING LORDS OVER GOD’S HERITAGE…</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 PETER 5:3</span><br>Are you called to be a leader in the home, the workplace or the church? Do you aspire to leadership? Understand this: today’s generation is unwilling to submit to, or follow those who practice the old ‘top down’ style of leadership that says, ‘I’m in charge, and the sooner you figure that out the better.’ No, you don’t demand leadership; you earn it – every day. How? By being a servant! By putting others first and yourself last. That’s what Jesus taught and practiced. You’re not called to be at the top of the pyramid. The New Testament model for leadership is an inverted pyramid with you at the bottom, supporting the others, holding them up, bringing out the best in them, laying aside your own comfort and desires to serve those you’re called to lead so that the job can get done, and done better. This means gently correcting mistakes and tying up loose ends while people learn. It also calls for breaking a sweat and getting dirt under your fingernails. 
AW Tozer wrote: ‘A true and safe leader is likely to be one who has no desire to lead, but is forced into a position of leadership by the inward pressure of the Holy Spirit, and the press of the external situation. A person who is ambitious to lead is disqualified as a leader. The true leader will have no desire to lord it over God’s heritage, but will be humble, gentle, self-sacrificing and altogether as ready to follow as to lead, when the Spirit makes it clear that a wiser and more talented man than himself has appeared.’

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>FAR BETTER TO BE RIGHT AND POOR THAN TO BE WRONG AND RICH.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 16:8 TM</span><br>After a week of special meetings, the guest preacher approached the airline desk to purchase a flight for home. Ticket in hand, he took a seat in the waiting area. Checking his credit card receipt, he realized the attendant had undercharged him almost fifty percent. ‘It’s wonderful how God provides,’ he rationalized. The church hadn’t paid him too well and the bills were piling up at home. For the next half hour he wrestled with himself, although, deep down he knew what he had to do. Finally he returned to the desk and said to the attendant, ‘I think you made a mistake.’ ‘No,’ she replied, ‘you see, I was in church last night when you spoke on honesty, and I thought I’d put you to the test.’ Why be honest? Because people are watching. Your actions and attitudes, in even the smallest of details, are forming the opinions of those who hear you claim to be a follower of Christ. 
There’s a golden moment in the life of Samuel the prophet. It’s his retirement. Standing before the nation he’d led for 40 years, he asks, ‘…Have I ever taken advantage of you or exploited you? Have I ever taken a bribe or played fast and loose with the law? Bring your complaint and I’ll make it right. “Oh no,” they said, “never. You’ve never done any of that…”’ (1 Samuel 12:3 TM). When those who’ve known you best for four decades can say that about you, you did it right. And that’s as good as it gets!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>GIVE A BONUS TO LEADERS WHO DO A GOOD JOB, ESPECIALLY…AT PREACHING AND TEACHING.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 TIMOTHY 5:17 TM</span><br>A mother watched her son begin to drain of energy as the week went on. By the end of the week he’d lost his desire to get out of bed. She heard the alarm go off through his bedroom door. Apparently he just kept punching the little snooze button on the top. Finally, after three or four extra rings she walked in and said, ‘Son, it’s time to get up.’ He peeked out from under the covers, ‘Can you give me three good reasons to get up?’ She said, ‘Yes. First, it’s Sunday – time for church. Second, you’re 43 years old and you know better. Third, you’re the pastor and they expect you to be there.’ Your pastor is always on call. He gets drained; he needs encouragement. Give him some! 
Richard DeHann writes, ‘Here are some creative ways a church can get rid of their pastor. First, you could look him straight in the eye while he’s preaching and say ‘Amen,’ and he’ll preach himself to death in a few weeks. Or you could acknowledge his good points, and he’ll probably work himself into the grave by the end of the year. Or you could dedicate your life to Christ and ask him to give you a job, such as winning others to Christ, and there’s a good chance he’ll die immediately of heart failure. Or you could get the whole church to unite in prayer behind him, and soon he’ll become so effective that some larger church will take him off your hands and you won’t have to worry about it anymore.’

<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>BY HIS DOING YOU ARE IN CHRIST JESUS...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 CORINTHIANS 1:30 NAS</span><br>A food company released the perfect cake mix. It required no additives. Just mix some water with the powder, pop into the oven and prepare yourself for a treat. One problem surfaced; nobody bought it. Puzzled, the manufacturer conducted surveys, identified the problem and reissued the cake with a slight alteration – add one egg. Sales skyrocketed. 
Why are we like that? What makes us want to add to what’s already complete? Paul asked the same question. Legalists angered him by adding their work to Christ’s finished work. Not much, just one small rule ‘you must be circumcised to be saved’ How does Paul respond? With a verbal blowtorch! ‘Watch out for those who do evil…[dogs] who insist on cutting the body’ (Philippians 3:2 NCV). ‘Evil,’ ‘dogs.’ We dismiss legalists as harmless; after all, they promote morality. They don’t dismiss Christ, they trust in Him a lot. But – they don’t trust in Him alone! They look at the cross and say ‘Great work, Jesus. Sorry you couldn’t finish it, but I’ll take up the slack.’ So Paul writes, ‘…how is it that you are turning back to those weak and miserable principles? Do you wish to be enslaved by them all over again?’ (Galatians 4:9 NIV). Legalism is miserable because legalism is endless. It leaves you with the anxiety that having done everything you know, you might not have done enough. Can our efforts make us more worthy of salvation? If so, we get a little of the credit, and deep down that’s what our proud heart wants. No, salvation is not about what you do, it’s about what He’s already done!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>“…BEFORE ALL THE PEOPLE I MUST BE GLORIFIED.”</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LEVITICUS 10:3 NKJV</span><br>At the end of His life, Jesus declared His mission a success by saying ‘I have brought you glory on earth by completing the work you gave me to do’ (John 17:4 NIV). David writes, ‘Not to us, O Lord, not to us, but to Your name give glory’… (Psalm 115:1 AMP). The breath you took as you read that last sentence was given to you for one reason, that you might ‘reflect the Lord’s glory…’ (2 Corinthians 3:18 NIV). Before Moses was qualified to lead Israel he first had to pray, ‘…show me your glory’ (Exodus 33:18 NCV). We cross a line when we make such a request. When our deepest desire is not the things of God, or the favor of God, but God Himself, we cross a threshold. Less self-focus, more God-focus. Less about us; more about Him. This calls for the death of ego. It rubs us the wrong way. It’s a truth we must constantly remind ourselves of. …‘God made all things, and everything continues through him and for him. To him be glory forever!’ (Romans 11:36 NCV). And if you still haven’t got the message: ‘…there is only one God, the Father, who created everything, and we exist for him…’ (1 Corinthians 8:6 NLT). Why does the earth spin? For Him. Why do you have talents and abilities? For Him. Whose Word matters? His. Whose will must be done? His, not ours. God’s to-do list consists of one item: ‘Reveal My glory.’ Heaven’s framed and mounted statement of purpose reads: ‘Declare God’s glory.’ Everything and everyone exists to reveal His glory; including you! Try to remember that.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>TWO ARE BETTER THAN ONE, BECAUSE THEY HAVE A GOOD RETURN FOR THEIR WORK.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ECCLESIASTES 4:9 NIV</span><br>Snoopy is lying on top of his famous doghouse, complaining that there’s too much to do. In the final frame of the cartoon, he sighs, ‘I hate being head beagle!’ If you like the privileges of being head beagle but not the responsibilities, you probably haven’t learned the scriptural art of delegation (Acts 6:1-6). DL Moody said, ‘You can do the work of ten men, or get ten men to do the work.’ So why are we unable (or unwilling) to delegate?
1) Fear of losing authority. Some of us would rather look for compliant people to implement our wishes.
2) Fear of work being done poorly. In some cases you’re right! But often our hang-up is not being willing to allow others to do the work their way.
3) Fear of work being done better. That’s pride! You should surround yourself with people who have the potential to do an even better job, then your work will out live you.
4) Unwillingness to take the necessary time. Task-oriented people just want to get the job done. They’ve little patience when it comes to waiting for others to learn through trial and error and become capable. 
5) Lack of training and positive experience. Nobody ever believed enough in us to delegate stuff to us, so we learned to work as independents. That can be fatal. Theodore Roosevelt said, ‘The best leader is the one who has sense to pick good people to do what he or she wants done, and enough self-restraint to keep from meddling with them while they do it.’

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…WE WERE FORCED TO TRUST GOD TOTALLY...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 1:9 TM</span><br>Four guys decided to go mountain climbing. In the middle of the climb one fellow slipped over a cliff, dropped about sixty feet and landed with a thud on the ledge below. The other three, hoping to rescue him, yelled, ‘Joe, are you okay?’ He replied, ‘I’m alive, but I think I broke both my arms.’ The three said, ‘We’ll toss a rope down to you and pull you up.’ ‘Fine,’ answered Joe. After dropping one end of the rope they started tugging, working feverishly to pull their wounded friend to safety. When they had him about three-fourths of the way up, they suddenly remembered that he said he’d broken both his arms. ‘Joe! If you broke both of your arms, how in the world are you hanging on?’ Jaw taut, Joe responded, ‘With my teeeeeeeeeeeeth.’ Some days the best we can do is just hang on by the skin of our teeth. Even the strongest and wisest amongst us have times when we don’t have the answers and can’t see the way forward; all we can do is look up and trust God to pull us through – and He does. If you’re in a tight spot today, don’t let go of the rope. If you have to, hang on by your teeth. Some things are just a job for God. Be still. Trust Him and let Him work. 
That’s where Paul was when he wrote, ‘…instead of trusting in our own strength or wits to get us out of it, we were forced to trust God totally not a bad idea since he’s the God who raises the dead!’ (2 Corinthians 1:9-10 TM).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…THE JOY OF THE LORD IS YOUR STRENGTH.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>NEHEMIAH 8:10</span><br>CS Lewis said, ‘There’s too much rigidity in dealing with sacred matters, too much speaking in “holy tones.” And the tragic loss in all this pious gamesmanship is to the individual in the pew. He begins to feel that in the midst of all the religious razzle-dazzle he himself can’t get through to God. Joy is more than earthly pleasure and more than what we call happiness. Joy is the enjoyment of God and the good things that come from Him. If the Bible provides us the wonderful words of life, joy supplies the music. If the way to heaven is an arduous climb, joy sets up the chair lift ‘Joy is the fuel God intends us to run on. So how come we feel so uneasy about seeking more of it? For the same reason that we feel guilty about taking time off. We think, ‘We’re Christians; we’re not supposed to enjoy ourselves.’
Read your Bible! ‘May the God of hope fill you with all joy…’ (Romans 15:13 NIV). Ever notice how some people go through incredible difficulties yet still have joy, while others who don’t go through half as much struggle to keep their heads above water? What’s the difference? These people have a well within that they draw from daily; a well that can’t be drained by what’s going on around them. Nehemiah said, ‘…the joy of the Lord [the joy that comes from knowing that He’s Lord of every situation] is your strength’ (Nehemiah 8:10). What’s blocking you from experiencing God’s joy? Find out asap – and refuse to live another day without it.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>AT THE CENTER OF ALL THIS, CHRIST RULES…</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 1:22 TM</span><br>Until Copernicus showed up in 1543, we were able to claim, ‘The universe revolves around us.’ And what Copernicus did for the earth, God does for our souls. He points us to His Son and says, ‘At the centre of all this, Christ rules.’ At a time when the theme of many preachers is ‘what God will do for you,’ Paul points out that God doesn’t exist to make a big deal out of us; we exist to make a big deal out of Him. Max Lucado writes: ‘We struggle with this idea because we’ve been demanding our way since infancy. “I want a spouse who makes me happy, co-workers who respect me and ask my opinion, weather that suits me, a government that serves me, and a God who gives me everything I want.”’ It’s all about me! What if an orchestra followed that approach, each artist clamoring for self-expression? Tubas blasting non-stop, percussionists pounding to get attention, the trumpeter standing on the conductor’s stool tooting his horn. Harmony? Hardly. Happiness? Not at all. Who enjoys confusion, or contributing to a cacophony? What would happen if we each took our place, played our part, followed the score He gave us, and made His song our song? What if there was less ‘here’s what I want’ and more ‘what do you suppose God wants?’ Paul answers, ‘…beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, [we] are changed into the same image from glory to glory…’ (2 Corinthians 3:18 KJV). Getting our eyes off ourselves and onto Christ, makes us more like Him. It changes us – and couldn’t we use a change?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>“I SERVED THE LORD WITH GREAT HUMILITY…”</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ACTS 20:19 NIV</span><br>My Utmost For His Highest is the world’s best selling devotional book. Yet without his wife Gertrude Chambers, the unrecognized driving force behind Oswald Chambers’ writings, we wouldn’t have this book at all. In the Forward, she tells how the selections came from his various speaking engagements. Yet she signed only with the initials BC. Who was this remarkable woman? Her husband affectionately called her ‘Biddy,’ a term of endearment. Oswald died as a result of complications following surgery in Egypt where he’d been ministering to the British Troops. Thousands mourned his death at 43. So well loved was he by those he ministered to that in spite of the fact that he wasn’t part of the military, he was still given a full military burial in the old British cemetery in Cairo.
They were married for just seven years when, at age 34, Biddy became a widow and the single mother of a little girl. Actually, the real story of the man’s fame began at his death. Before she met Oswald, Biddy was a stenographer. She could take shorthand faster than many of us could talk. So she began listening to her husband’s messages and took shorthand notes – hundreds of them – never thinking that one day they’d be transcribed into books and that she would become the publisher of them. The world owes a debt of gratitude to this humble and generally unknown woman whose efforts are still blessing so many. May God give us more people like her; people who believe that great things can be accomplished when no one cares who gets the credit.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>“DOES ANYONE DARE DESPISE THIS DAY OF SMALL BEGINNINGS?”</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ZECHARIAH 4:10 TM</span><br>Do you feel like there’s a huge gap between your present job and your ultimate career destination? You say, ‘Yes, I’d like to be a teacher, but that means I’d have to go back to school and finish my degree. That would take years!’ ‘Sure, I’d love to switch careers, but this job has security; I don’t think I could take the risk.’ ‘It would be fun to try and market my own product, but I don’t know how to get started.’ The excuses pile up like dirty dishes in a sink; it feels like it would take too long, cost too much, require too many sacrifices to get from point A to point B. Whether it’s going back to school, starting your own business or entering the ministry, the temptation is to always put it off until another time. Maybe when my wife gets a job, maybe when the kids are grown, maybe when I retire. Maybe, maybe, maybe!
How do you overcome the fear of starting? You reach big goals by taking small steps! While it’s tempting to think that the amount of time required is too long, those days and years will pass – whether you’re pursuing your goal or not! God wants you to heed His call, to show up for duty and leave the provisions – including the time, money, open doors, favourable relationships and material resources – to Him. If you do your part, He’ll do His. The Psalmist writes: ‘…no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly’ (Psalm 84:11 KJV). Just trust God and take the first small step!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…HIS SERVANTS WILL SERVE HIM…AND THEY WILL REIGN FOR EVER...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>REVELATION 22:3-5 NIV</span><br>Heaven is pictured in the Bible as a garden, a city, and a home. All three require skill, work and maintenance. Is that why we’re told we’ll serve God in heaven? Service is active, not passive. Seems like heaven will involve lasting accomplishment, unhindered by decay and fatigue, enhanced by unlimited resources. The Bible says we’ll reign with Christ, exercising leadership, making important decisions (see Luke 19:16-19). That means we’ll set goals, devise plans and share ideas. Actually, our best workdays on earth are just a foretaste of the joy our work will bring us in heaven. Indeed, our service to Christ now, will determine our position then. Jobs that depend on aspects of our fallen world probably won’t exist – such as dentists (decay), police officers (crime), funeral directors (death), and many others. But that doesn’t mean we’ll be unemployed. What’s an interest or hobby now, may become our main vocation then. Others however may continue with work similar to what they do now, whether it’s gardeners, engineers, builders, artists, animal trainers, teachers, musicians, scientists, crafts people, or hundreds of other vocations. The difference is, we’ll work without the hindrances of toil, pain, corruption and sin (Revelation 21:4-5).
Author Victor Hugo spoke of anticipating his work in heaven: ‘I haven’t given utterance to the thousandth part of what lies within me. When I go to the grave I can say, “my day’s work is done.” But I cannot say, “my life is done.” My work will recommence the next morning. The tomb is not a blind alley; it is a thoroughfare. It closes upon the twilight, but it opens upon dawn.’

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>SET YOUR MINDS ON THINGS ABOVE, NOT ON EARTHLY THINGS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>COLOSSIANS 3:2 NIV</span><br>Gary Larson captured a common misconception of heaven in one of his Far Side cartoons. In it a man with angel wings and a halo sits on a cloud, doing nothing. A caption reads: ‘Wish I’d brought a magazine.’ How come we talk so little about heaven? Why has it fallen off our radar screens? Listen: ‘[Satan] opened his mouth to blaspheme God…and his dwelling place and those who live in heaven’ (Rev 13:6 NIV). Satan slanders three things: 
1) God’s person
2) God’s people
3) God’s place – heaven. After being evicted from heaven (Isaiah 14:12-15), it must be maddening to know we’re now entitled to the beautiful home he was kicked out of. What better way for him to attack us than to whisper lies about the place Paul tells us to set our minds on? If we believe his lie we’ll set our minds on this life, not the next. And we won’t be motivated to take others with us when we go. CS Lewis writes, ‘The Christians who did the most for this world, were those who thought most of the next. The apostles, who set on foot the conversion of the Roman Empire, the great men who built up the middle-ages, the English evangelicals who abolished slave trade, all left their mark on earth – precisely because their minds were occupied with heaven. It is since Christians have largely ceased to think of any other world, that they have become so ineffective in this one. Aim at heaven and you will get earth ‘thrown in,’ aim at earth and you will get neither.’

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WE…WOULD PREFER TO BE…AT HOME WITH THE LORD.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 5:8 NIV</span><br>The sense that we will live forever somewhere, has shaped every civilization in history. In the pyramids of Egypt, the embalmed bodies had maps placed beside them as guides to the future world. In AD 125, a Greek named Aristides wrote, ‘When a Christian passes from this world, they rejoice…and escort his body with songs of thanksgiving as if he were setting out from one place to another nearby.’ In 1952 young Florence Chadwick stepped into the Pacific, just off Catalina Island, determined to swim to the mainland of California. She’d already been the first woman to swim the English Channel; both ways. The weather was foggy and chilly; she could hardly see the boats accompanying her. Still, she swam for 15 hours. When she begged to be taken out of the water, her mother, who was in a boat alongside, told her she was close and that she could make it. Finally, physically and emotionally exhausted, she stopped swimming and was pulled out. It wasn’t until she was on the boat that she discovered that the shore was less than half a mile away. At a news conference the next day she said, ‘All I could see was the fog…I think if I could have seen the shore I would have made it.’ 
Heaven is not a myth; it’s a magnet that pulls us in the direction of home. A home, which Paul describes as ‘better by far’ (Philippians 1:23 NIV). Child of God, no matter how tough life gets, keep your eyes on the heavenly shore; draw strength each day from God, and you’ll make it!

Ruth Lee writes: ‘It was the last day of a writers’ conference and we gathered in one of the dormitories. In our pyjamas we all looked alike. One by one we shared. After the introduction of two authors with published books, and others with claim to fame, it was my turn. “My name is Ruth,” I said, “and I feel so inferior, I think I’ll just go back to my room.” Everybody laughed, so I ploughed ahead. “I guess you could call me a producer. In the last 30 years I’ve produced a well-adjusted respiratory therapist, a machinist and another happy homemaker. I’m also involved in the co-production of seven grandchildren.” I told them how full my life was. Full of checking on cows, helping to fix fences and praying it would stop raining. I told them of busy hours spent babysitting and contending with my household. Then I told them how hungry I was. Hungry for the type of spiritual and emotional food I received at this conference. From the far corner of the room a quiet girl spoke up. “Would you please turn so that I can look at you?” she asked. I did, and she continued. “I want to remember your face when I write,” she said, “I want to write for people just like you.” Suddenly I had no need of title or degree. I served a purpose. With her words she helped me realise what I should have known all along: God doesn’t make nobodies – everybody is somebody important to Him!’ So, dare to be yourself. After all, who’s better qualified?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…THE DISCIPLES WERE FIRST CALLED CHRISTIANS IN ANTIOCH.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ACTS 11:26 NAS</span><br>The New Testament Christians dedicated themselves to one thing only; making Jesus Lord of their lives and establishing His rule wherever they went. Listen: ‘All the believers devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching, and to fellowship and to sharing meals (including the Lord’s supper), and to prayer. A deep sense of awe came over them all, and the apostles performed many miraculous signs and wonders. And all the believers met together in one place and shared everything they had. They sold their property and possessions and shared the money with those in need. They worshipped together at the temple each day, met in homes for the Lord’s supper, and shared their meals with great joy and generosity; all the while praising God and enjoying the good will of all the people. And each day the Lord added to their fellowship those who were being saved’ (Acts 2:42-47 Paraphrase).
Did it cost them? Yes: ‘The high priest and his officials…were filled with jealousy. They arrested the apostles and put them in public jail…then they brought the apostles before the high counsel, where the high priest confronted them…but Peter and the apostles replied, “We must obey God rather than any human authority”…They [the high counsel] called in the apostles and had them flogged. Then they ordered them never again to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go. The apostles left the high counsel rejoicing that God had counted them worthy to suffer disgrace for the name of Jesus (Acts 5:17-18: 21, 29, 40-42 Paraphrase). That’s what it means to be a New Testament Christian.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…THE DISCIPLES WERE FIRST CALLED CHRISTIANS IN ANTIOCH.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ACTS 11:26 NAS</span><br>The disciples were first called ‘Christians’ at Antioch; because they walked and talked like Jesus! Is something getting in the way of your living like Jesus? Figure it out and eliminate it. Is your life so complicated that it’s difficult for you to juggle everything, yet still remain Christ-like? Simplify your life. Are you unable to find words that describe how you believe God has called you to know, love and serve Him? Develop a new language. Is society dragging you in the opposite direction from where Jesus calls you? Acknowledge that your life is part of a spiritual war between God and satan, declare your side and get on with it. Admit that you are better off ‘fighting the good fight’ and suffering on earth for the cause of Christ, than winning the world but losing your soul for the balance of eternity. Get used to the fact that your life is lived in the context of spiritual warfare. Every breath you take is an act of war. To survive and thrive in the midst of this spiritual battle, you must seek to be more Christ-like. Your mission demands single-minded commitment, and a disregard for the criticisms of those who lack the same dedication to Christ. You answer to only one Commander-in-Chief, and you alone will give an explanation for your choices. Do whatever you have to, to prove that you revere God, you love Him, you serve Him; yes, and that you live only for Him. That’s New Testament Christianity. Not just going to church; but being the church! That’s what it means to be called a ‘Christian.’

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…TROUBLES PRODUCE PATIENCE. AND PATIENCE PRODUCES CHARACTER…</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 5:3-4 NCV</span><br>Storms come for a reason. They also come for a season. Discover the reason and grow wiser. Outlast the season and grow stronger; but never quit! Chuck Swindoll writes: ‘Somebody needs to address the other side of Christian life, if for no other reason than to uphold reality. We need to be told that difficulty and pressure are par-for-the-course. No amount of Biblical input, deeper life conferences or super-victory seminars will exempt you from struggle. God promises no bubble of protection. Ask guys like Job, Joseph, Daniel and Paul, and you’ll become acquainted with an ancient word that has almost disappeared in this generation of splashy, always-grinning, a-miracle-a-day spirituality; perseverance! I know of no better partner to dance with when you’re doing the three-steps-forward and two-steps-back number. It’s in the tough times that true character is forged, the life of Christ is reproduced in us, and our flimsy theology is exchanged for a set of convictions that enable us to handle things rather than trying to escape them. It’s when the bottom falls out and life tries to pound you into a corner of doubt and unbelief, that you need what perseverance produces: a) a willingness to accept whatever comes, knowing that by God’s grace you’ll win and come out stronger b) a determination to stand firm while those around you are falling or running away c) insight to see the character-developing hand of God in it all. Without that, we stumble and fall and God is grieved. With it, we survive and conquer and God is glorified.’ Can you think of one quitter, just one, who ever accomplished anything worthwhile?

‘Dear Paul the Apostle: We received your application for service under our missions board. Frankly we’re amazed you’ve been able to pass as a missionary. Here’s why: a) we’re told that you’re afflicted with eye trouble. We require 20/20 vision b) we hear that you have to make tents on the side to support yourself. How come? c) is it true that you have a prison record? Think how this would reflect on our organization d) it’s reported from Ephesus that you made so much trouble for the local business community there, that they refer to you as the man who ‘turned the world upside down.’ We deplore sensationalism in ministry e) you refer to yourself as ‘Paul the aged.’ Our new pension policies don’t anticipate a surplus of elderly recipients f) Doctor Luke, the physician, reports that you are a frail little man, frequently sick, and always so agitated over your churches that you sleep very poorly. He indicates that you pad around the house praying half the night. Our ideal applicant has a clear mind and a robust body. We believe that a good night’s sleep will give you zest and zip so that you will wake up full of zing. So, we regret to inform you, Brother Paul, that in all our experience we’ve never met a candidate so opposite to the requirements of our board. If we should accept you, we would be breaking every principle of current missionary practice. Signed, Most surely, J Flavius Fluffyhead, Secretary, Foreign Missions Board.’

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>“…O LORD, REVIVE THY WORK…”</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HABAKKUK 3:2 KJV</span><br>If respected pollster George Barna has accurately assessed the spiritual condition of the 77 million American adults who are churched, born again Christians, it’s time to pray, ‘…O Lord, revive Thy work…’ Bi-weekly attendance at services is generally the only time they worship God. Eight out of every ten don’t feel they’ve experienced a real connection with God during the worship experience. Most will die without leading a single person to Christ; indeed the majority thinks it’s not a significant responsibility of theirs. While believing the Bible to be God’s Word, they spend ten times more time watching television, listening to music, reading other books and conversing about personal hobbies and leisure interests. When asked what constitutes success in life, most talked about professional achievement, family solidarity, physical accomplishments or financial success. As a group they give about three percent of their income each year to God’s work, and feel pleased with their ‘sacrificial’ generosity. Fewer than one out of ten tithe, although more than one third of them claim to. Fewer than one out of six have a relationship with another believer through which spiritual accountability is provided and growth achieved. The vast majority relies on their church rather than their family to train their children to become spiritually mature. The likelihood of their marriages ending in divorce is the same as that of non-church goers, and few of them pray together except at meal times. Most Christian parents don’t believe they’re doing a good job at facilitating the spiritual development of their children, yet they’re unwilling to pay the price to do it. It’s time to pray: ‘…O Lord, revive Thy work…’

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…THERE’S SO MUCH MORE. LET’S GET ON WITH IT.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HEBREWS 6:3 TM</span><br>Settlers are important. They bring order and stability. But without pioneers we’ll go no further. Pioneers bring change, and change is unsettling. But that’s the price of progress. Henry Ford said, ‘I’m looking for people with an infinite capacity for not knowing what can’t be done.’ In 1920, Robert Millikan, Physics Nobel Prize winner 1923, said, ‘There is no likelihood that man will ever tap the power of the atom.’ In 1943, Thomas Watson, Chairman of IBM, said, ‘I think there is a world market for no more than five computers.’ Wow! Rather than being concerned about what our most gifted people will come up with next, our greatest fear should be that they won’t be given the chance to do it. We mustn’t allow our policies and procedures to stifle God-given vision! 
The Bible’s full of non-conformists like Deborah, Elijah, Esther and Paul who challenged the established order, refused to settle for less than God’s best, and left us an example to follow. Want to encourage our pioneers? Give them a longer tether; they need space to soar. Put them in charge of something they can really ‘own.’ Listen to their ideas and give them time to grow. Leave them alone and allow them to blossom. Want to kill our pioneers? Have as many layers of management as possible for decisions to have to travel through. Keep looking over their shoulders. Make your policy manual very thick. Control all-important decisions at the top. Send everything to committees for deliberation. Make them wait months for decisions that affect them. Put them on a team of small thinking bureaucrats.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 23:1 KJV</span><br>When Lloyd Douglas, author of The Robe, attended college, he lived in a boarding house. A retired wheelchair-bound music professor resided on the first floor. Each morning Douglas would stick his head in the professor’s door and ask, ‘What’s the good news?’ The old man would tap his tuning fork on his wheelchair and say, ‘That’s middle C! It was middle C yesterday. It’ll be middle C tomorrow, and it’ll be middle C a thousand years from now. The tenor upstairs sings flat. The piano across the hall’s out of tune, but, my friend, that’s middle C.’ And don’t we all need a middle C? Haven’t we had enough changes? Relationship changes. Job changes. Health changes. Weather changes but the One Who ruled the earth last night is the same One Who rules it today. He never changes! David writes, ‘…from everlasting to everlasting You are God’ (Psalm 90:2 NIV). Counselors may comfort us in the storm, but we need a God Who can still the storm. Friends may hold our hand at our deathbed, but ultimately we need the One Who defeated the grave. Remember the Wizard of Oz? Dorothy followed the Yellow Brick Road only to discover that the Wizard was a wimp! All smoke and mirrors. Is that the kind of God we need? No. We need One Who can place a hundred billion stars in our galaxy, and a hundred billion galaxies in our universe; a God Who, while so mind numbingly mighty, can come and touch us with the gentleness of a mother’s hand. We need both a Lord and a Shepherd. Both strength and tenderness – and that’s what we’ve got!

<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…LAYING HIS HANDS ON EACH ONE, HE HEALED THEM.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 4:40 NIV</span><br>When someone interrupts your task at hand for the sake of conversation, how do you react? If you relax and converse until the chat has natural closure, you’re people oriented. If you squirm your way out with a bombardment of verbal and non-verbal clues, you’re task oriented. 
Jesus spent more time with people than in any other action. Though He’d only three and a half years to train 12 men to change the world, He spent most of His time meeting needs, helping people amid the unbearable pressure to perform tasks and that’s the model He left us. At the end of one of His busiest days it’s recorded that, ‘When the sun was setting, the people brought to Jesus all who had various kinds of sickness, and laying his hands on each one, he healed them.’ What’s ministry all about? People or production? Obviously much of our paperwork and production is aimed at helping people. But often there’s precious little time or energy left for the people because we’re exhausted accomplishing all those tasks! Whether we like to admit it or not, paperwork, deadlines and busy schedules often preoccupy us and create a barrier between us and the opportunity of connecting with people and meeting their needs. Henry Nouwen writes, ‘A few years ago I met an old professor at the University of Notre Dame. Looking back on his long life of teaching, he said with a funny twinkle in his eyes: ‘I have always been complaining that my work was constantly interrupted, until I slowly discovered that my interruptions were my work.’

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>“…HE PASSED BY ON THE OTHER SIDE.”</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 10:31 KJV</span><br>Kevin Donaldson, President of Mission of Mercy, shares the following statistics. 450 million children worldwide live in abject poverty, existing on less than a dollar a day. 5.7 million of them work under horrific circumstances, including slavery. Girls, 12 or 13, sometimes younger, are forced to provide sexual services to 15 or more men a day. In brothels, these children are told they must pay rent to the owner – and it’s always more than the child makes from customers. Living conditions are horrible; violence is commonplace. There’s little or no medical care, and pregnancy automatically means forced abortion. Almost 11 million children each year (30,000 every day) die before their fifth birthday, most from preventable diseases. More than 3 million children under 15 are living with HIV/AIDS. About 13.4 million children have lost one or both parents to AIDS.
‘Are you trying to make me feel guilty?’ No! But blessing brings responsibility! In the parable of the Good Samaritan Jesus didn’t condemn the priest and the Levite for being blessed or busy. No, it was because they ‘passed by on the other side,’ to avoid a wounded man who needed their help. Understand this: when you have all you need, God expects you to show gratitude! When you have more than you need, He expects you to show compassion! ‘…freely ye have received, freely give’ (Matthew 10:8 KJV). Come on; open your eyes, your heart and your wallet. Don’t stand before God one day trying in vain to explain why you left so much of what He gave you, uninvested in the thing He cares about most – a hurting world.

<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>“MY GRACE IS SUFFICIENT FOR THEE...”</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 12:9 KJV</span><br>When God has ‘graced’ you, you can handle just about any situation! Listen to Paul: ‘Three times I called upon the Lord…begged that it might depart from me; but He said to me, “My grace (My favour and loving-kindness and mercy) is enough for you [sufficient against any danger and enables you to bear the trouble manfully]; for My strength and power…show themselves most effective in [your] weakness”…So for the sake of Christ, I am well pleased and take pleasure in infirmities, insults, hardships, persecutions, perplexities and distresses; for when I am weak [in human strength], then am I [truly] strong (able, powerful in divine strength)’ (2 Corinthians 12:8-10 AMP). But there’s something you should understand: when the grace lifts, it’s God’s way of getting you to recognize that things are changing, that it’s time to consult Him as to your next move. Pay attention! Why? Because when the grace lifts we tend to become ‘ungracious’ toward others, and risk tearing down valuable relationships we’ve spent our lives building. Don’t let that happen to you. We’re not talking about having a bad day in which you’re irritable and impatient. We all have those. No, we’re talking about reaching the place where your attitudes and actions consistently hurt others; it’s not an occasional thing, it’s a pattern. 
So, has the grace you’ve experienced lifted? Has an old season or relationship ended? Are you now hurting the situation more than helping? Ask God for fresh direction. Search His Word for wisdom as to your future. When the grace lifts – it’s time to say, ‘Lord, what do You have in mind for me now?’

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>DIRECT MY FOOTSTEPS ACCORDING TO YOUR WORD...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 119:133 NIV</span><br>Have you ever seen a small child trying to walk in the shoes of a big person? It’s funny to watch. It’s also significant: some day those tiny feet will grow up and fill those big shoes – or bigger ones. Do you feel like you’re trying to fill some big shoes today, like you need to grow up fast because you’ve no option? Life doesn’t wait until we’re as mature as we’d like to be, before handing us some of our greatest tests of faith. Most of our training is ‘on the job’, and, like a little one trying to fill big shoes, at first we do it badly, then awkwardly, but never stumble-free. The only thing that can stop us from growing into those big shoes – is the fear of putting our feet into them! The grace comes with the assignment. Grace is immediate, but growth takes time. Don’t be discouraged: ‘He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion’ (Philippians 1:6 NIV).
Another thing about filling big shoes, it makes us a lot more understanding toward others trying to walk in them too. ‘How could you do such a thing?’ is a question we don’t tend to ask, because we already know the answer from personal experience. Ever see a parent holding the hand of a child trying to walk in shoes that are too big, beaming with pride and delight simply because they attempted it, steadying them up, encouraging them to keep going, picking them up when they trip and bump their head? That’s what our God does with us!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…IT WAS NOISED THAT HE WAS IN THE HOUSE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MARK 2:1 KJV</span><br>When Christ enters your life:
1) He’ll rearrange things! Your well-ordered existence will probably get turned upside down. One thing’s for sure, when you meet Jesus you’ll never be the same again. When He showed up at this house in Capernaum ‘it was noised.’ As a result, the house was packed out with people. Not a square inch left. Four men carrying a paralyzed friend, hoping Christ would heal him, had to break up the roof and lower him to the feet of Jesus. Miracles can cause upheaval. 
2) You’ll get two kinds of reaction! The religious crowd will be threatened. When Jesus claimed to have power not only to heal, but also to forgive sins, the Pharisees said, ‘“Who can forgive sins but God only?”’ (Mark 2:7 KJV). The danger of institutional religion is that often we love the institution more than the individuals we are called to serve. So expect some flack, and don’t back down! Whatever it takes to get to Jesus, do it; He won’t disappoint you. He makes this standing offer, ‘…Him that cometh to Me I will in no wise cast out’ (John 6:37 KJV). 
3) All get what they come for! Those who come to mock, criticize or defend their religious viewpoint leave more lost than ever, and more convinced that they’re right. But those who come for help, get it. Listen: ‘Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled’ (Matthew 5:6 KJV). All Christ asks of you today is the humility to acknowledge your need of Him, and the faith to reach for and accept what He offers you.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>YOU’RE A TREE REPLANTED…BEARING FRESH FRUIT…ALWAYS IN BLOSSOM.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 1:3 TM</span><br>God describes His Kids like this: ‘You’re a tree replanted in Eden, bearing fresh fruit every month, never dropping a leaf, always in blossom’ (Psalm 1:3).  When God looks at your life He doesn’t see some withered old tree that is so dry it has no potential to produce anything good.  No way – He sees something magnificent that is constantly producing the fruit that comes from a life that is rooted in Him.  In the Bible it talks about us having the fruit of God…these aren’t apples and oranges, this is the good stuff: ‘love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control’.  
Every day you meet different people. Some of them are easygoing and fun to be around, others really test you.  They take a huge bite out of your patience or chew into your self-control.  So when that fruit has been eaten; how do you grow more?
Get your roots in God’s steaming compost!  It’s a sticky mixture made of: a daily dose of His word; a good regular chat with Him; and a heart that daily thanks Him for how patient and kind He is with you.  All this helps grow more fruit so that when you come in contact with someone who needs your patience you find that your branches are loaded with the stuff. 
So are you up for rolling up your trousers and squidging your feet into the compost today?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I CAN DO EVERYTHING THROUGH HIM WHO GIVES ME STRENGTH.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PHILIPPIANS 4:13 NIV</span><br>W Page Pitt should have failed, but instead he succeeded. After losing 97% of his eyesight at age five, he refused to attend a school for the blind. He was accepted into public school where he played baseball and football. Remarkably, he went on to complete college and become a top-notch journalism professor with a reputation for demanding excellence. A student once asked Pitt which he thought would be worse; blindness, deafness, or not having arms and legs. He replied, ‘None of those things! Laziness, irresponsibility, lack of ambition or desire: they’re the real handicaps. If I don’t teach you anything but to want to do something with your lives, this course will be a magnificent success.’ Often he told his journalism students, ‘You are not here to learn mediocrity, you’re here to learn to excel. If I send you on a story and you don’t get it because you’ve a broken leg, call me from the ambulance and I’ll forgive you. But don’t give me excuses! They wound me, and your explanations pour salt in the wound.’ 
Your biggest enemy is not the challenges you face; it’s complacency, negativity, self-imposed limitations and self-pity. We’ve got all kinds of excuses for not doing more with our lives. If only we’d better eyesight or were thinner or taller or our parents were richer.  Excuses! Two millenniums ago Paul wrote, ‘I can do everything through him who gives me strength.’ That means with God’s help you can rise above circumstances that ordinarily spell failure. So, excuses or results. What’s it going to be?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>DEUTERONOMY 6:5 NIV</span><br>Is your life like a set of drawers, one for each interest, opinion and pastime? One for work, one for play, one for God; each one running to a different set of values and standards? Each situation you encounter needs one more drawer to ensure no crossover or blending of worlds. We’re good at playing the part; saying the right things in church and being the class clown to impress our mates.  We put on an act because we are afraid that if our real personality was on show people would walk out rather than applaud.  Know this – your life is like a stage and loads of people may come in and out and watch for a while; but there is one person who remains a constant observer; Jesus.  You should live your life performing for an audience of One. No one else’s opinion matters.  He doesn’t see your life as a set of drawers or a collection of separate performances. He sees you as a whole person. The person you are when no one’s looking is just the same to Him as the person you are when you’re standing in plain view. 
God asks for integrity (wholeness) in our lives. Why? Because it doesn’t work any other way! God made us with one will, one mind, one heart and one spirit. It’s satan’s lie that ‘we can have it both ways’ which leaves us fractured and paralyzed. What’s the answer? Listen, ‘Love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength’ (Deuteronomy 6:5 NIV). ‘All’ means all!  One drawer, one life, one show!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>FOR WE ARE GOD’S WORKMANSHIP, CREATED IN CHRIST JESUS TO DO GOOD WORKS…</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 2:10 NIV</span><br>A hotel guest called room service one morning and ordered two undercooked eggs, cold bacon, burned toast and lukewarm coffee. The waiter replied, ‘That could be difficult, sir.’ ‘Well,’ the man replied, ‘It’s been no problem so far!’ Seriously, the quality of your work tells people who you are. The famous newspaper, The Wall Street Journal, says, ‘value to society comes when someone says, “Let me see your work.”’ Your gift of the gab may open a door or two…but the real test comes when people see the care you give to a piece of work. Maybe you’ve an essay to write, a song to sing; a picture to paint; a website to design. Give attention to details. Care about the small stuff. We serve a God whose name is called ‘excellent.’ Consider the workmanship involved in a blade of grass, a fingerprint or the constellations of stars that hang so boldly in the sky.  You just have to look up into the sky to see the beauty of God’s imagination and His eye for detail!
One Christian leader writes, ‘What’s true of grand music, writing, art and construction, is true of the way some still practice medicine, law, architecture, teach, type, preach, play instruments, cook, fix cars, coach, sell insurance, run a business, a home, a school, a restaurant, or a ministry. It makes them stand out, a cut above the average. It’s not for the money, glory or fame it may bring. It’s a matter of pride and commitment. Nothing less satisfies.’

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WHEN LIFE GETS…DIFFICULT, DON’T JUMP TO THE CONCLUSION THAT GOD ISN’T ON THE JOB.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Peter 4.12 TM</span><br>In the space of a few months Fred Whiteman went through more pain than most of us do in our entire lifetime. His best mate died of cancer. Then his mum died and his wife was killed. Next, he had to have a heart transplant. And while he was still getting over that he had to deal with cancer and a court battle. Man, you wouldn’t blame this guy if he had something to say about it all!  But did he get bitter and cynical? No, he did what King David said ‘…my heart is overwhelmed; lead me to the towering rock of safety.’ (Psalm 61:2 NLT)  When you’re overwhelmed it’s easy to ‘jump to the conclusion that God isn’t on the job.’ But Fred says, ‘When we can’t figure it out, we have to faith it out.’ 
What did he learn from his trouble a) how much you need God. It’s a harsh reminder that you’re only human and your life could end in an instant b) it builds character purifies the motives of your heart and gets rid of  the desire to play games c) your life demonstrates to others that in their darkest hour He’ll be there for them too. 
Paul says that nothing will separate us from the love of Jesus (See Romans 8:35). So when you start wondering, ‘Why did God let this happen?’ remember, He never said there wouldn’t be pain and challenges. No. He said He’d always care for you. Don’t judge God’s love based on your circumstances; instead look for Him in the middle of them.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>CREATE IN ME A PURE HEART, O GOD…</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 51:10 NIV</span><br>What’s purity?  The ‘P’ word may evoke loads of different thoughts in your mind; it might make you think of something totally far away from the kind of person you are.  You may think that it’s something you long to be, but you feel dirty from all the stuff you’ve done in your life, so it’s totally out of your reach.  You know that in a way all those thoughts have an element of truth to them.  You can’t make yourself pure by how often you pray or go to church.  You can’t even make yourself pure by giving yourself a scrub in a bubble bath!  You can only be made pure by Jesus…only He has the power to turn your mistakes round for good, mend your broken heart and clothe you with a robe of purity.  Something is pure if it has no contamination.  Someone that is impure has no way of making themselves pure by their own effort.  If you have said ‘yes’ to Jesus as your Lord and Saviour you need to trust that today you stand ‘…holy and blameless in His sight…’ (Ephesians 1:4)  He has made you pure.  You may be thinking, ‘that’s all good but how am I supposed to live a life that matches up with how God sees me?’ Well God is top because He gives us some amazing advice through King David, ‘How can a young person live a clean life? By carefully reading the map of your Word’ (Psalm119:9 TM). God’s Word is like a map of a city, it shows us the right roads to go down and where there is a dead end.  Navigate your life with His Word!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>FOR WITH YOU IS THE FOUNTAIN OF LIFE; IN YOUR LIGHT WE SEE LIGHT</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 36:9 NIV</span><br>Feelings are often hurt because we don’t talk to each other.  Friendships go pear-shaped because people don’t communicate their thoughts properly.  We often hide our worries away and live believing something that is totally false because we’ve made a load of assumptions about a situation.  And that’s how the devil wants it to be.  He knows that as soon as we start bringing our worries and anxious thoughts into the open it shines a big fat light on all the lies he has been whispering to us.  A nick name can tell you a lot about someone’s character.  Gangster Al Capone was known as ‘Scar face’.  Rapper Biggie Smalls was known as ‘The Notorious B.I.G’  In the Bible satan is called ‘…the father of lies’ (John 8:44 NIV) so we know what to expect when he opens his mouth. 
We serve the God of communication.  He invented it and created us so that we could chat with Him every day and get Him involved in every aspect of our lives.  God knows that if we bring our fears to Him and allow His light to illuminate our life we won’t be plagued by thoughts like, ‘what do they say about me when I walk out of the room?’ and ‘they think you’re rubbish’.  Imagine a life with less confusion and unanswered questions, a life that is based on truth and clarity!  If you look closely at the names of God it shows you what you can expect from Him.  Prince of Peace, Healer, Deliverer, Provider, Restorer, our Father….to name a few!  So do yourself a favour today, talk to God, and get some clarity about what’s going on!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…love is as strong as death…it burns like a blazing fire…</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Song of Songs 8:6 NIV</span><br>There is so much fake love being dished out!  It looks really appealing, like a plate of your favourite food, but as you eat and eat, you realise that your hunger isn’t getting satisfied and it’s beginning to leave a bad taste in your mouth!  
 	Fake love is like an email you get from a source you don’t know, but catches your eye.  You open it and see that there is an attachment – you click on it and all of a sudden your computer starts to flip out…the attachment had a virus and now everything else is ruined!  Love that comes with conditions isn’t real love.  If loving someone is dependent on money, street cred or even if they love you back it’s not real love.
God’s love busts open all our ideas of what true love is. Listen ‘…for love is as strong as death…it burns like a blazing fire…’  (Song of Songs 8:6 NIV) and ‘Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.  Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trust, always hopes, always perseveres.  Love never fails…’ (1 Corinthians 13:4-8).
One of Robbie Williams’s songs has the lyric: ‘I just want to feel real love’.  The world is crying out for a touch of real love, and God has chosen His people to be His hands.  The challenge for us today is will we love in the face of hatred?  Will we love when there is nothing in it for us?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…WE ARE NO LONGER SLAVES TO SIN…</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 6:6-7 NLT</span><br>When you said ‘yes’ to Jesus did you know that all the stuff that used to have a hold on you had to let go?  Bad habits and attitudes ceased to have any right in your life.  You see before you were a Christian the Bible says you were a slave (Romans 6:6-7).  A slave to fear, rejection, lust, and everything else that sucks.  You couldn’t help but live your life agreeing with the rubbish that ruled over you.  It was in your DNA – was who you were.  So now, what’s the deal?  Listen: ‘…We are no longer slaves to sin…we were set free from the power of sin’ (Romans 6:6-7 NLT).  Not only are you free from a life ruled by one mistake after another, but you were given a completely new way to live; by God’s Spirit.  God did something amazing.  He changed your spiritual DNA.  Instead of looking at you and seeing death and destruction, He looks at you &amp; sees a righteous child (2 Corinthians 5:21).  
	Righteousness means to be in right standing with God.  You need to hear this today.  Whether you make mistakes today or not you are in right standing with God.  Because of what Jesus has done for you, you are no longer a slave to darkness, but a child of the light and nothing on earth can ever change that (Romans 8:38).  So there’s no excuse; you don’t have to give in to that negative thought, or live agreeing with a bad attitude.  You have His Spirit to guide and keep you from one day to the next!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…HE DID NOT DEMAND…HIS RIGHTS…HE …HUMBLED HIMSELF…</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Philippians 2:6-8 NLT</span><br>In Bible days, coats were a big deal, men wore a lightweight inner garment next to their skin and a heavy cloak on top.  During the day the outer garment functioned like a winter coat, at night as a blanket against the cold.  In a time when men’s garments were normally held as a deposit in business deals, it was the inner garment that was forfeited.  This garment was protected by law and had to be returned to the owner by sunset.  Knowing this was the law Jesus said, ‘If anyone wants to…take your coat, give your cloak as well’ (Matthew 5:40 NRS). In other words, don’t just do what’s legally required, go further.  Say ‘I’m entitled to keep what’s mine, but I’m giving it up in order to bless you.’
Listen, ‘Your attitude should be the same…Jesus had.  Though He was God, he did not demand…his rights…He made himself nothing…took the humble position’.  This is the kind of thinking people today don’t get.  Who in their right mind would give up what’s theirs to help somebody else get ahead?  It blows their minds!  That’s what God wanted.  Why?  It’s not just what you say, it’s God’s love working through you that gets people’s attention.  But this kind of love has another advantage, ‘cos it gets you out of your comfort zones, it makes you rely on God even more than usual, and that’s when you really feel His support!  
Whatever He asks you to do he won’t leave you to play it out alone; He’s got your back!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>MY PEOPLE ARE DESTROYED FROM LACK OF KNOWLEDGE…</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HOSEA 4.6 NIV</span><br>You might be one of those people who love studying, good grades come naturally to you, you get excited in libraries and can’t wait for your next exam!  Or you might be like most people who struggle to retain the right information, sweat at the thought of a sit-down test and know that the library is that ugly brown building right near the skate park!  Whether you fall into the first or second category of people, God doesn’t want you to walk around clueless!
God warns that destruction comes from lack of knowledge, (Hosea 4:6 NIV) and He tells us in Proverbs to cry out for understanding (Proverbs 2.3) Listen ‘…I would not have you ignorant’ (I Corinthians 12:1 KJV).
Ignorance is dangerous ground to be walking on because it breeds prejudice and narrow-mindedness which can be the spark that starts the fire of racism, religious hatred and all sorts of messy misunderstandings. During his last days in prison, Paul asked Timothy for three things: 1) a cloak to stay warm 2) a parchment so he could keep writing 3) books so he could keep learning.  When you finally do leave school, qualify at college or graduate from uni, make sure you don’t stop learning. Every day carries a new lesson, so keep your eyes and ears open. And when those lessons come make sure you apply what you have learnt to your life!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>SOME OF YOU USED TO BE LIKE THAT. BUT…JESUS…WASHED YOU AND MADE YOU…ACCEPTABLE...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 CORINTHIANS 6:11 CEV</span><br>Jephthah was the son of a hooker, born into the roughest circumstances. Raised in a hostile, abusive environment he was eventually chucked out of the house and became a rebel gang leader.  But things changed when the Israelites needed a guy with guts to defeat their enemies. They told Jephthah, ‘Come…be our chief…and [you may] become head over…Gilead’ (Judges 11:6, 8 NAS). So, true to form, he gave the Ammonites a good kicking, led them to victory and became their leader. You can read his story in Judges, Chapters 11 -12. Talk about a turn-around! Jephthah belonged on a throne like the gangster Kray Twins belonged in the police! He’d no right to be there except for one thing – God’s grace! God loves to take the thing that’s dragging you down and use it for His glory. He turns losers into winners. He lifts ‘the poor…out of the garbage dump and give[s] them places of honour’ (1 Samuel 2:8 CEV). The truth is, in God’s eyes we were all misfits until He reached down and saved us. Paul says, ‘…Don’t fool yourselves! No one who is immoral…will share in God’s kingdom. Neither…any thief…greedy person…drunkard or anyone who curses and cheats…Some of you used to be like that. But…Jesus…washed you and made you acceptable to God.’ (1 Corinthians 6:9-11 CEV).
Are you getting it? The only difference between you and Jephthah is that God chose to use his past so we could learn from it. But you are not at the mercy of your past.  When you said yes to God he dealt with all your mistakes and made you perfect in his sight.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…WHOEVER SLAPS…YOUR RIGHT CHEEK, TURN THE OTHER TO HIM ALSO.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 5:39 NAS</span><br>The disciples lived in a culture that encouraged revenge and defending your honour. Back then a slap in the face was considered the ultimate humiliation. Now Jesus is saying, ‘Whoever slaps…your right cheek, turn the other to him also.’ Imagine how they felt? Probably like you’re feeling right now! Even today when we’re insulted we call it ‘a slap in the face.’ The adrenaline starts pumping and anger takes over. After all, our reputation’s at stake! But instead of flippin’ out &amp; giving them a good kicking, along comes Jesus and He says, ‘…Don’t hit back…If someone strikes you, stand there and take it’ (Matthew 5:39 TM). Hey, what’s wrong with this picture? Welcome to Radical Love.  It sees people through God’s eyes. Jesus practiced it by refusing to retaliate even though He had the right and the power to do it. As they hammered the nails into His hands and feet, He prayed, ‘Father, forgive them; they don’t know what they’re doing’ (Luke 23:34 TM). When the captain of the Roman soldiers handling His execution saw what happened, he was amazed and said, ‘Certainly this was a righteous man’ (Luke 23:47 KJV). This tough military officer didn’t hear some cold harsh words. No, he was shocked by the force of His love.
Understand this today; your enemies matter to God! God is looking for people who will be God’s love to them.  Are you up for that? Are you willing to get slapped again? If you are, your life will change and you’ll be blown away.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>CELEBRATE GOD ALL DAY...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PHILIPPIANS 4:4 TM</span><br>American writer Erma Bombeck tells about watching a boy in church who kept turning around and smiling at people. He wasn’t spitting, kicking or wrecking church property. He was smiling. Finally his mum jerked him around, smacked him and said, ‘Stop that grinning! You’re in church!’ Then, as tears rolled down his cheeks she added, ‘That’s better,’ and returned to worship. Bombeck continued: ‘It occurred to me that the entire world is in tears and…I wanted to hold this child with the tear-stained face and tell him about my God. The smiling God; the God who had to have a sense of humour to create the likes of us! After all, if you can’t smile in church, where’s left to go?’ 	
Have you ever turned the TV on and watched people sing amazing old skool hymns – which are actually packed with amazing words about how great God is; but they look like they’re totally depressed? Christians can come across as some of the most boring, grey people on the planet.  No wonder a kid prayed: ‘Dear God, please make the bad people good – and the good people nice!’ Whatever happened to ‘…the joy of the Lord…’ mentioned in Nehemiah 8:10? Or scriptures like, ‘Serve the Lord with gladness: come before his presence with singing’ (Psalm 100:2 KJV); ‘…may your saints sing for joy’ (Psalm 132:9 NIV); ‘Rejoice in the Lord always…’ (Philippians 4:4 NIV); ‘A cheerful heart is good medicine…’ (Proverbs 17:22 NIV); ‘…In your presence is fullness of joy…’ (Psalm 16:11 NKJV)? Remember, as a Christian you represent Jesus. So if you’re happy, do God and the world a favour, and tell your face! Okay?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…I PLACE MY LIFE IN YOUR HANDS…</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 23.46 TM</span><br>Lesson 6: Give it to God.  Some of the things we struggle with seem to go on forever; making enough money, family stress; making life ……… Even when life is going smoothly we kinda live with one eye on the clock, wondering how long will this good thing last.  If you want real peace – give your worries to God.  When Jesus cried  ‘…I place my life in your hands…’ it wasn’t a cry of defeat or failure.  No way – it was pure trust – surrendering all to His heavenly Father.  Jesus had done what He had been sent to do.  His job was finished.  For Jesus to be able to give His life fully, He had to want God’s will above His own.  ‘Not my will, but yours be done’ (Luke 22:42 NIV) In other words, ‘Father I trust you with how it ends’.
You can get so angry sometimes saying, ‘God why didn’t you do what I wanted? I don’t get it!’ But did you ever check with Him that what you asked for was His will for your life?  So often we wanna have our cake and eat it.  We forget that it’s God we’re talking to.  We can’t behave like spoilt brats, stamping our feet when we don’t get our way.  He is God, He doesn’t bend to our rules!  God stubbornly wants the best for you; He will only agree with His Word in your life – and listen ‘…the words of the Lord are flawless…’ (Psalm12:6 NIV)  Awesome! Whatever is stressing you out give it over to God, take a step of trust today and you’ll see that you can take Him at His word!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>IT IS FINISHED.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>John 19:30 NKJV</span><br>Lesson 5: The Old Testament priests used to have a tough job! Not only were they up to their elbows in blood and animal carcases all day long sorting out the right sacrifices for particular sins – at the end of a tough day there was nowhere for them to sit down &amp; put their feet up.  Why? The priest’s work was never finished!  He couldn’t sit down.  But after Jesus cried, ‘It is finished’ He went back to heaven and sat down at the right hand of His Father; He finished the job!  The Greek words for ‘it is finished’ literally mean ‘paid in full’.  It’s what people in those days wrote across a receipt when the bill was paid in full.  Christ’s death covers your every sin; from the cradle to the grave.  And nothing you can do, can add or take away from what Jesus has done for you.
You can’t add to a finished job!  Imagine seeing a finely crafted coffee table sitting in a carpentry shop ready for delivery.  You grab some sand paper and say ‘It’s good, but not good enough, let me show you.’  The master carpenter immediately steps in and says ‘No you’ll ruin it!’  Or imagine receiving a very expensive present from a mate.  Immediately you pull out a £5 note and say, ‘Here let me help you out with the cost’.  How insulting?  You’re robbing the giver of his joy and the sacrifice of its worth.  Listen: ‘…this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God - not by works, so that no one can boast’ (Ephesians 2:8-9 NIV) Saving faith simply means, trusting only in a finished work of Christ!.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I’M THIRSTY.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 19.28 TM</span><br>Lesson 4: You’re only human.  Combine the torment of being crucified in the intense Jerusalem heat with the loss of bodily fluids, and you can understand why Jesus was thirsty.  However, the Bible says that when they offered Him water containing ‘a mild painkiller…He wouldn’t take it’ (Mark 15.23 TM).  Why? Because it would have dulled His senses and He wanted to stay alert. Awesome. Jesus could have summoned an army of angels to rescue Him.  But He chose to die for our sins.  He said, ‘No one takes my life…I give it up willingly!’ (John 10:18 CEV).  This explains why John wrote: ‘Jesus, seeing…everything had been completed’ (He fulfilled every prophecy concerning His crucifixion) said ‘I’m thirsty!’  Not only was Jesus in need of a physical drink, He needed a long drink from a spiritual source, His heavenly Father.  When He spoke the words ‘I thirst’ there is a deep longing that resonates from His heart to be reunited with His Father.  We can go for long periods of time without food but without water we die quickly – our organs stop working and we can’t function any more.  It’s the same principle with God; if we starve ourselves of His Word and stop drinking from His Spirit we start to lose the plot.
You see God made us to need Him.  We weren’t meant to do it alone.  Jesus said ‘…’Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God’.’ (Matthew 4:4 NIV)   He also talks about the refreshing water of God (John 4). So do yourself a favour, have a big feast and a long drink from your heavenly Father – chow down!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>GOD, WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME?</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 27:46 NKJV</span><br>Lesson 3: Direct the hard questions to God.  At Calvary, Jesus asks one of the most heart-wrenching questions ever recorded, ‘God, why have You forsaken Me?’  These words are also found in Psalm 22:1-3 TM, where David poured out his heart in despair, asking God, ‘Why did you dump me…Are you indifferent?’  Ever felt like that?  The Bible says that when Jesus was crucified, God made Jesus ‘who knew no sin, to be sin…so…we might become the righteousness of God in Him’ (2 Corinthians 5:21 NASB).  In order to break sin’s hold on mankind and make salvation possible, Jesus went through a temporary separation from God.  At that precise moment He felt ‘Godforsaken’. If you’ve ever felt overwhelmed and abandoned, you know from experience that there’s not another living soul who has a satisfactory answer to your ‘Why?’ With good intentions our loved ones can only go so far.  Only God can pour His healing into your broken heart and help you make sense (or at least accept) what’s happening.  That’s why you need to go to Him for your answers.
But here’s the flip side of asking tough questions, you might get tough answers; are you willing to accept His answer and do what He says?  The Bible says, ‘God has given us…his promise and his oath’ (Hebrews 6:18 NLT), so even if you don’t get the answer you want, you can trust that He’s listening.   Check this out: the One who makes ‘everything …work together for…good’ (Romans 8:28 NLT) always sends the answer that’s in your best interests.   So you can trust Him today…and the next!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>ASSUREDLY…TODAY YOU WILL BE WITH ME IN PARADISE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 23:43 NKJV</span><br>Lesson 2: Reach out to others.  When Jesus was hanging on the cross the Bible says, ‘One of the criminals hanging alongside cursed him …but the other…made him shut up: ‘Have you no fear of God…We deserve this…He did nothing.’  Then he said, ‘Jesus, remember me when you enter your kingdom.’  [Jesus] said…‘Today you will join me in paradise’ (Luke 23:39-43 TM).  One man mocked, the other acknowledged he was wrong and received mercy.  The truth is, as much as it winds judgmental people up, God said ‘If you confess and reject (your sin), you will receive mercy’ (Proverbs 28:13 NCV). That promise is for the lost, the least, and the lowest.
It’s amazing: even though Jesus had been battered, falsely accused and was now fighting for breath as he hung on the cross, he wasn’t blind to other peoples pain and suffering.  In the depth of His own agony He not only promised the thief on the cross eternal life, He comforted him with these amazing words: ‘Today you will join me in paradise!’  There’s a lesson here for you – one that Job learned.  Job lost all his kids and wealth in one day.  But instead of running, he grabbed hold of God – and went on to better days.  How?  Listen: ‘After Job had prayed for his friends, the Lord made him prosperous again and gave him twice as much as he had before … After this, Job…saw his children and their children to the fourth generation’ (Job 42:10 &amp; 16 NIV).  When you reach out to other people in pain you start to see your suffering differently.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>FATHER, FORGIVE THEM; THEY DON’T KNOW WHAT THEY’RE DOING.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 23:34 TM</span><br>Lesson 1: Forgive those who hurt you.  Two kids were playing when one accidentally hit the other with a stick.  That night the injured boy’s Mum said, ‘Son you must forgive Harry before you go to sleep.’  Grudgingly he replied, ‘Okay, but unless I die before I wake up, he’d better watch out tomorrow morning!’  Uh?!  When people hurt us, it’s hard to believe it could’ve been unintentional or done in ignorance.  Yet amazingly, after being beaten, humiliated and nailed to the cross, Jesus said, ‘Father, forgive them; they don’t know what they’re doing’  Forgiving means refusing to remain a victim.  By not holding grudges or dwelling on the pain, you free yourself from the feeling of being controlled by your offenders.  Jesus said, ‘Pray for anyone who mistreats you’ (Matthew 5:44 CEV).  Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a German Christian who was persecuted by the Nazis, said, ‘God doesn’t promise that when we bless our enemies they’ll not despitefully use us.  They will.  But that can’t hurt or overcome us, so long as we pray for them.  By praying for them, we are doing for them what they can’t do for themselves.’
Professor Tony Campolo often asks his college students what they know about the teachings of Jesus.  They always say the same thing: ‘Love your enemies.’  More than any other factor this ethos stands out as the thing that should separate Christians from non-Christians.  Jesus said, ‘Give as freely as you have received!’  (Matthew 10:8 NLT).  Being able to forgive others comes from a deep gratitude to God for forgiving our sins &amp; wiping the slate clean; something we totally don’t deserve.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>LEAH HAD WEAK EYES, BUT RACHEL WAS LOVELY...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 29:17 NIV</span><br>When Jacob first saw Rachel she took his breath away. Any time a bloke’s willing to work 7 years for a woman, he’s definitely in love! But the Bible says Rachel’s sister Leah, whose name means ‘gazelle,’ was lanky and ‘tender eyed.’ One translation says, ‘Leah had weak eyes, but Rachel was lovely...’  Others may judge you based on your looks, but God never does. He knew Rachel’s treasure was on her, while Leah’s was in her. 
Get this: before the world began, God chose you for a specific purpose. Although her husband Jacob didn’t notice her, Leah already had a great role in God’s plan. The Bible says, ‘Because Leah was unloved, the Lord let her have a child, while Rachel was childless’ 
(Genesis 29:31 NLT). God blessed Leah so much that her sons founded six of Israel’s twelve tribes! Not bad for a ‘loser!’
Before Leah was Laban’s daughter, or Rachel’s sister, or Jacob’s wife, she was God’s idea; and He never has a bad one! Before time began her identity was determined by Him. And so was yours. He ‘know[s] you by name and you have found favour’ with Him (See Exodus 33:12 NIV). Today God has put something inside you that He wants to draw out of you. The Bible says everything God makes is ‘…very good…’ (Genesis 1:31 KJV), and it’s time you started seeing yourself that way too! God knows you, He wants to change your self-image so others can appreciate your unique gifts and qualities. Are you ready to let Him do that?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…I SERVED YOU FOR RACHEL…WHY HAVE YOU DECEIVED ME?</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 29:25 NIV</span><br>If a girl’s self-worth is shaped by her father’s influence, Leah was out of luck, because her father Laban didn’t think that much of her. After making a deal with Jacob who wanted to marry her sister Rachel, Laban tricked him and he ended up with Leah. If you’ve ever struggled with low self-image you can guess how Leah felt. Here she was getting ready for her wedding, knowing she was the ‘loser’s prize.’ Imagine waiting all your life to get married only to discover that your dreams will never come true, ‘coz your husband loves somebody else.  It gets worse. Jacob spent the wedding night with Leah, and didn’t even recognize her until the morning when he complained to Laban, ‘…I served you for Rachel…why have you deceived me?’ Even after discovering he’d slept with Leah, Jacob still wanted her sister! Leah was with someone who couldn’t appreciate who she really was; someone who took what they wanted without even looking into her eyes – far less her soul! Today if you’re in a relationship with somebody who doesn’t really know you and makes no effort to find out, you can relate.   
But the good news is, while Leah spent years being invisible to Jacob, she wasn’t invisible to God. And neither are you! You may feel pushed aside, pulled back and put down. But God has given you amazing gifts, and if you let Him, He’ll draw them out of you. So talk to Him. Let Him show the treasure that’s inside you.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>HIS SHEEP FOLLOW HIM BECAUSE THEY KNOW HIS VOICE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 10:4 NIV</span><br>Do you ever feel that your mind is full of so many random thoughts, you can’t tell what’s you, what’s God or what’s rubbish?  Here are some tips directly from God’s word on how to know what’s what!  Tip 1)  know His voice.  Listen: ‘His sheep follow him because they know His voice’  If you’ve said yes to God you are one of His sheep.  Jesus himself promises that His sheep will know His voice.  How?  Tip 2)  know His spirit. When Jesus went back to heaven He didn’t leave His people to fend for themselves.  He sent His spirit to live in His people so they could know the will of the Father &amp; live their lives not being confused all the time.  Tip 3)  know His Word – the Bible isn’t just a nice book that Christians read.  Its our manual for life.  It tells us how to live right.  It helps us understand confusing situations. But best of all it is like a blueprint of God’s character.  If you wanna know what thoughts are God thoughts, get to know who’s talking to you.  Tip 4)  know Him.  This is the tip to top all tips – the foundation tip!  You see the more time you spend with your mates, the more you know them.  You find out what they like, what they don’t like etc.  It’s the same with God; the more time you spend getting to know Him the easier it is to recognise Him. The easier it is to pick out His voice in a crowd or in a mind that is full of random thoughts.  Take some time today, and get to know Him. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WHENEVER YOU’RE TRYING TO…GET THE BETTER OF OTHERS, THINGS FALL APART…</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JAMES 3:16 TM</span><br>Shakespeare calls it ‘the green sickness.’ The poet Horace said, ‘Tyrants never invented a greater torment.’ But envy’s sneaky. It recognizes that openly ‘trying to…get the better of others’ is wrong, so it looks instead for socially acceptable (and spiritual sounding) ways to express itself. Like the ‘Yes…but,’ approach. That’s where you say something nice about somebody, but make sure to put a sting in the tail. For example, ‘She’s a pretty girl but it’s a shame she’s too big for that outfit’.  Another favourite is questioning people’s motives. ‘He’s only being generous to totally show off’ Or, ‘If I was less generous I could afford to indulge myself’ and how about the old unflattering comparison that goes something like this, ‘If you think he can sing, you should hear my mate.’ Sadly one-upmanship is sometimes more common among talented professionals like writers, teachers, politicians, singers, doctors, athletes – and preachers! For whatever reason, we seem to have trouble acknowledging the gifts and contributions of others.
So what’s the answer? Paul says it lies in ‘…the rich simplicity of being yourself…’ (1 Timothy 6:6 TM). It’s in giving up your obsession with getting ahead of others and having more. It’s learning to be content with who and what you are right now, while always looking to learn and grow. Early in scripture God says, ‘Do not covet…anything…’ (Exodus 20:17 NLT), because most of what we get upset about won’t matter in eternity. And since we ‘…cannot carry anything with us when we die’ (1 Timothy 6:7 NLT), all those goals and achievements aren’t worth forfeiting your peace over, are they?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>IF…A CHRISTIAN…SEES A BROTHER IN NEED, AND WON’T HELP–HOW CAN GOD’S LOVE BE WITHIN HIM?</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 JOHN 3:17 TLB</span><br>Eleanor Bradley was shopping in New York City when she fell and broke her leg. For 40 minutes she begged for help before a cab driver stopped and drove her to hospital. Kitty Genovese was murdered on a suburban street one night while 39 people watched from their windows. Andrew Morille was repeatedly stabbed on the underground as 11 passengers looked on. These are shocking examples of turning a blind eye to someone’s pain.  But how often do we look away from helping others?  Even in the little things: holding a door open for someone struggling with their shopping, may mean a minute of your day but it might make theirs.   James says if you know someone’s hurting and all you say is, ‘…”God bless you; stay warm and eat well” - but then you don’t give that person any food or clothing. What good does that do?’ (James 2:16 NLT). John goes even further. ‘If someone who is supposed to be a Christian…sees a brother in need, and won’t help…how can God’s love be within him?’ Good question! It’s one thing to say you care.  It’s another to roll your sleeves up, jump in with both feet and maybe risk putting yourself out, for someone else.  People say ‘ignorance is bliss,’ what they really mean is, ‘if I close my eyes, I can pretend its not there.’ Open your eyes today and ask God to show you who needs your help, He’ll do it. The question is – how will you respond? ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WE WHO ARE STRONG…BEAR THE WEAKNESSES OF THOSE WITHOUT STRENGTH.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 15:1 NAS</span><br>A young man who committed suicide left this note: ‘Mum and Dad, I never did develop into a real person, and I can’t tolerate this false, empty life I’ve created with no connection to family or friends…I’ve led a detached existence. I’m a bomb of frustration and…it’s best to defuse the bomb harmlessly now.’ Authorities never identified him and his body was never claimed. In Britain, every week 100 people end their own lives. It’s the final form of self-rejection for those who battle loneliness, insecurity, hopelessness, and unattainable perfectionism. And it happens at every level: young mothers, businessmen, professors, retirees, and, yes, even church ministers who look like they’ve got it together. What’s sadder is, these people are crying out to be rescued. They leave clues, like: a) talking about suicide b) sudden personality changes c) depression and constant fatigue d) drastic weight loss e) actual suicide attempts. Many have experienced the death of a loved one, a family or relationship breakdown, terrible debt or long term unemployment. They see suicide as the only way out of their pain.
God tells us ‘who are strong…bear the weaknesses of those without strength.’ Often all it takes is somebody who’ll listen and provide a shoulder to lean on. Could you be that shoulder? If you’re reluctant to get involved because you’re afraid you’d be out of your depth, get help from a counsellor, pastor or a suicide prevention hot-line. You could really become someone’s lifeline!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WHEN HE SAW THE CROWDS, HE HAD COMPASSION ON THEM…</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 9:36 NIV</span><br>During WWII while visiting a missionary school outside Tibet, Bob Pierce noticed a little girl on the steps. She was malnourished, ragged, and her eyes revealed a lifetime of suffering. When he asked about her, one of the teachers said, ‘Oh, she sits there every day. She wants to attend school but we’ve no room.’ Troubled, Pierce replied, ‘Can’t you make room for just one more?’ The teacher replied, ‘We’ve made room fo “just one more” so often that our food’s stretched to the limit. We’ve got to draw the line somewhere.’ Refusing to accept this brutal reality, Pierce exclaimed, ‘A child needing help shouldn’t be turned away. Why isn’t something being done?’ Quietly the teacher picked the little girl up, plunked her in Pierce’s arms, and asked, ‘What are you going to do about it?’ That day Bob Pierce reached into his pocket to buy rice for one little girl, and it led to the founding of World Vision which is now a massive international relief agency!
When you don’t look at suffering, walking past it becomes easier until eventually you don’t notice. The Bible says that when Jesus, ‘Saw the crowds, he had compassion on them.’ Looking at the needs around you can sometimes be overwhelming, but remember, they come one person at a time. Because you can’t do everything doesn’t mean you can’t do something. What can you do? Remember the widow’s few pence in Luke 21? And the loaves and fishes Jesus multiplied in Matthew 14? When you give what you have, God multiplies it and miracles happen!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>DON’T LET ANYONE LOOK DOWN ON YOU BECAUSE YOU’RE YOUNG…AND IN PURITY.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 TIMOTHY 4:12 NIV</span><br>Tim was a young lad, not afraid of a days solid graft and at the time Paul wrote these letters to him he was working hard; preaching about God &amp; helping to build His church.  Paul warns him not to let anyone look down on him ‘cause he was young; so often you can be afraid to really be who you know God’s called you to be, or say what you wanna say because you think other people are gonna dismiss you cause you’re ‘a kid’.  Listen: some of the top dogs in the bible were picked out by God when they were really young; David was probably about 16 years old when God had him chosen as king.  Samuel must have been even younger when God came &amp; chatted to him for the first time.  
After his warning Paul didn’t stop there.  He tells Tim how to live a life that will make it clear to others that God is totally involved with his life.  He doesn’t tell him to bang a drum and be dead pushy forcing himself on people.  He says ‘…but set an example for the believers in speech, in life, in love, in faith, and in purity.’  Paul understood that respect doesn’t come through a load of words, &amp; big promises that never get met. (Proverbs 16:20 NLT) 
Respect comes from people seeing that the life you live matches up to the words you speak, so next time you feel dismissed: chill and just get on with being yourself and living that life which represents God to the max.  God will show you for who you truly are anyway so just enjoy today!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…HE PAYS EVEN GREATER ATTENTION TO YOU …NUMBERING THE HAIRS ON YOUR HEAD…</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 12:7 TM</span><br>If you watch a couple who are totally in love, there’s a certain sparkle in their eyes as they look at each other.   It’s their love language.  Did you know that God had His own love language?  Just check out the Bible.  It’s full of adventure, God saving His people, songs about how much He loves and longs to be loved.  And the amazing thing is the Bible was written for you; so you could get to know God, and how He feels about you.  Bonus (check out Jeremiah 33:10-11)! 
Sometimes we think God will only speak to us in church, or if we’ve prayed for five hours.  Some of us believe that unless the world is ending we shouldn’t bother God – guess what? God is bothered about!  He is bothered about what you’ve got to say, He’s bothered about what kind of day you’re having and you know what He’ll keep on being bothered until the day you die!  Listen: ‘…He pays even greater attention to you, down to the last detail – even numbering the hairs on your head…’ (Luke 12:7 TM).  If God can be bothered to keep a tab on how many hairs you’ve got growing out of your head then surely He wants to know about the choices you make, the stuff that hurts your feelings and what makes you well chuffed!  The thing is when you start to include God in the little things, you’ll find that the bigger picture begins to become clearer and make more sense, so today don’t just muddle through; get Him involved and take a moment to thank Him that He’s bothered!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>By your words I can see where I’m going; they throw a beam of light on my dark path.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 119:105 TM</span><br>Anyone who’s been camping knows the feeling; you wake up in the middle of the night desperate for the loo.  You lie in your tent and try to ignore the feeling but as time ticks by, you have to get up.  Grumbling, you rummage for your trusty torch and start to trek across the site.  It’s pitch black, but as you flick the switch on your torch, a beam lights up the ground in front of you. Listen: ‘By your words I can see where I’m going; they throw a beam of light on my dark path’.  The Bible is the words of God written down.  When you open it up and read it, like that torch, you flick the light on in your life.  It can answer a problem, give direction for your life and help you get to know God better.  It’s your trusty God torch!  He gives you His word and Spirit to help you stick to the right path and go in the right direction. 
The Bible uses the example of darkness and light over and over again to describe the difference between people who have found God (or been found by Him – depending on how you look at it) and those who haven’t. The Apostle Paul said to his mates in Corinth: ‘…God, who said, Let light shine out of darkness, made his light shine in our hearts…’ (2 Corinthians 4:6 NIV) Maybe today you could pray for your friends who have not yet had their lives brightened by God, that they would suddenly see what it’s all about.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>BUT THE LORD IS FAITHFUL, AND HE WILL STRENGTHEN AND PROTECT YOU FROM THE EVIL ONE</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Thessalonians 3:3 NIV</span><br>Years ago, a farmer and his son were travelling to the city to sell their vegetables. The dad relaxed while his son shouted at the ox to go faster. As they passed a friend’s house the older man insisted they stop and visit. Later, back on the road, he took the slow scenic route. At dusk he stopped for the night. Frustrated and angry his son said, ‘You’re more interested in sunsets and flowers than making money.’ To which his dad replied, ‘That’s the nicest thing you’ve ever said to me’.  Next morning as they travelled, a blinding flash split the clouds, followed by a low rumble, then the sky grew black. ‘If we’d hurried we’d have missed the storm grumbled the boy’. His dad replied, ‘Slow down son, you’ll last longer’. By late afternoon they reached a hill overlooking the city. After staring down at it for what seemed like an eternity, the boy finally turned and said ‘I see what you mean, Dad.’  Slowly and silently they turned around and walked away from what remained of Hiroshima. 
The Bible says ‘The Lord is faithful who will guard you…from…evil…’ You don’t know what you’re being protected from, but God does. The Bible says ‘He… saves your life!’ everyday (Psalm 103:4 TM). Your ‘…steps [and stops]…are directed by [Him]…’ (Psalm 37:23 NLT). He knows what’s round the next corner. That irritating traffic jam, that unexpected phone call were all part of his plan for you. So learn to trust him more. Complain less, worry less, and rush less. Okay?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE SHADOW OF YOUR SIN WILL OVERTAKE YOU; YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF STUMBLING ALL OVER YOURSELF IN THE DARK…</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 5:22-23 TM</span><br>When he was born God picked Samson for a special job. He’d everything go for him but he gave into lust and ruined his life. It all started when he ‘saw a woman’ (Jud 14:2) and told his folks, ‘Get her for me’ (14:3). God says, ‘The shadow of your sin will overtake you; you'll find yourself stumbling all over yourself in the dark…’ (Proverbs 5:22-23 TM).
After leading Israel for 20 years Samson went back to his old habits with a sleazy hooker in Gaza (Judges 16:1), then finally with two-faced Delilah (Judges 16:4). Because of this he was captured by the enemy, had his eyes gouged out and ended up working in prison. Think you can’t fall back into old habits? When Potiphar’s wife tried to seduce Joseph he had the sense to leg it. He knew he wasn’t strong enough to resist so he got out of there. Samson was so caught up in his sinful desires he didn’t even realised God had turned away (Judges 16:20). So what’s the solution? Paul says: ‘No test…is beyond…what others have had to face. All you need to remember is that God will never let you down; he’ll never let you be pushed past your limit; he’ll always be there to help you come through it!’ (1 Corinthians 10:13 TM). Whatever you’re struggling with today, whatever you’ve struggled with in the past, you can’t fight temptation alone so come out of the shadows and into the light. Stay close to God. He’ll never let you down.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Live a life filled with love for others, following the example of Christ… that sacrifice was like sweet perfume to him.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ephesians 5:2 NLT</span><br>We can’t do the whole ‘living a life’ thing in our own strength, we need Gods help. Listen: …‘we know how dearly God loves us, because he has given us the Holy Spirit to fill our hearts with his love.’ (Romans 5:5 NLT). Notice the word ‘given’, we can’t earn it, but it’s always available. 
Love is a choice. It’s not a mood, a magic feeling or reaction but a choice. Too many of us are living in this strange little world where we’re expecting to walk down the street one day and have God’s love come and hit us in the face. From that moment on we’ll automatically feel more love and be full of grace and patience and kindness and can’t help but hug every sad looking person that happens to walk by. But that’s rubbish. You’re not suddenly going to get smacked with love and float through life with a big dumb smile and kind heart. The truth is that the greatest sacrifice we make is choosing to love the unloveables. That kind of love involves forgetting what you want and showing love to them, regardless of what they’re like or how we feel at the time. Even if you don’t want to or you have other places to be or you just don’t really like them, choose to show Jesus love. Be a friend. Provide for their need whatever that may be. Pray for them and make yourself give them your most precious gift, your time. Only then can we really know the full power of God’s love.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Live a life filled with love for others, following the example of Christ… that sacrifice was like sweet perfume to him.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ephesians 5:2 NLT</span><br>You’ll never become ‘like sweet perfume’ to God without sacrifice; paying the price to love others. Loving others doesn’t mean a whole lot if we only love the people we pick, on our own terms, at a convenient time, place, occasion and in a cosy room with big cushions and a PlayStation. Loving people who are different to us; maybe they’re a bit weird, smelly, have funny hair, funny clothes, laugh at their own jokes, like Star Trek, but loving them despite all of this, now that’s the challenge! To love people the way Jesus did just goes right against the grain of how we’re made, it’s just not normal! 
It’s easy to think that some people are naturals when it comes to loving. We think they’re just ‘nice’ and wish we could be more like them. Anyone who thinks along these lines is just using it as an excuse not to be loving. They think it’s ok and don’t need to change because ‘That’s just the way I am, can’t help it. Always have been, always will be.’ Rubbish. Jesus made it clear when it comes to how we’re supposed to love. ‘A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you...’ (John 13:34 NIV). Notice the words ‘As I have loved you’. Jesus loves us no matter who we are or what we’ve done or how much we look like a Klingon! He knows the worst about us and believes the best, and that’s how we should love one another.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Teach us to make the most of our time, so that we may grow in wisdom.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 90:12 NLT</span><br>Often we get very distracted by things we have no control over. One worry is often the future but we do have some control. The Bible teaches us you reap what you sow which basically means if you work hard and think about what you’re doing, the future will reflect that. If you sit around and watch TV, don’t expect to do much with your life. Did you ever get given a presentation project in school? Take for example a model bridge. The idea is for your bridge to safely hold as much weight as possible. During the presentation you can guarantee the kids that messed around had two tubes and a piece of paper which could hold nothing. But, the kids who put the time in, carefully plan, think through the science and work hard, their bridge could always hold all the weights. 
In order to plan for the future you need two things; Decisions and the Discipline to follow through on them. Decide what you want to achieve; what God has called you to achieve and work until you get there! Loads of us never admit that stuff goes wrong because we didn’t prepare properly in the first place. In fact loads of us actually decide not to do what’s right in the first place! We know we shouldn’t but we decide to drink or smoke or go out with that person anyway. Good decisions aren’t normally easy but they are essential if you want to be successful. So plan your bridge, make today a masterpiece.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>MANY WOMEN DO NOBLE THINGS BUT YOU SURPASS THEM ALL.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 31:29</span><br>What makes a mum? Someone who gives birth or someone who takes care of you? Today we celebrate Mothering Sunday, a day to thank those fantastic people who have sacrificed so much to make you the person you are today. The person who went without sleep to feed you through the night. The person who comforted you as a toddler and rubbed it better each time you fell and scratched your knee. The person who cooked for you and taught you to tie your own laces. The person who cheerfully waved good bye on your first day of school and went home and secretly cried. The person who stuck your pieces of ‘art’ on the fridge door and who cheered like crazy as you raced down the playing field with a tennis ball on a spoon. The person who made your outfit for the Christmas play and never laughed when you accidentally bought the baby Jesus gifts of Gold, Frankenstein and Myrrh. The person who ferried you around like a mad taxi driver. The person who you asked ‘did you see me?’ and honestly replied ‘I wouldn’t have missed it for the world’. The person who secretly went without so that you didn’t have to. Today we honour those people.
No matter who did those things for you, your natural mum or someone who loved you like in her place, make sure you honour them today. Remember to say thank you and show your appreciation.

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…LET YOUR ‘YES’, BE ‘YES’…</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 5:37 NIV</span><br>In the story of Ruth, she lost her husband before she could have any children. Having lost her husband and 2 sons, Ruth’s Mother-in-law Naomi decided to travel back to the land she was from alone. Ruth insisted on going with her ‘…Where you go I will go…’ (Ruth 1:16 NIV) promising that she would be with her until the end. Naomi argued because she knew that meant Ruth would probably never marry again. 
God blessed Ruth for the promise she made. She not only found someone to love and marry her but she had a child whom Naomi helped to raise. It must have been hard for Ruth to make and keep that promise – sacrificing her own future for Naomi but God blessed her for it. Promises can be hard to keep, especially when circumstances change. A marriage vow can seem easy to make but supposing your husband or wife gets sick and needs to be cared for 24/7 for the rest of your lives? That’s when a promise can seem impossible to keep. The Bible says ‘let your “yes”, be “yes”’. Don’t promise something you don’t mean and you can’t deliver. Even if you just promise to try, keep that promise, don’t use it as a cop out. Either let your yes be yes or don’t say it in the first place. God will bless you for keeping a promise if it honours him, particularly if it involves sacrifice. If you’re struggling to keep a promise today, ask God for strength.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>A MAN’S PRIDE BRINGS HIM LOW...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 29:23 NIV</span><br>A British newspaper once sent a questionnaire to several of the nation's top writers - including Jeanette Winterson. Among the questions was: ‘Whom do you consider to be the greatest living English writer?’ Jeanette Winterson replied ‘Jeanette Winterson.’ Pride is not a good thing, yet it’s something that all of us struggle with some of the time. It can take many forms and make you boastful, jealous, selfish, snobby, nasty, arrogant, demanding and downright rude to name just a few. Writer CS Lewis believed that pride leads to every other bad thing. He thought that if you wanted to know how much pride is in you, think about how much you hate it in others. Ask yourself ‘how much do I hate it when others ignore me or fob me off?’ The more you hate it the more it’s probably because of your own pride making you feel others should notice you! 
Pride can cause many problems but worst of all it can be the biggest barrier between you and God. It could be because you’re to proud to admit you’re wrong, too proud to say sorry, too proud to admit you can’t do without him, too proud to admit you’re, well, too proud! Solomon says a man’s pride will bring him low because it’s easy to fool someone who thinks they are clever. All you have to do to bring them down is suck up a bit to their enormous ego. Pride can blind you to your own faults and to what the Bible clearly says.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE WORLD OF THE GENEROUS GETS LARGER AND LARGER...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 11:24 TM</span><br>A church leader once stood before his church when speaking on giving. He told the church ‘Each month I go through the accounts and see what everyone gives. If anyone gives more than me, I increase what I give.’ Generosity is a wonderful thing. This leader’s commitment to make sure he gave the most was good, but did he really need to announce it? Jesus teaches us loads about generosity. We learn from Him that generosity is great because it: 
1) turns your focus outward. When you’re focussed on helping others you forget to be selfish! 
2) blesses other people. When you are generous, others benefit 
3) helps you – the giver. Have you ever given generously to someone who really needed it? Even if you have none left for yourself it feels great. 
Someone once said ‘You have not lived a perfect day, even though you have earned your money, unless you’ve done something for someone who’ll never be able to repay you.’ That’s why Solomon wrote, ‘The world of the generous gets larger and larger…The one who blesses others is abundantly blessed…’ (Proverbs 11: 24-25 TM). Do you want to be blessed? Become more generous! If you’re worried about your motives and don’t want pride to get in simply keep it quiet! Do others need to know how much you give and what to? Not at all. If you really want everyone to know what you did for someone you seriously need to consider why you gave. God sees everything you do, everything you sacrifice and you will be rewarded.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…DO WHAT IS RIGHT IN THE EYES OF EVERYBODY.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 12:17 NIV</span><br>A Korean guy once approached the counter at an Airline Company. He explained that 9 years earlier when he was 17, he’d travelled on a child’s ticket and now he wanted to pay the difference. The agent was stunned by the man’s honesty. Billy Kim was 17 when the Korean war broke out. His dad died and his school was bombed, so he joined the American Troops, shining boots and washing dishes. When he landed in San Francisco he was really excited but he was worried that he had to find his way to Virginia and he had no money. His cheeky friends decided to buy him a child’s ticket and, pretending he was a child, they pinned a note to his uniform saying: ‘To whom it may concern, send this boy to Route 1, Box 75, Danville, Virginia.’ But the story doesn’t end there. Billy later became pastor of a church of over 10,000 people. He became president of a huge broadcasting company and even translated for Evangelist Billy Graham. Not bad for a shoe-shine boy! 
Paul writes ‘…do what is right in the eyes of everybody.’ God chooses his leaders not because of their connections and good looks but because of their character. Just because you can get away with something it doesn’t make it ok! The Bible is very clear about putting things right and something hanging over you – even something that maybe only you will ever know about needs sorting out. Think about what you need to do to put things right, then do it.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…WHOSOEVER WILL BE CHIEF AMONG YOU, LET HIM BE YOUR SERVANT.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 20:27 KJV</span><br>Are you in a position of power? You may not think so but whoever you are the chances are that one way or another you are. Whether you lead a youth group or cell group, a Christian Union, a football team, a band or just your little brothers or sisters, the chances are that you are in a position of power one way or another. Think about the people who look up to you and follow your example, are you a good leader or do you just use them? 
Loads of books have been written about power. They teach you how to manipulate people, and use them to do what you want to do. Power can be a very dangerous thing if it’s not used properly and people will often end up getting hurt and trampled on. Most people need power to feel important and worth something but this is the exact opposite of what Jesus taught. Power is dangerous unless you know your worth in God. If you understand just what He thinks of you then using others to feel important is totally unnecessary.  Being in power is about being a servant. Serve faithfully and whole-heartedly not so you can become powerful, but to become more like Jesus. Jesus had all the power in the universe at his fingertips yet he was a servant, he washed his disciples’ feet. As you become more trustworthy and faithful you will get more power, but you will handle it in the right way. So if you want to be a leader, serve.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…CAPTURE EVERY THOUGHT…</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 10:5 NCV</span><br>If you’re trying to kick a particular habit, thought or attitude, you need to learn to recognise the ‘triggers’. Figure out when you get tempted by the habit and why you were suddenly tempted. If your problem is triggered by TV, don’t watch it, if it’s a magazine, don’t read it, if it’s a situation, don’t go there! 
Every action begins as a thought and before you kick a habit physically you have to win the battle in your mind. That’s why Paul writes, ‘Capture every thought…make it give up and obey Christ.’ Have you ever noticed that when you are trying not to think about something it’s all you can think about? In order to ‘capture a thought’ you don’t do it by thinking ‘I must not think that, I must not think that…’. The only way to fight it is with the truth. What does God say about that particular thing? If you focus on the truth you will forget what you’re trying not to think about! You can’t break a habit in your own strength. Willpower alone is not enough or you would have stopped it by now! This is what Paul wrote about the battle in the mind. ‘…Fix your thoughts on what is true and good and right. Think about things that are pure and love… Think about things that you can praise God for and be glad about. Keep putting into practice all you learned from me and heard from me and saw me doing, and the God of peace will be with you.’ (Philippians 4:8-9 TLB)

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>CATCH… THE LITTLE FOXES THAT RUIN… OUR VINEYARDS…</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>SONG OF SONGS 2:15 NIV</span><br>In the Old Testament Solomon discovered that it’s ‘the little foxes’ that ruin your vineyards. They seemed harmless enough but they were digging holes and generally wrecking the place. In the story of Esther, King Xerxes hires his best mate Haman to be Prime Minister and gives him serious power. Esther was a Jew and had been chosen to be Queen because of her beauty. Esther’s Uncle Mordecai worked in the palace and as a Jew he refused to bow to Haman like he wanted. Haman was so angry with he Mordecai he convinced Xerxes to kill all the Jews by pretending they were a threat. In the end Esther was able to save her people by showing the King what sort of monster Haman really was. Haman was a little fox in Xerxes, vineyard. Xerxes hadn’t realised it but Haman snook his way in and Xerxes didn’t even realise there was a problem. 
There are little foxes in all our lives, small things that creep in and seem totally harmless but at the end of the day they can destroy you if you don’t deal with them. The foxes can be attitudes, habits, people, relationships, thoughts, feelings, places you shouldn’t go, TV you shouldn’t watch, websites you shouldn’t be on; all these can seem harmless. Ask God to show you today what foxes are in your life that need taking care of before it’s to late. Ask Him to give you the strength and wisdom to know how to deal with them in the right way.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE LORD IS CLOSE TO EVERYONE WHO PRAYS TO HIM...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 145:18 NCV</span><br>God’s help is always available, but it flows more strongly towards those who really go after it. You get nothing sat around watching TV all day. God loves radical, on the edge risk-taking faith. If you really want to see God at work take some chances for Him! 
Listen: One day a couple of youth workers were chatting to some kids on the street about Jesus and the way He heals. Excited, the kids decided to give this healing thing a try and invited the youth workers to go with them to meet their ‘friend’. The youth workers were well up for it until they realised they had been taken to the scariest criminal on an inner-city estate who was struggling to walk. An audience of 50 or so local youth and criminals gathered to see the ‘show’ and whether God really could heal. Wondering how they ended up here the terrified workers cried out to God and He answered there and then. The man walked. 
Maybe all you have today is a belief that God wants to help and a hope that He will. Maybe you feel like all you have to offer Jesus is your pain. Perhaps your past has kept you from coming to Him before.  Wherever you are at, come to Him. God loves seeds of faith, no matter how small. Step out, trust him, take some action and get ready to give Him all the praise. He may not always respond the way you expect but you’re guaranteed a good answer!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…HUMBLE YOURSLEVES…THAT HE MAY EXALT YOU...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 PETER 5:6 NKJ</span><br>Your ego (thinking you’re top banana) can get in the way of God’s blessing. Have a think today about how you see yourself. Is it a good image or a bad one? Why is it a good or bad image? It’s hard to stay humble when we think a lot of ourselves. It’s hard to stay humble when others tell us we’ve done a great job or we look great or you’ve achieved something brilliant. At the same time it’s hard to be confident if we feel we have failed or we’re not good enough or we don’t look the way we want. The Bible says we are to ‘humble ourselves’. When Jesus was born the Almighty God, Creator of heaven and earth had humbled Himself and made Himself a mere human – not to be served but to serve! Jesus knew who He was yet He served his disciples, He even washed their smelly feet! He was a humble servant yet totally confident because He knew who His father was. Do you know who your Father is?
Despite what many think, being humble does not mean thinking less of yourself or talking yourself down or pretending you’re no good at something. True humility means you simply think of yourself less often. Serve and love others. Help people, be friends with them, put their needs before yours. Do this not because they matter more than you or are better than you but because that’s exactly what Jesus did!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…the fruit of the spirit is…joy…</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Galatians 5:22 NIV</span><br>Have you ever met one of those people who seem bubbly and full of joy like all the time? How do they do that? For most of us, we tend to stress about most things: being late for school, putting weight on, forgetting homework, getting a spot, accidentally sending an SMS about someone TO them! You name it – we all get stressed – and then we start having a go at God! The problem is we forget that God never promised us a trouble free life. What He did promise is that he’ll be with us through the troubles and make us stronger. So if life is not supposed to be trouble free, how can we have this joy Jesus promised? 
1) realise that you’re stressed because life is not going quite the way you’ve decided it should be 
2) don’t worry about things you have no control over, if you can’t change it, accept it and move on 
3) don’t expect everyday to be fantastic. Problems – great and small will help you grow. Even try to thank God for them when they come along and ask Him how they can be used for good! If you try to find the good in everything, life will seem much better. Rather than fighting life you’ll be flowing with it. As you work at it you’ll enjoy life far more. That’s why Paul wrote, ‘Always be joyful. Keep on praying. No matter what happens, always be thankful, for this is God's will for you who belong to Christ Jesus.’ (1 Thessalonians 5:16-18 NLT)

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…IF YOU’RE WORN OUT IN THIS FOOTRACE WITH MEN, WHAT MAKES YOU THINK YOU CAN RACE AGAINST HORSES?</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JEREMIAH 12:5 TM</span><br>So you’re facing a giant, everything is just too much and you want to give up. One question: is the giant really real and really that big, or are you just letting the little stuff pile too high? Jeremiah freaked out when he saw his people panicking about little things. ‘...if you’re worn out in this footrace with men, what makes you think you can race against horses? And if you can’t keep your wits during times of calm, what’s going to happen when troubles break loose like the Jordan in flood?’ (Jeremiah 12:5 TM)
You need to win small victories everyday to learn how to handle the big stuff. It may be refusing that extra chocolate bar or biting your tongue when your mum asks you to wash up. It’s the small battles that prepare you for the big ones. Before you run a marathon you have to run a mile. Training is hard work but instead of feeling guilty that you didn’t get up at 5am to start the day in five hours of prayer, try ten minutes and keep going. Instead of feeling bad that you haven’t read the Bible cover to cover, pick a chapter or psalm that’s appropriate for where you’re at and read it over each day until you totally get it. It’s your ‘all or nothing’ attitude that’s holding you back. Go back to basics; take care of the little stuff.

When Robert Livingston, a missionary doctor, died, the Africans removed his heart and buried it in the land he loved. When he died, they found him in prayer with his Bible opened to Matthew 28. Beside verse 20 he’d written: ‘The word of a Gentleman.’  Livingston could easily have lived comfortably in his native Scotland. What kept him in Africa? His arm was paralysed from a lion attack, he’d suffered 27 bouts of jungle fever and was exhausted from battling slave traders. Addressing the University of Glasgow, Livingston said, ‘What sustained me amidst the trials, hardships and loneliness of my exiled life, was the promise of a gentleman of the most sacred honour: it was this promise, ‘I am with you always, even to the end of the age’. People talk about the sacrifice I’ve made. But can it be called a sacrifice when it’s simply paying back a small part of a great debt I owe to God? A payment, that brings peace of mind and the hope of a glorious destiny? It is no sacrifice, it is a privilege!’ As a man cried openly at his funeral, a friend asked if he’d known Livingston personally. He said, ‘I weep not for Livingston, but for myself. He lived and died for something, I have lived for nothing.’ Livingston’s motto was, ‘I place no value on anything I have, except in its relationship to the Kingdom of God.’ Can you say that?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…I WILL…GIVE…EACH ONE…A NEW NAME...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>REVELATION 2:17 CEV</span><br>To begin a science lesson about magnets, a teacher asked her class, ‘My name starts with ‘M’ and I pick things up. What am I?’ A little kid replied, ‘My mum!’ 
Names are important. Napoleon knew the names of thousands of his soldiers. University President Charles E Eliot knew the name of every individual student. The Bible is filled with people whose names had special significance like Simon renamed Peter, Jacob renamed Israel, and Saul who God changed to Paul. Even Mary got told what to call her new baby Jesus. God’s big on names. In Revelation, He says that He’ll give us all ‘a new name’. 
Have you ever had someone important unexpectedly remember your name? It’s a great feeling. When you meet new people it’s not by accident; God planned it. Their names are important to Him. If you’re not great with names, rather than apologising for being ‘hopeless with names’ how about making a real effort to remember them? It can make a real difference to making someone feel you care. Here are three ways to help: 
1) as you meet someone and get their name repeat it, even discuss it. Using someone’s name straight away helps it to sink in 
2) association – link the name to something or someone with the same name. Think of something it reminds you of or rhymes with eg. Kelly and Jelly!  	3) introduce them to others using their name and repeat it to yourself. 
Reaching someone for God often means caring enough to remember their name. Are people that important to you?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>YOU DID NOT CHOOSE ME, BUT I CHOSE YOU...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 15:16 NIV</span><br>God knows everything about you, the good, the bad and the ugly – but He chose you anyway. How amazing is that? It’s also a truth that’s very difficult to hold onto when you’re having a bad day or feel far from God. So what does it mean to be chosen? 
1) to be chosen is to be totally individual and unique! Have you ever felt like just a face in a crowd? Each one of us has a desperate desire to be special, to be noticed, to be the most important person to someone else. With God everybody is a somebody. To Him there are no misfits, rejects or second class citizens. 
2) you have something individual to contribute. Chosen people are significant; in sports teams those picked first are chosen for a good reason, because they will make most difference. You have been chosen because there is a job which you will be best at. 
3) to be wanted by God. You are chosen because God wants you, no matter what others think or what you’ve been told the unchanging, everlasting God has chosen you, He wants you. 
When we are picked to do something it normally means someone else didn’t get to do it. God doesn’t choose that way, His plan is not to upset the lives of others but to make them better. In God’s plan those who are chosen are always chosen to serve. By serving one another all our lives are changed for the better and we will learn to love and respect in a whole new way.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I DENIED MYSELF NOTHING MY EYES DESIRED...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ECCLESIASTES 2:10 NIV</span><br>Read these words from a man who had everything. ‘I piled up silver and gold… I gathered a chorus of singers to entertain me…voluptuous maidens for my bed. Oh, how I prospered! …Everything I wanted I took - I never said no to myself. I gave in to every impulse, held back nothing….Then I took a good look at everything I'd done… I saw nothing but smoke…There was nothing to any of it. Nothing.’ (Ecclesiastes 2:8-11 TM). 
Delicious food, lots of sex, world-wide fame, massive wealth, unlimited power; Solomon worked for and achieved it all but it turned out to be a life of trivial pursuit, chasing after meaningless things. 
So why does all this stuff leave us so empty? Like a big, greasy fry-up it all feels great at the time but it doesn’t take long before you begin to regret it and actually feel worse than you did before. The reason you are left feeling so empty is because of God. He wants us to have a great time yes but the missing part in all of us is that desire to be in relationship with Him. He is the only one that can fill that hunger, he not only tastes far better than the fry-up but leaves you feeling great afterwards! When you go after a relationship with God everything else you need gets thrown in as a bonus! Jesus said ‘Steep your life in God-reality, God-initiative, God-provisions. Don't worry about missing out. You'll find all your everyday human concerns will be met.’ (Matthew 6:33 TM)

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…DON’T GET WORKED UP ABOUT WHAT MAY OR MAY NOT HAPPEN TOMORROW...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 6:34 TM</span><br>When it comes to the future young people tend to fall into two categories: those that panic about the future and those who don’t think about it enough. You’re constantly faced with the future and have to make what seems like huge decisions that may well affect the rest of your life when the reality is, you don’t really know what you want to do, where you want to go or who you want to be! The fantastic thing about God is He has it all in hand. He knows where He wants you, He knows what he’s planned and He knows who you will be! The key is to trust Him. The chances are you can plan out the next 50 years of your life but it’s a waste of time because He has probably got something in store that you never even thought of! 
So where does that leave you? Well, you don’t have to worry for starters. Don’t panic about your decisions, just ask God to make sure you make the right choices at the right time. Focus on who you are, not what you do: your qualifications don’t qualify you for what God has planned. You may be the best person in the world at something but if you don’t develop the character God needs he will raise up someone else for the job. Be flexible – you may be totally certain about you future or what you are going to be but if God calls you to something else, be ready to roll with it. Remember, you can’t see the bigger picture, but He can.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING AGAINST SOMEONE, FORGIVE...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MARK 11:25 TM</span><br>In the Bible, Peter was Jesus’ main man. He often got it wrong and he wasn’t the sharpest tool in the box, but he really loved Jesus. Peter was the one who walked on water; yes he nearly sunk but at least he got out of the boat.. Peter promised Jesus he would be with him; he even promised to die with him. Later that same night Jesus was arrested and Peter said three times that he didn’t know him. Imagine how Jesus felt; his best mate, his main man, the one he would build his church on, and he said he didn’t even know him. 
A little time after his death Jesus appeared to Peter and the others on a beach. Was he annoyed? No, he even cooked them a fry-up! Jesus had already forgiven Peter in his heart; he didn’t hold anything against him. 
Most people don’t hurt us on purpose; often they don’t even know they have. If you’ve been hurt by someone, refusing to forgive will do you far more harm than them. People will let you down, it’s not a case of if, it’s a case of when – we’re all human and Jesus knew that. Don’t fall into the mistake of kidding yourself you have forgiven someone when really you’ve just buried the issue somewhere for later. You know you’ve forgiven someone when you a) stop telling people what they did, and b) stop trying to hurt them back. 
Want a little secret to forgiveness? Pray for God to bless them – you have to forgive or you can’t honestly do it!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…MERCY IS…WHAT YOU LOVE MOST.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MICAH 7:18 TM</span><br>This sign was outside a nuns convent: Absolutely No Trespassing! Violators Will Be Prosecuted to the Fullest Extent of the Law. Signed – The Sisters of Mercy! Doesn’t sound quite right does it?  Thankfully Jesus proved on the cross that ‘…Mercy triumphs over judgment!’ (James 2:13 NIV). In the book Hosea, this prophet guy married a woman called Gomer. After having three children with him, shady Gomer deserted the family to live with another man. Later she worked as a prostitute and that was when God said to Hosea ‘…Go, show your love to you wife again, though she is…an adulteress’ (Hosea 3:1 NIV). Even though Gomer totally showed up her husband in front of everyone, Hosea showed her mercy and love, and welcomed her back as his wife!
Loving people who have wronged us is a very difficult thing to do. It goes right against our natural instinct to fight back and defend ourselves. Remember the Bible doesn’t say ‘Do for others as they have done for you’, it says ‘Do for others as you would like them to do for you.’ (Luke 6:31 NLT) – There’s a big difference! 
If today you’re struggling with forgiveness, think about all God has forgiven you. You have been shown love and mercy far beyond anything you can imagine or understand. No matter what we have ever said or done that has hurt God or other people ‘He’s totally forgiven it on the cross. We might not have gone off and treated God the way Gomer treated Hosea’ but we’ve been unfaithful in other ways. And yet like Hosea God has chosen to show us His love again and again.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THERE IS A TIME FOR EVERYTHING...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ECCLESIASTES 3:1 NIV</span><br>Have you ever pushed a relationship so far that it’s all just gone totally pear shaped? As humans we have a terrible habit of rushing in and forcing the issue instead of having the patience to know when to back off. The Bible says there’s ‘a time for everything.’ There’s a time to stop pushing someone and just let God do his work, otherwise you risk creating scars that might take years to heal. 
As painful as it is, letting go of people and situations you can’t control is normally the wisest course of action. If you’ve put your foot in it, hurt someone, made a mistake or just been downright annoying then apologising and backing off is often the hardest but definitely the wisest thing you can do! Just remember; manipulation, emotional blackmail and trying to get attention is just going to make things worse. A relationship won’t work unless both parties want it to. Choose your battles carefully. If you’ve hurt someone they often need a little time to get over it and really forgive you; so give them that space! Before you jump on every little comment or action think, ‘can I let this one go?’
Think about your current relationships. Are there any situations where a more prayerful but ‘hands off’ approach would be the best way? Letting go doesn’t mean you stop caring, it’s actually a sign of maturity, giving God space to work through the situation.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…I WILL BUILD YOU UP AGAIN...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JEREMIAH 34:4 NIV</span><br>When we read the early chapters of Genesis we find that Adam had a relationship with God before he had a relationship with Eve. That’s really important. Why? Because nobody but God can tell you who you really are, or what you’re worth! Until you totally get that, you’ll keep looking for someone to love you so much that you’ll finally start feeling good about yourself. The trouble is, when you think you’ve found that someone you’ll cling to them like chewing gum on your shoe. You’ll agree with everything they say and do and have no opinions of your own. You’ll feel jealous and threatened if they do or enjoy anything without you. No relationship can survive that kind of dependence! 
Adam could only learn to love and understand Eve after he really knew God. It’s in God’s presence, free from what others think that you really see yourself in the right way; the way God sees you as the person you were made to be.  It’s only once you’re in that place that you’re ready for a relationship. In relationship with God you’ll learn what you’re worth and you will only give yourself to someone who thinks as much as God does. 
If you’ve ever been abused, abandoned, betrayed or feel like you’re just not good enough, check out these words. They’re from a God whose opinion of you never changes:  ‘…I have loved you with an everlasting love; I have drawn you with loving kindness. I will build you up again…’ (Jeremiah 31: 3-4 NIV)

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…TAKE DELIGHT IN HONOURING EACH OTHER.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 12:10 NLT</span><br>It’s so easy to forget about other people, until we need them. And we do. A few years ago the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded on take off due to a little part called an ‘O-ring’ not quite working as it should have done. Out of all the millions of parts that were needed to work together, just one failed and that resulted in disaster. So what’s the point? Basically we need each other! We were made to function together so let’s learn to live together and love one-another! 
To make life work the way God made it to, we need to learn how to lean on each other yet know how to support others. We need to be generous enough to give, but humble enough to receive; be honest enough to share our faults, but always be willing to forgive others.
Loving and accepting people is not optional. Sorry to burst your bubble but you don’t get to opt-in or opt-out of love, acceptance, tolerance, understanding or patience – not if you expect that from others! The Bible says, ‘…take delight in honouring each other…Be patient in trouble, and prayerful always. When God’s children are in need, you be the one to help them out…’ (Romans 12:10-13 TLB).  
Why should we love one-another in all circumstances? Because that’s what God does for us. Despite what you may think no-one is a strong, capable, independent, cool, hot-shot so let’s stop acting like we are. Life’s hard enough without playing that game.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>The LORD keeps watch over you as you come and go, both now and forever.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 121:8 NLT</span><br>During a terrible thunderstorm one night, a mum rushed to her little Jonny’s room knowing he must be terrified. The house flashed and she ran into the room to find Jonny standing at the window. Excited, Jonny shouted ‘mummy, guess what, I was standing at the window and God took my picture!’ Little Jonny was convinced that God was at work so his world was a totally safe place to be. 
Ask yourself  ‘What would life be like if I was so certain of God’s love and care that this world is a totally safe place for me to be?’ We wouldn’t get as stressed. You wouldn’t worry about not being good enough. You wouldn’t have to hurry even when you’re busy due to an inner-peace. You wouldn’t speak without thinking and you can risk obeying God because you totally trust him! Of course we need to be wise and safe but with our life totally in Gods hands as he promised, he watches over us and we don’t need to worry! If we’re following his plan, doing as he has asked and living a life worth living we don’t need to stress over things, not even the results of our actions. It’s all in his loving hands.  
The theory is great but do you think living this way is really possible? ‘The LORD keeps you from all evil and preserves your life. The LORD keeps watch over you as you come and go, both now and forever’ (Psalm 121:7-8). What more proof do you need?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Then Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, “Send me your son David, who is with the sheep”.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Samuel 16:19 NIV</span><br>In this story David is an insignificant shepherd boy and the psycho King Saul regularly gets taken over by an evil spirit. Recognising this, Saul calls for someone to come and play the harp for him. David arrives and once again Saul is taken over by the evil spirit but as David plays his harp the spirit leaves.  If you are serious about fulfilling the plan God has for you, look at these three things. 
When the time is right AND you are ready, God will send for you. He will open the right doors and give you favour with the right people. Who notices a shepherd boy looking after a few sheep? God does! Do whatever God has asked here and now and that’s all the qualification you need for the next thing. Don’t get impatient or fed up, God knows where to find you! 
God needs talent AND character! David got the job because of his harping skills but it was his honesty and passion for God that let him not only keep it but grow; even in a pretty dodgy environment! You don’t know how important the lessons you’re learning now will be in the future but God does so don’t blow it! 
God gives us jobs that feel uncomfortable. God picked David to serve a King who’d lost the plot; jealous, insecure and troubled by an evil spirit. Why? Because if you can do that you can do anything. You learn to love the unlovable, understand grace, grow in patience and complete Gods plan. This is your path to destiny.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…a righteous man will be remembered for ever...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 112: 5-7 NIV</span><br>Have you ever wondered how you will be remembered? This isn’t something most young people need to think about but it’s important because what you want to leave behind will affect how you live your life. Here are five things you will be sure to leave behind:
1) what you invest in other people - so make sure you invest as much time as possible 
2) your prayers will never be forgotten by God and may be answered long after you’re gone; so pray like crazy! 
3) your life’s story may live on to inspire others so make it a good one; full of God, faithfulness, excitement and be a great example for others to follow 
4) your giving will carry on; the impact of the money you give to Gods work now could have a massive effect on the future so be generous and give money where God tells you. 
5) multiplication. It’s a big word but think of it this way, if in your life you pray for and see five of your friends become Christians, then they each see five, then they each see five, in no time at all that’s 155 Christians just because of your prayers! 
Thinking about how you will be remembered might sound a bit morbid but it’s actually about life not death! The way you live your life will have an affect long after you’re gone – it may be a good effect or it may be a bad effect – so make the decision today to invest for the future in the way that God wants.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Luke 5:16 NIV</span><br>If you’re serious about getting serious with God, you can almost guarantee one of the battles you’ll face is with hurry. In the world we live you tend to find two types of people, those who can be bothered, and those who can’t. Those who can’t suffer from what’s called apathy and those who can are usually so focussed on fighting apathy that everything has to be done at warp speed. While this super-sonic way of living starts to get the job done, the pit-falls are normally as follows: a) you get worn out  b) you get frustrated at what seems like apathy from anyone going slower than you  c) you become so focussed on getting the job done you actually forget to have a relationship with God!  
Nobody was in more demand than Jesus but he always knew that there was a time for hurry and a time for rest. Have you ever noticed that despite living a hectic lifestyle Jesus never got stressed out? In those three years he never even felt the need for a little holiday; not even a day trip to Blackpool! 
The truth is, as much as we complain about it, we love hurry. It keeps the adrenaline pumping and makes us feel important. Jesus never hurried. He had time for people, his diary was flexible. Nothing was so important that he couldn’t change his plans for someone. And what’s the secret? Solitude. Jesus took time out, away from busyness to be with His Father. Make sure booking time out for God has the highest priority in your diary this week.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WHEN THE RIGHTEOUS SEE GOD IN ACTION THEY’LL LAUGH, THEY’LL SING...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 68:3 TM</span><br>After teaching His disciples, using an image of the vine and the branches, Jesus told them, ‘I have told you this so that you will be filled with my joy. Yes, your joy will overflow!’ (John 15:11 NLT). He’s saying that this important life-teaching will result in something you can’t buy at Tesco – Joy! Joy is happiness with bells on, satisfaction with go-faster stripes! Nehemiah writes, ‘…the joy of the LORD is your strength’ (Nehemiah 8:10 NIV).  Did you hear that, Joy gives you strength. Imagine you’re a curry (just go with this ok!) you’re in the chef’s pan, the customer has asked for extra-strong, extra-hot, and extra-spicy, so in goes the special ingredient: JOY POWDER. You have just become the most talked about dish in the restaurant :-) 
Listen: ‘When the righteous see God in action they’ll laugh, they’ll sing’ Joy is never going to come to people who walk around with their eyes closed because it’s about SEEING God in action. When we use our ‘faith-eyes’ – our ability to see and feel God’s goodness in things, our capacity for joy increases. 
The first step to joy is to start looking for God in action. If we live with the illusion that joy might come to us someday if we just stand in the same place and wait long enough, we’ll be waiting for eternity. Instead we need to lay down our ambitions and our agendas and take up Gods. We need to admit that our own plans lead to frustration and ask for His. That’s what the bible calls being humble. And guess what? ‘The humble will see their God at work and be glad. Let all who seek God’s help live in joy’ (Psalm 69:32 NLT)

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>SURELY YOUR GOODNESS AND UNFAILING LOVE WILL PURSUE ME ALL THE DAYS OF MY LIFE…</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 23:6 NLT</span><br>You’ll miss what God’s planning for you next if you cling to the past and yearn for yesterday. When a new page in your life is turned, a new place to live, a new school, even maybe a new ‘Mum’ or ‘Dad’ suddenly on the scene, the temptation is to wish for things to be the way they used to be. Listen to the Apostle Paul’s words echoing through history ‘…Even though on the outside it often look like things are falling apart on us, on the inside, where God is making new life, not a day goes by without his unfolding grace.’ (2 Corinthians 4:16 TM)
Don’t limit your life by the achievements of the people who’ve gone before you, older brothers and sisters, or even your parents. Keep your mind fresh by having expectations that go beyond the example they’ve set you. Maybe in your family there are people who seem a tough act to follow. Well don’t you think Joshua had a similar problem stepping out of Moses’ shadow! Learn from everyone; copy no-one, you are a unique person destined to make a unique impact. Maybe your family is the opposite. Perhaps you’re the first one to ever blaze a trail for God in this world and you feel starved of support and encouragement. Listen: ‘The Lord God is my strength, my personal bravery, and my invincible army…’ (Habakkuk 3:19 AMP). God is your first resource and your last resort. When you really need people there to help you on your journey, He’ll bring them across your path. But every step of the way you can be sure that goodness and unfailing love will pursue you all the days of your life; what more could you ask for?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE RIGHTEOUS WILL FLOURISH LIKE A PALM TREE...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 92:12 NIV</span><br>Palm trees. You generally don’t get them growing in your back garden! Palm trees are associated with exotic places, hot places, and they’re quite amazing trees! For starters, you can cut it but you can’t kill it. The nutrients that most trees need to survive can be found just below the bark, so when you cut them they die. But not the palm tree; its life comes from its heart so it thrives even under attack. Don’t let surface issues faze you. Stay focused on what God promised you!
The palm tree bends but it won’t break. Monsoon storms and hurricanes can blow most trees away, but not the palm tree. It’s flexible. It can bend all the way to the ground, and when the storm is over it straightens up again and is actually stronger. You were made to bend, not break. God promises to give you ‘…strength that endures the unendurable and spills over into joy’ (Colossians 1:11 TM). The unfolding of God’s amazing plan for your life will happen as you show your ability to endure. 
The palm tree’s depth exceeds its height. While the roots of the average tree go a few feet under, the roots of the palm tree go deep in search of water. David said this about people who trust in God, ‘They are strong, like a tree planted by a river...’ (Psalm 1:3 NCV). God’s plan for you is to go deep, stay connected to Him, and never be uprooted, or blown away. If you’re facing attack, or a storm, or a dry season don’t ask ‘Why me?’ instead remember, ‘God has made me like a Palm tree’.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…FORGIVE…AS QUICKLY AND THOROUGHLY AS GOD…FORGAVE YOU.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 4:32 TM</span><br>Do you know that forgiveness has very little to do with the other person; it’s a decision you make, like expelling carbon dioxide from your lungs because you know that holding on to it will only poison you. So release it. Go ahead; exhale. Let all that bitterness out and breathe in the oxygen of God’s love. The test of love is to forgive the guilty. That’s what God did for you – and it’s what He expects you to do for others! Not suggests, expects! Here’s a little test you can do right now –  are you refusing to forgive some things that aren’t any worse than some of the things you’ve done to other people yourself? Forgive them, or you’ll never be free to enjoy the relationship God wants you to have with them; and Him. 
Whatever you don’t forgive, you relive. That’s what makes you keep striking out at others, robs you of the joy of loving, and being loved in return. Unforgiveness is an umbilical cord that keeps you tied to the past. When you forgive, you cut that cord. When you refuse to, you remain connected to memories that can distort your personality. That’s how issues pass from generation to generation. So take charge today by saying, ‘This ends here and now, and it ends with me!’ Learn to receive forgiveness from God – and from those you’ve hurt – then offer it out to those who’ve hurt you – have a forgiveness sale – make some special offers! Do it so that your heart will become tender, your spirit lighter, your mind freer, your vision clearer. Everybody loves a sale!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…THE TRUTH ITSELF STANDS UP FOR DEMETRIUS...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>3 JOHN 1:12 TM</span><br>When other people say cool things about you, you have acceptance; but when the truth itself stands up for you, you have character. Demetrius had it; do you? As you read these words today, take time to ask yourself, ‘Do I have character?’ 
Character is confidence dressed in humility. It keeps its word, its temper and its friends. It has a steady eye, a steady nerve, a steady tongue, and steady habits. It’s silent when it has nothing to say, thoughtful and compassionate when it does speak. Character is always first to make amends when something’s wrong. Character doesn’t run scared; It’s surefooted, brave, and handles whatever comes along. Character has a sense of humour. It knows that a good laugh is the oil in the engine of relationships. Character never makes excuses. It learns from its mistakes and becomes wiser. Character knows that respect and good manners small things that make a big difference. Money can’t buy character. A billionaire can be totally without it while a busker may have it oozing out of every pore. Character can walk with kings and eat with tramps. Everyone is equal, and equally loved through the eyes of Character. Character is a journey, not a destination. The path is rarely broad or flat but the way is certain, marked by a set of footprints left in the earth 2000 years ago. Character leads, only as it follows.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…I’M ON MY WAY TO GET YOUR ROOM READY...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 14:3 TM</span><br>Born during the 1880’s, John Todd was six when his parents died. His wealthy auntie offered him a home, and when her servant Caesar went to get him the conversation went like this: John: ‘Will I like living there?’ Caesar: ‘You’ll be in good hands.’ John: ‘Will she love me?’ Caesar: ‘Yes, she’s got a big heart.’ John: ‘Will I have my own room and a puppy?’ Caesar: ‘Everything’s all set.’ John: ‘Will she go to bed before I arrive?’ Caesar: ‘No, she’ll be waiting for you.’ Sure enough, as they approached he saw a candle in the window and his auntie standing in the doorway. She kissed him and welcomed him. Over the years she became a true mother to him. Todd eventually became a church leader.
Years later, when his Auntie’s health was failing she wrote to him about her impending death, wondering what would become of her. Todd wrote back saying, ‘My Dear Aunt: Years ago I left a house of death not knowing where I was going, whether anyone cared, or if that was the end of me. The ride was long but your servant encouraged me. Finally I arrived to your warm embrace and a new home. I was welcomed; I felt safe. You did all this for me, now it’s your turn to go. I’m writing to let you know someone will be waiting up for you. Your room’s ready, the light’s on, the door’s open, and they’re expecting you. I know, because once, long ago, I saw God standing in your doorway.’ 
Good news: you don’t need to fear death because Jesus went ahead; and He’ll be waiting for you.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…KEEP AWAY FROM ANYTHING THAT MIGHT TAKE GOD’S PLACE...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 JOHN 5:21 NLT</span><br>There are some pretty extreme stories in the Old Testament that leave us scratching our head and thinking, ‘What..?’ Like when the Israelites started dissing the food God miraculously provided. ‘Then the LORD sent venomous snakes among them; they bit the people and many Israelites died.’ (Numbers 21:6 NIV). Heavy scenes! Not surprisingly, the people repented and begged God to remove the snakes. Then something weirder happened - God told Moses to make a bronze snake sculpture, and said whoever looked at it would be healed - and they were. It was a bizarre sequence of events. But there’s more... For centuries the people preserved, protected and polished this bronze snake, dragging it with them everywhere, until they ended up worshipping it. Something that had once been an answer to prayer became an idol. The Bible describes how eventually a King called Hezekiah ‘…broke into pieces the bronze snake Moses had made, for…the Israelites had been burning incense to it…’ (2 Kings 18:4 NIV). 
Think it can’t happen? John says, ‘…keep away from anything that might take God’s place in your hearts.’ Anything or anybody can become an idol; your football team, your favourite band, your fashionable wardrobe, your fancy new mobile... Don’t get the wrong idea; there’s nothing wrong with enjoying all this stuff. It’s only when wrong stuff begins to take God’s place! 
Jesus said, ‘Your heart will always be where your treasure is’ (Luke 12:34 CEV). Jesus deserves ‘…first place in everything’ (Colossians 1:18 NAS) – without exception. When He’s truly at the centre of your life everything else is just icing on the cake.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…I KNOW THE PLANS I HAVE FOR YOU...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JEREMIAH 29:11 NIV</span><br>Nothing shocks God or catches Him off guard. He didn’t panic when Adam messed everything up in the Garden. He didn’t freak out when the ancient world was becoming a 24-7 sin factory; He was ready with a flood to cleanse it and start afresh with Noah. Israel may have tried His patience but they never made Him gasp in surprise. That’s because God has always had a plan. And His plan includes your life too. It’s detailed, like a road map, whatever wrong turns you’ve made in your life, however lost you feel, He can get you back on track. The Bible says He has ‘plans to prosper…and not to harm you…to give you hope and a future.’ But sometimes you feel like you’re travelling through the night, it’s hard to see the signposts, the road gets bumpy... maybe you get sick, fail an important exam, fall out with your best friend...one thing is happened after the other,  you’re not sure you’ll survive. 
When the crisis you’re facing makes you want to throw in the towel, remember this: our problems become God’s opportunities. He loves to transform our stupidest mistakes into priceless gems of wisdom, He turns our cuts and bruises into greater strength, and our deepest fears into unshakeable faith. How? By showing us a bit more of His master plan! When we think the story’s over, He just turns the page. He loves making order out of chaos – and He’s been doing it since Genesis 1 verse 3! So trust Him today; Plan A is still on track - and refuse to give place to discouragement no matter what – okay?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…THE VISION IS …FOR AN APPOINTED TIME…</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HABAKKUK 2:3 NKJV</span><br>Dreams come in all sorts of shapes and sizes. There are dreams that buzz around in your head like a bee for a few days, then just vanish. Other dreams seem to make a permanent cosy nest in your heart. Then there are dreams that seem to grow daily deep in your spirit until you feel like they’re getting so big you’re gonna explode! 
Often we don’t pursue our dreams because we’re afraid of failing; it’s safer to pet them in private instead of letting them fly in public. Broadcaster and author Chuck Swindoll says, ‘We’re short of eagles and running over with parrots. Content to sit safely on our evangelical perches and repeat religious words, we’re fast becoming overpopulated with bright-collared birds having soft bellies, big beaks, and little heads. What would help would be more keen-eyed, wide winged creatures willing to soar…exploring the illimitable ranges of the Kingdom.’ 
Listen: ‘Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and your plans will succeed’ (Proverbs 16:3 NIV). God’s the One who gives us the courage to step out on to the tightrope of life and He’s also the one who promises to ‘…keep you from falling…’ (Jude 1:24 NIV) He strengthens us to do what we’ve never done before. He empowers us to get off square one! Remember, going out on a limb can be scary; but that’s where the best fruit is. 
So what if your dream is currently more parrot than eagle?  You obviously need to pay a visit to the Master of Transformation.  The one who turned water into wine, a lunchbox into a banquet, fishermen into world changers!  In fact He may be waiting for you to make a move so He can transform you too.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…I WILL ANSWER YOUR PRAYERS…I HAVE SET A TIME...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ISAIAH 49:8 CEV</span><br>On the dance floor it’s quite easy to tell the people who have rhythm from the people who don’t!  But you don’t need to worry if it’s not you who’s ripping up the place with your moves; there’s a rhythm that’s a lot more important than Usher… and God determines the beat. God has a ‘set…time.’ It’s not always predictable, sometimes He moves suddenly. But usually He tips you off in advance about changes He has in mind. He gives you the passion to pursue fresh interests, and before long you’re thinking, ‘Hey – the beat changed – when did that happen?’ Well isn’t that how all the best DJs do it!? Then comes the dramatic pause. Why? Because it takes time for change to produce the maximum impact. During that time God: a) helps you forget your past so it can’t pollute your future, and b) prepares your heart for fresh experiences.  Why is it that even though God says, ‘…when the time comes, I will…do all this’ (Isaiah 60:22 CEV), we generally don’t appreciate His timing until after the dust has settled? If only we would allow God to work out His plan at His tempo!  It makes sense really, doesn’t it? It’s easier to know when to bust a move, if you’re already in step with God and bouncing to the beat. Maybe the Apostle Paul was a bit of a mover on the dance floor?  Well after all, he’s the one who first encouraged us to ‘…keep in step with the Spirit’ (Galatians 5:25 NIV)]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…SO THAT THINGS MIGHT GO WELL FOR THEM...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>DEUTERONOMY 5:29 NCV</span><br>Check this out: ‘I no longer call you servants; because a servant does not know his master’s business.  Instead I have called you friends; for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you’ (John 15:15 NIV).  Jesus describes the difference between being a friend or a servant by talking about sharing inside information. David said, ‘The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him…’ (Psalm 25:14 KJV). God will share things with those who are intimate with Him that He won’t share with others. When you see somebody who’s focused in the confusion and cool when the heat is on, they might know a secret; shared with them by a Friend.
Realize that when God tells you to do certain things He’s not trying to make your life hard. No, He’s setting you up for a blessing. Listen: ‘I wish their hearts would always respect me and that they would always obey my commands so that things would go well for them…’ (Deuteronomy 5:29 NCV). On the other end of anything God asks you to do, is the promise ‘so that things would go well for you.’ Don’t be surprised if sometimes God expects things of you that: a) He doesn’t require of others b) He won’t explain and you can’t understand c) when you’ve obeyed, you won’t immediately see the benefits. But if you’re convinced that God has a unique plan for your life and loves you unconditionally, you’ll throw yourself on Him in complete trust, knowing that in the end it will ‘go well’ for you.

<title><![CDATA[Job’s secret!]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>IN ALL OF THIS, JOB DID NOT SIN BY BLAMING GOD.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOB 1:22 NLT</span><br>When God called Job ‘…the greatest…among…the people of the East’ (Job 1:3 NIV), the title was well-deserved. Job was massively respected by everyone who lived around him.  The guy had 10 children, loads of property and his own servants! Then, without warning he lost everything including his children and his health. Yet ‘Through all of this Job did not sin nor…blame God.’ Instead he asked, ‘…Shall we accept good from God and not trouble?...’ (Job 2:10 NIV). How could anyone endure this without becoming bitter? What was Job’s secret? 
Here are 3 ideas: 1) He recognized God’s right to control events in his life. When the dust settled, Job said, ‘…even if he killed me, I’d keep on hoping…’ (Job 13:15 TM). If we take that literally it doesn’t make a lot of sense – but Job is just stressing the point  that anything God permits is ultimately for the best, so he said, ‘I know that you can do anything, and no one can stop you’ (Job 42:2 NLT). 2) He looked beyond the immediate tragedy.  Listen: ‘My flesh may be destroyed, yet…I will see God…and I long for that moment’ (Job 19:26-27 CEV). Job had nothing to praise God for in the present – so he looked to the future! Job chose to take his eyes off the here and now, he looked through the doorway of death to the other side, and was strengthened to handle whatever life threw at him. 3) He acknowledged his limited understanding. Instead of feeling the need to explain his extreme highs and lows, Job told God, ‘…I have talked about things that are far beyond my understanding…I heard about you from others; now I have seen you with my own eyes’ (Job 42:3-5 CEV). Finding God in it – that was Job’s secret!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…I’M NOT TRYING TO BE A PEOPLE PLEASER…I AM TRYING TO PLEASE GOD...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GALATIANS 1:10 NLT</span><br>A talented young musician studied under a famous violin teacher. Now it was time for his first public performance.  He played amazingly and a huge chorus of ‘Bravos!’ from the audience.  Strangely he seemed not to hear them, but kept glancing nervously at the front row. It wasn’t until a white-haired man stood up and nodded graciously, that the young violinist started to smile. His master had praised his work! He’d received the only approval that mattered.
Whose approval do you look for? Be honest! It’s important to get real about how much of what you do is just to win the favour of other people. Paul said, ‘…we speak as messengers…approved by God…Our purpose is to please [Him], not people’ (1 Thessalonians 2:4 NLT). He also said, ‘…I’m not trying to be a people pleaser…If I were…I would not be Christ’s servant.’ (Galatians 1:10 NLT). Will Smith has been heard saying ‘Too many people spend money they haven’t earned, to buy things they don’t want, to impress people they don’t like’.  The problem is, that’s not his own wisdom – he stole the quote from someone else – he obviously feels like he needs to impress someone!  You really need to watch out for this trap.  Don’t be like the people in the Bible who ‘…loved human praise more than the praise of God’ (John 12:42-43 NLT). 
Remember, any time you set new goals, establish new boundaries, or change old patterns, you’re going to get flack from people who are used to you behaving in a certain way. Have the courage of your convictions. Don’t stop doing what you know is right!

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…I AM THE WAY…THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 14:6 NIV</span><br>Why do we pretend we have all the answers when we don’t? When Paul wrote, ‘…we know in part…’ (1 Corinthians 13:9 NIV) he wasn’t having a crisis of faith, he was just being honest. It’s as if some things in life are labelled by God just like products in a supermarket – with an ‘EXPLAIN BY’ date. Thomas may not have arrived at the truth of the resurrection when the others did; but he got it soon enough!
A Christian broadcaster said: ‘I find airtight conclusions mainly in people who have not hurt much. They’re usually people who have become tightly wired, rigid and isolated from the real world. They’re closed…unwilling to be vulnerable. Suddenly a divorce comes. Or someone dies in a tragic set of circumstances or loses his job. Reality hits and a storm blows in that threatens their once tranquil existence. Their emotional explosion results in more questions than answers. They discover things they didn’t really know. They are in the vortex of dilemmas they cannot solve. At that point simplistic solutions are replaced with realistic reflections, and the deep things of God begin to emerge, eclipsing shallow answers’. That explains why Jesus didn’t have a go at Thomas and say, ‘Are you just going to diss me to my face by saying I’m a ghost!’ No, Jesus didn’t push Thomas away because of his doubts, He called him closer, close enough to touch him.  Thomas knew stuff in his head, Jesus had said to him earlier, ‘I am the way and the truth and the life’ but it had not entered his heart. However, when Jesus appeared to him, that changed.  Jesus knew the EXPLAIN BY date for Thomas and he knows it for you too.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>GOD, YOUR GOD, IS AMONG YOU – GOD MAJESTIC, GOD AWESOME</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>DEUTERONOMY 7:21 TM</span><br>In his book, Living the good life, John Ortberg writes: ‘A friend and I were going to spend two weeks preaching in Ethiopia when it was still under Marxist rule. The underground churches there asked if I would bring 50 study Bibles. I had reservations about smuggling Bibles, but we decided to give it a shot. Sure enough, the customs agent opened the suitcases and confiscated the Bibles. A few days later we received a call that the head customs official wanted an interview with the leaders of the churches. We feared the worst – church leaders in Ethiopia spent so much time in prison, they referred to it as ‘The University.’ (This is where God would send his leaders when He really wanted them to grow. Like the biblical Joseph, some of them would actually be put in charge by the guards, when the guards wanted to go on break. They would take the bullets out of their rifles and hand them to the Christian prisoners to stand watch until they got back!) Imagine our surprise when the official said, ‘These Bibles are illegal. You may keep them on one condition – you must tell no one. I want one for myself.’ Ortberg says, ‘That day my God got a little larger!’
Every time you step out in faith, your see that God is bigger than you thought and you realise the truth of Paul’s words, ‘…His power at work in us can do far more than we dare ask or imagine…’ (Ephesians 3:20 CEV).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…WHAT GOOD IS THE BIRTHRIGHT TO ME?</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 25:32 NIV</span><br>The deal Esau made with his younger brother Jacob goes down as one of the worst of all time. After a failed hunting trip, having been without food for three days, Esau finds his brother Jacob cooking a pot of stew. ‘Give me some before I die’ he says. Jacob says, ‘Give me your birthright in exchange’. Esau replies, ‘Look, I’m about to die…what good is the birthright to me?’ The birthright entitled Esau, the firstborn, to the privilege of one day becoming head of the family. It was a position of great honour. Sadly, Esau is remembered as a man who threw it all away in a moment of weakness. He went after the wrong things in life and did stuff for the wrong reasons. His brother Jacob may have been a con man, but Esau was a fool. His appetites devoured his values. In the heat of the moment he exchanged something permanent for something temporary; something which would last for something which would fade. Esau let his God-given destiny slip away. To Esau everything was negotiable.  He acted like a gambler who loses his house in a game of cards. He found out too late that some things in life can’t be replaced.
There’s a lesson here for you. There will be times in your life when you are offered something temporary at the cost of something permanent.  It’s never worth it!  Don’t be someone who gambles with God’s good gifts. The word for you today is, ‘…Hang in there, even if your life’s flashing before your eyes, I’ll give you the life crown with your name on it’.  (Revelation 2:10 Street)

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…THIS IS THE WONDERFUL MESSAGE HE HAS GIVEN US TO TELL OTHERS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 5:19 NLT</span><br>Why don’t we share our faith with others: a) we’re not sure of it b) we don’t know how c) we fear rejection. But do you really want to be pulling out one of those excuses when you stand before the throne of God?’  
Paul writes, ‘…my life is worth nothing unless I use it for doing the work assigned to me by the Lord Jesus – the work of telling others the Good News about God’s wonderful kindness and love’ (Acts 20:24 NLT). You don’t have to use fancy words; you just have to share the story! What story? Listen: ‘The word became flesh and blood, and moved into the neighbourhood.  We saw the glory with our own eyes, the one-of-a-kind glory, like father, like son, generous inside and out, true from start to finish’  (John 1.14 TM).   It’s amazing – Jesus left heaven and came to earth with all its hurt, sorrow and sin. When you tell your friends about Jesus you can let them know that he understands all their frustration and pain.  The charity Christian Aid have a slogan, ‘we believe in life before death’ – and we should too!  Heaven is an awesome thing to look forward to but it’s not the ONLY thing we have to look forward to. Take the pressure off yourself! You don’t have to bust a gut to convince or convert anybody; just share with them the answers you’ve found to the questions they’re facing.  Bit by bit they’ll come to see that their life really does fit into God’s big story, a story with a fantastic ending!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…IN CHRIST…WE FIND OUT WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE ARE LIVING FOR…</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 1:11 TM</span><br>Dr. David Burns writes books on relationships.  He says, ‘Remember that fear always lurks behind perfectionism. Confronting your fears and allowing yourself the right to be human can, paradoxically, make you a far happier and more productive person.’ 
The media and the entertainment industry spend millions daily bombarding you with impossible images of airbrushed perfection. They try to make you think you should be thinner, more fashionable; anything other than who God made you to be. Looking around, it’s easy to just see are people who seem happier, cleverer and cooler than you. It’s like they know the secret and you don’t.
Do you realize that by constantly putting yourself down, you’re insulting your Maker? God’s Word says you are ‘…made…in an amazing and wonderful way…’ (Psalm 139:14 NCV). In His eyes you’re ‘just right’ because He never makes anything that isn’t. God made you unique and for a special purpose. Paul says it’s in Christ that ‘we find out who we are and what we are living for.’ So if you’re struggling in the endless quest for perfection, make this your prayer: ‘Father, You are my Maker, my Sustainer, my Rewarder. You’re the Lover of my soul. In spite of my weakness and struggles I thank You for the work You’ve done, and continue to do in me. Help me to please You by loving and accepting myself the way You do. In Jesus’ Name, Amen.’

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THIS IS THE DAY THE LORD HAS MADE; WE WILL REJOICE AND BE GLAD IN IT.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 118:24 NIV</span><br>Take a moment to think about that verse from Psalm 118 and ask yourself, ‘Is this how I live?’ If not, make some changes! Start with today; don’t worry about tomorrow.
Say to yourself, ‘Just for today, I’ll enjoy each moment to the full and try not to tackle my whole life’s problems at once. Just for today, I’ll try to improve my mind by learning more than I know; I’ll read my Bible because it’s my source of wisdom and strength. I’ll be open to those Scriptures that require obedience, action, and commitment. Just for today, I’ll be agreeable, wear a smile and make sure my words are ‘seasoned with grace.’ Just for today, I won’t find fault or try to change or improve anyone – except myself. Just for today, I’ll have a plan and a goal which I’ll reach towards and chase after. Just for today I’ll develop my character. I’ll do a random act of kindness and keep it secret; if anyone finds out it won’t count. Just for today, I’ll do something I don’t naturally want to do, which will train my spirit to rule my flesh and my faith to rule my emotions. Just for today, I won’t be afraid to love or to risk; I’ll take steps of faith that stretch me beyond my present comfort zone, I’ll enjoy all God’s blessings, and believe that every seed I sow in His Kingdom will be multiplied back to me many times over. This is how I’ll live – just for today – and when tomorrow comes, I’ll do it again!’

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…THE LORD’S RETURN WILL SURPRISE US...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 PETER 3:10-11 CEV</span><br>You can get T-shirts these days printed with designs that say ‘Jesus is coming – look busy!’  But seriously though, we need to be regularly reminded that Jesus is coming back soon.
Critics have always poked fun and cast doubt by saying, ‘…what’s happened to the promise of his Coming?…everything’s going on just like it always has…Nothing’s changed’ (2 Peter 3:4 TM). But the second coming of Jesus is not just some flimsy hope, the New Testament refers to it over 300 times! Peter says, ‘The Lord isn’t slow about keeping his promises…[His] return will surprise us…so…honour God by the way you live…make certain [He] finds you pure, spotless, and living at peace’ (2 Peter 3:9-14 CEV). Paul adds, ‘…the Lord…will come down from heaven…Christians who have died will rise…we who are…alive…will be caught up…to meet the Lord…and remain with him forever’ (1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 NLT). So, are you ‘looking for the blessed hope…the appearing of…Jesus’ (Titus 2:13 NAS)? Are you living like it could be tomorrow; or even today! Are you reaching out to your mates, grabbing every opportunity to sprinkle salt and shed light? (See Matthew 5:13-14). You should be! If the Apostle John could tell people 2000 years ago ‘…this is the last hour…’ (1 John 2:18 NIV) then we must now be in the last minute.  Wow! What an awesome time to be alive!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…A GRAIN OF WHEAT…IF IT IS BURIED…SPROUTS AND REPRODUCES…MANY TIMES...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 12:24 TM</span><br>Wheat can’t be planted and harvested in the same season. In order for it to ‘sprout and reproduce’ the seed must be buried deep in the ground where nobody sees it. There it undergoes a complete transformation as the seasons pass by, soaking the soil with rain and sun. In the same way, God’s purposes for your life can’t be rushed. You can only carry them, like seed in your heart, let them grow, then harvest them whenever He says it’s time. Every living thing has a life cycle, a process from infancy to maturity, from frailty to strength. 
When God plants a dream in your heart He starts preparing you for its fulfilment. He strengthens your character. He deepens your spiritual roots. But because we don’t understand His timing we get frustrated and try to rush things. It may be weeks, months, or even years from when you first sense something stirring within you, until the time you actually start living the reality of it.
Do you think you’re growing a seed that can’t be harvested just yet; one that needs to go through more stages of its lifecycle? If so, don’t risk wrecking it by trying to bring it out prematurely. Instead, trust God’s timing. Remember, there’s not one instance in the Bible where He was ever late!  In the meantime, just get on with enjoying life.  That shouldn’t be too hard to do; if God has planted His seed in your heart, and it’s growing, you’ve obviously got a lot to look forward to in the years ahead.

<title><![CDATA[Talking about worship]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…GOD IS SPIRIT, SO THOSE WHO WORSHIP HIM MUST WORSHIP IN SPIRIT AND IN TRUTH.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 4:24 NLT</span><br>Here are 3 things about worship for you to chew on today:
1) There is no ‘correct’ style of worship. The worship style you feel comfortable with says far more about your cultural background and personal preferences than it does about your faith. True worship is an expression of both emotion and intellect, heart and mind. Jesus gave only two requirements for true worship ‘in spirit and in truth.’
2) You don’t need a building to worship God. There’s nothing wrong with buildings, unless you start loving them instead of God. The Bible says ‘“…the Lord of heaven and earth does not live in temples built by hands’ (Acts 17:24 NIV). No building, or the lack of one, should ever be allowed to control, limit or distract you from worshipping God. Jesus said, ‘…where two or three come together in my name, there am I with them’ (Matthew 18:20 NIV).
3) Worship makes a powerful statement. More people are won to Christ by feeling God’s presence, than by all our clever arguments.  Not many people are converted to Christ on purely intellectual grounds. No, it’s getting a sense of the reality of God with us that melts hearts; His love breaks through mental barriers. In true worship God’s presence is felt, God’s pardon is offered, God’s purposes are revealed, and God’s power is displayed. When the spiritually hungry are brought into an atmosphere of worship, where people are pouring out their hearts to God, it creates in them a desire to know Him too!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>“…FROM NOW ON YOU WILL FISH FOR PEOPLE.”</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 5:10 NCV</span><br>When you choose to follow Jesus you always get back more than you give. Always! When Jesus asked these fishermen if He could use their boat they were happy to oblige. It had been a pretty boring night out on the lake, they’d caught absolutely zilch.  All they had left to do was clean their nets, then head home and catch some zeds.  But using their boat as a platform, the life-giving words of Jesus began to carry over the water to the crowd on the shore.
The fishermen sat in the back of the boat listening as they rinsed the nets. Then the crowd left and Jesus said, ‘…“Put out into deep water, and let down the nets for a catch.”’  (Luke 5.4 NIV) They were completely unprepared for what came next. Their net was suddenly filled with fish. It was only the help of some friends in nearby boats that saved them from sinking under the weight! By the time the boat reached the shore its net was torn to shreds. Fishing was all they knew; what would they do tomorrow? Then they heard the Master say, ‘Follow me.’ 
And today He’s saying the same to you. These men laid down the tools of their old life and followed Jesus into a new one. In just a few short years God would use them to change their world. What did they give up in exchange? The tattered remains of an old lifestyle. Whatever’s keeping you from following Jesus, take a long hard look at it today. If you decide to lay it down and follow Him, you’ll never regret it!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…YOU ARE PRECIOUS AND HONORED IN MY SIGHT…BECAUSE I LOVE YOU...’</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ISAIAH 43:4 NIV</span><br>One of the most awesome promises in the Bible is found in Isaiah Chapter 43 ‘…you are mine. When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and when you pass through the rivers, they will not sweep over you. When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned…For I am the Lord, your God…you are precious and honoured in my sight, and…I love you…’ (Isaiah 43:1-4 NIV). Why not write down that last phrase on a card and carry it with you: ‘…you are precious and honoured in my sight…I love you…’ Wow! You are loved by God. Who else do you need to impress? What other ladder do you need to climb? What are you going to add to your CV that’ll top that? 
Make your life a showcase of living in the love of God. Every morning when you wake up let your first words be ‘I’m loved by God.’ And every night when you go to sleep let your last words echo, ‘I’m loved by God.’   As every day goes by you’ll start understanding more and more deeply just how amazing those four little words are. When you’re tempted to jack it all in because you’ve blown it, remember, ‘I’m loved by God’   When you’re overwhelmed by all the stuff you have to do, say it: ‘I’m loved by God’. Say it when you’re tempted to sin, to dishonour God, to lash out in anger and hurt someone, or deceive someone, or use someone. Say it when you’re afraid, when you’re anxious, when you’re alone… remember and feast on the words that give life: ‘I’m loved by God.’

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…IF WE ARE TO SHARE HIS GLORY, WE MUST ALSO SHARE HIS SUFFERING.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 8:17 NLT</span><br>It’s exciting to talk about the blessings of following Jesus, but Paul writes: ‘If we are to share his glory, we must also share his suffering.’ That changes things, doesn’t it? The only time the crowd cheered Jesus was when they thought He was gonna overthrow the Romans. The only time Jesus was above anybody was when they nailed Him to the cross. He died like a common criminal. Very few believed He’d risen. Now Jesus says to us, ‘…[If you] intend to come with me…Don’t run from suffering; embrace it…’ (Matthew 16:24 TM). Easier said than done right?!
Taking flack because you’re a Jesus freak is never easy.  You’ll need shed-loads of character, discipline, love and vision. Why vision?  Check this out; when He comes back He won’t take the spotlight alone. Oh no. Listen: ‘When Christ, who is your life, appears…you also will appear with him in glory’ (Colossians 3:4 NIV). Did you get that? Until Christ returns, we have a serving role not a starring one! But later, after the final curtain falls, we get to join Jesus for the encore, taking our place in the line-up of the greatest cast in all of history. Jesus told the religious leaders of His day that if you get the applause of men now, enjoy it, coz it’s at the expense of the honour God will give you later. The higher your calling takes you, the more vulnerable you become to pride, so for now, keep your head down. John the Baptist said, ‘He must increase, but I must decrease’ (John 3:30 KJV). And John got it right!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…GIVE THANKS WHATEVER HAPPENS…</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 THESSALONIANS 5:18 NCV</span><br>If you tend to look at what’s negative in life rather than what’s positive, here’s a prayer just for you!  
‘Even though I hide under my duvet and growl when the alarm goes off, thank You Lord that I can hear; there are many who are deaf. Even though I close my eyes as long as possible against the morning light, thank You Lord that I can see; there are many who are blind. Even though I put off the effort to get up thank You Lord that I have the strength to get up; there are many who are bedridden. Even though the first hour of my day is hectic when socks are lost, toast is burned and tempers are short, thank You Lord for my family; there are many who are all alone. Even though I never look like the pictures in the magazines thank You Lord for the clothes I have; there are many who have no choice. Even though my school is sometimes boring, thank You for the opportunity to learn; there are many who don’t get the chance. Even though I complain from time to time and wish things were different, thank You for the gift of life; there are people in the graveyard who would gladly change places with me. Even though I make mistakes, stumble and fall, thank You for the grace to get up again; there are many who didn’t make it. Thank You Lord for all these blessings – and 101 others that I’ve taken for granted. Amen.’

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…WHEN A BELIEVING PERSON PRAYS, GREAT THINGS HAPPEN.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JAMES 5:16 NCV</span><br>Why pray? Because nothing lies beyond the reach of prayer. You’ll never know how many people have made it through a tough day because you asked God to encourage them. Or how many are healed because you stood with them in faith. Or how many spiritual runaways have come home because you pleaded with God to get on their case. None of us will ever know the full effect of our prayers this side of heaven, but we know this: God’s kingdom on earth comes through people who pray. Through prayer we’re invited to chat with God; a two way chat that involves both talking and listening. Prayer is ‘talking with God about what we are doing together’ as author Dallas Willard puts it. Have you ever thought that actually, besides all the cool stuff that gets done through prayer, the greatest thing of all is the joining of our heart with God’s heart. Lots of people on their deathbed end up regretting their obsession with work, money, pleasure and power. But have you ever heard of anyone who regretted spending too much time in prayer? 
An old minister once said, ‘Prayer does not consist of battering the walls of Heaven for personal benefit or the success of our plans. Rather, it’s the committing of ourselves to carrying out God’s purposes. It’s not bending God’s will to ours, but our will to His. In prayer we tap reservoirs of spiritual power whereby God can find fuller entrance into the hearts of men.’ Why pray? Because everybody knows, you start to become like the people you spend most time with.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…ANYONE WHO SACRIFICES…WILL GET IT ALL BACK A HUNDRED TIMES OVER...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 19:29 TM</span><br>A-level’ stands for ‘Advanced level’, it’s beyond the ordinary, a cut above the rest. A-level love is about work, not play; it’s about being a servant, not a hero. Jesus said, ‘…Whoever wants to be great must become a servant…’ (Mark 10:43-45 TM). You can give without loving, but you can’t love without giving. Real fulfilment can’t be found by only looking after numero uno! One Christian leader writes: ‘When I set about the task of loving, I usually end up giving instead of receiving. Love inevitably costs me three commodities that are most precious; my time, energy and money. I don’t part with these easily…because I have them in limited quantities…It’s time to strip away the false glamour, and tell the truth: true love is sacrificial.’
Another Christian leader says, ‘When I get up each morning I remind myself that today I may be called upon to give more love, more care and more patience than I get back. In times of sickness and hardship I’m required to do this for weeks or months on end. But then it’s my turn and God gives it back, either through my family or someone else. Either way it always comes back in an amount equal to my need.’ Peter wondered if it was all worth-while when he asked ‘We have left everything and followed you. What do we get out of it?’ Jesus replied, “…anyone who sacrifices…because of me will get it all back a hundred times over…”’ (Matthew 19:29 TM).  A-level love may cost you - in time, energy and moments of heartache -  but gives back so much more.

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…I AM THE ONE WHO TAKES CARE OF YOUR SINS - THAT’S WHAT I DO...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ISAIAH 43:25  MSG</span><br>In Old Testament days when a man ‘blew it,’ he brought a lamb to the altar as payment for his sins. But notice this: the priest didn’t examine the man, he only examined the lamb. If the lamb met God’s requirements the man was instantly forgiven. That is still how it works! When you fail, you need only approach God and say, ‘Father, I come in the name of Jesus asking for forgiveness.’ In that moment the Father’s focus moves from you to Christ, and you are automatically forgiven. What an arrangement!
But you need to forgive yourself too. If you don’t, you’re saying God’s forgiveness isn’t good enough.  That’s wrong!  If a perfect God says He will forgive you, on what grounds do you, an imperfect person, refuse to forgive yourself – or anybody else? 
‘You get nothing for nothing,’ you say. Nothing? Are you serious? God’s forgiveness is the most expensive thing in the world. It may have cost you nothing, but it cost God everything. Its pride that makes us think that somehow we’ve got to pay, at least in part, for what we’ve done. Yes, there are consequences and correction that build your character – but don’t think that’s what deals with your sin!  When Jesus cried, ‘It is finished,’ and died, God wrote, ‘paid in full’ across every sin debt you’d ever owe. And you must accept that by faith. Why? Because no more will ever be required, and no less will ever be accepted!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>DO NOT DESPISE THESE SMALL BEGINNINGS...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ZECHARIAH 4:10 NTL</span><br>Everything big starts with something small; all God needs is something to start with! Have you ever noticed what the disciples said to Jesus just before He fed the 5,000? Listen: ‘”Here is a boy with five small barley loaves and two small fish, but how far will they go among so many?” (John 6:9 NIV). Sound familiar? The challenge is too massive and you’re too tiny. Realise this: the miracle of provision only started when they took what they had and put it into the Master’s hands. As long as you try to make it happens and control it, it won’t happen. But the moment you give what you’ve got to God, it will start to grow. Imagine, just a boy’s lunch – all God needs is something to start with. The prophet Zechariah wrote, ‘Do not despise these small beginnings, for the eyes of the LORD rejoices to see the work begin…’ (Zechariah 4:10 TLB). Don’t be afraid to take small steps. Make them steps of faith and God will work with you.
Jesus said, ‘…I will build my church…’ (Matthew 16:18 TLB). Build it with what? Twelve flawed people just like you. But when He poured Himself into them it was so powerful, that when two of them got together they could turn any town upside down. ‘But I have so many weaknesses,’ you say. We all come to the Lord damaged and in need of repair. The good news is, you can be strong in certain areas and struggling in others, and God will still use you.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN HAS BEEN FORCEFULLY ADVANCING, AND FORCEFUL MEN LAY HOLD OF IT</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 11:12 NIV</span><br>Sometimes we think God’s like Santa Claus; if we just sit and wait He will drop His blessings into our lap without any effort on our part. No. The Bible says, ‘forceful men take hold of it.’ Sometimes to get what you want from God you have to get down into trenches, grab hold of His promises and resist the enemy’s attacks in your life. Even when you are in the right place to succeed, unless you become proactive it may never be yours. Before Israel could inhabit the Promised Land they had to fight the Canaanites, the Hittites, and other ‘ites.’ So, basically to get God’s best, sometimes you need to kick some stuff out of your life.
Your ‘ites’ could be a bad attitude, too lazy to care, or a low self-esteem that stops you, coz you’re afraid.  Don’t let those things rule your life!  In fact ‘forcefully’ push them away – God’s called you to a life of purpose and blessing. But you had to fight for it! There were 31 kings and seven nations that had to be conquered before they could move in and possess it. And they had to be dealt with one by one. Are you getting the idea?
It’s not enough to be strong in faith, you must be strong in fight! The enemy’s strongholds in your life must be pulled down. Your ‘ites’ must be dealt with! God will give you the strategy and the weapons. He’ll even empower you, but you’ve got to fight for your inheritance! Plus – what you become in the process is often more valuable than what you gain on the other side of it!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…NOTHING CAN EVER SEPARATE US FROM HIS LOVE...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 8:38 NLT</span><br>Paul asks five life-changing questions – take a minute and think them over: 
1) ‘…If God is for us, who can ever be against us?’ (Romans 8:31 NLT). That means someone messes with you, they mess with the big G-O-D!
2) ‘Since God did not spare even His own Son but gave Him up for us all, won’t God… also give us everything else?’ (Romans 8:32 NLT). Would God save your souls then leave you to fend for yourself? If you can let God save you, why do you find it so hard to let God look after you? 
3) ‘Who dares accuse us… ? Will God? No! He is the one who has given us right standing with himself’ (Romans 8:33 NLT). Every voice that accuses you, including your own, must shut up in the face of God.  Through Jesus – no accusation can stand. 
4) ‘Who then will condemn us?...the one who died for us…is sitting at the place of highest honour next to God, pleading for us.’ (Romans 8:34 NLT). Let your accusers rise up and speak against you. Jesus, your defender, silences them. Why? Because you’re a child of God and no one messes with God’s kids. 
5) ‘Can anything ever separate us from Christ’s love?...’ (Romans 8:35 NLT). Paul answers his own question: ‘Death can’t, and life can’t. The angels can’t, and the demons can’t. Our fears for today, our worries about tomorrow, and even the powers of hell can’t keep God’s love away…nothing in all creation will ever be able to separate us from the love of God that is revealed in Christ Jesus our Lord’ (Romans 8:38-39 NLT).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…IT IS MARVELLOUS IN OUR EYES</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 21:42 NIV</span><br>The heroes of the Bible were powerful, but they weren’t perfect. They were disciplined, but never discarded. Does that make you believe that you can be used by God too? Paul was the first to admit that he didn’t always hit the mark, yet the life He led, the challenges He faced and got through still sets our pace two millennia later. God’s perfect word can be communicated through normal people, what a responsibility!  It’s through ordinary people He fulfils His plan.  How awesome is that?!
Listen: ‘…whose weakness was turned to strength…’ (Hebrews 11:34 NIV). God’s heroes were strengthened through struggle. Don’t judge them by one weak moment, judge them by the whole of their lives. The dent in their armour didn’t affect their performance on the battlefield. Why does God use people like that? Because: a) ‘…My [His] strength comes into its own in your weakness’ (2 Corinthians 12:9 TM) b) He’s not limited by our limitations (Ephesians 3:20) c) He uses what’s available (1 Corinthians 1:27). How awesome is that?!
Listen: ‘When you mess up it’s not the end of the story.  You have a choice to dust yourself off, get up on your feet and try again.  If you stop at the first hurdle, it’s like agreeing with all the lies of the devil; he would love you to believe that you’re all alone and once you’ve failed you can’t take the test again.  Rubbish!  Our Bible heroes made some big mistakes, but as their lives went on they learnt that if you say, “I can’t do this on my own; help me, God”, He steps in and does everything in His power to help – how awesome is that?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…”HERE COMES THAT DREAMER. LET’S KILL HIM...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 37:19-20 TM</span><br>Joseph was a dreamer; his life teaches us the following lessons:
1) Don’t give up on your dream, even though it might be a rough ride. At 17 Joseph dreamt that one day his family would bow down to him. But he made the huge mistake of telling them about it. It got him into a whole heap of trouble. But it didn’t stop him. Joseph talked, before he understood.  Sometimes what we think something means isn’t always the case.  If God has spoken to you, give it time to get rooted in your heart, before you strut about it.
2) Don’t give up on your dream, though others don’t always get it. Joseph’s brothers said, ‘Look, this dreamer is coming . . . let us now kill him.’ It is hard to keep your dream alive when some people are trying to kill it. But when your dream comes from God; it holds you, even when you are can’t hold it!
3) Don’t give up on your dream, though your life is full of surprises. A God-dream will invite attack; don’t let that discourage you! Attack means your dream is a threat.  Take it as a compliment – the devil is worried.  It says five times: ‘The Lord was with Joseph.’ Check this: He’s with you too!
4) Don’t give up on your dream, though it takes time to fulfil. Twenty-three years passed before Joseph’s dream actually came true, but in the end he ruled his family, made friends with his brothers, and saved the nation. Not bad going, eh?  Fact: God will work in His time frame.  But remember, if it’s a God-dream, He gave it to you in the first place – it’s for a purpose.  The important thing to remember is – never give up on your dream!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>PRAISE…GOD…AND…MAGNIFY HIM WITH THANKSGIVING</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 69:30 NAS</span><br>When Dr. Robert Schuller, founder of California’s Crystal Cathedral, was growing up, drought ravaged their family farm. They prayed for rain that never came. His Dad, who normally harvested 100 wagon loads of corn, reaped only half a wagon full. Schuller says, ‘I’ll never forget it. His calloused hands holding ours as he looked up and prayed, “Thank you Lord, I’ve lost nothing. I’ve regained all the seed I planted in spring.” While other farmers were saying, “We lost 90 or 100 loads,” my father told me, “Never count the might-have-beens or you will be defeated. Never look at what you have lost, only look at what you have left”’ Top advice!
King David said, ‘Praise . . . God . . . and . . . magnify him with thanksgiving,’ because gratitude has: a) driving power. Paul says, ‘…thanks be to God, who always leads us in victory…’ (2 Corinthians 2:14 NCV). Thanksgiving helps you make the hard decisions. It gives you courage to believe against all odds b) energising power. Listen: ‘…Don’t ever stop thinking about what is…worthy of praise…And God, who gives peace, will be with you’ (Philippians 4:8-9 CEV). Stop and remind yourself of God’s goodness.  It gives you perspective and strength c) persevering power. Gratitude gives you the oomph to ‘press on’. Paul could ‘press on’ because his goals included knowing Jesus (see Philippians 3:14 NIV), and seeing a lost world saved (see Romans 10:1). What goals are you striving for? d) arriving power. When you reach your destination you will find you have developed selflessness and humility.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>”YOU KNOW EVERYTING I’M GOING TO SAY BEFORE I START THE FIRST SENTENCE”</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 139:4 MSG</span><br>Did you know that no one on earth has the same eye colour?  Each eye has a different pattern and blend of colours – no two pairs of eyes are the same.  No one else has the same finger print as you – that’s amazing – no one else in all the world.
God is the greatest designer, with an artist’s eye for colour and an architect’s intricate attention to detail.  When He set about making you, not only did He make you like no other, but He knew what plan He had for your life even before He spoke, ‘Let there be light’, and the sun was born.  He knows you, better than your mates or your Mum and Dad, and He knows you better than you know yourself.   Check this: ‘You know everything I’m going to say before I start the first sentence’ (Psalm 139:4 MSG).  Doesn’t that blow your mind?  You might be saying to yourself, Why does He bother with me? Listen: ‘For we are God's masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so that we can do the good things he planned for us long ago.’ (Ephesians 2:10 NLT).  God has unlimited time just for you.  He can’t get enough of you.  You make Him happy.  The whole point of creation was for God be in a relationship with you. Yep – to be your God but also your best friend.  Just like an artist loves their work, God is passionate about His prize creation, you are His ‘handiwork’.  Know this – you are loved and you have a purpose.  Life was meant for living – enjoy!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…FIX YOUR ATTENTION ON GOD...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 12:2 MSG</span><br>There is so much going on around you it can be really hard to sift through the noise and find the still small voice of God whispering to you.  The media has so much influence on your life, through soaps, reality shows, magazines etc.  And everyone seems to have an opinion on something; ‘So and so is too fat or too thin’, or ‘What’s hot and what’s not this season’.  The thing is, what one magazine says one day can change the next; a lot of the articles are based on speculation from a bunch of bad photos.  What’s true and what is false has become blurred.  So in all this noise, how do you know how to tell what God is saying?  Well, the Bible gives us loads of tips to help us; here’s a few of them: 
Tip no.1) ‘Plans go wrong for lack of advice – many counsellors bring success.’  God puts people around you who are wise and trustworthy; take advantage of that.  If you need advice, ask.  Tip no 2) ‘Trust in the LORD with all your heart…and He will make your paths straight…’ (Proverbs 3:5-6 NIV).  Put your trust in him – He is faithful and as you acknowledge Him He promises to make your way straight and clear.  Tip no 3) ‘Don’t become so well-adjusted to your culture that you fit into it without even thinking.  Instead, fix your attention on God.  You’ll be changed from the inside out…’ (Romans 12:2 MSG)  God doesn’t want you immune to His voice – He wants you to know it well and follow it.  Focus is the key; don’t lose sight of God and ‘You’ll be changed from the inside out!’

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…WAIT. IT’S ON ITS WAY.  IT WILL COME RIGHT ON TIME</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HABAKKUK 2:3 MSG</span><br>Waiting isn’t easy, but it’s necessary. God is working on both ends of the line; He’s getting you ready for it (even when you don’t know what it is), and He’s getting it ready for you. Look at Joshua. He’s been to the Promised Land, now he got to go back and live with a bunch of people who have no idea, and in most cases no interest in what he’s talking about. Can you relate?
To get from one place to another there is always a journey of some kind. It’s hard to let go of what you know and stand empty handed waiting for God to fill them, especially in the area of: a) The feelings: Face your anger and decide to let it go. You might feel empty for a time, but that’s normal. You’re in-between pain and the peace that comes from forgiveness and acceptance. Don’t panic! It will pass. b) The relationship: When you let go of someone it can be hard, because you’ feel a sense of loss. Don’t rush into another relationship to fill the gap. Talk to God; you need this time to heal and let Him fill any holes in your heart. c) The situation: You have let go of the old but you are not sure if you can handle what’s next, or even when it’s coming. 
When Jesus said, ‘”…Let us go over to the other side”’ (Mark 4:35 NIV), the lessons His disciples learned in-between changed them forever – and they will change you too!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…IF I PERISH, I PERISH!</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ESTHER 4:16 NIV</span><br>Esther was born a slave in captivity. Because of her beauty a pagan king made her one of his wives. Talk about feeling out of place! But no place is out of place when you are in God’s place. When Haman plotted to have all the Jews killed, Esther was put in the right place by God to save them. Esther discovered her life’s purpose when her Uncle Mordy said, ‘”…who knows whether you have come to the kingdom for such a time as this?”’ (Esther 4:14 NKJV). And what was her response? Listen: ‘”…I will go to the king, which is against the law; and if I perish, I perish!”’ (Esther 4:16 NKJV). So what do we learn from Esther?
1) Sometimes you won’t understand God’s timing or His plan for your life. But just because you don’t understand God’s plan right now doesn’t mean He doesn’t care, or doesn’t have one. Seek Him. He will show it to you – step by step!
2) When you discover God’s plan for your life you feel empowered. Whether you are a slave or a queen, when you know God’s called you it enables you to deal with each obstacle as it happens.
3) Taking a risk is easier when you know that God’s in control. When Esther said, ‘”…if I perish, I perish!”’ she wasn’t being dramatic; she was simply putting herself in God’s hands, she knew that even death is something that can be faced with confidence when you trust God. You see, not only does God have a place for you here on earth; He also has one waiting for you in Heaven. So you can’t lose, can you?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…PRAY FOR THOSE WHO MISTREAT YOU</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 6:28 NIV</span><br>If you feel misunderstood today, Jesus understands. Critics joked about Jesus being born in a stable, questioned that He was God, even accused Him of belonging to satan. They rejected His teachings, were jealous of His success, critical of how He did stuff and wound up by His message. And in the end, they put Him to death. John writes, ‘The Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it…He came to His own, and those who were His own did not receive Him’ (John 1:5&amp;11 NAS). 
Whoever thought up the saying, ‘Sticks and stones may break my bones, but names will never hurt me,’ is completely wrong! Nothing is further from the truth. Unfair names and ugly words do harm us, and that harm can last a lifetime. We need to be careful what we say to other people, especially to the people we love.
When you’ve been misunderstood, ask: ‘What can I learn from this experience? Could I have responded to the situation in a better way? Have I acknowledged my mistakes?’ Learning from misunderstanding can make you wiser and stop future pain. The bottom line is, the answer to misunderstanding is – forgiveness! Forgiveness doesn’t mean you agree, or that you even want a close relationship with your offender. But it does mean you let it go – FOREVER! That means don’t just forgive it; forget it. Here’s a quote to scribble in big letters in your notebook: ‘To be great, is to forgive the one who misunderstood you.’

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…I RECOGNISE MY SHAMEFUL DEEDS...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 51:3  NLT</span><br>King David is probably the guy most referred to in churches for having an amazing friendship with God.  He had a deep connection with the creator that still challenges so many people today.  But David was no super-hero; he made some spectacularly bad choices too.  If you read his story, you’ll probably think you’re like a saint in comparison – adultery, murder and destruction – David did it all!  So what made Dave so special? Answer: he recognised that what he had done was wrong and did all that he could to make it right with God.  You see God hates sin but He promises that if we say sorry and stop doing the bad stuff and truly change our ways, He will forgive us and even turn our bad situations around for our good and His glory.  We’re so good at pointing out other peoples’ faults and excusing our own.  But we forget that all sin is wrong in God’s eyes.  If you’re a Mafia boss dealing drugs and killing people or if you just gossip behind your mate’s back, God sees it all in the same light.  What we all need to do is look closely at our own heart and actions and recognise those things that you know God wouldn’t like.  Take your faults to God.  Don’t be scared coz He loves you and wants to help you deal with that stuff.  You’ll be amazed how quick God is to forgive and how much freedom you’ll feel knowing you’re forgiven.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…TAKE EVERY THOUGHT CAPTIVE AND MAKE IT OBEDIENT TO CHRIST</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2CORINTHIANS 10:5 NLT</span><br>We all make mistakes – no one is without fault, but what makes us go from having a bad thought to actually doing bad stuff?  Well it’s all to do with the way we deal with that thought.  Our thoughts are powerful and there is a war going on for your mind, coz the devil knows a bad thought can give birth to bad actions. 
That’s why Paul says, ‘…take every thought captive and make it obedient to Christ.’  How do we do that?  Someone once said, ‘Your mind is like a nest and your thoughts are like birds flying over it.  It’s up to you what birds you allow to nest there.’ All through the day, random thoughts fly through our heads, but what we choose to focus on can really influence our actions.
For example, if we focus on all the negative thoughts we have about ourselves each day, we can end up believing that they are true and end up with a bad self image.  Taking our thoughts captive just means controlling what we think about and dwell on.  We sometimes need to make a choice to focus our minds on what God says about us.  The more we do that, the more our thought processes and decisions will come from the healthiest source.  It’s important to read the Bible because it is full of what God thinks and we need to know His opinion above all others, so that our thoughts stay healthy and influence our actions and choices.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WHEN YOU GIVE…DON’T SHOUT ABOUT IT!...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 6:2 NLT	</span><br>Listen: ‘When you give…don’t shout about it as the hypocrites do…to call attention to their acts of charity!  I assure you they have received all the reward, they will ever get.’ (Matthew 6:2 NLT). That means don’t insist on having a plaque with your name on it coz you gave a few quid to a charity… you don’t give to make yourself look good! Jesus shows the perfect way to give, ‘…when you give to someone, don't tell your left hand what your right hand is doing…and your Father, who knows all secrets, will reward you.‘ (Matthew 6:3-4 NLT). Give generously. Give gladly. But keep it ssssshhhhh! Your giving is nobody’s business – it’s just between you and God. If you broadcast your giving you immediately have your reward, 10 seconds of glory. But you give up the chance to receive something even better when you get to Heaven. And you will receive it. Listen: ‘God is not unjust; he will not forget your work and the love which you have shown him as you have helped his people and continue to help them [served others]’ (Hebrews 6:10 NIV). That’s a promise you can trust.
Next time you’re sat in church, remember there are loads of faithful people around you who have given, and given again, and told no one. You may be one of them. Every Sunday you’re rubbing shoulders with some of the great givers of our day. And they’ve done it for God by keeping it to themselves. Others may never know, but God will never forget. How good is that?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>MAKE A CAREFUL EXPLORATION OF WHO YOU ARE...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GALATIANS 6:4 TM</span><br>Take a good look at your life and decide to make it count. Life’s saddest words are found on a tombstone that reads: ‘When it came time to die, I had not lived.’
It’s flippin’ scary to take risks and try new things. We think, ‘What if I fail?’ What if you do? It won’t be your first mistake. And no matter how bad it is it probably won’t be your worst. And unless you fail at something really spectacular like attempting to climb Mount Everest or swim the English Channel and die doing it, it probably won’t be your last mistake. One thing you can count on, whatever happens you’ll grow up; in wisdom, experience and character. Basically, you’ll be wiser for just having a crack at it. 
Rick Warren who wrote ‘Purpose Driven Life’ remembers: ‘I could have taken a hundred gift and ability tests as a young man and would never have discovered that I was gifted at teaching, because I had never done it! It was only after I began accepting opportunities to speak that I saw the results, received confirmation from others and realised God has gifted me to do this.’ 
Unless you’re willing to risk getting involved you’re not gonna know what you’re good at. The road to success is never mistake-free. But then, neither is the road to failure. The choice is yours. That’s why Paul writes, ‘Make a careful exploration of who you are and the work you have been given, and then sink yourself into that…’ (Galatians 6:4 TM). No risk, no reward!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…[A MAN MUST BE CONTENT TO RECEIVE THE GIFT WHICH IS GIVEN HIM FROM HEAVEN...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 3:27 AMP</span><br>Has it dawned on you how much ‘they’ control your life? They say what’s cool and we wear it, drive it, quote it or do it! Now that may be okay in some areas, but not when it comes to your life’s direction. Jesus said, ‘…if the Son liberates you [makes you free men], then you are really and unquestionably free’ (John 8:36 AMP). That means you are: a) FREE from the peer pressure b) FREE to be who God called you to be c) FREE to look to Him for your own answers instead of always running to other people. Jesus said, ‘A man must be content to receive the gift which is given him from heaven.’
So many of us struggle with insecurity and fear of what people think. We’re competitive; we compare ourselves with others. We’re jealous of the stuff they have, their abilities and talents. We’re always trying to keep up with certain people or be like them. As a result we are totally frustrated because we are jumping our own fence, getting outside of what God has called us to be. We’re not being ourselves! You can’t run somebody else’s race. You’ll never enjoy God’s blessing to the maximum until you commit yourself to being the person God ordained you to be. No one else on this planet is you… So rise up and announce, ‘I am what I am. I can’t be anything other than what God has called me to be. So I’m gonna concentrate on being the best me I can be, and enjoy it every day!’

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>IT’S THE CHILD HE LOVES THAT HE DISCIPLINES...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HEBREWS 12:6 TM</span><br>Do you want to change? To grow up in God? Real change can’t start until you understand first that God loves you as you are; otherwise you will keep trying to change yourself to earn His love and acceptance. This is pointless task ‘cause, you already have it – you just don’t know it! 
Most of us think that if we accept ourselves as we are, we are excusing what’s wrong in us. Rubbish!  You can’t take God’s correction properly until you have a clear understanding of His love for you. Otherwise you’ll see His correction as rejection, His disapproval of your actions as disapproval of you. To grow up in God you need to believe that God is committed to you, and He will tell you when you’re way off target, and will guide you along the best pathway for your life (see Psalm 32:8). During those times you need to know His love for you is not just wishy washy – it can be tough love – now and again you may get a God-slap!
The Apostle Paul was 100% convinced that nothing could EVER separate him from God’s love (Romans 8:39). Are you convinced? You need to be! In Revelation 3:19 (NLT), God speaks to each of us and says, ‘I am the one who corrects and disciples everyone I love…’ Evidence of God’s love and approval of you is the fact that He convicts and corrects you! It’s not His correction that should worry you; it’s the absence of it! 
If you feel like you’re going through this right now, get happy; it means God loves you and has amazing things in store for you!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>FOR IT IS GOD WHO WORKS IN YOU...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PHILIPPIANS 2:13 NIV</span><br>You can’t put your life into compartments by saying, ‘In this category I’m gonna do things my way, but in that category I’m gonna be led by God.’ Every step you take must be synchronised with the beat of God’s heart! Nothing is more important than keeping pace with Him. Listen: ‘…God…works in you to will and to act according to his good purpose’ (Philippians 2:13 NIV). God works through us as we engage our minds, open our mouths, move our feet and use our hands to do what He has already put into our hearts. The moment you say ‘yes’ to God He gives what you need to do what He asks.  Check this: He doesn’t show His will to you first then call you next. No, He calls you, and as you move out and obey Him He shows it to you step by step, helping you as you go.
God is never content with the ‘normal’! Never! Every day in different ways He will develop you into a greater God carrier. You’re not out for a stroll, you’re on a mission.  Again and again you will be given challenges and be put into situations that will mature you to the point where you have the same attitude, the same responses and the same desires as Jesus. When you start to understand that, walking with God will take on a whole new meaning. Realise that your walk with Him is the only walk that will ever satisfy you or fulfil your purpose for being on this planet.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…HE WILL DIRECT YOUR PATHS</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 3:6 NLT</span><br>Here are some examples of when hearing God about something makes all the difference. 1) Future choices. When trying to decide what’s next, look carefully at your options and ask God to make the right one clear. 2) Before you make a choice based on someone else’s idea. Why? Because peoples’ ideas aren’t God’s commands. Don’t commit yourself to stuff you can’t do and end up trapped by promises you can’t fulfil. Be there for people, but be led only by God’s Spirit. 3) When someone’s being awkward. What people say can totally effect how we think.  Don’t make bad decisions because your mate is being moody – that can totally manipulate you from making the right choice. 4) At a tough time. Don’t change your college course just coz it’s a bit tough…take a minute and ask what God wants you to do.  If someone asks you to do something, think first…is this something that is gonna be pleasing to God?  5) When you’re tempted. Don’t just cruise along with the crowd.  Often saying ‘no’ is the right answer.  Think: ‘Is this in tune with God’s heartbeat?’   5) When you have popularity. A compliment is always nice but don’t let it navigate your decisions.  Flattery just inflates the ego and can make it tough to hear God clearly. Some people will be excited by your dreams because they don’t have their own… but are you ready to carry passengers?  It’s wise to share your heart with people you know have a good relationship with God.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I WILL GUIDE YOU ALONG THE BEST PATHWAY FOR YOUR LIFE…</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 32:8 NLT</span><br>Solomon says, ‘Many are the plans in a man’s heart, but it is the LORD’S purpose that prevails.’ (Proverbs 19:21 NIV). Even though your plans aren’t perfect, if your heart’s motive is right, God will make things work out for your good and His glory. Are you having difficulty sorting out your ideas from what He is saying? We all struggle with that, especially when the Bible doesn’t give us specifics. For example, when it’s time to go to Uni or marry or get a job, what should you do? Listen: ‘I will guide you along the best pathway for your life.’   You say, ‘That’s nice, but I’d like a little more detail.’ Okay:
1) Ideas go away but God’s direction stays. God moves at His pace and He invented you and time, so He can make it work! There is persistence in His leading, that is why time is on your side. Do not rush ahead of Him. 
2) God’s direction is usually impossible to follow without Him. He plans it that way. Jesus said, ‘…without Me you can do nothing’ (John 15:5 NKJV). 
3) God’s direction usually begins with discomfort. Listen: ‘like an eagle stirs up its nest…The Lord…led him…’ (Deuteronomy 32:11-12 NIV). Eagles learn to fly when their mum pushes them out of the nest and over the cliff’s edge. Can you imagine their thoughts? ‘Mum what you playing at!’ But it’s only when the eagle is forced out of its comfort zone that it discovers it was born to fly, spreads its wings, releases its power and finds its place in the heavens. Has God been stirring up your nest? Relax! He’s leading you!

When the time is right the plan will be clear, the people in place and the resources available. Peter writes. ‘Everything that goes into a life of pleasing God has been miraculously given to us…’ (2 Peter 1:3 TM). Did you hear that? Everything! God told Abraham when to leave home (see Genesis 12:1), and Jacob when to go back home (see Genesis 31:3). He even told Elijah where to find food in the middle of a famine (see 1 Kings 17:1-5). And His promise to you is ‘…along unfamiliar paths I will guide them...’ The path you are on today may be unfamiliar to you but it’s not to God. He has already gone ahead of you. All you need is the faith to step out and follow Him.
God never changes. If He talked to people all through the Bible He’ll talk to you too. Question is, have you learned to recognise His voice yet? Nothing should be more important to you than learning to hear from God for yourself. Other people’s ideas should only confirm or clarify what He’s already shown you. If you have not heard from God you will be tempted to think that human ideas are His commands – and that could hurt you. Listen: God has a personal plan and a specific destination for you. Take the time to ask Him about it. His Word says, ‘He guides the humble in what is right and teaches them his way’ (Psalm 25:9 NIV).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I PRESS ON…</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PHILIPPIANS 3:14 NAS</span><br>When the bottom falls out what should you do? Blame somebody else? That only makes you bitter. Wallow in self-pity? That only paralyses you and alienates those around you. When David returned from battle and found his home burned to the ground and his family taken prisoner, he cried till he had no tears left to cry. But then we read, ‘…David strengthened himself in the LORD his God’ (1 Samuel 30:6 NAS). That’s it! You have got to learn how to get alone and give yourself a good talking to! You have got to learn how to pray for yourself and speak God’s promises to yourself. Here is one worth quoting: ‘…Weeping may go on all night, but joy comes with the morning’ (Psalm 30:5 NTL). Did you get that? Joy is coming! Help is on the way! You must learn how to rise up and say, ‘What does not destroy me will only make me stronger. No day lasts forever. This too shall pass. In the meantime I will let it drive me closer to God.’ Come on – start talking to yourself!
Your weakness can be the discovery point for strengths you never knew you had. It is the biggest battles that produce the biggest victories. When Joseph recalled the worst time of his life he said, ‘…God turned into good what you meant for evil…’ (Genesis 50:20 NLB). Others do not control your destiny, God does, and He’s not like others! You will come out of this a better person. Look beyond the pain and you will find perspective. The word for you today is – Take a deep breath, refocus, and keep pressing on!’

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…GO…AND MAKE THINGS RIGHT...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 5:24 TM</span><br>One of the reasons we love Jesus is because He wasn’t stuck up. He allowed a prostitute named Mary to anoint His feet, while the religious crowd looked on making judgements. He chilled with tax collectors, the most hated, dishonest blokes in town ‘because He knew they needed Him just as much as anybody else. He took risks on people. Listen: ‘…God is not ashamed to be called their God…’ (Hebrews 11:16 NIV). If God was not ashamed of the likes of Zacchaeus and Mary, then He’s not ashamed of you. If God could brag about the faith of a Rahab (another prostitute) beside people like Esther and Moses, who are we to judge anybody?
Jesus had a massive impact on the people he met. Like Zacchaeus, the cheating tax collector, who, on meeting Jesus, cried out, ‘”...Lord! Here and now I give half my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anybody out of anything, I will pay back four times the amount”’ (Luke 19:8 NIV). 
Understand this: the root of all inner healing rests on our willingness to forgive, and when possible, to make things right with those we have hurt. There is no statute of limitations in God’s Kingdom when it comes to responsibility. If you owe someone a debt, pay it. If you have hurt them, apologise and try to make it right. Jesus said, ‘…If you…remember a grudge a friend has against you…leave immediately, go…and make things right…’ (Matthew 5:23-24 TM). That leaves room for no excuses, does it?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…DO THE HARD WORK OF GETTING ALONG WITH EACH OTHER...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JAMES 3:18 TM</span><br>If you are serious about making good friend, do the following:
1) Put others first. Listen: ‘Serve [others] wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not men’ (Ephesians 6:7 NIV). If you serve God by serving others, you can’t go 
2) Chuck out any emotional baggage. If someone hurt you and you need to deal with it, do it right away. Ask God to help you forgive them and move on. If it’s not worth bringing up, forget it and move on.
3) Invest in your most valuable relationships. Think about who you hang out with. It says in the Bible that who you relate to moulds your character and ultimately your choices and destiny.
4) Be happy to serve. One airline executive explained how difficult it is to hire and train people for his industry: ‘Service is the only thing we have to sell, but it’s the toughest thing to teach because nobody wants to be thought of as a servant.’
5) Constantly express your appreciation. Tell the people you care about how much you love them – do it a lot! Too many of us think that the best way to help people is to criticise them or give them ‘our thoughts on the matter’ Wrong! The best way to help others is to see the best in them. Practice the 101 percent principle: look for one thing to admire, then give them 100 percent encouragement for it. That will help you to like them, and them to like you. What could be better for a relationship?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…THAT WE WOULD NOT TRUST IN OURSELVES, BUT IN GOD...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 1:9 NAS</span><br>Paul was in one of those ‘dead-end’ situations when he wrote: ‘We felt like we’d been sent to death row, that it was all over for us…Instead of trusting in our own strength…we were forced to trust God…’ (2 Corinthians 1:9 MSG). ‘Sent to death row.’ That’s pretty dramatic language! Paul felt sentenced! In court, sentencing comes when the evidence has been presented, the judge has ruled and the verdict is final. It looked like there was no way for Paul to survive; he was in a dead-end situation. Is that where you are today? Don’t give up. What looked like the end of the story was really God saying, ‘Right, you can’t get yourself out of this, but I can. Let me help!’ That’s why he went on to say that through it all he learned not to trust in himself, but in God Who ‘raises the dead.’ Think: when your hopes seem buried and you have nowhere to turn, isn’t that when God’s power is working strongest in your life?
You have a loving Heavenly Father you can call on. You can trust what He says and know that as you go through life with Him, He will make your paths straight (Proverbs 3). You have a future! So speak to your Heavenly Father today, trust Him. Don’t doubt. Expect Him to work and fight and your behalf and watch as your dead-end situation turns around. Why? Because now you are beginning to trust the One Who can really do something about it!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…I SAW THE LORD...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ISAIAH 6:1 NIV</span><br>Listen: ‘…I saw the Lord seated on a throne, high and exalted...above him were the seraphs…they were calling to one another: “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord Almighty...” At the sound of their voices the doorposts…shook and the temple was filled with smoke. “Woe to me!” I cried. “I am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips and live among a people of unclean lips…” Then one of the seraphs flew to me with a live coal in his hand, which he had taken...from the altar. With it he touched my mouth and said, “See, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away and your sin atoned for.” Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, “Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?” And I said, “Here am I. Send me!”’ (Isaiah 6:1-8 NIV).
Woah, that must have been totally hectic! Isaiah was only young when he had this mad God experience. Imagine if you were praying and suddenly you found yourself in the throneroom of God!!! Well actually in a very special way you are. God loves to hang out with all His kids and He communicates to us in different ways. You might hear a song and the lyrics might touch your heart. You might read the Bible and hear God speaking to you through what He says. But however God speaks, trust that he’s got something to say to you and wants to be with you. God’s holy and powerful, but he’s also your Father and wants to be your friend!

<title><![CDATA[Your attitude]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…AS A MAN THINKS IN HIS HEART, SO IS HE…</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 23:7 AMP</span><br>Here’s why your attitude makes such a difference:
1) Your attitude affects what happens. Successful people know this; whether it’s a doctor going into surgery, a singer performing a song or a business-person launching a new company. Confidence can increase your chance of success in life. When you approach something new, especially something you’re not looking forward to, fix your mind on the facts, not your feelings. That will put your attitude on the right track.
2) If you give someone attitude, you’ll get it back in your face. Smile at people and they’ll probably smile back. Act harsh and you’ll get a hash response. If you wanna get on with people today and the next, treat them well. It’s not rocket science, and it will actually make you feel pretty good too!
3) Your attitude can give you the winning edge. When world heavyweight champion Joe Louis got knocked down by Tony ‘Two Ton’ Galento in Yankee Stadium, he immediately jumped back to his feet and went after his opponent. When his trainer protested saying, ‘Why didn’t you stay down for nine?’ Louis said, ‘What! And give him a chance to rest.’ Louis went out in the fourth round and won the fight. Having a good attitude gives you the winning edge.
4) Your attitude, not your achievements, brings happiness. You could have all the money in the world and still have an attitude that sucks. You could be drowning in ‘bling’ and still resent your family and friends. A good attitude helps you through tough stuff as well as being successful. Ask God today to give you not just a good attitude, but a ‘God attitude’.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>IF SOMEONE FORCES YOU TO GO ONE MILE, GO WITH HIM TWO...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 5:41 NIV</span><br>What is the kingdom of God? It’s when God has number one priority in every area of life. In God’s Kingdom what you get back is always greater then what you give. Listen: ‘Give away your life; you’ll find life given back, but not merely given back – given back with bonus and blessing. Giving, not getting is the way…’ (Luke 6:38 MSG). Notice, Jesus said that God would give back to you. But He didn’t say ‘Only give to those who can give back to you.’ That is self-centredness! John Bunyan, who 400 years ago wrote an awesome book called ‘Pilgrims Progress’ said this: ‘You have not lived today unless you have done something for someone who can never repay you.’
In the Roman Empire a military officer could force any Jewish civilian to carry his heavy backpack for up to one mile. That was the officer’s right, and the person refused at their peril. So to walk the first mile was only to do what was required. Jesus said, ‘I’m telling you to go the second mile.’ Why? Because extra-mile-service gives you an opportunity to make an impact on the lives of others. A person with an extra-mile-attitude is someone who: a) cares more about others than themselves b) risks more than others think is safe c) dreams bigger than others cab believe d) believes for more than others think is possible e) gives more than others think is necessary. And you’ll notice – there is no traffic jam on the extra mile! People aren’t fighting to help others out, but Jesus said it’s the key to a happy life!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WHEN YOU PRAY, DON’T BE LIKE THE HYPOCRITES...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 6:5 NCV</span><br>Jesus said, ‘When you pray, don’t be like the hypocrites. They love to stand in the synagogues and on the street corners and pray so people will see them. I tell you the truth, they already have their full reward.’ (Matthew 6:5 NCV). This was a case of prayer gone wrong because: a) their prayers had become totally shallow, not from their hearts b) their prayers were rituals, rather than genuine expressions of a loving heart c) their prayers were long winded and wordy, designed to impress others d) their prayers were filled with hollow, fancy phrases e) the prayers made them look good but didn’t touch God’s heart. They had forgotten the point of prayer.
But Jesus didn’t leave us guessing. No; He talked straight: ‘But when you pray, go into your [most] private room, and, closing the door, pray to your Father, Who is in secret; and your Father, Who sees in secret, will reward you in the open.’ (Matthew 6:6 AMP) If you spoke to your parents how you speak to God, they’d all laugh out loud. ‘O, great, most gracious and loving earthly parent, what is it that thou dost wish me to do?’ No wonder people get turned off! If you want to learn how to pray – read Psalms. A guy called David wrote most of the prayers and songs in it. They are spontaneous. Personal. Honest. No gobble-de-gook. No impressive Christianeze. They just let it all out. Straight talk thrills the heart of God and gets results!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>MEN OF ISSACHAR, WHO UNDERSTOOD THE TIMES...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 CHRONICLES 12:32 NIV</span><br>Describing life in chilly New England, Chuck Swindoll writes: ‘Newcomers…get the false impression that there will hardly be much of a winter, so they continue…sightseeing and relaxation with little regard for the deep freeze that inevitably arrives. Seasoned souls are not so foolish…they use that brief interlude to prepare for winter’s bitter blast…Early on I learned a valuable lesson…winter can be endured with much greater success if you prepared for its arrival.’
God’s Word says, ‘Get ready; be prepared…’ (Ezekiel 38:7 NIV). You need to suss what’s going on now not later! People respected the men of Issachar because they ‘understood the times.’  Times change: a new college course, something massive like the loss of a loved one, a new friendship or moving to a new place. Before a new ‘time’ arrives you can often feel restless; a feeling you’ve outgrown something that used to excite and challenge you. 
Different times help you grow in different ways and keep you progressing towards the ultimate fulfilment of God’s plan for your life. Sticking with the familiar can be fatal. It’s dangerous to wait for circumstances to change before making a move that God already has planned. The best way to avoid that is by staying connected to Him, developing your spiritual radar, and moving whenever He says it is ‘time’.
So while you’re taking down your decorations and Christmas lights, take down those old attitudes that are stopping you from moving into the next thing God has for you. The art of living means understanding the times, navigating through them, and squeezing the joy out of every minute on the way.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...THE LORD LONGS TO BE GRACIOUS TO YOU...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ISAIAH 30:18 NIV</span><br>On December 31st the clock strikes midnight ushering in a New Year. Three hundred and sixty-five days of potential to fulfil your dreams and ambitions. A new beginning. A gift full of promise. But you must accept it, unwrap it and use it. Not everybody does.    
Maybe you dread what the New Year holds; exams, your first job, new schools, moving house, life without a loved one. Well, God loves to take fragile people and set them on the road to peace, joy and victory. He is the expert at drying tears, calming fears, giving courage to worried hearts and taking away bad memories. He is '...making all things new...' (Revelation 21:5 NIV). He never leads you back, just forward. 
Listen: 'The Lord longs to be gracious to you.' So what do you want to see one year from now? Does it include making new friends? Achieving some awards? Leading a cell group? Only you can complete the question, 'What if I could...?' because only you know what makes your heart leap. 
Famous US author Stephen Covey says, 'Begin...with the image of the end of your life as your frame of reference... Each day will then contribute to the vision you have of your life as a whole.'  Go for God in 2006! Set your goals now, write them down. Picture your life in a year, five years and ten years and work towards that vision.  '...the Lord longs to be gracious to you...' To be gracious means 'to show favour.' Wow! The desire of God's heart is that you should walk in His grace and favour every day of this year.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...GOD . . . RESTED FROM ALL HIS WORK.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 2:2 NIV</span><br>Listen: God...rested from all his work.' It's interesting that God should feel that He needs a day off, after all He IS God! The truth is that God probably didn't need a day off, after all He's been working everyday since. But, God taking a day out to rest sets a good example for us. After all, our bodies were designed to need rest and time out, especially to make sure we spend time with God! 
In the world in which we live, Sundays are no longer special days. The shops are open, many people now have to work and it's not seen generally regarded as a rest day, in fact it's quite the opposite. After a chokka week Sunday's a great time for a lot of people to get busy on their homework, shopping washing and cleaning done.
So what about your life, is there a balance between work time, you time and God time or is life one non-stop rollercoaster that you can't get off? Remember, when you put stuff off until tomorrow, it never comes. Invest in your relationships, serve God as he has asked you to, don't neglect your responsibilities at home and make sure that every day you take time out to be with God. Your time is a balancing act so ask God to help you to use it wisely. Keep what's important in perspective. God knew exactly what He was doing when he gave us 24 hours in a day so if there are not enough, you're not using them right! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...IF IT [THE VISION] SEEMS SLOW IN COMING, WAIT.  IT'S ON ITS WAY...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HABAKKUK 2:3 TM</span><br>Whether you are in a prison cell like Joseph, a boring classroom at school or stuck at home with your brothers and sisters, God has not forgotten you and the dreams he has given you. You may not know how to get from where you are to where your dream will take you, but God knows! Simply ask Him to reveal the next step. The more you see yourself leading the CU, launching your own business, serving a ministry, writing your first book or helping others through your unique gifts, the sooner it will become a reality. Before our vision becomes clear God gives us glimpses of it - like a picture developing in a dark room - it slowly appears before your eyes.
Take your God-given vision and run with it. Let it inspire you to put your best into everything you do at the moment, while always praying and speaking with Him who knows and loves you best. Today pray: 'Lord, I thank You for all You've given me - even those things that seem unfair and annoying, even the pain that others have caused by trying to hurt me. Help me to do my best, to stay Christ-like and positive, because I know that where I am right now is not where You're taking me. Give me glimpses of Your vision for my future so that my understanding can grow just at the right times. Give me patience along the way, and faith to trust that You're working for my good every moment of the day. Amen.']]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...HE HID IT...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 25:25</span><br>In the 'parable of the talents' Jesus teaches us about using what God has given to us. The 'talent' the story refers to is not a talent like turning your eyelids inside out but a currency of money. In the story a rich man gives three amounts of cash to three servants and goes on holiday. When he returns, two of the servants have invested the talents and made more, but one was so scared of losing what little he had, he just buried it. When the man returns he tells the two servants well done and gives them more. But to the one who wouldn't take a risk he says 'you wicked and lazy servant' and tells him he would have even made interest if he'd put it in the bank. 
God has given each of us gifts and talents. How we use those gifts is entirely up to us. As you use your talents you get better at them and as you push yourself, which may mean taking risks, you'll be rewarded with greater gifts, talents and responsibility. The lazy servant was so scared of failing that he didn't even try to invest, he just clung tightly to the little he had. Remember, your talents have been given to you for a reason. God has a purpose but it's up to you to stretch yourself and discover that purpose. When all is said and done remember that our most fulfilling reward is not human approval, it's the 'well done, good and faithful servant' at the end of it all.']]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...FORGETTING THE PAST AND LOOKING FORWARD TO WHAT LIES AHEAD.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PHILIPPIANS 3:13 NLT</span><br>Every experience you've had from the moment you were born until now, has made you what you are today.  The things that happened to you, both good and bad, decide how you will act and react for the rest of your life. Jesus said, '&quot;A good man gives out good from the goodness stored in his heart; and a bad man gives out evil, from his store of evil&quot;' (Matthew 12:35 PHPS). There are things stored up in each of us that must be dealt with before we can move on in life.
That's why Paul wrote, '...forgetting the past and looking forward to what lies ahead.' Paul understood that forgetting and looking forward are the keys to developing and growing. One won't work without the other. Forgetting closes the door to your past; looking forward opens the door to your future. What did Paul have to forget? A lot! On his orders, Stephen, the first Christian martyr, was stoned to death while he watched. And there were many more to follow. Could you forget that? If Paul hadn't learned to deal with his past, he would never have written half of the New Testament or helped build a church that would last for two thousand years.
Understand this: the only place the past can live is in your memory. The only power it has over you is the power you give it. So the word for you today is - '...forgetting the past and looking forward to what lies ahead.']]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...THEY...PRESENTED HIM WITH...GOLD...INCENSE AND...MYRRH.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 2:11 NIV</span><br>It's Christmas. Jesus' Birthday. But what can you possibly give to the One who not only has everything, but created it all? The wise men probably asked the same question. As wise blokes they were clever enough to navigate thousands of miles guided by a star, important enough to get an audience with King Herod and rich enough to go on such a long journey carrying expensive presents. But in addition to 'gold...incense and...myrrh,' they gave Jesus some gifts that are priceless - here's what they gave:
1) Their time. Long before His birth they had invested years researching and preparing for it - not counting the two years it took them to travel to where He was born. Do you know what? You're as close to God today as you want to be, planned to be, and took time to be. Want to get closer? Spend more time with Him.
2) Their worship. Once they found Him, '...they fell down...and worshiped Him...' (Matthew 2:11 NLT). Worship changes us completely because when we stand in God's presence with an open heart and let His Spirit work in us, '...we are being changed to be like Him...' (2 Corinthians 3:18 NCV). 
3) Their hope. While those around saw only darkness these men recognised 'The light that shines in the darkness...' (John 1:5 NCV). And that hasn't changed. God's love still shines brightest in the darkness of our broken dreams and messy hearts. 
So in the middle of your family celebrations, take time out to be with Jesus; after all, it's His birthday.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...HOW CAN THIS BE?...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 1:34 NASB</span><br>Have you ever tried to put yourself in the place of Mary?  A young girl, enjoying her life, excited about her new fella when suddenly this angel pops up and says that God has chosen her to be the mother of His Son!  Given the circumstances, her response was pretty calm: 'How can this be, since I am a virgin?'  Imagine what she was thinking!  What would people think? How could she care for a baby? What would Joseph say? Would he abandon her?  No wonder she '...was greatly troubled...' (Luke 1:29 NIV) most people would be! 
Maybe you're facing a tough situation and trying to trust God but getting nowhere. Maybe you or someone you know is sick, and although you know that '...by His stripes we are healed...' (Isaiah 53:5 NKJ), you are wondering, 'How can this be when my symptoms are still there?'  We all have issues which stretch our faith to its limits.
What's even more challenging is that Mary's situation was caused by God. Hang about... he's not supposed to do that is he? He's supposed to bless and rescue us! But God had a plan. Mary was about to be involved in something amazing and never to be repeated. To get her through the faith-test she was given a simple but powerful promise: '...the Lord is with you...' (Luke 1:28-30 NKJ). Once you understand that 'the One who called you is completely dependable. If He said it, He'll do it' (1Thessalonians 5:24 TM), your attitude changes completely. So today if you are wondering about the future, remember what the angel said to Mary, '...nothing is impossible with God' (Luke 1:37 NLT), because He promises the same to you! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…AND HE WILL BE CALLED...PRINCE OF PEACE</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ISAIAH 9:6 NIV</span><br>School was finished and ten-year-old Charlie was thrilled to be out of London celebrating Christmas in the country. Driving along the winding roads with his Mum he was captivated by the snowy winter landscape. But suddenly the snow got heavy, the visibility turned bad and the car slid out of control ending up in a ditch. Charlie tried to push while his mum pressed the accelerator, but it was no use. They left the car and walked down the road where they knocked on the door of a little house and asked for help. Flustered, the lady invited them in to use the phone and warm up while she sorted out some tea and biscuits. 
'It’s a nice story, but what's so special about that?' you're asking. Well, it was special for the woman who opened the door that day; she has already told the story hundreds of times. And can you blame her? It's not everyday the Queen of England, and Prince Charles, turn up on your doorstep! 
On a winter's night over 2,000 years ago the Prince of Peace knocked on our door - and it was no accident. Christmas can be a crazy time full of emotion, laughter, sadness, happiness, loudness, quietness, madness and Uncle Arthur's terrible jokes.  But remember, however your Christmas is shaping up, make sure that the Prince of Peace reigns in your life and family.  Celebrating the birth of Jesus together, let the love and peace he brings be central to all you do.  Have a blessed Christmas!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…SET AN EXAMPLE . . . IN SPEECH, IN LIFE, IN LOVE, IN FAITH AND IN PURITY</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 TIMOTHY 4:12 NIV</span><br>It seems young Timothy was easily intimidated by powerful, older people. He was scared to challenge them to live with more faith. And it sounds like he was a bit less disciplined than he should have been. So Paul writes to him, 'Do not let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example... in speech, in life, in love, in faith and in purity... devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture . . . Do not neglect your gift… so that everyone may see your progress...' (1 Timothy 4:12-16 NIV). What's Paul's message to us?
Look at your life. Put it under a microscope. Make sure that every part is operating according to the highest standards. Set an example. Your age doesn't matter, live in a way that will make people will want to follow you. In what areas? In speech, the things you say and the way you say them; in life, your daily habits will decide your future; in love, the quality of your personal relationships; in faith, the amount that you trust God; in purity, your character and integrity. Live in a way that makes people study your life and see Jesus.
French artist Henri Matisse once said, 'Artists should have their tongues cut out.' Why? Because the artist's message comes through paint on canvas, not through the words they use. That’s a bit extreme, but it makes a powerful point! So today will your life be an example for others to follow? Don't tell them what to do, just let them see you.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>”…WHERE YOU GO I WILL GO</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>RUTH 1:16 NIV</span><br>You can spend your life anywhere, with anybody, doing anything, then suddenly get involved with someone and know that your destiny's tied to that person. It's what made Elisha leave his farm and follow Elijah, to wash his clothes and set up his tent. It's what made Timothy hang out with Paul, an old man preparing to be executed. As he passed books and blankets through a prison window Timothy was saying, 'There's something about you that touches me. Without you I will not reach my destiny.'
Ruth developed a special bond with her mother-in-law Naomi. Listen: '”…where you go I will go...”' The fact that Naomi was from a different country and was at a different stage of life, didn't matter to Ruth. There must have been times when they didn't relate to each other at all. When God wants to mature and stretch you, He will send somebody into your life with different experiences and insights. Naomi was Ruth's eyes and ears in a world she didn't know; she was her tutor and guide in avoiding the pitfalls of life. Naomi understood where Ruth had been; that's important because we are all products of our past. She also knew where Ruth needed to go; all Ruth needed was the courage and guts to follow.
God's constantly raising up people to take on new challenges. If you hope to be something for God, recognise the people He sends into your life to prepare you. Whether they come to comfort, counsel, correct or challenge you, remember the words of Jesus '”…whoever accepts anyone I send accepts me…”' (John 13:20 NIV).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>”…I AM EIGHTY-FIVE . . . I AM AS STRONG . . . AS I WAS AT [FORTY]…”</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOSHUA 14:10 TLB</span><br>Caleb is the champion of the second half. Listen: '”Give me the hill country. Even though I'm eighty-five, I'm as strong as I was at forty...”' (Paraphrase. See Joshua 14:7-12 TLB). Caleb probably said this in front of a load of young men each trying to get the best deal when it came to moving into the Promised Land. The hill country was full of walled cities and giants. Who wants that? The old guy did. Maybe your life has not been too impressive as yet. You don't think you've done anything important, lost a few mates and are wondering what life has in store. Don't stew on it. If Caleb was still up for new challenges at 85 it’s probably a bit soon for you to think about giving up!
E Stanley Jones spent more than 50 years in India. At 83, after a lifetime of constant travel during which he spoke to millions, met with Presidents and Prime Ministers and was the main man in the conversion of masses, he had a stroke. It left him without speech or physical mobility. In the long months before he died, Jones managed to mutter through virtually paralysed lips the manuscript of a remarkable book. In one amazing paragraph he writes: 'There are scars on my faith, but underneath those scars there are no doubts... I'm 83, and I'm more excited today about being a Christian than I was at 18, when I first put my feet upon this way!' 
With God, running stumble-free doesn't make you a winner, finishing strong does!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>….IN QUIETNESS AND TRUST IS YOUR STRENGTH</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ISAIAH 30:15 NIV</span><br>Sometimes talking makes things worse. Listen: 'The tongue is a small thing, but what enormous damage it can do. A tiny spark can set a great forest on fire.' (James 3:5 NLT). Look at how an argument can start with just a small comment and turn into a massive fight. Often people are just waiting for some loud mouthed individual to say what they wish they had the guts to say, and once the door is open they join in. Don't be that person. Learn to stop that spark before a huge fire breaks out. If you want to get on in life and make a difference, learn to tame your tongue. Your mouth can talk you out of more blessings than you can count.
In the Bible we see David arriving at the palace to work for Saul. Saul was a bit of a psycho due to his 'evil spirit' but David wasn't stupid, he could see what was going on. David got on with his job and kept his mouth shut, knowing his time would come. Make sure you’re not there when disgruntled, complainers start moaning on. 
'…pour out [your] complaint before [God]…' (Psalm 142:2 NIV). If something’s bugging you just tell Jesus! Is that hard to do? No! Talk to him then hold of that situation and bring light and life to it. Our conversations need to be full of grace and love. Speak positively. With a few words you can change a whole lot of attitudes.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>”I WILL INVITE EVERYONE WHO IS VICTORIOUS TO SIT WITH ME ON MY THRONE…”</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>REVELATION 3:21 NLT</span><br>As we enter the prime season for temptation to take hold, here’s 12 top truths to keep you on track. 1) Christmas is not an excuse to give in to temptation. 2) Any weakness you constantly give in to, excuse, deny or hide, will control you. 3) You must identify and target your biggest weakness first. 4) Ignoring your weakness guarantees you'll lose 5) Satan will use certain friends to trip you! 6) Your weakness will try to take over your life and ruin God’s plan for you 7) Your weakness will always draw you to the wrong people and make you uncomfortable around the right ones. 8) Your weakness can show itself at any time, and usually at the most unexpected time 9) Your weakness can't be beaten by any logic or will power 10) God will let you be successful in different areas even when you feel like your weakness is winning. Why? Because He is full of grace and mercy 11) People who love you are praying for you to beat your weakness because that glorifies God. 12) Overcoming your weakness brings great rewards. Listen: ‘”Conquerors will sit alongside me at the head table, just as I, having conquered, took the place of honour at the side of my Father. That's my gift to the conquerors!”' (Revelation 3:21 TM). Understand this: God will not only help you to overcome your greatest weakness - but to turn it into your greatest weapon! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>”…SATAN HAS ASKED TO HAVE ALL OF YOU…”</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 22:31 NIV</span><br>Are you struggling with temptation? Here's a plan for victory.
1) Decide that you will not give in. Jesus said, '”…I have given you . . . [physical and mental strength] over all the power that the enemy [possesses]…”' (Luke 10:19 AMP). Get rid of your 'I can't' attitude. Start drawing daily on God's strength. 
2) If you slip, don't wallow. Becoming mature is a life-long process. It takes place each time you turn to God in your weakness and allow Him to do for you what you can't do for yourself. 
3) Confess your sin. Listen: 'The Lord is near to the broken-hearted…' (Psalm 34:18 NAS). God always responds to a sorry heart. He will meet you at your lowest point, walk you through the pain and healing of regret, and bring you out stronger and wiser. 
4) Make a 3-column ‘temptation’ list: a) Discoveries. List everything you have learned about yourself, other people, and God's Word b) The New Me. List areas that still need to be changed and dealt with c) Action Plan. Write down things you want to bring into your life like prayer, confession, accountability, Bible reading and new Christian friendships.  
5) Use what you've learned. Jesus told Peter, '”…satan has asked to have all of you . . .but I have pleaded in prayer for you…so when you have repented and turned to Me again, strengthen and build up your brothers”.' (Luke 22:31-32 NIV). Let today mark a new beginning by using what you've learned, not only to avoid falling again, but also to help others facing the same temptations.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>RUN FROM ANYTHING THAT STIMULATES YOUTHFUL LUST. FOLLOW ANYTHING THAT MAKES YOU WANT TO DO RIGHT…</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 TIMOTHY 2:22 NLT</span><br>In Genesis, when Eve looked at the tree in the middle of the garden, she 'saw . . . its fruit was good [and] . . . she took some' (Genesis 3:6 NCV). Look out! The tempter knows where each of us are weakest. He knew that God had great plans for Eve so he decided to seduce her, and in doing so, dealt a deathblow to her descendants. Understand this: the battle is always over your future. The issue is not just you - it's about those God plans to bless through you!
Look at Samson: his character didn't match his strength. He fooled himself into thinking that he could live as he wanted and escape the consequences. His life is a mine of valuable lessons, such as: a) success in one area does not mean you can't fail in others b) temptation always returns to the scene of its previous success c) playing with temptation means you'll always lose d) even though giving in to temptation may not cut you off from God's grace, it can limit your usefulness to Him e) where we think we are strongest is where we're least likely to be prepared for attack.
When all else fails there’s one thing you can always do when you are faced with a temptation… RUN!  That's what Joseph did. His boss’s wife fancied him, and she was no minger either. Joseph found himself trapped but decided that giving in would be '”…a sin against God”' (Genesis 39:9 NIV), so he legged it! God is not dishonoured when you run - He's dishonoured when you don't!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>TEMPTATION COMES FROM THE LURE OF OUR OWN EVIL DESIRES.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JAMES 1:14 NLT</span><br>Before we give in to temptation we go through certain stages: a) ignoring prayer and Bible reading we become cold to God. Forgetting about danger, we get drawn in like a moth to the flame b) we begin to justify ourselves thinking, 'Nobody knows, what harm will it do?' c) we convince ourselves it's OK and can't even remember why it's wrong d) we surround ourselves with mates who do the same, or are willing to look the other way.
'But I would never do that,' you say. Maybe, but what things would you do? This raises another question, 'Have you reached your time of testing yet?' When Jesus told Peter he'd deny his Lord, Peter replied, 'No way!' Yet within hours he'd fallen flat on his face. James says, 'Temptation comes from the lure of our own evil desires.'  You have weak areas which if not disciplined by commitment and character, have the ability to destroy you.
'What can I do?' you ask. When Jehoshaphat came up against an enemy too big to handle alone, he prayed, '”…we have no power against this great multitude . . . We do not know what to do, but our eyes are upon You”’ (2 Chronicles 20:12 NKJ). Jehoshaphat understood three things: 1) he knew that in his own strength he was no match for this enemy 2) he was humble enough to admit it and reach for help 3) he knew where to turn - '”…our eyes are upon you.”' What's the secret of victory? Lean on Jesus, not yourself!

<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...GO, AND I . . . WILL TEACH YOU WHAT YOU SHALL SAY.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EXODUS 4:12 AMP</span><br>
When Moses told God that he was unqualified for the job, in a way, he was right. When God calls you He gives you what you need, but He doesn't necessarily do it immediately. Your learning often takes place in the process of actually having a go. 
Have you told God, 'I'm terrified of talking in front of people - what do you mean you want me to lead this talk?' Or, 'I can't do it. Why would You want me to do for this job when I don't know what to do?' You can't rely on your own opinion! The only qualification you absolutely must have to do any job God asks of you is a willingness to try. The rest, as they say, is 'on-the-job training.' You simply have to trust God and act when he tells you.
That's not to say you'll never be scared. Like Moses, you may feel so inadequate you can't even imagine succeeding. That's when you must have faith to stretch and grow past what you can imagine and just start doing what needs to be done as well as you can. That can be scary. You'll probably find yourself more dependent on God than ever before. You may have to ask the people around you loads of questions, and sometimes more than once. Don't be afraid to ask, to make mistakes, to get help, or to do things differently than people before you. If God has called you - then you are the person for the job! Do not ever lose sight of that!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...TWO FORCES WITHIN US ARE CONSTANTLY FIGHTING EACH OTHER...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GALATIANS 5:17 TLB</span><br>
No matter how long we've been a Christian, our body never improves; it never becomes more like God because we get old! That's why we are told to everyday to give ourselves to him and live by Gods power.
Listen: 'Obey only the Holy Spirit's instructions . . . then you will not always be doing the wrong things your evil nature wants you to . . . we naturally love to do evil things that are just the opposite from the things that the Holy Spirit tells us to do; and the good things we want to do when the Spirit has His way with us are just the opposite of our natural desires. These two forces within us are constantly fighting each other to win control over us, and our wishes are never free from their pressures . . . But when the Holy Spirit controls our lives He will produce this kind of fruit in us: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control' (Galatians 5:16-17 &amp; 23 TLB).
Is living like this really possible? Yes, but you must do four things: 1) understand that you're a target for the enemy and protect yourself with God's Word and prayer 2) get angry with sin - don't put up with it: '...let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles...' (Hebrews 12:1 NIV) 3) be continually filled with the Holy Spirit. Without it, you lose every time 4) stand in God's strength, not your own. How? By exercising your choice to obey Him rather than going for the easy option.]]></introtext>

WILL BE BLESSED THROUGH YOU...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 28:14 TLB</span><br>If you found out that a Christian invented the typewriter it would beg the question... why? Well, what's the cheesiest reason you can come up with? Yes, believe it or not the typewriter was invented to write sermons. Christopher Sholes was worried about his pastor who'd been busy all week visiting victims of an epidemic, comforting the families and doing funerals. As a result the poor guy had no time to write his Sunday sermons. One day Sholes was talking to a friend about what could be done. He said, 'It seems a pity there ain't some quick method of writing for busy folks like parsons.' His friend replied, 'Why not invent a machine?' Sholes responded, 'I'll try.' That rainy afternoon was the beginning of months of hard work. Finally a group got together one day to see him tap out on paper, in capital letters, C LATHAM SHOLES, SEPTEMBER 1867. Six years later the Remington's recognised the typewriter as something that could revolutionise business. In those days clerks were mostly men, but the Young Women's Christian Association started offering courses in typing for women. To start with it created a scandal, but as the first typists to be trained were women, employers rushed to hire them. So, the typewriter and the YWCA made sure that a woman's place was not only at home, but could also be in the office.'
Have you ever wondered what is and isn't ok to ask God for? Well if it's going to help spread the gospel in anyway you can be sure it's fine.]]></introtext>

WILL BE BLESSED THROUGH YOU...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 28:14 TLB</span><br>One God-given idea can change so much. Braille did! In 1824 Louis Braille, a Christian, invented a system of raised dots on paper so that blind people could read. He invented 63 symbols representing every language, so the Bible was placed into the hands of the visually impaired for the first time.
Even heard of the Morse Code? In part, you owe your mobile phone and your computer to a Christian named Samuel Morse. The world was a different place before this guy! First class news took two weeks to reach the USA. And reports of a major victory could take six weeks to reach Britain. One day a friend said, 'Morse, when you were experimenting did you ever come to an absolute deadlock, not knowing what to do?' Morse replied, 'More than once.' His friend asked, 'What did you do then?' Morse shared a secret: 'I got down on my knees and prayed for light, and light came, and when my inventions were acknowledged by flattering honours from America and Europe, I said, &quot;Not unto me, O Lord, not unto me, but unto Thy name give the glory.&quot;' That's why the first message sent by transatlantic cable read: 'What God has wrought.'
Christians are so creative because God is so creative! We've not really got time to mention Louis Pasteur, the French scientist who discovered that infection is the result of germs and viruses. He introduced sterilisation methods that saved the lives of millions. Do you think God will ever run out of creativity? Not a chance! Ask Him for some today!]]></introtext>

WILL BE BLESSED THROUGH YOU...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 28:14 TLB</span><br>Good ideas come from God, so ask Him for one. The world's been blessed by those who did. Think about anaesthetic: how would you like to be operated on without it? That is the way they did it until a Scottish doctor called James Young Simpson introduced something he called 'artificial sleep.' As a student at Edinburgh University he was attracted to surgery because he was troubled by the pain and death rate experienced during operations. After reading Genesis 2:21, 'And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam...,' Simpson thought a chemical called chloroform might be the answer. He first experimented on himself. Finally, in 1847, the first three operations with chloroform took place. One of the patients, a young soldier, enjoyed it so much that he grabbed the sponge and inhaled again. 'It was just too good to be stopped' he said.
At first Simpson found people against him. Some thought it was a sin to interfere with nature. 'Hand me the Bible,' said Dr. Simpson. 'This is how God operated on Adam.' Simpson made speeches, wrote letters and booklets and tried to convince everyone who opposed him that this was the way forward. In a setback, three deaths caused by chloroform were reported from other hospitals, but Simpson was able to show them that they weren't applying the anaesthetic properly. The tide turned when Queen Victoria gave birth to her eighth child under chloroform and said that she was 'greatly pleased with its effect.' Today ask God to give you an idea that blesses others. Then act on it!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...DO YOU BELIEVE THIS?</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 11:26 TM</span><br>
When Jesus stood at the graveside of Lazarus He told the grieving family two things we must never forget: a) '&quot;Your brother will rise again&quot;' (John 11:23 NAS) b) '&quot;Everyone who lives believing in me does not ultimately die at all. Do you believe this?&quot;' (John 11:25-26 TM). That's the basic question of life. '&quot;...Do you believe this?&quot;' What's going to take you past death and onto your heavenly home? Jesus and only Jesus! Only he can guarantee you eternal life. He beat death and the grave for you. You may be reading these words, fighting tears of pain and grief. Perhaps you have lost your friend or family member, or maybe you've just seen horrific images of starving children on the news. Christ understands your grief; like no one else He feels your pain.
Maybe you're even scared of dying. If you have never before given your life to Jesus you need to get that sorted now. Don't wait for a better time. Give your life over to Him today and you will be saved, which means when you breathe your last breath - tomorrow or in 80 years, you will pass from death to life - heavenly life. If you know Jesus there's no reason to be scared of death or the unknown; He's already got it sorted and He's made a place for you. It's ready! Unexplainable, unending joy will be yours forever because of Jesus. Then like Paul you can say, 'O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting?' (1 Corinthians 15:55 AMP). Think: immediately following death - Glory!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>ANTS . . . STORE UP THEIR FOOD IN THE SUMMER.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 30:25 NIV</span><br>You will never change your life until you change something you do daily. Success does not suddenly happen, neither does failure; both are a process. Every day of your life is just preparation for the next. The question is, what are you preparing for? Are you setting yourself up for success or failure? 
In the animation film Antz, the ants spend the whole summer working hard and collecting grain for the winter so they won't go hungry. During the summer the grasshoppers pay a visit and tell the ants they intend to take all the food they want. The ants have enough of the annual bullying from the grasshoppers and fight back. Needless to say the ants win the day and put an end to the grasshoppers, bullying and laziness. The result was that the grasshoppers had no food for the winter but the ants had all they needed. The grasshoppers didn't get that the only real preparation for tomorrow is the right use of today.
In an exam, have you ever walked confidently into the classroom, knowing you've revised so hard you're gonna 'ace' it? Impossible? Unfortunately, most of us don't lead our own lives - we just accept them. Life is not a dress rehearsal. You do not get a second chance. Walking with God you can have that kind of confidence every day. Benjamin Disraeli, Britain's first Jewish Prime Minister, once said, 'The secret of success in life, is for a man to be ready for his time when it comes.' Answer this question: if God gave you the things you are praying for, could you handle them?]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...HE . . . HAD DESIGNS ON US FOR GLORIOUS LIVING...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 1:11 TM</span><br>Most of us spend our lives focusing on what we have... until we realise that we're running out of time, then we begin to focus on what we've done. Understand this: when you leave this world your material possessions will be forgotten. The only thing that will stay - is your life's impact! During your lifetime you will directly or indirectly impact the lives of approximately 10,000 other people. The question is, how will you impact them? Money, or the lack of it, does not necessarily determine your life's impact. People with fat fortunes have lived, died and made little or no difference. Other people, totally skint but full of vision, have done what Jesus said when He prayed 'your will be done, on earth, as it is in Heaven.'
At the end of a life well lived the Apostle Paul wrote, '...I have finished my course...' (2 Timothy 4:7 NIV). Having said that he handed the ministry over to Timothy, walked to the executioner's chopping block and was relieved of his duties. Yet his impact is greater now than ever. He writes: '[God]. . . had designs on us for glorious living...' What kind? Living with impact! Not just making a living but making a difference!
In the movie Forest Gump, Tom Hanks plays a character with disabilities, both physical and mental. By following wise advice he goes on to achieve some incredible things. You know what? You have within you huge potential for achieving incredible thing. God's given you a gift. Believe it. Discover it. Develop it. Cherish it. Use it. Give it. That's glorious living!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>FOR EVEN HIS OWN BROTHERS DID NOT BELIEVE HIM.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 7:5 NIV</span><br>'Jesus' brothers said to him, &quot;you ought to leave here and go to Judea, so that your disciples may see the miracles you do...&quot; for even his own brothers did not believe him' (John 7:3-5 NIV). At first glance Jesus' brothers seem pretty encouraging, until you realise they were being sarcastic.  
Have you ever experienced the pain of being rejected by your family? If so, you're not on your own. Jesus did too! This little snippet from John's gospel describes how his own brothers completely misjudged Him. Jesus was full of all the wisdom of God so He understood that they just didn't get Him. But because He was also human through and through it still hurt. However the amazing thing about Jesus is that He chose to keep on loving and respecting them anyway. And then, beyond continuing to love His family, He showed an even higher priority, to those who'd come to hear what He had to say. 
Taking up your cross and following Jesus often involves misunderstanding and rejection by your own friends and family, and not always just by non-Christians! If that's what's going on with you today why not pray this prayer: 'Father, bring me to the place where I can live like Jesus lived, facing head-on those who misunderstand me, hearing their comments and feeling the pain of their words, yet learning to rise above it. Help me to understand, forgive, and love people no matter what. Bring me  to the place of peace, so that no matter who doesn't get me, I can go on, like Jesus went on. Amen.']]></introtext>

Like Sally Field at the Academy Awards, we find ourselves wanting to be able to say as she did after winning her second Oscar: 'You like me! You really like me!' The trouble is, it's not someone's approval that makes us feel good, it's our belief that they are right. How we feel about something can all hang on the reaction of others, not on what's right in Gods eyes. Do you know there are loads of stories of missionaries who have died a 'failure', believing that nothing had changed, but upon their death revival broke out because of their work. Whether we are around to see success or not, the approval of God is all that matters. 
It's nice to be appreciated, but when we're not, our self-worth must be based on two things alone:
1) God's unconditional love and acceptance of us, which was proven once and for all at the cross.
2) The joy of knowing that one day we will hear '&quot;well done good and faithful servant...&quot;' (Matthew 25:21 NIV). Today God is saying to you, 'Don't despise your place, your gifts or your job. You can't have someone else's and it wouldn't fulfil you if you could.' ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>GOD SAID TO JACOB, &quot;NOW MOVE ON TO BETHEL AND SETTLE THERE. BUILD AN ALTAR THERE TO WORSHIP ME...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 35:1 NLT</span><br>What do you do when you have lost your way; when you've blown it all and it seems your whole life is screwed up? These questions haunted Jacob while he was hanging out in Shechem. He'd been a con from a young age and played it well. Now the con man was getting old and mending his ways but his sons had learned a lot from their old man; but they were violent too. Thanks to Jacob's sons, Shechem became like a scene from 'War of the Worlds' - Jacob was terrified. It looked like it was payback time - the scary local tribes were looking for revenge.  
In despair, Jacob turned back to God who whispered, 'Go back to Bethel.' So Jacob turned around and went back to the place where he'd once met God; where he'd received a heavenly vision; where he'd first known the joy and security of living in a loving relationship with God. Jacob returned to Bethel and made an altar there. 
Have you stumbled and fallen? Have you made a mess of your life? If so, do what Jacob did; go back to where you met God. Get down on your knees and pray! Stop dancing on the edge of disaster, living a secret life that only you and God know about! Go back to your Bethel! God will meet you there. Listen: 'Let the wicked abandon their way of life and the evil way of thinking. Let them come back to God, who is merciful, come back to our God, who is lavish with forgiveness' (Isaiah 55:7 TM). Those words were written for you! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...GOD LOVES A CHEERFUL GIVER.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 9:7 NIV</span><br>There are two kinds of givers: those who give what's left over, and those who give off the top. The first group isn't necessarily greedy, they just live a different way. They see themselves as being responsible for meeting their own needs, so whatever's left over goes to God's work. The problem with giving leftovers is that you will never give what you think you can't afford. As soon as you feel a bit skint, you decide not to give. The other problem is that you buy the new Nike trainers which you've convinced yourself you  absolutely need and have no money left over anyway! God says he wants you to be a 'cheerful giver'. But if your heart is more desperate for those new shoes, how can you ever be generous the way God wants?
On the other hand, those who give 'off the top' understand that God owns and controls all the blessings in their life anyway, so they feel free to give to Him first and themselves second. Leftover givers always struggle in this area. They know all the stuff about God providing but there are clothes to buy, nights out to fund and friends' birthdays coming up, so they hold back, afraid they can't do all this and give to God. 
Fear has the power to make you act the opposite to what you believe. Basically fear makes you irrational. Doesn't it make more sense to trust God with your money since it's all His anyway? ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>DO FOR OTHERS WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE THEM TO DO FOR YOU...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 7:12 NLT</span><br>Take a look at the following statements: a) I am always honest b) I am mostly honest c) I am quite honest d) I am rarely honest e) I am never honest. Which slot are you in? 
Most of us put ourselves in the second slot because it's the most convenient. Risking confrontation, being disciplined, putting others first and paying the price for success can all be a bit uncomfortable. Most of us think that being mostly honest is fine - unless we are on the other end of someone's being 'mostly honest'. If you are looking for a real standard of decent behaviour to live by, you will find it in the golden rule. Here's why:
1) His golden rule is easy to understand You just put yourself in the place of the other person and think 'how would I like it?' Even a small child can get that! 
2) It's a win-win lifestyle. Have you ever met people who believe that in order for them to win, others must lose? Well if you think about it if I treat you as well as I want to be treated, you win. If you treat me the same I win. Where's the loser in that?
3) It produces peace and self-worth. Ultimately, you have to be able to live with yourself! If the only way you can win is by cheating, you lose self-respect, live with the fear of being found out, lose your confidence before God, and all your successes don't count! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>DO FOR OTHERS WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE THEM TO DO FOR YOU...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 7:12 NLT</span><br>All good relationships are based on Christ's golden rule. The bottom line is show people that you value them! It's easy to tell someone how great you think they are but showing it is often a totally different story. There are loads of ways to show someone how much you value them: you can just tell them straight, or give a little gift, a little note, or tell other people and let it feed back. But, the best way is through the most precious gift you have - your time. Poet Robert Brault said 'I value the friend who finds time for me on his calendar, but I cherish the friend who for me does not consult his calendar'. 
How can you possibly show someone their value if you never actually have time for them? You can only maintain a friendship for so long with 'thinking of you' text messages and emails with the subject line 'sorry it's been so long'. It doesn't matter how much you think you care for someone or love someone, at the end of the day you have to show it through your time. 
Other people need to be loved and valued the way you want to be loved and valued. Make sure that you treat people with respect at all times. Don't ever try to use, control or manipulate people. Remember, if your friends think you are taking advantage of them even after you have explained yourself or your behaviour, you need to re-think your idea of friendship! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>DO FOR OTHERS WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE THEM TO DO FOR YOU...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 7:12 NLT</span><br>What did Jesus mean when He said, 'Do for others what you would like them to do for you...'? He was saying:
1) Value others. Seventy percent of people who leave their jobs leave because they don't feel valued. That shows just how poorly some people treat their employees. There isn't a person in the world that doesn't want to be appreciated. Don't you?
2) Thank them. American Psychologist Donald Laird said, 'Always help people increase their self-esteem. There's no higher compliment you can pay someone than helping them to be useful.'. How can you do that? By letting people know that you think they have done well and saying it - especially in front of their mates. When was the last time a group of your friends sat around biggin' each other up? Try it, there's no feeling like respect from your mates. 
3) Trust them. Without trust there can be no real relationship. Once lost, it's virtually impossible get back. Did you know the best way to make someone trustworthy is to trust them? When you encourage someone in that way, especially someone you don't know well they will always do their best not to let you down. The opposite is also true. By not even giving someone a chance they have no reason to be trustworthy. It's not easy but that is what Jesus does for us. No matter how many times we fail him, we get another shot. And he believes in us each and every time. Don't others deserve the same chance from you? ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘”COME TO TERMS QUICKLY WITH YOUR ENEMY…”’</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 5:25 NLT</span><br>The power you have over anyone who hurts you – is the power of forgiveness. Forgiving – sets both sides free from the negative connection that exists between you. As long as you don’t forgive someone you’ll drag them with you wherever you go. Jesus said, ‘Come to terms quickly with your enemy’ because the best healing is a quick healing. Bitterness does more damage to the one who carries it, than the one who it’s focused on. 
Think: have you ever been wronged? Have there been times you haven’t got everything you deserved? Right! We live in an imperfect world, don’t we, and as long as we do we won’t see a time when everything we do is fully rewarded. Even when truth is on your side you may never be able to right all the wrongs. Continually fighting for ‘your rights’ can make you downright miserable. What are you really hoping to gain at the end of the day for using up all that time and energy? And besides, when you’re focusing on ‘your rights’ you’re usually looking backwards, not forwards. You can’t make progress when you’re facing the wrong way. Only when you turn your focus in the right direction and forgive, can you move ahead. That doesn’t mean you don’t recognise the wrongs; it means you choose to forgive and focus on what you can control – your attitude and your responses. Doing that will increase your energy, build your potential and set a great example. It also honours God!

<title><![CDATA[Deal with your hypocrisy!]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘…NO MORE PRETENSE…’</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 4:25 TM</span><br>Listen: ‘”These people honour Me with their lips, but their hearts are far from Me”’ (Matthew 15:8 NIV). That’s Jesus talking about hypocrisy – saying one thing but doing another.  It stinks! Two things:
1) Practicing hypocrisy is natural, resist it! Hypocrisy comes naturally to humans. It happens when we let our flesh rule our spirit. We let ourselves get sucked into saying and doing things to impress people and taste that sweet sugar of pride.
2) Breaking with hypocrisy is painful, stay at it! It’s easier to train a new Christian than re-program an old one steeped in religion. Winning any personal battle starts with admitting the problem. It is then that the Holy Spirit can begin His work and put us on the path to freedom. But be warned, it is a long, tough brutal fight. 
Paul writes, ‘…I insist – and God backs me up on this – that there be no going along with the crowd, the empty-headed, mindless crowd . . . that’s no life for you. You learned Christ! My assumption is that you have paid careful attention to Him, been well instructed in the truth precisely as we have it in Jesus. Since then, we do not have the excuse of ignorance, everything – and I do mean everything – connected with that old way of life has to go. It’s rotten through and through . . . take on an entirely new way of life – a God-fashioned life, a life renewed from the inside and working itself into your conduct as God accurately reproduces His character in you. What this adds up to . . . no more pretence…’ (Ephesians 4:17-25 TM). Could language be any clearer?!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘GIVE THANKS IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES...’</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 THESSALONIANS 5:18 NIV</span><br>The following story has been reprinted by request; it needs no commentary: 
‘They huddled inside the storm door – two children in ragged over-sized coats. ‘Any old papers, lady?’ I was busy. I wanted to say no – until I saw their feet. Little sandals sopped with sleet. ‘Come in and I’ll make you some hot cocoa.’ There was no conversation. Their soggy sandals left marks on the hearthstone. I served them cocoa with toast and jam to fortify them against the chill outside. Then I went back to the kitchen to work on my household budget. The silence in the front room struck through me. I looked in. The little girl held the empty cup in her hands looking at it. The boy asked, ‘Lady, are you rich?’ I looked at my shabby slipcovers. ‘Am I rich? Mercy, no!’ The girl put the cup in its saucer – carefully. ‘Your cups match your saucers.’ Her voice was old, with a hunger not of the stomach. Then they left, holding their bundles of paper against the wind. They had not said thank you. They did not need to – they had done more than that. Much more. Plain blue pottery cups and saucers, but they matched. Potatoes and brown gravy; a roof over our heads; my man with a good steady job – these things matched, too. I moved the chairs back from the fire and tidied the living room. The muddy prints of small sandals were still wet upon my hearth. I let them be. I want them there in case I ever forget how rich I am!’

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘…THEY FALL FLAT ON THEIR FACES.’</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 4:19 TM</span><br>In the early 1960’s Dr. Joseph Fletcher, published a book called Situation Ethics. In it he said that love was the only standard for determining right from wrong. The result was chaos. Now, everybody has their own standards, which change from situation to situation. To make matters worse, because of their natural inclination to be easy on themselves, they judge themselves according to their good intentions – but hold others to a higher standard and judge them by their worst actions. The same person who cheats at sport or steals office supplies from his employer wants a good deal from his vehicle mechanic and honestly from the client he deals with in business.
It is easy to be disgusted with people who fail the ethics test; especially when they have wronged us. It is a lot harder to make ethical choices in our own lives. Understand this: when you walk close to the edge of honesty, you’re likely to slip over that edge! It may be possible to fool people for a season, but in the long haul your deeds will catch up with you. In the short-term being honest may look like a bad idea - just as someone can temporarily appear to win by being dishonest. However, you inevitably lose when you live by the double standard. Can you think of one person who lived a life of short cuts and deception who it worked out well for in the end? No. Solomon writes: ‘The road of wrongdoing gets darker and darker – travellers cannot see a thing; they fall flat on their faces’ (Proverbs 4:19 TM).

<title><![CDATA[Confident about Judgement Day]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘…WE WILL NOT BE AFRAID ON THE DAY OF JUDGEMENT…’</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 JOHN 4:17 NLT</span><br>Today we fast-forward to Judgment Day.  It’s a day when earthly wealth will not matter. Physical beauty will not be factored. Fame will be forgotten. You might stand next to Napoleon or Julius Caesar, but all eyes will be on the judge: Jesus (see Acts 10:42 &amp; 2 Timothy 4:1). Those who throughout their lives ignored Him will hear the words ‘”Depart from Me…”’ (Matthew 25:41 NIV). But to those who accepted Him as Lord and Saviour, there need be no fear: ‘…we can face Him with confidence because we are like Christ here in this world’ (1 John 4:17 NLT). Think about that! When Jesus looks at you he’ll see a reflection of himself! Since you are ‘in Christ,’ you can view Judgment Day with confidence. Should you fear judgment? No. ‘In Christ’ your sin is gone! Should you fear death? No. ‘In Christ’ is indestructible life! So should we, who are ‘in Christ,’ fear about the Big Day? Not at all: ‘…our standing in the world is identical with Christ’s’ (1 John 4:17 TM).
Will you get into Heaven because you are worthy? No. You will get there because the One you trusted is worthy! Listen: ‘As we live in God, our love grows more perfect. So we will not be afraid on the Day of Judgement, but we can face Him with confidence because we are like Christ here in this world. Such love has no fear because perfect love expels all fear. If we are afraid, it is for fear of judgement, and this shows that His love has not been perfected in us’ (1 John 4:17-18 NLT).
Some people need to be very scared of Judgement Day – but not those who love Jesus.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘”…WHEN A BLIND MAN LEADS A BLIND MAN, THEY BOTH END UP IN THE DITCH.”’</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 15:14 TM</span><br>There’s some important growing and maturing that can only happen when you’re with the right people. Listen: one day a scorpion that asked a frog to carry him across the river because he couldn’t swim. ‘How do I know you won’t sting me?’ the frog asked. ‘If I do, we’ll both drown,’ he replied. So the scorpion hopped on. Half way across the river the scorpion stung him. As they were drowning the frog said, ‘Aaaagh! You promised you wouldn’t. Why did you sting me?’ The scorpion replied, ‘I can’t help it, it’s my nature to sting.’
Learn to recognise stinging relationships and walk away from them before they take you down with them. Like a deadly scorpion sting; if you don’t amputate, the poison will spread. Unless you have the courage to cut off what will not heal, you will end up losing much more.
You can’t partner closely with someone who doesn’t share your faith. When you feel passionately and want to express it, it’s like trying to breakdance with a mosher! (or the other way around). You picked the wrong dance partner…it’s gonna get messy! Why get tied up with someone who doesn’t share your God-given purpose? ‘But I’m reaching out to my friends – they need Jesus’. You’re right.  But have you read Galatians 6:1 or Jude 1:23? Both verses give a warning to make sure that in your reaching out you don’t go too far and fall yourself.  Why not pray today for wisdom to find the right balance?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘…GOD . . . PUT HIM IN THE GARDEN . . .TO TEND AND KEEP IT.’</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 2:15 NKJ</span><br>David knew that God had called him before he went to work for King Saul! That’s important! You’ve got to know who you are, apart from what you do; otherwise you’ll end up working harder at being appreciated than you will at your job. That sends the wrong signal to your work-mates and supervisors.  It also robs you of the solid foundation of security, peacefulness and joy your job provides. God has called you by name, so don’t let your self-worth swing like a politician’s popularity in an election year, up one day and down the next. You’ll end up riding a roller coaster of moodiness and unexpected disappointments.  Occasionally you’ll enjoy moments of praise, but they may or may not be sincere; for once others learn that you thrive on recognition; they hold the key to manipulating you for their own purposes. So trust your calling, not their opinions.
Thirsting for recognition gives others power over you. That’s dangerous! It’s hard to hear God’s voice (often directing you against the tide of popular opinion) when you have tuned your ears to respond only to your peer group. Listen: ‘…whatever you do, you must do all for the glory of God’ (1 Corinthians 10:31 NLT). If you’re pushing a brush, do it as unto the Lord! You can experience God’s pleasure in what you are doing, even if it’s not your idea of a good time.  Put your heart into your work today, and the hours will fly by!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘…GOD . . . PUT HIM IN THE GARDEN . . . TO TEND AND KEEP IT.’</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 2:15 NKJ</span><br>Think your job is tough? David worked for a violent King who was troubled by an evil spirit and who threw javelins at him! David’s job was to bring peace, order and productivity. Notice two important things:
1) David didn’t run away from his problem! If David had run away, he would have run away from his opportunity to serve God in that environment. David knew God was up to something good so he kept his joy, tuned his ear to God and found out what the moment demanded in order for God to show up. God is a trouble-shooter. When He sees trouble He sends in a shooter. God can empower you to be a solution to the problem – whatever the problem is. That’s what God’s big plan is all about – bringing His kingdom order to sin’s chaos. 
2) When David was called; he came with gifts. He brought ‘…a young goat and a donkey loaded down with food and wine’ (1 Samuel 16:20 NLT). He also brought his harp-playing skills! David wasn’t asking, ‘What’s in it for me?’ We need to get rid of our ‘gimme spirit’ and replace it with a heart that comes to serve. That involves keeping a right attitude, saying, ‘This may be a hard time, but it’s just a season. So I will check my attitude and be grateful for what I have. I can be trusted with what I‘ve been given. While I’m here I’m going to make God happy He picked me for the job. And I’ll show these people I work with that I’ve got something they need.’

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘…GOD . . . PUT HIM IN THE GARDEN . . . TO TEND AND KEEP IT.’</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 2:15 NKJ</span><br>While David was out in the pasture tending sheep, all human eyes were on charismatic King Saul. But God’s eyes were on David, watching how he worshipped, how his character was coming along, how he confronted evil. Would he be easily intimidated, or did he have the stuff kings were made of? How would he cope with battle? Would he tremble at the giant, or trust his giant God for a breakthrough? Was he proud and self-sufficient, running ahead of God, or did he rely 100% on God? Would he be fair with people? How would he handle authority? Would he diss the people placed over him? Or would he respect those in authority, regardless of their personal shortcomings?
David was not fully aware of what God had planned for him, but he acknowledged God in all his ways. Someone once said, ‘Character is what you are when nobody is watching.’ Well, God is always watching! He was watching David; and He is watching you! 
Most of us don’t work as though God is watching, or even cares about the quality of our work. We fail to realise that ‘No one on earth – from East or West...can raise another person up.  It is God alone who judges; He decides who will rise and who will fall.’ (Psalm 75:6-7 NLT). Do you understand that as difficult as your current situation may be, God has placed you there for a purpose? You’re there so that you can learn how to grow in grace and maturity and be trained for better things. Think about it!

TO TEND AND KEEP IT.’</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 2:15 NKJ</span><br>God sends His people into the world to be ‘salt’.  Cooking salt brings out the best flavours. In first aid, salt cleans and kick-starts the healing.  How salty are you?
God knows that if we become too comfortable in any situation we will just lounge there, not confronting issues but enjoying a bit of peace. However, being too laid back means missing the blessings that come through focused purpose and active warfare. Yes, warfare! Does the image of a soldier seem a bit hardcore to you? Well check this out: ‘Endure hardship with us like a good soldier of Christ Jesus’ (2 Timothy 2:3 NIV). We have been called to go into hostile situations, take the territory and demonstrate to others what it’s like to live under the lordship of Jesus. Don’t get caught up in mundane things like back chatting, name calling and who’s wearing what! There’s a bigger, God-given reason for being in that class or in that job. 
Has it occurred to you that you could be the only Christian somebody in your place of work or study actually knows? Or better yet, maybe the first one to make Christ look good and His message attractive? Someone’s eternal destiny could be riding on your testimony. They may not be interested in what you have to say at the moment, but life’s storms of death, divorce, sickness or adversity can change all that in an instant. That’s when the world starts crying out for help because nobody else has the answer. So, ‘…whatever you do, you must do all for the glory of God’ (1 Corinthians 10:31 NLT).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘…GOD . . . PUT HIM IN THE GARDEN . . . TO TEND AND KEEP IT.’</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 2:15 NKJ</span><br>Work well done is its own reward. It gives us a sense of value. When we’re not achieving anything we tend to get depressed. Don’t fall for the media hype that says successful people don’t need to work. We were all created to fulfil a purpose regardless of how much money is in our bank account. 
From the time Adam and Eve were created it’s been clear that God intended us to be like our Creator – productive, fruitful and involved in work that contributes to His master plan. Adam and Eve were given responsibility over the garden of Eden and enjoyed a maximum level of fulfilment in their jobs before their selfish decision to start doing things their own way. Listen: ‘…God took the man and put him in the Garden . . . to tend and keep it . . . Out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them. And whatever Adam called each living creature, that was its name’ (Genesis 2:15&amp;19 NKJ).
The first job description included naming and overseeing – the ultimate manager’s position! Eve was created to share in these endeavours as Adam’s business partner! A man who is not busy doesn’t need a business partner! So you don’t need to look any further than your Bible to realise that productive work is God’s plan for your life.  So what are you waiting for?  Put this magazine down and get stuck in today!

TO TEND AND KEEP IT.’</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 2:15 AMP</span><br>Have you started to develop what they call a ‘Work-Ethic’ yet? Sooner or later your Work-Ethic needs to kick in or you’ll find yourself skint and frustrated.  The opportunities you have in front of you are vast compared to your parents’ and grandparents’ generations.  So what are you complaining about? As difficult as it may be to accept, you are in your present position for a reason and you are there for a season. Study the course; take the tests, get your results and move on to what God has for you next. There’s something you need to learn and take with you from your present situation into your next one. Like what? Skill building and character building for starters. You’re gonna need those computer skills; and you need to remember to save your work before the PC crashes! You need to learn how to be patient, persistent, and how to manage your moods. For those who love the Lord, no experience is ever wasted. Listen: ‘…all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose’ (Romans 8:28 NKJ). Sometimes it’s difficult to see this in the moment. When Joseph was in the pit and the prison, it was hard to see how this road would lead to the palace, but it did. God has a master plan for your life. Your current situation may well be the ideal preparation for the job God has in mind for you. Look back at the steps that have moved you in your present direction. Then trust that God is using each experience to bring about His desire – and your fulfilment.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘…THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SECRETS OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD HAS BEEN GIVEN TO YOU…’</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 8:10 NIV</span><br>There are some people in life who seem to know everything about everything.  Or at least that’s how they act.  Well check this out: whatever they actually do know…they only got to know by looking, listening and learning from every opportunity! Some people you’ll meet will be like a rubbish dump of useless information, others will be a goldmine of valuable lessons. Make sure you pick the right people: those who ask you hard questions, bring you new perspective and keep you on track. When God sends you these people, there are three principles that will help you keep them.
1) Show appreciation. An ungrateful attitude acts like a chilly draught that will slam closed the doors to your future. Never take others for granted and never forget to say ‘thank you’.
2) Carry your own weight. Do not be a free-loader. Always look for ways to be a blessing to those who are blessing you.
3) Understand the boundaries. Just because somebody is taking time to invest in your future doesn’t mean they want to be your New Best Friend.  Do they really want to get texts and emails from you every five minutes!  Chill out and show respect. At the same time don’t go to the other extreme and start hero-worshipping either. Observe the boundaries that are naturally in the relationship and you will always have someone in your life who can help get you to where you need to go.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘”…GO NOW AND LEAVE YOUR LIFE OF SIN”’</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 8:11 NIV</span><br>Jesus always told it like it is. He would never put a bandage on an infected wound. He always insisted on getting right down to the root cause of a problem.  When a woman who’d been caught having sex with a bloke who wasn’t her husband was brought to him he first dealt with her accusers and then told her lovingly but firmly, ‘”…Go now and leave your life of sin.”’ (John 8:11 NIV)  We come to the same Jesus with the same burden of guilt and shame that woman felt.  Listen: ‘Since he himself has gone through suffering and temptation, he is able to help us when we are being tempted’ (Hebrews 2:18 NLT). Sadly, in our ‘Do it yourself’ culture, we often try to sort our issues out everywhere else before coming to Jesus.  Why?  Because He’s the only person we can’t fake it to – we have to be 100% real with him and that’s scary!  But it’s worth it! Job writes, ‘…prepare your heart and lift up your hands to Him in prayer. Get rid of your sins, and leave all iniquity behind you. Then your face will brighten in innocence. You will be strong and free of fear. You will forget your misery. It will all be gone like water under the bridge . . . you will have courage because you will have hope. You will be protected and will rest in safety. You will lie down unafraid, and many will look to you for help’ (Job 11:13-19 NLT). Jesus invites you to step into the river of God’s mercy today. Let it flow over you setting you free. Whether it’s the guilt of something you have done, or the pain for something that was done to you – get real with Jesus!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘…THE GLORY OF THE LORD WILL SHINE OVER YOU’</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ISAIAH 60:2 NLT</span><br>The most recent school shooting in America left 12 pupils dead and left lots more wounded in hospital. A student, smiling and shouting, gunned down his classmates then turned the gun on himself. ‘Well, America’s full of guns, it would never happen here.’ Oh really…well let’s consider the warning signs:
There have been some heartbreaking stories in our own news recently of kids being really cruel to other kids.  And whaddaya know – the American school carnage began as a seed planted in the imagination of a boy left alone with video games in which the good guy is actually the bad guy, and winners blow away losers, leaving dismembered bodies in scenes of blood and gore. ‘Whoa…hang about, they’re only games! Maybe! But the shops report that the more violent and bloodthirsty the game, the better it sells. Think about it: if violence has become your generation’s most popular form of entertainment, what does that tell us about the future? What kind of stuff will we be seeing on the six o’clock news in ten years time? The Bible teaches that as a young person you need to develop an inner life with three elements: a) Love – choosing to work on those vital family ties and not looking for it in all the wrong places b) Law – God has given us rules to live by, including the rewards of keeping them and the consequences of breaking them c) Light – spending time in God’s presence – worshipping, praying – do this while you’re  young, and the darkness of the world will never overcome your brightness, listen: ‘Darkness as black as night will cover all the nations…but the glory of the Lord will shine over you’ Isaiah 60:2 NLT.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘…SERVE EACH OTHER WITH LOVE.’</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GALATIANS 5:13 NCV	</span><br>Listen: ‘By love serve one another.’ William Booth, founder of The Salvation Army, lived by those words. And check this out - when he was too old and sick to attend their General Conference, he sent a one-word telegram; one word that ignited the auditorium and brought the crowd to their feet – ‘Others!’
William Wilberforce lived by those words too. History records that in one 30-day period in 1814, without the aid of computers or email, his efforts produced 1,500,000 signatures on a petition protesting against slavery, which he then presented to the British Parliament. He was constantly under threat from the slave owners, not to mention shady MPs who owned their own plantations and slaves. His fight lasted for decades. Encouraged by people like John Wesley, Wilberforce stirred the conscience of the whole nation. One of the greatest influences in Wilberforce’s life was his friend John Newton, writer of the song Amazing Grace. John had been a slave trader but gave it up when he had a real encounter with Jesus. On his deathbed in 1833, that Wilberforce received the news that Parliament had finally passed a law to ban slavery forever. Eventually his influence reached America and slavery was abolished there too. Think one person can’t make a difference? Think again!
Why don’t you pray: ‘Lord, You have given me unique abilities.  Please help me to be me and not pretend to be someone else.  Save me from moodiness or jealousy toward others. Help me to discover who You created me to be.  Help me to enjoy the things that make me so special.  Help me to realise that I was born to make a difference. Help me to give this world something that no one else can.’

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘…IF I WERE STILL TRYING TO PLEASE PEOPLE, I WOULD NOT BE CHRIST’S SERVANT.’</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GALATIANS 1:10 NLT</span><br>When Jesus spoke, He was free from the need to create an impression. That means He was free to ‘speak the truth in love’ (see Eph 4:15). Are you? Or is your life a bit like one really long episode of Fame Academy; where everything you say or do is a performance designed to impress ‘The Judges’?  Almost certainly our family would be on that judging panel; our mates too. Plus our teachers, youth leaders and maybe even the people at the bus stop in the morning! It gets pretty crowded in that judges, box. Of course, you will never really know for sure what anybody’s actually thinking about you. The drawback of a performance life is that it’s not really a life at all; it’s an act made up of what we think other people are thinking.
When we are young we can get into a bad habit of living to please other people. When we are older and wiser we realise that most of the time others weren’t even thinking about us anyway! When our identity gets wrapped up in other people’s opinions, we set ourselves up for approval addiction. Our sense of self worth is always on the line. That’s not how God wants us to live! No one’s approval can affect us – unless we choose to let it. The same is true for disapproval! That’s why Paul writes, ‘…I’m not trying to be a people pleaser! If I were still trying to please people, I would not be Christ’s servant’ (Galatians 1:10 NLT).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘…BE FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT.’</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 5:18 NIV</span><br>God’s indwelling Spirit does three wonderful things for each of us:
1) He seals us! Listen: ‘…ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit…’ (Ephesians 1:13 KJV). To protect a letter you seal the envelope. To keep air out of the jar you seal its mouth with a rubber-ringed lid. To seal a deal, you sign the contract. A seal declares importance, value and ownership. Are you getting the idea?
2) He protects us! Peter says we are ‘…shielded by God’s power…’ (1 Peter 1:5 NIV). Do you have any idea how many times God has stepped between you and the enemy, protecting you from harm? Deep within each of us God’s Spirit whispers, ‘You are mine, and what I own I protect and care for’
3) He makes sure our prayers are heard! Listen: ‘The Spirit comes to the aid of our weakness. We do not even know how we ought to pray, but through our inarticulate groans the Spirit Himself is pleading for us, and God who searches our inmost being knows what the Spirit means, because He pleads for God’s own people, in God’s own way’ (Romans 8:26-27 NEB). Notice: ‘the Spirit comes to the aid of our weakness.’ Weak bodies, weak wills, weak faith. How good to know that it’s not up to us. ‘The Spirit Himself is pleading for us.’ None of us pray as much as we should – but we all pray more than we think – because the Holy Spirit turns our very sighs into petitions and makes sure that we get heard. Sealed! Protected! Heard! Spirit-filled living – refuse to settle for less.

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘FOR YOU WHO WELCOME HIM...’</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 8:9 TM</span><br>Listen: ‘…Those who trust God’s action in them…experience life on God’s terms’ (Romans 8:5,9-10 TM). All believers have God in their heart – but not all believers have given their whole heart to God! The question is not, ‘how can I have more of the Holy Spirit?’ It’s ‘how can the Spirit have more of me?’ 
Let’s go down the list: a) your tongue. Do you tend to stretch the truth? Do you gossip? b) your language. Is your conversation all effing and blinding and dirty jokes? c) your grudges. Do you hold resentment vowing to get even one day? d) your activity. Do you just kick back because you think the world somehow owes you something? 
If you find these questions too personal, maybe you can take it up in heaven with the apostle Paul! Listen to his list: ‘Put away all falsehood and tell your neighbour the truth...do not sin by letting anger gain control over you...If you are a thief, stop stealing. Begin using your hands for honest work, and then give generously to others in need. Do not use foul or abusive language. Let everything you say be good and helpful...And do not bring sorrow to God’s Holy Spirit by the way you live...Get rid of all bitterness, rage, anger, harsh words and slander, as well as all types of malicious behaviour’ (Ephesians 4:25-31 NLT). Notice the words ‘do not bring sorrow to God’s Holy Spirit by the way you live.’ This calls for getting up each morning and saying, ‘Good morning Holy Spirit! Guide me today, empower me please and help me to honour You in all that I do.. Amen.’

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘”THOUGH THE MOUNTAINS BE SHAKEN . . . MY UNFAILING LOVE FOR YOU WILL NOT…”’</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ISAIAH 54:10 NIV</span><br>On September 11th, 2001, as volunteer Frank Silecchia sifted through the carnage at the World Trade Centre he found 47 bodies but no survivors. But something did catch his attention – a cross standing upright against the dusty sunrise. The unmistakeable shape was made by steel beams from two different buildings.  As they’d crashed into each other, the girders, forged together by the fire, had created a giant cross in the chaos.
When death or disease claims a loved one, or financial disaster wipes out our sense of security, we wonder, ‘Where’s God in all of this? Does He care?’ We can handle almost anything as long as we know He’s there. When we’re not sure, the doubt creates fear.
When God introduced Himself to Moses through a burning bush He said, ‘”I Am”’ (Exodus 3:14 NAS). That has not changed. He is still the same right here, right now ‘I Am’ God. Jesus said, ‘”…Before Abraham was born, I Am”’ (John 8:58 NIV). That means He doesn’t need a crystal ball to predict the future, or a rear view mirror to see the past.  He is ‘the same yesterday, today, and forever’ (Hebrews 13:8 NLT). He still walks into the events of our lives: weddings, funerals, broken homes, hospital rooms, bankrupt businesses and jail cells saying ‘I am – always with you.’ Listen: ‘”Though the mountains be shaken and the hills be removed, yet My unfailing love for you will not...” says the Lord who has compassion on you’ (Isaiah 54:10 NIV). 
If you look closer you will see He is standing right there with you – and has been all along!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘…WHILE WE WERE STILL SINNERS, CHRIST DIED FOR US.’</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 5:8 NIV</span><br>The old Bible sat in the bargain basket amongst hundreds of tattered books. A lot of people had picked it up and thumbed through its faded pages. It wasn’t in very good shape – certainly not worth the £2 on the sticker. So it was thrown aside. But then a man picked it up and gasped in shock. He rushed to the counter and paid the puny amount for the old book. It was an original Gutenberg, 500 years old and one of the first books ever printed!  It was worth more than one million pounds! You have to wonder who turned it over to the ‘Last Chance Booksellers.’ The world cast it aside, unaware of its value.
And we do the same thing, don’t we? Seeds of greatness often lie buried within unpromising people that amazingly spring to life when they are watered and nurtured. 
In truth, we were all overlooked until Jesus saw something of value in us. But rather than paying a bargain price He paid the highest price. Listen: ‘…While we were still sinners, Christ died for us’ (Romans 5.8.NIV).
A different world would appear before our eyes if we could begin to see every man, woman, boy and girl as a precious treasure that God could not live without, that Christ died to redeem. Look at Matthew: when Jesus found him he was a dodgy tax collector, a wheeler-dealer working for the Romans. But Jesus said, ‘”Follow Me”’ (Matthew 9:9 NIV). Matthew did and never looked back.  Aren’t you glad that God found you!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘…[LOVE] NEVER LOOKS BACK, BUT KEEPS GOING TO THE END’</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 CORINTHIANS 13:7 TM</span><br>One night in bed a wife says to her husband of 50 years, ‘When we were young you used to hold my hand.’ Slowly, a little irritated, his hand reaches out. ‘And when we were young you used to snuggle up against me.’ A little more slowly his body creaks and turns; nestling against hers. ‘And when we were young you used to nibble on my ear.’ Abruptly the covers are thrown back and he lurches out of bed. ‘Where are you going?’ she asks, a little hurt. ‘To get my teeth,’ he grumbles. When you’re young, free and single it’s hard to imagine all the changes a life-long relationship will bring.  For lots of young people finding the perfect partner becomes an endless quest, filled with heartache.  Well, here’s a tip, instead of working on finding the perfect someone for you, why not work on becoming the perfect you for someone!  All the instructions are in God’s word.
Listen to this, it’s not just for weddings, it’s for the whole of your life: ‘Love never gives up.  Love cares more for others than for self.  Love doesn't want what it doesn't have.  Love doesn't strut, it doesn't have a swelled head, doesn't force itself on others, isn't always ‘me first’, doesn't fly off the handle, doesn't keep score of the sins of others, doesn't revel when others grovel, takes pleasure in the flowering of truth, puts up with anything, trusts God always, always looks for the best, never looks back, but keeps going to the end’.  (1 Cor.13.4-7 TM)

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘YOU WILL GO OUT IN JOY…’</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ISAIAH 55:12 NIV</span><br>Fred and Betty were driving home from church. ‘Fred, did you notice the pastor’s sermon wasn’t up to scratch today?’ Fred replied, ‘No, not really.’ Betty continued, ‘Well, did you notice that the worship was flat?’ He responded, ‘No, I didn’t.’ Undaunted, Betty continued, ‘Well, you must have noticed that young couple and their kids right in front of us, with all the noise and commotion they made, they ruined  the whole service!’ ‘Sorry dear, I didn’t notice’.   In disgust Betty finally puffs, ‘Honestly, Fred, I don’t know why you even bother going to church!’
 Why do some churchgoers think they have a right to act like Simon Cowell?  When
Paul writes, ‘Come out from them and be separate…’ (2 Corinthians 6:17 NIV), he’s saying our faith should make us different, but not negatively different – positively different! Understand this: unless you commit yourself every single day to walking in the joy of the Lord, you will find negative ways of separating yourself from non-believers. Stop and think who you represent. Jesus is called ‘…the Good Shepherd…’ (John 10:11 NIV). ‘Good’ is such an understatement!  His goodness is a powerful attracting force that wins people’s hearts.  Does that describe you? It should! Paul writes, ‘Rejoice in the Lord always…’ (Philippians 4:4 NIV). ‘Easy for Paul to say, he doesn’t have my problems.’ Really? When he wrote those words he was in prison with no chance of getting out! Happiness is an emotion, but joy is a fruit of the Spirit (see Galatians 5.22 NIV). Any time, any where, it is available to you. Every morning you can get up and say, ‘Today I will go out with joy, because God’s Word demands it and a hurting world needs it!’

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...THE JOY OF THE LORD IS YOUR STRENGTH.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>NEHEMIAH 8:10</span><br>True joy only comes to those who have devoted themselves to something bigger than their own happiness and personal interests. Nehemiah told the Israelites, 'Don't feel bad. The joy of the Lord is your strength' (Nehemiah 8:10 TM). True joy always involves three things: 1) a conscious decision to focus every day on God's goodness 2) reaching out to bless other people every chance you get 3) understanding that joy produces strength, which explains why your joy is so high on the devil's hit list. If you lose your joy you lose your strength, and that's no good!

American author Dallas Willard writes: 'to cut off the joys and pleasures associated with our bodily lives and social existence as unspiritual, can have the effect of weakening us in our efforts to do right.' There are basically three kinds of people: 1) the joy-guilty: who believe we are not supposed to be happy, and have fun because life is to be handled seriously. These people feel guilty about feeling good 2) the joy-angry: who've been hurt by life and whose anger simmers just beneath the surface. If you let them, they will turn your sunshine to rain because your joy really bothers them 3) the joy-factory: producing joy everywhere they go. When you are around them, they breathe life into you. If you are joy-guilty or joy-angry try spending a little time with a joy factory. Try to find out how they produce so much joy. You'll probably find it's nothing to do with how easy their life has been, or how much money they have in the bank. More likely they have had a revelation about God that you need to get too.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...HIS PEACE WILL GUARD YOUR HEARTS AND MINDS...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PHILIPPIANS 4:7</span><br>Jesus said, '&quot;Can all your worries add a single moment to your life? Of course not&quot;' (Matthew 6:27 NLT). Worry changes nothing. When was the last time you solved a problem by worrying about it? Imagine somebody saying, 'I got behind on my bills so I decided to worry my way out of debt. And you know, it worked! You can't add one day to your life or one bit of life to your day by worrying; all worry will do is bring you wrinkles and grey hairs!

Listen to these two Scriptures: 'Those who trust in the Lord are like Mount Zion, which cannot be shaken but endures forever' (Psalm 125:1 NIV); 'You will keep in perfect peace him whose mind is steadfast, because he trusts in You' (Isaiah 26:3 NIV). We don't get up in the morning and decide 'Today I'm going to doubt God' yet when we worry that's what we do.

Paul writes, '...His peace will guard your hearts and minds...' Paul uses a military word here - guard. The Philippians lived under Roman occupation and were used to seeing the Centurions guarding their town. What security! Before an enemy could get to them they first had to get past the rock-hard Roman guards. And you know what? God gives you the same guarantee! His peace is not wishy washy - it is solid. Your heart and mind are completely safe if you'll let His peace stand guard. Why don't you ask Him for His peace right now?]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WITH YOU THERE IS FORGIVENESS...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 130:4</span><br>Some people grow through failure; others never recover from it. They talk about the past all the time because they can't get beyond it. What's the answer? See your mistakes as stepping-stones rather than stumbling blocks! 'How do I do that?' By doing three things.

1) You must push! You've got to push through emotions like Regret: 'If only I hadn't failed.' Frustration: 'I thought my idea was great, why didn't they?' Self-pity: 'They hurt me so I will just sit here and lick my wounds.' Paralysis: 'I will never get beyond this.' When it comes to emotions, the only way out is pushing through!

2) You must bounce! Solomon says, 'Though a righteous man falls seven times, he rises again...' (Proverbs 24:16 NIV). You must be like the lady who said, 'I'm never down, I'm either up or I'm getting up!' So, if you fall, will you bounce back up and try again?

3) You must remember! There's only one way - God's way! Samson blew it by getting too close to the wrong woman (see Judges 16). Jonah blew it by trying to run from God's call (see Jonah 1:3). Peter blew it by denying his Lord (See Matthew 26:74) But God used all of them eventually - when they were willing to do it God's way. So remember, don't blow it by thinking your way is better than God's. The Psalmist writes: 'With You there is forgiveness...' God's forgiveness is received by faith - and it involves forgiving yourself! 'But what about my past?' The moment you accept God's forgiveness you don't have a past, you only have a future. You're free to get on with your life!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...HE PRUNES THE BRANCHES THAT DO BEAR FRUIT SO THEY WILL PRODUCE EVEN MORE</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 15:2</span><br>The pruning process!  	04 Nov 2005
'...HE PRUNES THE BRANCHES THAT DO BEAR FRUIT SO THEY WILL PRODUCE EVEN MORE' JOHN 15:2

Listen: 'He cuts off every branch that doesn't bear fruit and he prunes the branches that do bear fruit so they will produce even more' (John 15:2NLT). There's a time for planting and a time for pruning. Maybe God is at work in your life today taking away branches that don't belong, and pruning ones that do. What kind of things does God take away? Things that have served their purpose. Things that refuse to change. Things that will give you trouble later on. Things that are standing in the way of greater fruitfulness. Things that are holding you back. Things He has not chosen for you.

Have you ever seen a freshly pruned tree? Doesn't look too good, does it? And when God starts to cut back certain things in your life in order to re-direct your energies, you won't look too good either. Sometimes this means: a) having less nice stuff for a while b) letting go of things you depended on, c) being unable to explain to your mates why you are even going through the pruning process.

God knows what needs to be cut back in your life; He also knows what needs to be cut off. Trust Him. Even though you can't understand what He's doing, just pray, 'Lord, if I needed it You would let me keep it, so I open my hand to You today. Send whoever You will and take away whoever You will. I'll praise You when they come and I'll praise You when they go, because Your approval is my reward, and Your purpose is my reason to live.']]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...WE ARE LIKE CLAY JARS THAT HOLD THE TREASURE...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 4:7</span><br>If all we ever offer people are one-sided testimonies of success without failure, eventually they'll get fed up. They'll think that while they struggle, we have it all together. That's because we exaggerated our stories and failed to tell the whole truth. God help us! Our message is simple: we were saved by grace, we are being saved by grace, and we will be saved by grace.

It was after David's shameful sin with Bathsheba that God's mercy touched his life and enabled him to write his greatest Psalms; the ones we all find comfort and healing in. It was after Paul had filled jails and graves with believers that he wrote, 'I owe a great debt...' (Romans 1:14 TLB) and then went on to impact the whole world with the Gospel.

Don't quit because someone has discovered you are 'a clay jar'; it's the treasure inside that counts! There will be times in your life when you will need to reach out through your pain... because the message that saves others is the same one that saves us too!

Accepting the rejected is not the weakness of the Gospel; it is its strength! There's a world of difference between a proud heart that says 'I've got it all together' and the cry of a troubled heart that says, 'take my broken life.' One glimpse of God's grace brings all of us to our knees, confessing our sins, and becoming determined to live for him with all our heart, soul, mind and strength... (see Luke]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...BE QUICK TO LISTEN, SLOW TO SPEAK...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JAMES 1:19</span><br>There's no doubt about it, men and women are very different. Men generally tend to be 'fixers'; fix the PC, fix the leaky tap, etc. So it comes as a shock to most blokes when it seems like their wives or girlfriends would rather talk about a situation than fix it. Indeed, just having her fella sit down and actually listen to how she feels often changes her entire outlook. Isn't that right girls!

Has the situation been resolved? Not necessarily. But something important has happened. The guy who used to hang on every word at the start of the relationship has suddenly returned showing that feelings, thoughts and struggles really do matter to him. A fella who learns this sooner rather than later, finds himself with a happy chick! Often our prayers don't seem to change our circumstances, yet we feel much better when we have prayed. Why? Because we have shared it with One Who is able, and cares enough to listen; so we walk away with a changed outlook. Paul writes, 'Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave Himself [His time, His attention, His support, His encouragement, and His life] up for her' (Ephesians 5:25 AMP).

Isn't it amazing how many men can soar in their careers, yet be clueless about their relationships! You lads (you're not too young) whether it's your girlfriend, your sister or your mum the same rule applies! But be warned, the first time you attempt this don't be surprised if a female gets suspicious, looks confused or collapses and has to pick herself up off the floor. Her reaction will be in proportion to the length of time you have been emotionally absent!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE RAVENS BROUGHT HIM BREAD...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 KINGS 17:6</span><br>Don't limit God to only blessing you through people you approve of. That's daft! Nehemiah built the walls of Jerusalem with money provided by a pagan king. God used a raven, a dirty bird, to feed the prophet Elijah. When God moves, people who you would normally shun may become the source of what you need. By avoiding them you could be blocking a blessing God has in mind for you. Your tendency to alienate certain people can cause your life to get stuck like a scratched CD. You can't escape difficult people but with God's help you can be positive in the middle of negativity.

David had the ability to work effectively with difficult people. It doesn't get much more challenging than working with someone who has an 'evil spirit' troubling them like King Saul did. At first David enjoyed Saul's favour, but later Saul tried to kill him. Yet David never changed his strategy. He would never diss Saul or his family because for better or worse he respected God's decision to make Saul King. And because of the amazing character and wisdom with which he handled the situation, he ended up becoming the next King!

God's principles are timeless and David followed them daily. David didn't limit himself and he definitely didn't limit God. By getting his eyes off people, being neither impressed nor depressed by them, David made sure God always had priority. And many times God used unlikely people to bless David. So, learn to get along with difficult people; your greatest challenge today may be the very person who assists and blesses you tomorrow.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>A FRIEND LOVES AT ALL TIMES...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 17:17 NIV</span><br>If you fall, not everybody will cheer you on when you get back up. In one of Jesus' stories, the older brother wasn't too happy when the Lost Son came back home. And there are still lots of people like that around. Basically there are three kinds of people:

1) the users. These people will suck up to you but only for what they can get from you. When trouble hits your life, you won't see them for dust because they don't want to be linked with your mistakes. Don't be resentful toward them; users aren't bad, they're just insecure and self-serving

2) the cautious. There are loads of these dudes around. When you're in trouble they'll wait to see if you get out of it. And even then they'll keep their options open. Before they decide to accept you they'll first check to see who else does. Paul says, '...appreciate those who work hard among you...' (1Thessalonians 5:12 NCV). When it comes to the cautious, love them but don't build your life on them

3) the devoted. These are the people Solomon talks about in Proverbs 17:17: 'A friend loves you all times, and a brother helps in time of trouble' (NCV). There's an old saying that says, 'In the good times our friends know us, in the bad times we know our friends.' If you have even a handful of devoted friends you are truly blessed, 'coz they'll stand by you at all times. They're not just strong in faith, they're strong in fight. They help in times of trouble.' Look after these friendships, invest in them, 'coz without them you'll struggle to reach your God-given destiny.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>CREATE IN ME A PURE HEART, O GOD...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALMS 51:10 NCV</span><br>Even though David was a man of courage, strength and creativity, he constantly struggled with a weakness in his life. What was it? He liked the ladies! Not just the single girls...he went after married ones too. God loved David, but He didn't love his sin - not one bit. He saw what David got up to with another man's wife and waited... He even watched as David sent the woman's husband off to the front line of a battle, where he died... and still God waited.

'Why did God wait?' He wanted to give David a chance to confess what he had done wrong and ask God for forgiveness. In the end a prophet bloke called Nathan was sent by God to David to let him know that God had seen it all and wasn't happy! David responded to God, 'Have mercy on me...cleanse me from my sin...create in me a pure heart, O God' (Psalm 52:1-10 NIV). When God sees real repentance, He comes and totally takes our sin and removes it from us...not only that, He chooses to treat us like it never happened. We all have weaknesses we struggle with, but we have something called, 'self-control' which helps us to not do it. If you know you need to get right with God, say now 'God I have sinned against You and hurt myself and our relationship. Please forgive me, and make me clean. Please help me to choose to say, 'no' when I am tempted. Thank you that You love me'.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>BLESSED IS THE MAN WHO PERSEVERES [THROUGH] THE TEST [FOR] HE WILL RECEIVE THE CROWN...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JAMES 1:12 NIV</span><br>Are you thinking about quitting? Life's full of quitting points! But if you throw in the towel on your studies, your friends, your hopes or your dreams, you might regret it for the rest of your life. Only by staying in the race can God strengthen you and make you a winner. About 100 years ago a Christian preacher and activist called Fred Meyer said, 'You never test the resources of God until you attempt the impossible.' Quitting doesn't build character, endurance does. It develops something in you that nothing else can; that's why God says it is 'blessed.' It sustains courage, gives staying power to discipline and turns dreams into reality.

Nobody knew more about endurance than Jesus. He endured all the way to the cross; when they ripped the hair from His face, when the whip tore His flesh, when they nailed Him to a cross, when His friends abandoned Him, when the crowd mocked Him, when God Himself turned His face away, and hell rose up and cried, 'Quit!' But no! Listen, Jesus: '...for the joy that was set before him endured the cross...' (Hebrews 12:2 NIV).

Remember, '...God...rewards those who earnestly seek Him' (Hebrews 11:6 NIV). The Bible says you will find Him '...when you seek...with all your heart' (Jeremiah 29:13 NIV). Those promises apply to you! Test them! Tell God, 'I'm gonna keep going and trusting You for the strength to get through.' Chances are when you do you'll see God step in like a coach and say, 'Come on, you can do it; just focus on me and the finish line.']]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>PEOPLES' THOUGHTS CAN BE LIKE A DEEP WELL, BUT SOMEONE WITH UNDERSTANDING CAN FIND WISDOM THERE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 20:5 NCV</span><br>Being made in God's image gives us amazing potential. But sometimes it takes someone who is clued up to recognise it and 'draw it out.' Too many of us are good at seeing the obvious. We're quick to label people as arrogant, bad-tempered, or weak. But a person with spiritual understanding sees beyond that to the hopes and fears behind their behaviour.

The people who knew Simon knew his tendency put his foot in his mouth and be impulsive. But Jesus saw something else. That's why He renamed him Peter, meaning a rock suitable for a foundation. Just imagine the look on the disciples' faces when Jesus said, '...you are Peter...upon this rock I will build my church, and...hell will not conquer it' (Matthew 16:18 NLT). But Peter did become a rock, a respected leader and a founder of the church. And all because of Jesus' ability and willingness to look beyond his character flaws to what was inside.

Today we need more people who'll pray for this generation, look beyond their flaws and 'draw out' their qualities. Set yourself a challenge to look for the hidden amazing qualities in your mates, even when they let you down.  Next time you're around your family, don't just start teasing, moaning or picking out faults - make a choice to shut up, open your eyes, and look for their great qualities! Remember, God made them too: you diss them; you diss Him. Ask God today for eyes to see what others miss.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>GO HOME...AND TELL THEM HOW MUCH THE LORD HAS DONE FOR YOU...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MARK 5:19 CEV</span><br>Have you ever been in a church event that was so great you were gutted when it finished? Or visited a place so beautiful, you just wanted to stay there forever? Now and again, God focuses on strengthening us in our spirits, so we can do the next task and this strength effects our emotions and bodies too. But there comes a time when He says to us what He said to the man with the unclean spirit, 'Go home...and tell them how much the Lord has done for you...'

Notice, when Jesus healed this man the Bible says, '...people came out to see what had happened' (v.14 CEV). And when God changes you, your family, your mates and your neighbours are all gonna notice it too. So don't be shy about telling them what God's done for you. Be tactful, but be bold and be happy about it!

This tormented man's first response to being set free was to jump into the boat and go with Jesus. But Jesus stopped him. Why? Because his purpose wasn't in the graveyard where Jesus found him, or travelling with the 12 disciples. No, it was to be a 'mad-for-it' evangelist! And when he '...went [home]...and began telling...how much Jesus had done... Everyone who heard...was amazed' (v.20 CEV). God doesn't want you to live cut off from the rest of the world; He wants you to tell those you know and love what He can do in their lives too. So, today if you ask Him where He wants you to go, chances are He'll say, 'Go home.'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>LEAVE NO...FOOTHOLD FOR THE DEVIL...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 4:27 AMP</span><br>Ever notice that Jesus didn't waste a load of time talking about what the devil was doing? Instead He dealt with him by quoting God's Word and kicking him out of people's lives. In Mark chapter five, the man living among the tombs was tormented by evil spirits. When Jesus confronted them, the Bible says the evil spirits begged him 'not to send them out of the area' (v.10 NIV). Why? Because they didn't want to quit their position or give up their assigned turf. When they realized that Jesus was determined to get them out of the man, they pleaded with Him to let them at least stay in the same area. When Jesus gave them permission to enter into a herd of pigs that were nearby, the pigs immediately '...rushed...into the lake and were drowned' (Mark 5:13 NIV). There's a lesson here: satan will object to your freedom, but he'll get really, really annoyed about being kicked out of every area of your life. How can you really annoy the devil? Easy, fill your new life with God! Fill yourself to bursting with the Word of God and ask the Holy Spirit to fill you to the max so that you will have the self control to not go back to your old ways and I bet you'll be amazed!

Your immediate response to any suggested compromise by the enemy must always be a resounding, 'No! Not an inch!' Then pray, asking God to protect your heart and mind as you have a God-filled day!

<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...THE TRUTH WILL SET YOU FREE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 8:32 NLT</span><br>A lie is as effective as the truth - if you believe it. And satan is 'the father of lies.' Here are three ways he tries to crush you:

1) feelings. Through lying words he'll convince you that you don't deserve to be forgiven; through lying emotions he'll try to make you feel like you're not forgiven. Here's where victory is decided. Stand your ground. The work is done in you. God's Word says so; now you must begin to say so too. Chose God's word instead of the lie. Satan will remind you of all your past mistakes and failures. By having to deal with them you will experience the same emotions you had when you went through them before. He plans it that way. The idea is to make you feel like nothing has changed - what a liar!

2) shock. Satan doesn't give up without a fight (attack is just proof that you haven't been conquered). If you're not expecting it, you'll think, 'nothing has changed, or why would I still be fighting the same old battles?' 

3) doubt. Satan's third strategy is to get you to give up and say, 'What's the use, nothing's changed!' When you speak like that you are signing the delivery note and accepting the package. Don't do it! The Bible says, 'You might get trapped by what you say...' (Proverbs 6:2 NCV). Stop. Think before you speak. Don't agree with the one who only wants bad for you. Agree with the one who knows you better than you know yourself and is totally mad about you!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WHEN HE SAW JESUS...HE...WORSHIPPED HIM.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MARK 5:6 KJV</span><br>What is worship? Worship is our response to God's love for us. We can express our worship through songs, music, dancing, even helping people. When you experience God in any way, you get a massive desire to make some sort of expression. You kinda wanna point and say, 'Look everyone, look how much God cares for me!' Paul says, 'At the name of Jesus every knee should bow...in heaven, and...on earth...and... confess that Jesus...is Lord...' (Philippians 2:10-11 NKJ). Worship is powerful. Next time you have a rough day, make the choice to acknowledge God. When you start to thank God in the hard times, it busts up anything the devil was trying to do. The Bible says, '...no weapon used against you will defeat you...these are the good things my servants receive...' (Isaiah 54:17 NCV). That includes anything that would try to destroy you and your family; old hurts, painful memories, addictions, past sins, they must all bow in submission when the Name of Jesus is lifted up in praise.

In the New Testament, when the man from the tombs began to worship, the forces of evil cried out, '...what business do we have with each other...Jesus...Son of the Most High God?...' (Mark 5:7 NAS). The truth is satan's cronies have nothing in common with Jesus - no association and no relationship. And the only business He has with them is to get rid of them! David said, '...my head is lifted...above my enemies all around me...I will sing and make melody to the Lord' (Psalm 27:6 NRS). Worship is one of the keys to not getting down about life. So talk to Jesus today, acknowledge that He is King, and watch your worship work!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...HE WAS IN THE...TOMBS, CRYING OUT</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MARK 5:5 NKJ</span><br>Discussing his low self-esteem, cartoon character Charlie Brown says, 'It goes back to when I first set foot on the stage of life. They looked at me and said, &quot;He's just not right for the part!&quot;' You might smile, but when you have spent your whole life putting yourself down you, know exactly what he means. The man in the tombs spent his days, 'crying out' because he thought he was worthless. And many of us have a similar view of ourselves, we think we have no value.

Your self-image is second only to your faith in God. It doesn't matter what others think of you, what matters is what you think of yourself; based on what God thinks! Self-esteem has to come from yourself. That's why it's hard to believe the good things people say about you when you can't see them yourself. Plus, how you treat other people flows directly from your pool of personal dignity and self-respect. It's impossible to '...love your neighbour as yourself' (Matthew 19:19 NIV) when you don't even like yourself. But God is in the business of building up His children.  He will reveal how valuable you are, not only in big ways, but in the small things too!

One of the only times we're ok about bigging ourselves up is on application forms! Stop putting yourself down! God made you the way you are in order to use you the way He planned. Start telling Him what a great job He did. And remember, He loves you unconditionally - and that's the only reason you need for loving yourself!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...HE WAS IN THE...TOMBS, CRYING OUT</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MARK 5:5 NKJ</span><br>Jesus didn't cross the Sea of Galilee in a storm just to meet with a disturbed man. There were plenty of those on shore! He did it because, although this man seemed so fierce and tough on the outside, it was from deep inside that 'he was... crying out.' He hated who he'd become and the situation he was in. How about you? Are you crying on the inside because of how your life has turned out?  Maybe you intended to be a better friend, a more focused student, an honest worker or a kinder person, but things didn't work out the way you planned and now you are in a mess. 

Jesus said, 'Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be filled' (Matthew 5:6 NIV). Wanting to change is the first step! Thank God Jesus never said, 'Blessed are those who are good enough already,' or we'd be in big trouble! No, He was talking to those who want to do the right thing; who still believe they can, even if they're not right now; those who want to do better.

Remember, it's not what you've done that makes you a candidate for God's forgiveness, it's how you feel about what you've done.  God will never have a go at you for asking for His help. In fact, change begins with a desire and a willingness to challenge your problem. So what's in your heart today? What do you want to change about yourself and your life? Get some space. Ask God for help. He'll respond with love and forgiveness. He won't disappoint you!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...THE HOLY SPIRIT WHOM MY FATHER WILL SEND...WILL TEACH YOU ALL THINGS...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 14:26 NIV</span><br>You can either live by what your feelings tell you and what your circumstances say, or you can live by what the Spirit of God says. Have you noticed how music can influence your mood? A really mellow track can chill you out, some tunes make you feel happy, others totally depressed.  If music can have such a powerful effect on you, just think what other things you listen to can do.  If you listen to all those negative opinions about all your worries and fears, your mood, choices and reactions will be influenced by them.  But if you listen to what the Spirit of God says about you, He'll not only influence your emotions but give you wisdom to tackle a tough situation. He'll also give you peace that will keep you calm in circumstances that are out of your control!

You might be saying to yourself, 'Yeah, that's all good in theory, but I've never even heard of the Holy Spirit'. Listen: '...no one knows the thoughts of God, except the Spirit of God' (1Corinthians 2:11 NIV). If you wanna know what's on God's mind, ask God for this most precious gift to fill your heart today (see Acts 1:4 NIV). Jesus calls the Holy Spirit our 'helper'.

Jesus said, '...The Holy Spirit...whom my father will send...will teach you all things...' (John 14:26 NIV). A life that is directed by the Spirit of God, will be a life in line with the will of God. Go on, ask Him and live by the Spirit!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>F WE SAY WE HAVE NO SIN, WE ARE FOOLING OURSELVES...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 JOHN 1:8 KJV</span><br>How many times have you said, 'Nobody understands me', or felt that you are totally misunderstood by those around you? If you look at Jesus and the people he hung out with, they were the ones society had no time for and had given up on. Jesus made time to listen, live and heal the hurting. The devil does the opposite. He'll do whatever it takes to convince you that there is no hope. Without a support system he knows he can get the better of you. He'll try to convince you, 'you're not like those people; you're better.' Or 'your situation's unique because of your background; others can't relate because they've never had it this bad.' The problem with thinking you are different from everybody else is - you start to think that the bad stuff you do is ok! Jesus loved people but He never said that the bad stuff they had done or were doing was ok.

The Bible says, 'If we say we have no sin, we are fooling ourselves.' By hardening your attitude and whipping out the old 'yeah but...' card, eventually you become disconnected from the truth. And that's dangerous, especially when you stop listening to those who are willing to speak truth to you and have your best interests at heart. When self pity starts to get the better of you, ask God to help you keep focus. Stay connected no matter what, try to hang out with people who love you but are truthful.  These friendships are God's gift to you. Enjoy!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...I WILL NOT LET YOU GO UNLESS YOU BLESS ME.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 32:26 NIV</span><br>Jacob's life was a bit like a soap opera.  Family bust-ups, lying, cheating, death threats, marrying the wrong sister...the usual soap storyline.  Even Jacob's name set him off to a bad start...if you call your son, 'deceiver', what do you expect? 

But one night Jacob got jumped... the bloke was big and really strong. Jacob fought for his life but this guy wouldn't give up. For hours they wrestled and then it began to dawn on Jacob, 'If this bloke had wanted to, he could have killed me by now...maybe he's not an assassin...hang on, maybe this is a God thing!'  All of a sudden, the fight changes. Jacob isn't fighting to get away anymore; he's fighting to get a better grip and hold on.  Jacob got tenacious! Tenacious means to cling tightly to something, to not give up, to not let go! Jacob was so tenacious that the guy he was wrestling with that the tables turned and the guy said, 'Let me go'. Jacob realised that this was no ordinary man and said, '...I will not let you go unless you bless me.' (Genesis 32:26 NIV) Because Jacob held onto God, and wouldn't let Him go, (even though it was hard work), God blessed him, and changed his name and future. You might think you're being attacked, but maybe God has grabbed hold of you, 'coz He wants to change your identity...?  Don't run; grab on and be tenacious!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>YOU WILL BE MADE RICH IN EVERY WAY SO THAT YOU CAN BE GENEROUS ON EVERY OCCASION...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 9:11 NIV</span><br>Here we go with day two on giving: Why is God interested in money - there's nothing he needs to buy? You're not likely to find yourself behind Him in the queue at your local ASDA stocking up on Angel Cake and Holy Water! 

God cares not for His own needs but for ours, if we'll let Him. But He's very careful that we don't become greedy - in fact greed is mentioned in the Bible as something God can't stand. So as long as you'll devote yourself to God He'll make sure you get everything you need, when you need it. That's His offer. 

Don't be afraid to give.  God isn't a money grabber, out to line his own pockets. When He talks about giving, He asks for our whole lives...bet that tenner feels a lot easier to let go of now?  Watch out though that giving money doesn't become an easy option for you though, it's much harder to spend your time personally serving the soup to the homeless on a cold, wet night than just donating a few quid to pay for the soup. 

Don't give 'coz you feel bad, give because you're inspired to love others, because of the love God shows you every day.  Take your Heavenly Father's example - He didn't give Jesus because He was on a guilt trip - He gave Him out of love.  Believe me, God doesn't need your guilt or your money... but He will take and use your seed no matter how small. He'll multiply it and produce something that has the ability to touch thousands.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...THE ONE WHO PLANTS GENEROUSLY WILL GET A GENEROUS CROP.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 9:6 NLT</span><br>Listen: 'Now He who supplies seed to the sower...will also supply and increase your store of seed...You will be made rich in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion...' (2 Corinthians 9:10-11 NIV). The Bible often uses the illustration of 'sowing' and 'reaping' to show there's a direct link between giving and receiving. If you give generously, then God will make sure you have more, to give again. This isn't about money, but about a lifestyle of trusting God for everything.  Paul isn't talking about people who are trying to get rich; he's simply saying God wants people who are willing to give to others what is valuable to them. He's saying, 'It's not only safe to obey Me, it's safe to trust that I will look after you!' It's true, you can't out-give God.  It can be hard to give something away, especially when you don't have much in the first place.  Paul explains that giving to God is like giving to someone who takes the gift, makes it better and gives it back.  The farmer who sows doesn't lose his seed, he gains a harvest. Can you imagine a farmer praying, 'God, give me a crop? I'm not ready to sow any seed yet, but I'm trusting You to do something: but just in case, I'll keep a tight fist on my seed.' Are you doing that?

News flash!  When we stop grabbing and start giving, God gets involved and starts doing some multiplying. We add and the God of the universe multiplies! You'll be amazed how God keeps His word.  It's God's plan for us to be generous!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I HAVE SEEN GOD FACE TO FACE, AND...MY LIFE WAS SPARED.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 32:30 NIV</span><br>Do you realize that without God's hand on your life you wouldn't be here today? David said He 'protects us from death...' (Psalm 103:4 CEV). How cool is that?  There must be so many accidents, illnesses or dangerous situations we have avoided or escaped because God has got our backs!  The truth is, your mates (and some of your enemies) did not think you would make it this far. But God reached down, rescued you and put you in a good place (see Psalm 18:19 NIV).

In the Bible, a guy called Jacob wrestles with God; afterwards, Jacob said, '...I have seen God face to face, and...my life is preserved.' And so is yours. Why? Listen: the Bible says, '...God...with a word, makes something out of nothing' (Romans 4:17 TM). God wants to give you things in life, good things that weren't there before.

Check this: 'Jacob was left alone...' (Genesis 32:24 KJV). When God deals with you on important issues He does it 1-2-1, not as part of the crowd. In fact being in a crowd can stop you from hearing His voice.  Being alone with God can feel threatening because your camouflage and ego are stripped away. Your first reaction may be to stay with the crowd, but you soon discover that they can't do what time alone with God can.  God wants to hang out with you! So, like Jacob, don't be afraid to get in God's face for a while. When you do, you'll experience His love, and discover His purpose for your life.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...GOD CALLED TO ADAM, 'WHY ARE YOU HIDING?</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 3:9 TLB</span><br>When you don't feel good about who you are as a person you will use clothes, food, relationships, money and humour to build a wall to keep people from getting too close. Lasting relationships are only built when you stop hiding and are willing to let people see the real you. Another alternative is to focus on others by asking, 'How come she got that new MP3 player and I didn't?' Or, 'Why did he get the girl and not me?' That kind of thinking just makes you bitter and totally miserable.

Being fake with others is bad, but being fake with God is worse. In the Garden of Eden,

God asked Adam, 'Why are you hiding?' But He already knew the answer. Nothing and nobody can hide from Him! God wanted Adam to admit where he was and what he'd done. Why? Because until you face the truth about yourself, tell Him and ask for God's forgiveness you will: a) find it hard to talk to God b) feel lonely and rubbish about yourself c) find it hard to be honest with people; afraid they'll see your mistakes.

If you're hiding the real you, ask God to give you the guts to show your true self. Start by praying, 'Father, I know You love me. Nothing can change that, and I'm sorry I doubt that You care for me. You loved me before I was born, made me with a good plan in mind, changed me and gave me a special purpose in the world, and You are working day by day to make me even more pleasing to You' (see Philippians 2:13 NIV).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...IN THE NAME OF JESUS...RISE UP AND WALK. AND HE TOOK HIM BY THE...HAND, AND LIFTED HIM UP.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ACTS 3:6-7 KJV</span><br>Peter spoke to the lame man using a Name that was bigger than his problem, the Name of Jesus. That's because He's the One who has the legal right to heal us in the areas where we hurt most. Peter moved in faith, reached out, took the man's hand and lifted him up. When he did the Bible says, '...[the man's] feet and ankles became strong. He jumped [up]...' (Acts 3:7-8 NIV). He already knew how to walk, he just needed help getting on his feet.

Today you are surrounded by people who need help to get back up spiritually, emotionally, physically and financially. So what are you going to do? Your hand reaching out in compassion and faith can lift them. They don't need you to spend the rest of your life supporting them, they just need a hand up - and an introduction to the One Who is able, willing and waiting to meet their need.

Paul said, 'At the name of Jesus every knee should bow...every tongue should confess that Jesus...is Lord...' (Philippians 2:10-11 KJV). What's in a name? In this case - everything! At the name of Jesus hell trembles, habits break, sickness retreats and life-long problems are solved. And one more thought: if you're the one needing to be helped to your feet, don't look to the person who's lifting you, look to Jesus! Leave the how, when, and where to Him. Focus on Jesus - He won't let you down.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...NOW IS THE...DAY TO BE HELPED.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 6:2 TM</span><br>Same old thing; every day the crippled man '...was set down at the Temple gate...named Beautiful...' (Acts 3:2 TM). When you've got a problem, even if you are in a beautiful environment you can't enjoy it. This man was so close to the answer, but because he couldn't enter the temple, it seemed totally out of his reach. Is that where you're at? You can see the light, but the tunnel is just too long!  You feel like you've lost your hope.  Sometimes it's like you're an outsider looking in on a party.  Everyone knows each other, but you feel like you're invisible! 

The Bible doesn't tell us how long the lame man had been sitting there, but he'd no reason to think that today would be any different from yesterday. He didn't wake up that morning saying, 'Today two blokes are gonna come along with the power of  God to heal me!'  But that's what happened.  This is your day!  God has got a life-changing, soul-cleansing, health-restoring, relationship-renewing experience for you today. God doesn't just fix us.  He makes us new.  We just have to say, 'God I need you today'.  You are not invisible to him.  He knows you well, '...You created my inmost being...' (Psalm 139:13 NIV).

If He created you, then trust that He can heal you!  Today stop for a moment and make a choice to trust.  Trust that the tunnel has an end, and that He will take you through it.  Trust that if your hope is in God, you'll not be disappointed.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...A MAN CRIPPLED FROM BIRTH...WAS SET...AT THE TEMPLE GATE...TO BEG...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ACTS 3:2 TM</span><br>You can learn a lot from the crippled man at the temple gate:

1) a weakness in one area can cripple you in others - like a habit you can't break, always checking out the opposite sex, a bad temper or always being down on others. Apart from lacking strength in his ankles this man was normal, but one weakness stopped him from living his life. We all struggle with something. '...the temptations that come into your life are no different from what others experience...' (1 Corinthians 10:13 NLT). That's why James writes, '...pray for each other so God can heal you...' (James 5:16 NCV). So, how are you handling your weakness? Through denial? By feeling sorry for yourself? By ignoring the problem, hoping it will go away? This man was 'at the temple gate to beg' - why are you there? We all know our own faults, but we don't have to be held prisoner by them.  Don't settle; choose: 'This may be who I am now, but it's not who I'm going to be!'

2) what are you looking for? A crutch to help you live with your problem? Don't avoid the only person that can make you better! The guy at the gate had got so used to being ignored that he wasn't even expecting a glance, let alone a solution to his problem.  God doesn't just see your pain; He offers you a helping hand and more: '...what I have I give you...' (Acts 3:6 NIV). Wow! When your interest in others is limited to what they can do for you, it causes you to miss what God can do for you. This man ended up walking, leaping, and praising God because that day he experienced God's power - you can too!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WE ARE...THE FRAGRANCE OF CHRIST...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 2:15 NKJ</span><br>In ancient times when the Roman army won a great victory, they paraded their defeated enemies through the streets in chains. As part of the celebrations they burned incense on altars throughout the city, filling the air with perfume. That way those who couldn't see the procession knew the army had triumphed because they heard the music and smelled the incense. The scent became symbolic of victory. Are you getting the idea?

Paul says, 'Thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumphal procession in Christ and through us spreads everywhere the fragrance of the knowledge of him' (2 Corinthians 2:14 NIV). Forget Ralph Lauren and Chanel No.5! Your life should be so consumed by God's presence that people around you can pick up the scent of it. After all, you are the most convincing evidence there is that Jesus is alive and well!

All over this country there are elegant churches and cathedrals with amazing stained-glass windows which often show important events from the life of Jesus. That's cool. But the truth is, God doesn't need church windows to tell His story; He's looking for tuned-in Christians to do that! 

It's been said that the longer a husband and wife live together the more they start to look, act and talk alike. And it is the same with us. The more time we spend thinking about Jesus, talking to Him, reading His Word and basking in His presence, the more people are going to want to know, 'What's different about you?'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...GOD TURNED INTO GOOD WHAT YOU MEANT FOR EVIL...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 50:20 NLT</span><br>Joseph had to go through the pit and the prison to get to the palace. Let's see what we can learn from him:

1) when it's hard, hold on!  When you're misunderstood or having a hard time,

complaining doesn't do any good. You're not learning while you're complaining. In every experience there's a lesson. Learn it and grow stronger. When life gives you a slap, know that it will only sting for a moment!

2) Self-Promotion of yourself is never as good as a God-Promotion. Each time Joseph tried to promote himself it worked against him. Joseph learned the hard way that success comes from God and that we must give Him credit for it. Whether you're a star or the poorest of the poor, God deserves your credit

3) when your dream comes true, it may be different than you imagined. As a boy Joseph dreamed only of power for his own gain. But God had something bigger in mind...set apart to save a nation. If your dream is something you thought up, don't expect God to get involved in it. What He has in mind will exceed your expectations, benefit others and promote His kingdom - not yours. Pray this prayer: 'Lord, help me to see these difficulties as stepping stones to maturity and character. Give me the patience to wait until You open the door. True promotion comes from You. Help me to remember that I'm blessed for one reason - to be a blessing to others. Amen.']]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WHEN JESUS...KNEW HOW LONG HE HAD BEEN THERE, HE SAID, 'DO YOU WANT TO GET WELL?</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 5:6 TM</span><br>When you've been hurt, you can choose to remain a victim by dwelling on how things should have been, or use the experience to grow wiser. The paralysed man at the pool had been there for 38 years. When Jesus found out how long he'd been there He asked, 'Do you want to get well?' A bit of a harsh question, but Jesus knew that. It was time for him to stop seeing his disability as part of his identity. Because he'd been that way for so long he thought like a victim. Listen: '...I don't have anybody to put me in the pool...' (v.7 TM). Translation? 'Nobody really cares.' When Jesus commanded him to get up, He knew it would take real courage for the man to overcome his feelings of hopelessness and self-pity. But when the man obeyed, he was healed on the spot. God never forces healing on you, even if you are hurting. No, you must want to get well and make a conscious decision to believe you can. Getting hurt is inevitable; living like a victim is a choice. 

There will always be people who speak without thinking and hurt others. Listen, you don't have to let your bad experiences of others dominate your thoughts and influence your future relationships and life experiences. Understand this: it takes the same energy to choose healing as it does bitterness - but the results are very different! One leaves you paralysed by the past, the other gives you hope for the future. Choose!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...MY GRACE IS...ALL YOU NEED...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 12:9 TM</span><br>Are you finding it hard to get over the way someone has treated you in the past?  Have you been misunderstood, or neglected when you really should have been taken care of and protected? Most people who've been hurt in life could easily convince a jury it should never have happened. And it shouldn't! But it did - reliving it won't change it! Think: if you were in a car crash and taken to hospital you wouldn't spend all your time obsessing about the driver who crashed into you, would you? No, your main concern would be recovering as fast as possible! Isn't it weird that with physical wounds we ask for help straight away, but with emotional ones we tend to focus on the problem instead of the solution, we try to hide the problem and sort it out ourselves.

During the American Civil War General Robert E Lee once visited a house in Kentucky where a very bitter woman showed him the remains of a magnificent tree the Union artillery had destroyed. She expected Lee to sympathize with her and condemn the Yankees. But instead he quietly replied, 'Cut it down, dear lady, and forget it.' Her bitterness could not change that tree, but the tree could change her, and not for the better. Paul says he begged God to take away his pain until, 'He told me, &quot;My grace is enough; it's all you need&quot;...Once I heard that...I quit focusing on the handicap...' (2 Corinthians 12:9 TM). 

How do you stop focusing on your hurt? Tell God about it, let it go and He will deal with it.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...I KNOW THE PLANS I HAVE FOR YOU...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JEREMIAH 29:11 NIV</span><br>Sometimes it can feel like everyone around you has a boyfriend or girlfriend, except for you. God does want us to have good friendships, but so often we start to go out with someone for totally the wrong reasons.  Often because we're insecure, we look to the wrong people for our security.  Sometimes we start going out with someone just because we think we won't be popular if we're single.  None of these are good starting points for relationships.  God wants us firstly to have our security totally grounded in Him.  It's important to know that we are totally accepted and loved by God; actually it's important to not just know it but believe it too!  

God doesn't love you just because it's His job to.  He loves you because He created you.  He took time over you - you are not a mistake but you were made with a purpose and have value.

God's best for you is not a string of failed relationships.  You're not a jacket that is tried on by lots of different people to see if you fit and then sent to a charity shop when the fashion changes.  It sucks when people treat each other that way.  

God is patient with us even when we're having a bad day. He doesn't dump us like someone who can't be bothered anymore.  He is the best mate you will ever have. So before you hook up with someone, ask yourself 'Why am I starting this relationship and will it take me down a good road?'  If you know it's not gonna have a happy ending, trust that God has the best person for you if you just chill out and wait.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…KNOW THE TRUTH...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 8:32 NIV</span><br>Whether you believe in God right now or not, you could be facing a tough situation, one you feel is out of your control and has made you afraid and worried. While everybody around you is moving on with life you feel paralysed. You know inside that you have got what it takes to beat this, but you feel like you’re alone. What’s going on? Well, If you’re just getting on with life without chatting to God and getting His opinion on stuff, you’ll hit a brick wall sooner or later.  
Do you feel bored? Nothing excites you anymore. One day feels like the next until gradually you start believing nothing will ever change. It doesn’t matter whether you live in a shack or a mansion; unless you are free in your spirit it’s like being in prison.
Jesus said, '...know the truth and the truth shall set you free' (John 8:32).  You need a daily dose of the truth!  Truth is not just a concept; it’s a person.  ‘I am the way, the truth and the life…’ (John 14:6 NIV). Jesus is the answer to every question, every fear and every worry.  And the amazing thing is He wants to chat to you today.  All you need to do is ask him to come into your heart and become number one in your life. You’ll be amazed how much your life begins to change from then on!  If you feel paralysed today, you will find your answer in Jesus. He gives life buzz, freedom and purpose. So, refuse to live another day in a paralysed, out-of-control, fearful state. Last tip: If you pack your day with truth, there’ll be no more room for lies!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...STOP ALLOWING YOURSELVES TO BE...UNSETTLED.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 14:27 AMP</span><br>Some kids at summer camp were chatting about creation. One asked, 'If everything has a purpose, how come God made poison ivy?' Another replied, 'Because He knows there are some things we should keep our hands off!' Keeping your hands off certain things isn't easy, especially when you're involved or it's a friend. 'But sometimes my mates do my head in.' Maybe you wind them up too! No friendship is ever perfect! God says, 'Friends love through all kinds of weather, and families stick together in all kinds of trouble' (Proverbs 17:17 TM). You need to be patient with others coz others are patient with you.
Jesus said, '...stop allowing yourselves to be…unsettled' (John 14:27 AMP). You're doing it to yourself! Learn to 'let go' and work on developing the fruits of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23). That'll keep you busy! Letting go doesn't mean you don't care, it just means allowing others to learn from their mistakes. It means focusing on Jesus instead of obsessing over the other person. The Prophet Isaiah says, 'You will keep in perfect peace all those whose thoughts are fixed on You' (Isaiah 26:3 NLT). Letting go means caring but not obsessing. It means stepping out of the middle and not trying to influence the outcome by judging, whispering, nagging, arguing, criticizing and fixing. It's about facing each day with God's help and living it to the max! Realise the only person you can change for good is you! Fear less and trust more. Accept that '...amid all these things we are more than conquerors…through Him...' (Romans 8:37 AMP).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>AS IRON SHARPENS IRON, SO ONE MAN SHARPENS ANOTHER.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 27:17 NIV</span><br>How do you handle correction? By taking offence? By hearing it as rejection? By getting defensive? All of us need people who'll be honest with us because we're easily blinded by our egos. When God sends somebody to correct you it is because He loves you. He only does that to those He values. Listen: 'If you are not disciplined...then you are illegitimate children and not true sons' (Hebrews 12:8 NIV). 
So, how do you handle correction? By killing the messenger? By making sure he or she never speaks to you again? By keeping score and saying, 'Look what I've accomplished; what have you done?' By giving in to self-pity and saying, 'People don't understand or appreciate me?' God does put people around us who we can trust to be honest with us, even if it's to tell us we’re out of order.
Accountable people always exhibit four qualities: 1) vulnerability. They're capable of knowing when they're wrong and admitting it – even before they're confronted 2) teachability. They're willing to hear, quick to learn and always open to advice 3) availability. They're approachable. They don't avoid you 4) honesty. They hate anything fake and are committed to the truth regardless of how much it hurts. 'That's a high standard,' you say. You're right. It's a standard pride can't handle and fragile egos freak out at. There's something in everyone that would rather look good than be good. So when God sends people into your life who love you enough to tell you the truth – go with it!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...NO GOOD THING WILL HE WITHHOLD FROM THEM THAT WALK UPRIGHTLY.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 84:11 KJV</span><br>If it was a good thing God would not have said 'no'. Either the timing is wrong or He has something better for you. Gratitude comes when you realize what could've happened didn't happen because God stepped in.  We can get so used to fighting that we forget that God has promised to protect us, even from ourselves. 
David wrote, 'The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want' (Psalm 23:1 NAS). A shepherd leads, feeds and protects. What a picture; God watching over you 24-7! Like a lifeguard at the beach who spots a dangerous situation God will interrupt everyone's fun, risk embarrassing you in front of your friends and maybe even bruise a rib or two. That's because He loves you too much to let you drown in the thing you think is so good for you.
Preacherman Billy Graham's wife is called Ruth, she says, 'If God had said yes to all my prayer requests I'd have married the wrong man – several times.' Listen: 'Commit your way to the Lord; trust in him; and he will do this...' (Psalm 37:5 NIV). What you're bitter about today you'll thank your Heavenly Father for tomorrow. The author Mark Twain said that when he was 14 his father was so ignorant he could hardly stand him. But by the time he was 21 he was amazed how much the old man had learned in seven years. Hello! The more mature you become the more you'll begin to see how loving and wise your Heavenly Father is, and the more you’ll trust Him.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...IF ANYTHING IS EXCELLENT OR PRAISEWORTHY – THINK ABOUT SUCH THINGS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PHILIPPIANS 4:8 NIV</span><br>You don;t have more problems than other people – you just think about them more often! Stop: go back and reread that sentence. Take a moment and think about what it means. It's what you think about that determines how you feel. If you don't believe that try getting angry without first having angry thoughts, or getting sad without first having sad thoughts. You can't do it, can you? To experience a feeling you must first have the thought that produces it. That's life-changing information; it's knowledge the devil doesn't want you to have.
If you change how you think you'll change how you feel! Nothing can hold your negative feelings in place other than your own thinking. The truth is, it's your thinking that's negative, not your life! Once you understand that you can get back on the path to happiness again. 
Change takes time. You didn't become negative overnight and you won't become positive overnight. But you can start. How? By doing two things: 1) by treating your negative thoughts in the same way you treat flies at a picnic – shoo them away and start to focus your mind on good stuff! You have that choice! 2) by thinking about God's goodness. David did: 'Praise the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits: Who forgives all your sins; who heals all your diseases; who redeems your life from the pit; and who crowns you with love and compassion' (Psalm 103:2-4 NIV). So, if you're serious about changing your life, start changing how you think!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>DO NOT WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PHILIPPIANS 4:6 NLT</span><br>Apparently... 40% of what we worry about never happens. 30% has already happened. 12% focuses on things we cannot change. 10% on our health, which only makes it worse. Only 8% are real problems we can influence. Think: 92% of our worries are a waste of time!
Worry comes from a Greek word meaning, 'to divide the mind'; worry splits us right down the middle. It doesn’t stop tomorrow's trouble, it just makes us unable to focus on today, so we miss out. And who can afford to lose strength? 'But how can I stop worrying?' Paul offers a two-pronged answer: God's part and our part. Our part includes prayer and thankfulness: 'Do not worry about anything; instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need, and thank him for all he has done' (Philippians 4:6 NLT). Do you want to worry less? Talk to God more.  And let Him know you're thankful.  Thankfulness is powerful; it releases God's peace. Listen: 'If you do this, you will experience God's peace, which is far more wonderful than the human mind can understand. His peace will guard your hearts and minds as you live in Christ Jesus' (Philippians 4:7 NLT). Faith-filled prayer brings God's peace. Imagine having God's totally chilled state of mind! Do you think He worries, freaks out or is surprised by anything? Your problem is no more challenging to Him than a twig to an elephant. God enjoys perfect peace because He enjoys perfect power – and He offers His peace to you. Just do your part through prayer and thanksgiving and He'll do His!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>..LIVE A LIFE OF LOVE, JUST AS CHRIST LOVED US</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPH 5:2 NIV</span><br>You only have to spend 2 seconds looking at the cover of the 'gossip magazines' to get the latest info on some celebrities love life 'Are they together? Aren't they? What will so and so think? Was that a friendly hug or something more?'.  Open up the teen magazines and it won't be long before you find a questionnaire that will prove 'Once and for all if your relationship is TRUE LOVE.'  The bible's focus is more on our lives of love rather than our love lives (although you check Song of Songs for some steamy talk of love). Paul tells the Ephesians to live a life of love just as Christ loved us and gave himself for us. So it's time for a love life check up, how are you doing with loving others as Christ has loved us. Read this and ask God to speak to show you where you are doing well and not so well: 
'Love is kind and patient, never jealous, boastful, proud, or rude. Love isn't selfish
or quick tempered.It doesn't keep a record of wrongs that others do.Love rejoices in the truth, but not in evil.Love is always supportive, loyal, hopeful, and trusting. Love never fails!' (1 Corinthians 13:4-8 NCV)
God is fascinated with our lives of love (even more than we are with celebrity love lives). The more we love the more we become like God. 'God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in him.' (1 John 4:16 NIV).  Paul says in his letter to the Colossian church, 'put on love' (Col 3:14 NIV), love isn't always something that just springs up from inside us, sometimes we have to decide to love, to bend down pick it up and put it on.  Ask God to help you to wear love wherever you go.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>BE STILL, AND KNOW THAT I AM GOD.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 46:10  NIV</span><br>Are you feeling stressed out and anxious today. Wondering if everything will get done and sorted? Remember God says: ‘Be still, and know that I am God.’ And there’s a reason He’s saying it.  Ever noticed the more busy you get, the more stressed out you are, the more you NEED God, the less time you spend with Him, talking to Him, trusting Him. Half the time we are stressed over stuff that isn’t even what God wants us to be doing. It was something we wanted to do, no wonder we are stressed! 
Whatever is stressing you out , ask God to reveal to you His will in the matter, what does he want you to do?  Then stop, take a deep breathe, chill out and ‘be still’ and acknowledge that He’s God, He’s in charge, He knows what He’s doing! 
Life is a lot less hassle and a lot less stressful when we learn to trust Him without always demanding to know what He’s going to do, when He’s going to do it, and how He’s going to carry it out.
Jesus said, ‘I am the vine, and you are the branches’ (John 15:5). Until you really grab hold of those words you will keep trying to do things that only God can do –   solving your own problems and answering your own prayers. Or worse, you will try to cover up for Him because you think He’s not doing it fast enough, or in the way it should be done. Give it up! Try less and trust more! Jesus said, ‘I am the vine, you are the branches.’ All you have to do is stay connected!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>MAY YOU EXPERIENCE THE LOVE OF CHRIST.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 3:19 NLT</span><br>Others love you conditionally with strings attached, only if you are cool or good looking, only if you’ll love them back. But not God, He loves you because He decides to. His love is self-generated and spontaneous, His love is priceless and yet he chooses to give it away freely. Check this out: ‘The Lord did not set his affection on you…because you were more numerous than other peoples, for you were the fewest of all peoples. But it was because the Lord loved you’ (Deuteronomy 7:7-8 NIV). You can neither earn nor influence God’s love. Paul writes, ‘God showed his great love for us by sending Christ to die for us while we were still sinners’ (Romans 5:8 NLT). We think we can measure how much God loves us by what is happening in our lives, or how we feel. But forget it. There is nothing you can do (good or bad) to make God love you any more or any less! 
Jesus said, ‘Abide in My love’ (John 15:9 NAS). To abide in His love is to feel at home in it. Home: the place where you are known, loved, secure, and always welcome. John writes, ‘We take up permanent residence in a life of love’ (1 John 4:17 TM). 
To abide in His love is to cling to Christ like a branch clings to a vine. Does the branch ever let go of or drop off the vine? Only at the risk of death. Does the branch ever stop drawing life from the vine? No, it receives nutrients 24 hours a day. Listen: ‘As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in Me’ (John 15:4 NAS).]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>MY FATHER NEVER STOPS WORKING.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 5:17 NLT</span><br>In the old days Blacksmiths and Silversmiths could take some hot metal and make armour, swords, horse shoes, spoons, knifes, jewellery, all kinds of stuff just by bashing it with a hammer. The word ‘smith’ means to hit or strike. These guys were experts with a hammer and so is God. He knows the weight of the hammer and the force of the blow required to produce in you Christ-like character. No one yanks the hammer out of His hand and says, ‘Go easy on that silver; you have pounded it enough!’ No, He buffets the metal until He’s finished with it. Silversmiths keep polishing until they can see their face in the finished product. When will God stop with you? When He sees His nature and His likeness reflected in you.
Jesus said, ‘My father never stops working.’ The pounding you feel doesn’t suggest God’s distance, it proves His nearness. Trust Him. Hasn’t He earned your trust? Has He ever spoken a word that proved to be false? After a lifetime of walking with God, Joshua said, ‘Not one word failed from all the good words God spoke’ (Joshua 21:45 TM). And Paul adds, ‘If we are faithless, he will remain faithful, for he cannot disown himself’ (2 Timothy 2:13 NIV). Try making a list of His mistakes. Now try making a list of yours, and the times He’s forgiven you. Who on earth has a record like that? You can depend on Him. He is ‘The same yesterday and today and forever’ (Hebrews 13:8 NIV). And because He is your Lord, ‘he will be your sure foundation ‘(Isaiah 33:6 NAS). Be happy, God is directing your steps and monitoring every detail of your life!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>YOU HAVE SHOWN KINDNESS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 24:14 NKJV</span><br>Before we leave her, let’s learn three more important lessons from Rebekah:
1) When you give generously, you get back more than you ever thought possible. Jesus said, ‘With the measure you use, it will be measured back to you’ (Matthew 7:2 NIV). We set the standard of what we receive, by what we give. Rebekah gave more than was asked, and received back more than she ever expected to get. She became the great-great great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandmother of the Messiah! Give what you can; you will be amazed what God will give you in return
2) When you give generously, your loved ones will be blessed too. When Abraham’s servant revealed who he was, he brought out gold articles and rich garments and gave them to Rebekah. But he also gave precious things to her mother and brother. The rewards of your generosity will always overflow and touch the lives of those closest to you
3) When you give, the impact of your generosity will often outlive you. In the moment of giving you cannot imagine how your actions might impact the lives of others in the future. Imagine what the world would be like if Noah had said, ‘I don’t do boats,’ if David had said, ‘I don’t do Giants’ if Mary had said, ‘I don’t do virgin births’, if Paul had said, ‘I don’t do letters’, and if Jesus had said, ‘I don’t do crosses’. A lifestyle of generous giving will outlive you and bless those who follow you. So what can you do or give that will make a difference to others long after you done it?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>YOU HAVE SHOWN KINDNESS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 24:14 NKJV</span><br>One day as Rebekah was standing by the well, a man approached and asked her for a drink. Without hesitation she said yes. Then she offered to water his camels. That was no small offer. One camel can drink 20 gallons of water. Do the maths: 10 camels at 20 gallons each equals 200 gallons. 200 gallons drawn with a five-gallon jar equals 40 trips to the well. 40 trips at three minutes each equals two hours. What Rebekah did not realise was that her simple act of generosity would change her life forever. Little did she know that her actions were the answer to a servant’s prayer and the plan of a sovereign God. All she did was do what she felt she should, but in so doing she became the bride of Isaac, the inheritor of Abraham’s fortune, and a ancestor of Jesus. Rebekah went the extra mile. Her generosity seems to be seriously different from the attitudes of  today. She said, ‘I’ll not just do what you ask me, I’ll do more.’ In contrast many of us say, ‘I’m going to do the least that is expected of me and try and get the most out of it.’ Sadly this attitude has also crept into the lives of even God’s people. Few desire to do more than they must. Everywhere you look you see an attitude of minimum effort for maximum payment. The Rebekah principle teaches us that when you go through life looking for small opportunities to be generous, there can be a big pay back from God!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>BY FAITH NOAH.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HEBREWS 11:7</span><br>You can make a difference in your family! Listen: ‘By faith Noah…built an ark to save his family.’ Noah’s obedience to God did not benefit just him, it also saved his family. Maybe your family are not yet Christians and it feels like you’ve been praying and talking to them forever. It took Noah 100 years and a lot of wood… but you don’t have to make trips to B&amp;Q and start building an ark, just keep making those trips to your bedroom (or wherever you pray) and keep asking God to use you and to save your family. Don’t give up! 
You can make a difference for future generations! When Noah stepped out of the ark God used him to start the world all over again. Wow! Listen: ‘For the eyes of the LORD range throughout the earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him.’(2 Chronicles 16:9 TM). God is still looking for people to partner with so that He can fulfil His purposes. But to qualify you must: a) dare to stand out in the crowd. Noah believed in his vision when nobody else did. Difference-makers are different. Do not let that bother you; b) dare to do things for the first time. Do not let the words ‘it is never been done before’ keep you from doing what God asks. Folks said, ‘It is never rained before, who needs a boat?’ But they were wrong and it cost them dearly; c) hold on through the rain to see the rainbow. So take your stand and believe God, for what He’s promised you – He’ll perform!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THEN THOSE WHO WERE IN THE BOAT WORSHIPPED HIM.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 14:33 NIV</span><br>The story of Peter walking on the water ends with the words: ‘Then those who were in the boat worshiped him’.(Jesus) There’s an important principle here: God shows you how amazing He is. You stop and think about what He’s done and respond in worship. And therefore your love for Him grows. This may happen to you in a dramatic way such as a walk on the water. But usually it happens in ways that are easily missed, such as a still small voice in you that whispers, ‘I never let you down; never walk off and leave you’ (Hebrews 13:5 TM).
John Ortberg, who wrote a book about ‘getting out of the boat’ says: ‘You need to worship God not because His ego needs it, but because without worship your experience and enjoyment of Him are not complete. You need to worship, because without worship you can forget you have a big God and end up living in fear. You need to worship, because without it you can forget His calling and begin to live in a spirit of self-preoccupation (me me me attitude). You need to worship, because without it you can lose your sense of wonder and gratitude and plod through life with the blinders on. You need to worship, because your natural tendency is toward self-reliance and stubborn independence (just doing things your way).’
In Mark’s version of the water-walking story he records that the disciples were amazed ‘because their hearts were hardened.’ Each time you pause to remember what God has brought you through, your heart will become tender and your lips declare: ‘I will praise the LORD at all times. I will constantly speak his praises (Psalm 34:1 NLT ).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WHEN HE SAW THE WIND, HE WAS AFRAID.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 14:30 NIV</span><br>The truth about water-walking is: the fear never goes away! If you want to grow, you must go! Go into something new, something risky.  And each time you do you will experience fear. Give up trying to make fear go away! Fear and growth go together; it’s a package deal. The decision to grow means choosing between risk and comfort. Each time you get out of the boat you become a bit more confident about getting out the next time. It’s not that the fear goes away, you just get used to dealing with it. You realise that it doesn’t have the power to destroy you. On the other hand, every time you choose to stay in the boat rather than obey the call of Christ to ‘Come,’ the voice inside you gets a little quieter, till finally you do not hear it at all.
Did Peter fail? No. Other than Jesus, he’s the only man who ever walked on water. All of the other disciples would go on to say ‘we saw someone walk on water’ Only Peter could say ‘I walked on water’. Only Peter knew the joy of being empowered by God to do what could not humanly be done. Walking on water changes you forever. And only Peter knew the grace of being lifted by Jesus in a moment of desperate need. He understood in a way the others could not that when you take baby steps of faith, the Lord will never let you drown. He had an experience with Christ the others did not have. So, failure isn’t sinking in the waves, it is never getting out of the boat!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>PETER…WALKED ON THE WATER.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 14:29 NLT</span><br>Here are some things you need to know about water-walking:
1) Everybody has a boat. Your boat is whatever gives you a sense security. It’s what you’re tempted to put your trust in, especially when life gets a bit stormy. Want to know what your boat is? Your fear will tell you. Ask yourself, ‘What is it that I get most scared of leaving behind or doing without if I was to obey God and and step out in faith?’. It might be being popular or having loads of cash or your best mate or anything that you think need and find it hard leave when God asks you to.
2) Keep your eyes on Jesus not the storm. When did Peter sink? When he ‘saw the wind.’  We do this all the time.  Maybe you’re trying to do something new, a new course at college, a weekend job, a new friendship, getting involved in a new activity. At the beginning things are great; it’s blue skies; then reality sets in. You get some problems, some difficulties. Life’s full of surprises so we should expect it, but somehow the trouble and problems take over - it’s all we can think about, all we can see. Because the wind some of us never leave the boat. The problems put us off, ‘better to stick with what we are doing now’!  But the truth is, there’s no guarantee that life in the boat will be any safer. Everything’s risky!  Understand this: if you live in the boat you will eventually die in the boat, and you will end up wondering what your life might have been if only you would been willing to step over the side.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>IN THE HAND OF THE POTTER.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JEREMIAH 18:6 NIV</span><br>Ever seen anyone make something on a potter’s wheel? They bang their foot on a pedal and the wheel starts spinning. Soon they’ve chucked on a lump of clay and a load of water and got their fingers stuck in. Before your eyes, with the wheel still spinning, they have shaped a pot. ‘So I went to the potter's house, and sure enough, the potter was there, working away at his wheel.  Whenever the pot the potter was working on turned out badly, as sometimes happens when you are working with clay, the potter would simply start over and use the same clay to make another pot’ (Jeremiah 18:3-4 TM)
If you are asking, ‘Why am I going through all of this?’ the answer is, you are ‘in the hand of the Potter.’ Knowing that helps – especially when you are on the wheel and everything in your life seems to be spinning out of control. It is not. Look under the table and see whose foot is on the wheel. It’s God and He’s in control. He’s not put off by the clay regardless of where He finds it or how messed up it is. He’s committed to working on it until it becomes what He wants. Listen: ‘to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God’ (John 1:12). He is interested in what you are becoming. Regardless of what you have been up until now.
Notice, even though the pot turned out badly sometimes. God never throws us away, nor is His plan for us held back because we have a mistake or struggle in certain areas. Understand this: whether you are being lifted from the mud, turned on the wheel or made over again, at all times you are in His hand. And you always will be!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>MASTER, WE'VE BEEN FISHING HARD ALL NIGHT AND HAVEN'T CAUGHT EVEN A MINNOW. BUT IF YOU SAY SO, I'LL LET OUT THE NETS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 5:5 TM</span><br>After fishing all night and catching zilcho, nowt, nothing, the disciples were gutted. Then Jesus said to His disciples, ‘Push out into deep water and let your nets out for a catch.’ (Luke 5:4 TM). Can you imagine their thoughts? 
The test of our faith comes when: a) nothing you have tried has worked; b) the word God gives you seems to make no sense at all. Notice Peter’s answer: ‘But if you say so, I’ll let out the nets’ (Luke 5:5 TM). He got it right! Doubt your doubts but don’t doubt God. Why? Because He’s not held back by your idea of what’s possible! One word from Him can change everything. Listen to what happened next: ‘this time their nets were so full they began to tear!’ (Luke 5:6 NLT). Here are four important lessons for you today:
1) Sometimes He’ll involve you in one thing to teach you another. Soon Jesus was going to involve them in an even greater miracle – ‘catching people’ and bringing them into His kingdom. 
2) He’ll use the ordinary to do the extraordinary. In their normal workplace where nothing special ever happened, Jesus suddenly showed up and changed everything. You can expect Him in your normal, ordinary life. Not just at big events, festivals or church. 
3) He’ll move you from the security of the shore to the risks of the deep water. You’ve got to experience the great storms in order to enjoy the great catches. No risk, no reward! 
4) When you obey God nets break, needs are met, minds are blown and God is made famous. But remember, you can’t even begin to live miraculously until you can say, 
‘Because you said so, I will…’ (Luke 5:5 NIV). ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOUR AS YOURSELF</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matt 22:39  NIV</span><br>In the film Spiderman, Peter Parker, is told ‘With great power comes great responsibility.’ Peter had just found out that he could walk up walls, beat up the local tough guys and generally start living like a super hero, so these were important words. 
In many ways these words shape Peter’s life as he tries to work out what it means to be responsible for other people when you’re a friendly web slinging Spiderman! 
The bible has some important things to say about power and responsibility: 
‘For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me’ (Matthew 25:35-36 NIV)  Jesus’ message seems clear, if someone is in need and you have the power to do something about it, then your responsibility is to do it!  Britain is the fourth richest country in the world which gives us a lot of power to make a lot of difference but also gives us a lot of responsibility. This year many charities are joining forces to campaign to the government to ‘MAKE POVERTY HISTORY’, to increase aid to poor countries, to erase the debt that poor countries owe us and to improve the trade rules so that people get fairly paid. For example, if you buy a designer jacket for £100 the person who made it will have been paid about 50p! As a Christian, as a neighbour, ask yourself how you can love the poor. How can you give more, get more involved? Talk to your youth leader, talk to your friends, Talk to God. Find out what you can do. You might not think you have much, but every pound, every hour, every prayer can make a difference.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>DON'T LET ANYONE LOOK DOWN ON YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE YOUNG</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Tim 4:12 NIV</span><br>Mary, Jesus’ mum was just a teenager when God sent ‘Gabs’ with a message that would change her life. David was the youngest in his family, when an old prophet came to his Dad’s house looking  for the next king. Soon the prophet was pouring oil on his head saying that he was God’s man!  Paul writes to his friend Tim who is leading one of the first churches and says ‘don’t let people look down on you because you’re young’. God is not held back by your age. He’s not waiting for you to be older and wiser before he starts to use you in his plans. 
Of course, God will want you to learn from those who are more experienced. Like Mary had her much older relative, Elizabeth. Timothy had Paul. So it’s important you don’t think you’ve got all the answers. Learn from the successes and mistakes of others – you’ll never live long enough to make them all yourself! 
Paul also tells Timothy to set an example.  Wrinkle creams, extreme makeovers, celebrities lying about their age. Have you noticed that everyone is desperate to be young again. Everyone is looking at you and wanting to be like you. But God wants a generation of young people that everyone wants to be like, not because of their smooth skin, fashion, energy or looks but because of their holiness, purity and speech. He wants young people to lead the way in living lives of love, showing kindness and generosity. He wants young people who will take leaps of faith, do what others are too comfortable or scared to do, who take giant risks because they trust in a massive God.  Go for it! Set an example!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>OFFER TO GOD A SACRIFICE OF PRAISE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HEBREWS 13:15 NIV</span><br>If you feel like your problems have got you trapped in a downer, read this. ‘About midnight Paul and Silas were…singing hymns to God…Suddenly there was such a violent earthquake that the foundations of the prison were shaken. . .all the prison doors flew open, and everybody’s chains came loose’ (Acts 16:25-26 NIV). Praise opens the doors! Praise breaks chains! Any time you are willing to praise God despite your circumstances and the problem in your life, the forces of heaven come to your aid. ‘Oh com’on, I last thing I feel like is praising God’ you say. Then ‘offer to God a sacrifice of praise.’ Even with gritted teeth and tear filled eyes, we can praise God. Anybody can praise God in the good times, but if you praise when you don’t feel like it, when the problems are massive and everyone else thinks your nuts– that’s when it really counts.
The battle of Jericho teaches us that sometimes we have to worship God when: a) we’re up against a brick wall; b) we feel like we’re going in circles; c) the enemy seems to stand over us laughing; d) our mind thinks ‘this is no way to fight a war;’ e) it is the last thing on earth we feel like doing. (Check out Joshua 6 to see what happened)
Nehemiah writes, ‘Don't be sad! This is a special day for the LORD, and he will make you happy and strong.’ (Nehemiah 8:10 CEV). If you look to natural things for happiness you’ll live on an emotional roller coaster. But if you choose to look at Jesus and His unfailing love for you, you’ll move from weakness to strength every time!

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>BEFORE YOU WERE BORN, I SET YOU APART FOR A SPECIAL WORK.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JEREMIAH 1:5 NCV</span><br>In the bible there is a pattern of what happens in a life that God wants to use and improve:
1) There’s always a call – not a phonecall but it will ‘ring a bell’ in your heart. God asks normal people to take a risk and do something ‘not normal’- which will need shed loads of trust. Like when Jesus calls Peter to get out of the boat and walk on water. 
2) There’s always fear. God has a habit of asking people to do things that scare them: like Moses who told God, ‘I’m not a good enough speaker, use somebody else’ 
3) There’s always reassurance. Listen: ‘As I was with Moses, so I will be with you.’ That is what God told Joshua, the new leader who’d just taken over 
4) There’s always a decision. Sometimes, like with Gideon, we say yes to God’s call. Sometimes, like the rich young ruler who spoke to Jesus, we say no, but we must always decide.
5) There’s always a changed life. Those who say yes to God’s call aren’t expecting instant perfection, not by a long shot. But because they say yes they learn and grow even from their failures and become part of God’s plan to rescue the world. Those who say no to God are changed too; they become a little harder, a little more resistant to His calling, a little more likely to say no next time. 
Is God calling you? Maybe it has to do with your future, your relationships, your money, or facing your deepest fear. God’s call will go to the core of who you are and what you do. If you say yes to Him, you will never regret it!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>NOT JUST WHEN YOU THINK THEY ARE WATCHING.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 6:6 CEV</span><br>It takes courage to be led by God’s Spirit. It’s not easy to break the mould in your family or step outside the boundaries others create for you. Maybe God’s telling you to serve him when everyone expects you to get a ‘proper job’. Maybe you want to go to college but no one in your families ever done that. Whatever it is, you could face criticism. Jesus did. When they said, ‘Isn’t this the carpenter’s son?’ (Matthew 13:55 NIV), they were saying, ‘He should stay in his place.’ They’ll say that about you too.
Two kinds of people always fail – those who listen to nobody and those who listen to everybody. Paul writes: ‘Each of us will give an account of himself to God’ (Romans 14:12 NIV). In the end, it’s only what God thinks that counts. 
Too often our actions are ruled not by a sense of purpose but by a need to please. We care so much about what certain people think, that with every step we look over our shoulder to see whether they are smiling or frowning. God says, ‘You shall have no other gods before me’ (Exodus 20:3 NIV). Now, your first thought might be: ‘But I don’t have any other gods?!’ But you do when you dedicate your life to impressing people rather than obeying God. When you are a child of God your number one responsibility is to please Him. Your second is to live your life to the fullest. Living on purpose, choosing to live God’s way in God’s world, whatever people say is the way to really live; anything else is just existing.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>IT IS FOR YOUR PLEASURE THAT THEY EXIST AND WERE CREATED.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>REVELATION 4:11 NLT</span><br>The day you were born God smiled. He did not need to create you, He chose to. When you fully grasp that you will never again have the problem of feeling ‘less-than.’ Farai Chideya graduated from Harvard (a top American uni), worked for Newsweek magazine and quickly rose to the top. Yet she spent years living in the private hell of bulimia, trying to become like the glossy images in the make-believe world around her. When she finally broke free from the destructive grip of her eating disorder she wrote, ‘Losing weight did not change my personality and it did not lighten the emotional baggage I carried from my childhood. I thought I wanted to be thin. What I really wanted was to be happy, and neither my looks nor my achievements could do that. Because I could not love or accept myself, the acceptance of others was never enough. When I tried to be perfect I came across as remote and unapproachable, yet the exact opposite was what I wanted.’
Then she shares four life-changing principles: ‘Your obsession to be perfect will: 1) keep you trapped in loneliness, for satisfying relationships can only be built on honesty and total acceptance; 2) force you to see your shortcomings as something to hide instead of opportunities for growth; 3) keep you obsessed with what you are going to be some day, instead of enjoying what you are right now; 4) rob you of the chance to make your life count, for by focusing constantly on yourself you will have nothing left to give to others.’ Think about it!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>JESUS…WENT THROUGH THE COUNTRY HELPING…EVERYONE WHO WAS BEATEN DOWN BY THE DEVIL.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ACTS 10:38 TM</span><br>The Simpson’s, Brat Camp, Super Nanny… your telly seems to be crammed with programmes showing rebellious kids kicking off and desperate parents pulling their hair out wanting to know why their kids do what they do. But it’s nothing new, it all started with the first book, Genesis, telling us about the first fight in the first family between the first two brothers. And we all wrestle with the same issues because we’re all from the same gene pool. In the first dysfunctional family Cain attacked and killed his brother Abel out of anger, jealously and a ‘me first’ attitude. Now be honest, have you ever felt like that? 
But do we have to live that way? No way! 
Maybe the last person you want to look like is your mum or dad but like it or not families do have certain characteristics that pass down the generations. But here’s a bonus… it’s part of God’s plan that we start to look like Him, by reflecting His love and goodness. Paul refers to this as ‘a God-fashioned life, a life renewed from the inside and working itself into your conduct as God accurately reproduces his character in you’ (Ephesians 4:22 TM). Notice, you cannot reproduce Christ-like characteristics in your own strength. New Year’s resolutions, willpower and good intentions are not enough. Only God’s Spirit can make the changes necessary in your life. Listen: ‘God is working in you, giving you the desire to obey him and the power to do what pleases him’ (Philippians 2:13 NLT). Good news: God will give you the desire and the power to live a transformed life.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>CASTING ALL YOUR CARE UPON HIM.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 PETER 5:7</span><br>When you hear people talk about forgiveness, are you the kind of person who always thinks of the same BIG SIN? That thing you did years before but just can’t believe God has forgiven. So you find yourself asking Him one more time, ‘God please forgive me. I’m so sorry’. If only we could hear God…’What sin?’ He’d say. ‘You know…what I did...all those years ago’ we shoot back. ‘But my child, I forgot all about that when you asked the first time, why are you still holding on to it?’  
Maybe someone offended you big time. They’ve said sorry and you’ve sort of forgiven them, but you just can’t forget. Or maybe you prayed to God for something and He said ‘NO’. Do you keep hoping he’ll change His mind, like a the ‘pop idol’ hopeful who goes to every audition in every town every year? Sometimes you have to LET GO! 
Check this out: ‘Cast all your cares upon Him; for He cares for you.’ ‘Cast’ is a really simple word, it just means, ‘throw it away.’ What are you dragging around? Old pain? Old scars? A dream or a grudge for somebody who’s already moved on? You are sacrificing your future for something that is not worthy of your time and energy. Throw it away! Why would God tell you to do something so radical? Because ‘He cares for you.’ That is right, while you are caring for IT, He’s caring for YOU. It is hard to watch somebody you love twisting in pain because of something they shouldn’t be carrying to begin with. God has no problem making the thing leave you alone; His struggle is getting you to loosen your grip on it. So today He’s speaking to YOU, not what’s bothering you, saying, ‘Throw it away!’

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>MY HEART HAS HEARD YOU SAY, ‘COME AND TALK WITH ME.’ AND MY HEART RESPONDS, ‘LORD, I AM COMING.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 27:8 NLT</span><br>If you have ever given up chocolate for a detox or been on a diet or are just trying to eat more healthy food you will know what I mean when I say food talks to you. You can be in the middle of doing something, homework, watching telly, sleeping! Then, your whole body seems to hear the chocolate cake sitting in your fridge start to call out ‘come and talk to me, come and see me, come and eat me!’ You try to tell yourself that you are not eating chocolate, but your mouth waters, your lips twitch and your stomach shouts back ‘I’m coming’ 
Spending time with God is feeding our spirits. Reading the bible and praying is like have a proper meal every day – and we need it, otherwise we become weak and can’t do everything we need to. God knows we need it too, so He loves to feed us with His word. Sometimes like your everyday meals, your times with God are good, they build you up and keep you strong. But sometimes God can call you for something special. He will call out like the chocolate cake. He wants a bit longer than you normally give, he wants you go a bit deeper and those times are amazing. They don’t happen everyday but we need them too, so if you hear God calling make sure you make time for Him. Don’t miss out your steady meals or your special chocolate cake moments. 
King David wrote, ‘Whom have I in heaven but you? And besides you, I desire nothing on earth. My flesh and my heart may fail. But God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever… (Psalm 73:25-26 NIV) and also ‘My heart has heard you say, ‘Come and talk with me.’ And my heart responds, ‘LORD, I am coming.’ (Ps 27:8 NLT). 
Are you spiritually hungry? Spend more time with God!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>ANGELS…ARE SENT TO HELP THOSE WHO WILL RECEIVE SALVATION.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HEBREWS 1:14 NCV</span><br>Here’s a promise you should remember every day. ‘No harm will befall you, no disaster will come near [you]. For he will command his angels…to guard you in all your ways’ (Psalm 91:10-11 NIV). But angels not only serve you, they are stunned by you. Listen: ‘Do you realise how fortunate you are? Angels would have given anything to be in on this’ (1 Peter 1:12 TM). Angels are amazed by the gifts God has given you. Does the Holy Spirit live within angels? No, but He lives in you. Do angels thank God for salvation? No, they’ve never been lost, broken and messed up by sin and then rescued – but you have. Did Christ become an angel? No, but He became a human just like you, and angels stood in awe. Angels attended His birth, witnessed His death and announced His resurrection. They even watch over the work of the church: ‘Through Christians like yourselves gathered in churches, this extraordinary plan of God is…talked about even among the angels’ (Ephesians 3:10 TM) God’s angels are so involved with us that the Bible says, ‘Do not forget to entertain strangers, for by so doing some people have entertained angels without knowing it’ (Hebrews 13:2 NIV).
Awesome eh!! God sends His personal bodyguards to protect you. Is this sloppy sentiment from some cheesy American daytime TV show?  No, it is solid scriptural reality! If Jesus is Lord of your life, then angels are watching over you!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>ANGELS…ARE SENT TO HELP THOSE WHO WILL RECEIVE SALVATION.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>HEBREWS 1:14 NCV</span><br>If you believe the Bible you have to believe in angels. There are over 300 references to them. How are they described? Tinsel halos and white nighties? No way! Two words describe them: many and mighty. It took only one angel to shut the mouths of the lions for Daniel and bring Peter out of prison on the eve of his execution. And do you remember Elisha’s servant? When an army threatened to take their lives, Elisha asked God to open His servant’s eyes. Check it out: ‘Then Lord opened the servant’s eyes, and he looked and saw the hills full of horses and chariots of fire around Elisha‘ (2 Kings 6:17). If God opened your eyes today what would you see? Angels sitting on your parents car as you drive along? Or guiding you away from a mugger hiding down an alley? Maybe guiding the hand of the surgeon? Or protecting you while you sleep? Billy Graham (a seriously wise preacher guy) says, ‘If you are a believer, expect powerful angels to accompany you in your life’s experience.’
But who is this protection for? ‘Those who will receive salvation.’ Reject Jesus and you reject this awesome offer of protection. Listen: ‘The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear Him, and he delivers them’ (Psalm 34:7 NIV). Notice: He doesn’t give you a wink and a wave as He flies past; He encamps, He lingers, He takes off his coat and settles in. 
You can rest secure beneath the shadow of His wings. Think about that and let it lower your stress level. The truth is, some of the wealthiest people on the planet do not have it that good!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WHEN I GO TO SPAIN I HOPE TO VISIT YOU</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 15:24 NIV</span><br>Sometimes we think we have got the direction of our lives sorted. But then bosh! Something happens and our plans go pear shaped. It only later when we look back we can see than what we thought was pear shaped was in fact God shaped! 
Remember we don’t decide God’s plan for our lives, we discover it. Paul wrote, ‘When I go to Spain I hope to visit you.’ But he never made it. Instead he finished up in one of Europe’s worst prisons, but from there he wrote the Epistles (letters to churches that end up taking up most of the new testament!). God knows what He is doing!
One of England’s finest preachers decided that he couldn’t speak at a big conference in America even though he had already bought his ticket, because his wife was so ill and needed him to stay.  The ship sailed without him and J. Stuart Holden missed a golden opportunity in the prime of his preaching career. A devoted husband, Holden focused on caring for his wife and tried not to think of what he was missing on the other side of the Atlantic. We’re too easily disappointed when our plans fall through; too easily discouraged when ‘great opportunities’ are missed. And so do we complain far too easily forgetting that God is the one planning our lives? For example, things don’t happen as soon as we’d like but delay is often just the protective hand of a caring heavenly Father. It sure was for Holden. Until the day he died he decided never to question God’s timing again. The unused ticket he held, reserved his passage on a new luxury liner – The H.M.S. Titanic!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THEN DAVID GOT UP FROM THE GROUND.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 SAMUEL 12:20 NIV</span><br>Check out and learn from David: standing on his balcony eyeing up another man’s wife. Then follows a night of sin, an unplanned pregnancy, a failed cover up, a shady murder, a public exposure and a dying child. It doesn’t get much worse! Covered in sackcloth and ashes, he lies on the palace floor pleading for the life of the new born love-child. For a whole week he cries, then it’s over... ‘Is the child dead?’ he asks. The answer is, ‘yes’. Then: ‘David got up from the floor, washed his face and combed his hair, put on a fresh change of clothes, then went into the sanctuary and worshiped.’ (2 Sam 12:20 TM) 
Facing circumstances he could not change, receiving forgiveness he could not earn, learning a lesson he’d never forget, David closed the book and moved on. In Psalm 51 he prays, ‘Hide your face from my sins and blot out all my iniquity. Create in me a pure heart, O God’ (Psalm 51:9-10 NIV). And God answered his prayer. Check this out: ‘I will sing of your strength, in the morning I will sing of your love; for you are my fortress, my refuge in times of trouble’ (Psalm 59:16 NIV).
No doubt about it, our sin offends God. But our unwillingness to repent (flip our lives around) and receive His forgiveness offends Him even more! And that is what we do when we remain stuck in our failures. God never intended such a waste of life! The way to honour and big God up after any failure is to get back up, corrected and redirected, and carry the message of His forgiveness to others who’ve failed!

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WHO AM I THAT I SHOULD GO?</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EXODUS 3:11 NKJV</span><br>Here are three more lessons from the life of Moses:
1) It’s always hard to leave your safe zone. Moses didn’t want to leave the comforts of Pharaoh’s palace, or the security of his new family in Midian. Yet if he didn’t he’d never have fulfilled God’s destiny for his life. Big destinies call for big sacrifices. Just because you do not feel like doing something doesn’t mean you shouldn’t!
2) Real growth begins when you leave your safe zone. For 40 years Moses benefited from everything Egypt had to offer. But only after he left Egypt for the first time did he begin to learn what’s really important: God’s purposes. And it took another 40 years in the desert to discover how God intended to use him. By then he’d been humbled and remade by God. If you want to grow, you have to go!
3) The safe-zone will rob you of your greatest moments and memories. Many people are so afraid of risk that they spend their lives in Egypt, the land of ‘not enough.’ A few are willing to get out of their safe-zone and as a result they enter the desert, the land of ‘just enough.’ But God wants more for you. He wants you to leave the wilderness and enter the Promised Land, the land of ‘more than enough.’ Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed over the risks you did not take, than the ones you did. But you can pre-empt tomorrow’s regret by moving forward today and getting into the ‘faith zone.’

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>WHO AM I, THAT I SHOULD GO…?</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EXODUS 3:11 NIV</span><br>Your life story will be all about risks – the risks you took and the ones you avoided. Look at Moses. Do you think we’d even remember his name today if he hadn’t stepped out of the safe zone? Look what he overcame:
1) Comfort! Comfort can be a greater threat to your progress than hardship. After Moses left Egypt he spent his next 40 years in a place called Midian looking after sheep. He married one of Jethro’s daughters and became head of the family business. Since Jethro had no sons he was going to inherit everything once Jethro died – a cushy little number in those days. Imagine leaving all that to go back and face Pharaoh! Then imagine leading two million complaining people through the wilderness. God’s plan is always rewarding, but don’t think it’ll be easy!
2) Insecurity! When God called Moses he had loads of questions and doubts: ‘Who am I that I should go?’ (Exodus 3:11 NKJV). ‘What shall I say to them?’ (Exodus 3:13 NKJV). ‘Suppose they will not believe me?’ (Exodus 4:1 NKJV). ‘But I am slow of speech’ (Exodus 4:10 NKJV). Finally Moses said, ‘Please send someone else’ (Exodus 4:13 NIV). Fortunately God wouldn’t take no for an answer. So finally Moses did the only thing that helps when we’re uncertain about our future: he obeyed God, the One Who knows our future in every detail. So he agreed to answer God’s call, leave his safe zone and return to Egypt. As a result the children of Israel were delivered out of the hands of Pharaoh, and Moses became famous. What things could YOU do for God and whose lives could be changed if you took that first scary and uncomfortable step out of the safe zone? ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>NO ONE WHO HAS LEFT HOME OR BROTHERS OR SISTERS OR MOTHER OR FATHER OR CHILDREN OR FIELDS FOR ME AND THE GOSPEL WILL FAIL TO RECEIVE A HUNDRED TIMES AS MUCH IN THIS PRESENT AGE…WITH PERSECUTIONS</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MARK 10:29-30 NIV</span><br>Some Christians will never stop talking about the all the ‘blessings’ God wants to dish out to those ‘who have faith’, others will always bring you back to the hardship, hurt and persecution Christians must face. Jesus said we’re to expect both. Most western Christians (like us) expect the blessings but don’t know much about persecution. Yet in other parts of the world hundreds of thousands of Christians are banged up in prison, tortured and even executed every year because of their faith. If you are only expecting good things to happen to you, ask yourself why? Bad stuff happens to good people. Look at Jesus and he said: ‘When that happens, remember this: Servants don't get better treatment than their masters. If they beat on me, they will certainly beat on you. (John 15:20 TM)
When the winds of persecution you face become gale force and your faith gets pushed to its limits, don’t give up or give in. When jokes, hate, even violence are catapulted at you, hit back with love. Trust God to help you to stand firm under attack, He will be judge. Find and underline these two Scriptures: 1) ‘If the world hates you, remember that it hated me first…I have chosen you out of the world, so you do not belong to it. That is why the world hates you’ (John 15:18-19 NCV) 2) ‘Christ suffered for you and gave you an example to follow… People insulted Christ, but he did not insult them in return. Christ suffered, but he did not threaten. He let God, the one who judges rightly, take care of him’ (1 Peter 2:21-23 NCV). Remember, whatever happens, God will take care of you!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>LIVE GENEROUSLY AND GRACIOUSLY TOWARD OTHERS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 5:48 TM</span><br>Here’s how Jesus says we should respond to those who mistreat us:
‘Here’s another old saying that deserves a second look: ‘Eye for eye, tooth for tooth.’ Is that going to get us anywhere? Here’s what I propose: ‘Do not hit back at all.’ If someone strikes you, stand there and take it. If someone drags you into court and sues for the shirt off your back, gift wrap your best coat and make a present of it. And if someone takes unfair advantage of you, use the occasion to practice the servant life. No more tit-for-tat stuff. Live generously. You are familiar with the old written law, ‘Love your friend,’ and its unwritten companion, ‘Hate your enemy.’ I’m challenging that. I’m telling you to love your enemies. Let them bring out the best in you, not the worst. When someone gives you a hard time, respond with the energies of prayer, for then you are working out of your true selves, your God-created selves. This is what God does. He gives his best – the sun to warm and the rain to nourish – to everyone, regardless: the good and bad, the nice and nasty. If all you do is love the loveable, do you expect a bonus? Anybody can do that. If you simply say hello to those who greet you, do you expect a medal? Any run-of-the-mill sinner does that. In a word, what I’m saying is, Grow up. You are kingdom subjects. Now live like it. Live out your God-created identity. Live generously and graciously toward others, the way God lives toward you’ (Matthew 5:38-48 TM).
Need I say more? Enough said! ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Let the Lord Jesus Christ be as near to you as the clothes you wear. Then you won't try to satisfy your selfish desires</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 13:14 CEV</span><br>Here’s three things that give you victory and the devil a battering:
1) Soaking yourself in the Scriptures. Listen to this: ‘Man does not live by bread alone, but on every word that comes out of the mouth of God’ (Matthew 4:4). Three times satan tried to get Jesus to listen to his lies, but each time Jesus slammed back with ‘It is written’ followed by words of truth from scripture. After the third attempt satan left Him alone because he cannot get his warped way when we know God’s Word and believe it. Have your ‘It is written’ ready. Get to know and learn Word of God before the attack comes
2) Developing the habit of prayer. Prayer puts a shield of divine protection over you. Don’t try to live without it. Check out what Jesus said: ‘Stay alert; be in prayer so you do not wander into temptation’ (Matthew 26:41 TM). Unless we clock on to how easily we get caught up in sin we won’t pray against it and then we’ll always be vulnerable. The most effective weapon the enemy has against you – is you! The bible says your old nature must be crucified daily. The selfish, rude, cruel you needs to be killed off everyday! Prayer is how you do that
3) Clear out what drags you down. A book or magazine, a certain tv show or web site, a place or person. We all have things that get in the way of living God’s way. The new believers in Ephesus brought out all their old books of witchcraft and pornography and burned them in the town square. Sound extreme? Paul says, ‘Make no provision for the flesh.’ Be ruthless with yourself. Satan is like a parasite always trying to grab on to your life. If you give Satan a toe hold he’ll turn it into a strangle hold! What do you need to clear out of your life?]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...I OPPOSED HIM TO HIS FACE, BECAUSE HE WAS CLEARLY IN THE WRONG.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GALATIANS 2:11 NIV</span><br>Prejudice means we accept without question the opinions we hear growing up, the drivel churned out by the media, and the viewpoints of narrow-minded people. Growing up is learning to ask 'Is this right?' or more importantly, 'Is it Christ-like?' Prejudice throws people on the junk heap because of their colour, their gender, their bank balance, their post-code, or the beliefs they choose to follow.

Often we can be so blind to our prejudices that we'll even crack jokes at other people's expense - and invent horrible names to call them.  If you act like that don't expect God to be laughing with you.  God stirred up Paul to confront Peter over his racial prejudice. Listen: '...I opposed him to his face, because he was clearly in the wrong' (Galatians 2:11 NIV). Did Paul excuse Peter because he had so many other good qualities? No! Peter's attitude and actions were wounding people and reflecting badly on God, Who '...loved the world so much that he gave his one and only Son, so that whoever believes in him may not be lost, but have eternal life' (John 3:16 NCV).

In previous generations wars have gone on and all sorts of pain has been caused - and the bottom line has been prejudice of one kind or another. Before you can deal with the prejudice passed on to your generation you've first got to deal with it in your own life. Are you ready to do that - to genuinely start looking at people through the eyes of Jesus?  Start to speak positive things about the people you've dissed in the past - and your heart will soon catch up.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>SO THAT SATAN WILL NOT OUTSMART US...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 2:11 NLT</span><br>Today we'll look at three effective strategies to help you fight temptation - and win:

1) expect it.  Temptation begins in your mind. Unless you expect temptation you won't prepare for it. Any defeat you've suffered was first a battle lost in your mind, so as a young person with a big destiny - wise up  'so that satan will not outsmart us...'  (2 Corinthians 2:11 NLT)

2) detect it. Ask God to help you detect satan's advances and brace yourself for the impact. An ink-stained wall in Wartburg Castle, Germany, illustrates the point. A radical 16th century Christian, Martin Luther, suddenly detected the enemy's presence when he was praying. The story goes that he picked up an inkpot and hurled it at the devil and it smashed against the wall. Luther sensed satan's sinister advance and responded the best way he knew how. Sound extreme? Maybe, but do you have that kind of spiritual sensitivity?

3) reject it. Don't start playing games with the devil- you'll get hurt. Listen: 'Submit yourselves then to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you' (James 4:7 NIV). Satan wants you do the reverse; resist God and submit to him - that's a trap!  If you're fighting temptation today listen: '...our high priest [Jesus] is able to understand our weaknesses ...he was tempted in every way that we are, but he did not sin. Let us, then, feel very sure that we can come before God's throne where there is grace. There we can receive mercy and grace to help us when we need it' (Hebrews 4:15-16 NCV).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THEY COULD NOT GET TO JESUS THROUGH THE CROWD, SO THEY DUG THROUGH THE CLAY ROOF ABOVE HIS HEAD...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MARK 2:4 NLT</span><br>What's stopping you from getting to Jesus today? Guilt over what you have or haven't done? Disappointment in church or Christians? When the four guys carrying their paralysed friend arrived at the house where Jesus was preaching, they couldn't get through the crowd. Nothing about bringing this man to Jesus was easy; they had to make it happen! At that point they'd a choice to make: give up and go home, or try to find a way through. They went for option two and decided to climb up and dig 'through the clay roof above His head'.  When they finally broke through and Jesus 'saw their faith, he said...&quot;Son, your sins are forgiven&quot;' (vs. 5 NIV).

Whatever 'roof' is separating you and those you love from Jesus, it can be removed! Tear it off! Don't let any obstacle stand in your way. You can have great mates, a fresh start, good results and a healthy life if you are determined to break through to the presence of Jesus.

These men were radical in their approach. They didn't just have faith, they had faith in action. They'd come to see Jesus and some dried mud was not about to stop them. As they dug through the roof they knew they were tantalisingly close to the answer and they weren't going to be put off. No matter how hard it seems, keep going! You're closer to a break-through than you realise, so start dig, dig and dig some more.  Don't stop until you feel the pleasure of his presence and hear his words of grace to you.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>FOUR MEN ARRIVED CARRYING A PARALYSED MAN ON A MAT</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MARK 2:3 NLT</span><br>This man on the stretcher was no lightweight; it took four men to carry him! Want to be a soul-winner? A family-uniter? A community-changer? They are some of the greatest things you can do. But be warned, bringing people to Jesus is not always an easy job, it involves:

1) being sensitive to their needs. Chances are someone close to you right now is lying on a 'stretcher' inwardly. Oh, they look like they've got it together, but don't be fooled by their front. They're hurting, and paralyzed - and they know it. Whenever they're alone they're crying out, 'God, unless you help me I'm finished'

2) carrying them all the way. Many Christians want to see people set free, but only if it doesn't involve personal sacrifice. That's not how it works. Deciding to bring somebody to Jesus means bringing them all the way. It means comforting, encouraging and holding them securely until He touches them.

3) leaving the healing to Jesus. David cried, '...lead me to the towering Rock of safety' (Psalm 61:2 NLT). Hurting people know what they need - and so does Jesus. So once you get them to Him, stand back and watch the Master at work. We tend to look for outward signs of change, but Jesus first addressed this paralyzed man's inner condition, where it really counted (v5), before completing the outer work. Don't dismiss God because He works in ways that don't make sense to you. Rest assured, when He starts working on them, He'll '...keep at it and bring it to a flourishing finish...' (Philippians 1:6 TM).

'...THERE WILL BE NO MORE DEATH OR MOURNING...' REVELATION 21:4 NIV



Think about some of the ways we deal with death: 

1) through humour. Woody Allen joked, &quot;It's not that I'm afraid to die, I just don't want to be there when it happens.&quot; Somehow laughing about it seems to keep death at a safe distance 

2) through denial. Just don't talk about death, remove it from all conversation. That's easier than re-ordering our lives in the light of it

3) through traditions. Elaborate floral arrangements and graceful hymns dress death in a strange beauty - which helps people avoid its ugliness. But the Bible calls death 'the last enemy...' (1 Corinthians 15:26 NIV)  

4) through fear. Lots of people are really scared of death - check out the other passengers when air turbulence causes your flight to get a big bumpy!

Sooner or later we're all forced to face death head-on, it's not funny, it's real, it's not beautiful - but thank God it needn't be fearful. Death may be the end of your earthly life, but it won't be the end of you. Paul, who had an amazing vision of heaven, came back and reminded his friends life there is '...better by far' (Philippians 1:23 NIV) because Jesus is there! Remember your most treasured memory, your greatest accomplishment, your most precious relationship, then think '...better by far' Listen to this, from near the very end of the Bible, '...God himself will be with them.  He will remove all their sorrows and there will be no more death, or sorrow, or crying or pain.  For the old world and its evils are gone forever...' (Revelation 21.3-4 NLT).  But remember that the Bible's very clear - you don't get to heaven by chance, you go by choice.  You must first accept Jesus as Boss of your life.  Have you done that yet?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...THE WEAKER I GET, THE STRONGER I BECOME.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>CORINTHIANS 12:10 TM</span><br>Paul writes: 'I came to you in weakness - timid and trembling.  And my message and my preaching were very plain.  I did not use wise and persuasive speeches but the Holy Spirit was powerful among you.' (1 Corinthians 2:3-4 NLT). Writing to the same people a few years later he says, '...we are like clay jars that hold the treasure.  This shows that the great power is from God, not from us' (2 Corinthians 4:7 NCV).

Paul didn't just acknowledge his limitations, he found them to be God's way of using him even more effectively. Listen: 'After these incredible visions it's easy to get cocky, but to keep my feet on the ground I got this stab wound from satan - the blade's still in there.  It's agony; it does my head in.  Three times I'm there begging the Boss to pull it out for me, but he says, &quot;All I've given you is plenty to drown out the pain of a tiny flick knife.  Anyway, my energy works best when your energy's on zero&quot;.  So now I love bragging about my lack of energy, my weakness - 'cos then the liberator's power really kicks in...I'm over the moon about all the things that make me weak: the slurs, the hassles, the victimisation, the problems.  For when I've no energy of my own, it's bizarre, but that's when I'm at my strongest' (2 Corinthians 12:7-10 Street). Regardless of how long you have walked with the Saviour, every ounce of your ability comes from Him, not you. Let that sink in today, chew it over and never forget it!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...IT IS GOD WHO MAKES US ABLE TO DO ALL THAT WE DO.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 CORINTHIANS 3:5 NCV</span><br>Let's face it: most of us don't wake up in the morning feeling invincible! No, we're very aware of our limitations when it comes to things like getting along with our family, fulfilling the demands of school, college and work, keeping on going in spite of pain and illness, confronting difficult situations, battling a bad habit, or finding the strength to keep pushing ahead when our dreams have crashed and burned.  But we pretend we've got it together. We act like we're capable of handling any situation when we know we're really not.

You might be surprised to hear that one guy who constantly struggled to cope was the Apostle Paul. He wrote: '...Who is able to do this work?' (2 Corinthians 2:16 NCV). However - even when he felt swamped Paul enjoyed remarkable success. How? Listen: 'We are not saying that we can do this work ourselves.  It is God who makes us able to do all that we do' (2 Corinthians 3:5 NCV). Without God and the power He pours into us we're totally sunk! This is tough for the independent 'stand on my own two feet' generation to swallow. It grates on our egos to think, 'Without God I don't know what the right thing to do is, or how to do it the right way, or where the power to do it will come from. So I must choose to rely on Him at all times.' But once you embrace those words and begin to live by them, you are standing on the threshold of the life you have always wanted.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>CREATE IN ME A PURE HEART, O GOD...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 51:10 NIV</span><br>Tough-guy Samson went too far. He ended up blinded and ridiculed by his captors in a Philistine dungeon. Why? Because of two unguarded areas: pride and sex. King David also struggled against unrelenting temptation. In a moment of weakness he gave in to lust and paid dearly. But his life took a different route to Samson, because deep down he was 'a man after God's own heart.' What made the difference? Repentance! In brokenness and gutsy honesty David got real with God and found mercy and grace to get back up. Stop and ask yourself, 'Am I living a secret life that only God and I know about? Have I allowed myself to become so addicted to my sin that I fear there's no possibility of turning back?'

It's never too late to start doing what's right. You can't sink so deep that Christ is unable to lift you. Repentance is the place to start. Repentance means turning around 180° from your sin, confessing your failure and recognising your inability to change on your own. It means asking for God's strength. Stop making excuses for what you're doing; you're only fooling yourself. You may have kept it a secret so far, but ultimately you'll be found out. Don't go another day without falling on your knees before God and praying, '...cleanse me from my sin... Create in me a pure heart, O God...' (Psalm 51:2&amp;10 NIV). 

When you've done business with God, reach for people who can strengthen and encourage you. Don't keep pressing on alone, you won't succeed. Get back in the race and run like never before!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>IT MATTERS VERY LITTLE TO ME WHAT YOU THINK OF ME...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 CORINTHIANS 4:3 TM</span><br>While we should respect other people's opinions, we should never be ruled by them. If you let it criticism will steal your individuality, rob you of your creativity, and stop you from fulfilling your destiny. That's too much power to give anybody. Insecure people will always criticise you, especially if your choices are more radical than theirs. That's because they're uncomfortable with things that don't fit the limits of their thinking. Secure people can handle being the 'odd one out'. They can allow others the freedom to be different and to make their own choices. That's because they themselves are secure in who God has called them to be.

Jesus obviously wasn't too concerned about what others thought of Him. Listen: 'He made himself nothing...' (Philippians 2:7 NLT). He had a goal: to do His Father's will; no more and no less. And He knew that to do it He had to be free from other people's opinions. So do you! The greatest tragedy that could happen to you would be to grow old and realise that somewhere along the way you lost yourself and never succeeded at being the person God called you to be. And that's a distinct possibility if you allow the opinions of other people to rule your life. Paul says, 'It matters very little to me what you think of me, even less where I rank in popular opinion. I don't even rank myself...The Master makes that judgment' (1 Corinthians 4:3-5 TM). Today ask God to set you free from other people's opinions.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>HE WILL GIVE YOU ALL YOU NEED FROM DAY TO DAY IF YOU LIVE FOR HIM...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 6:33 NLT</span><br>It's great to have a circle of friends whose company you enjoy.  And it's great to find a 'special someone' who you can share your life with.  But being around other people isn't the only way to be happy. Get rid of the idea that anybody's company is better than your own. At the end of the day no one but God can fill the spiritual emptiness within us. Think about that for a minute and you'll realise that often the answer to loneliness is not people - it is purpose, it is not an absence of affection but a lack of direction.

John had no friends on Patmos; it was a prison island - like Alcatraz!  But it was there that God showed him the glories of heaven. As a result, we have the Book of Revelation. Paul was in prison when he wrote most of his greatest stuff. Could you do that? 

When other people say nice things about you it reflects their opinion of you. In the same way, when you speak well of yourself it reflects your opinion of yourself, and you have to live with you every day - so enjoy your own company! Loneliness is only a halfway house on your journey from companionship to contentment.  Contentment is when your options seem to close in the natural realm but doors suddenly swing open in the spiritual realm and you begin to see the possibility of having the kind of relationship with God you never had before.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>BE ON GUARD.  STAND TRUE TO WHAT YOU BELIEVE.  BE COURAGEOUS.  BE STRONG.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 CORINTHIANS 16:13 NLT</span><br>Where did we get the idea that everybody has to like us? Certainly not from God's Word. Jesus said His blessings are especially for the 'persecuted and insulted' (see Matthew 5:10-11). If you are 'thin-skinned' you will have a tough time facing life's challenges.  That's why perseverance counts more than popularity. The Apostle Paul had to put up with being deserted by his friends, getting awkward letters from the Corinthians, being let down by the Galatians, mistreated by the Philippians, mocked by the Athenians, then imprisoned and beheaded by the Romans. So what are you complaining about? Writing to the Corinthians Paul mentions four things you need to pay careful attention to:

a) be on guard! The enemy is out to get you. What's he after? The deposit of God that is within you. You're a seed capable of producing a harvest for God in the earth, so protect yourself! b) stand true to what you believe! You can't stand on your present circumstances or the opinions of others because those things constantly change. No, you can only stand on the Word of God. Are you? c) be courageous! Being childish won't cut it when the battle rages. It is time to grow up. Will you still be making the same excuses in ten years time or will you realise today is the day to get involved? d) be strong! Weakness is an invitation to your enemy. It always precedes surrender, and quitting is not an option for you! God told His people that the Promised Land was theirs, but they had to fight for it. And He's saying the same to you today!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...WHOEVER ACCEPTS ANYONE I SEND ACCEPTS ME...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 13:20 NIV</span><br>Too many of us don't reach for help because we have an image to uphold. That's dangerous! To grow we must be open to the Lord, AND to whoever He sends our way. Listen: 'He was in the desert for 40 days and was tempted by satan...and the angels came and took care of him' (Mark 1:13 NCV). Even Jesus needed strength from others. With no food for 40 days He was very hungry and satan tried to take advantage of this weakness: '...change these stones into loaves of bread' (Matthew 4:3 NLT). One of the hardest things to do is say 'no' when you have the chance to fulfil a real need in a wrong way.

Even though He created the angels, Jesus let them care for Him. The greater was willing to receive help from the lesser. What a lesson for us. When your pain level gets high enough you would not care who God uses! If you were ill you wouldn't care who the doctor was, would you? Their accent or skin colour would mean nothing because of the urgency of your need.

Perhaps you need someone, but you don't trust anyone. Trust God! Who do you think brought you this far? Listen: '&quot;The mountains may disappear, and the hills may come to an end, but my love will never disappear; my promise of peace will not come to an end&quot;, says the Lord'. (Isaiah 54:10 NCV). When God extends His love to you, do not be too proud to accept it, whatever form it comes in. When you accept God's helpers, you are accepting Him!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>YOU WILL SEEK ME AND FIND ME WHEN YOU SEEK ME WITH ALL YOU HEART.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JEREMIAH 29:13 NIV</span><br>Want to improve your prayer life? Today, we'll take some advice from Francois Fenelon, a 17th century French priest: 'Tell God all that is in your heart, as one unloads one's heart, its pleasures and its pains, to a dear friend. Tell Him your troubles that He may comfort you; tell Him your longings that He may purify them; tell Him your dislikes that He may help you conquer them; talk to Him of your temptations that He may shield you from them; show Him the wounds of your soul that He may heal them; lay bare your indifference to good, your depraved taste for evil, your instability. Tell Him how self-love makes you unjust to others, how vanity tempts you to be insincere, how pride hides you from yourself and from others. If you thus pour out all your weaknesses, needs and troubles, there will be no lack of what to say. You will never exhaust the subject, for it is continually being renewed.

'People who have no secrets from each other never want for subjects of conversation. They do not weigh their words for there is nothing to be held back. Neither do they seek for something to say. They talk out of the abundance of their heart. Without consideration they simply say just what they think. When they ask, they ask in faith, confident that they will be heard. Blessed are those who attain to such familiar, unreserved communication with God'.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...GIVE YOURSELVES FULLY TO THE WORK OF THE LORD...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 CORINTHIANS 15:58 NIV</span><br>A career is something you choose; a calling is something you are given. A career is something you do for yourself; a calling is something you do for God. A career might promise status, money or power but a calling generally promises difficulty and suffering - with the opportunity to be used by God. A career may end with retirement and lots of executive toys; a calling isn't over until the day you die. A career can be disrupted by any number of events; but when God calls you He enables you to fulfil your calling even in the most difficult circumstances.

For some people in the Bible, the call of God involved living in slavery, going on a long, dangerous journey or being put to death!  And not just in Scripture. Charles Colson had one of the most high profile careers in America. He had access to power and influence, but he ended up in prison. He thought his career was over - and in a way he was right. But his calling was just beginning. He was called to reach prisoners just like him. He reflects: 'The real legacy of my life was my biggest failure - that I was an Ex-convict. My great humiliation - being sent to prison - was the beginning of God's greatest use of my life; He chose the one experience in which I could not glory, for His glory.' Sometimes in the plans of God, you have to sacrifice a career to connect with your calling. Think about it!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...WHAT WE SUFFER NOW IS NOTHING COMPARED TO THE GLORY HE WILL GIVE US LATER.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ROMANS 8:18 NLT</span><br>Receiving God's call is not the same thing as falling into your dream career. When God called Jeremiah to preach to people who wouldn't listen, he cried so much he became known as 'the weeping prophet.' Our first response to a God-sized calling can often be panic or fear. Bible teacher Henry Blackaby writes: 'Some people say &quot;God will never ask me to do something I cannot do.&quot; I have come to the place in my life that if the assignment I sense God giving me is something I know I can handle, I know it is probably not from God. The kind of assignments God gives in the Bible are always God-sized. They are always beyond what people can do, because He wants to demonstrate His nature, His strength...and His kindness ...to a watching world.'

Saying 'yes' to God's call could mean putting in hours of work and effort when you'd rather not. Maybe it won't involve the kind of recognition you've always hoped for. People may fall out with you and diss what you are trying to do. For sure it'll involve trial and error and some false starts. Can you go with that? 

Natural talent alone is not enough to take on a calling from God. You will need to pray for strength and creativity beyond what you currently have to do what He asks of you. And it will have to be God and you doing it together. You are not just called to work for God, you are called to work with Him!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS GOD WORKS IN OUR LIVES, BUT IT IS THE SAME GOD...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>CORINTHIANS 12:6 NLT</span><br>
Discovering your calling involves very careful listening. If you're lying on your bed with your headphones on and Green Day blasting in your ears from your MP3 player, you're not likely to hear your mum shouting to tell you that your dinner's ready.  In the same way, if you want to hear God calling you to your destiny, you're gonna have to get away from the other noisy things in your life.  Stop and think - what in your life is creating excess noise that is making it hard for you to hear God?

Getting connected to your calling will affect the way you relate to the world around you. Skilled potters know that as they knead and press clay, it presses back, telling them what it can and can't become. Amateur potters just haven't developed that 'feel'; and their shoddy pots prove it!  As the Holy Spirit works in your life, you will also learn how to 'feel' the world around you differently; and respond to what you 'feel' more sensitively.

Philosopher Mortimor Adler speaks of those brilliant minds that have been called to sit at the table of what he calls 'the great conversation of the human race.' Well, guess what? Ninety-nine percent of us will never sit at that table! But we can still hear '...Well done, good and faithful servant...' (Matthew 25:23 NIV). That's a promise to all who hear God's call, accept it, and give their lives fully to it.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...LORD, IF IT IS YOU, COMMAND ME TO COME TO YOU ON THE WATER.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 14:28 NAS</span><br>Correctly hearing God's calling usually involves lots of attempts and failures. You won't just wake up one morning with your calling suddenly clarified and your gifts suddenly developed. Before Peter walked on the water he said, 'Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water.' Jesus said, 'Come.' There's a lesson here for you, and it's wrapped up in that tiny little word 'if'.  Before he took his 'leap of faith', Peter wanted to be sure that it was Jesus calling him.  And before you get out of whatever your 'boat' is, you'd better be clear that Jesus is the One doing the calling. God's not looking for impulsiveness. Sometimes we make reckless decisions about relationships, money or future plans, then try to justify ourselves with spiritual jargon.  Don't do it; the only one who's gonna sink is you!

In many books risk-taking is highly praised. But your risk-taking must be in obedience to God. If you have a thrill-seeking personality, you really need to listen here. Boredom can make you vulnerable. It can tempt you to solve your problems by making a rash decision that is not in line with God's will. The line between 'do not be afraid,' and 'do not be stupid' is one that is easily blurred! Knowing when to get out of the boat and take a risk doesn't just call for courage, it calls for wisdom to ask the right questions, listening to recognize the Master's voice, and patience to wait till He says 'Come!'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...EACH ONE OF YOU IS A SEPARATE AND NECESSARY PART</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 CORINTHIANS 12:27 NLT</span><br>The disciples came from very different backgrounds: a fisherman; a tax collector; a terrorist. Seem like strange choices? No, the Lord knows all of our strengths and weaknesses. He never makes mistakes because He created the Master Plan; including the part you are supposed to play in it.

The great thing is when you know He chose you; you no longer need the approval of other people to feel good about yourself. Whether you're outspoken like Peter or gentle like John, He accepts you and gives you space (and grace) to be who you are.

Everybody doesn't have to be like you in order for you to work with them or enjoy hanging out with them. Paul says, 'the body has many parts...[God] has put each...where he wants it...all of you together are one body...each one of you is a separate and necessary part' (1 Corinthians 12:14,18,27 TLB). Did you get that? You have an important part to play, just like all the other people you've met in your life. There are no unnecessary parts!

Do not let anybody intimidate you into giving up your individuality. If two of us were identical, one of us would be unnecessary. It is ok to admire somebody else's talent so long as you don't try to be a replica version of them. Learn from everyone; copy no-one. God loves you just the way you are! Listen, '...we have become gifts to God that He delights in...we were chosen from the beginning to be His' (Ephesians 1:11 TLB).]]></introtext>

Paul writes, '...all things happen just as he decided long ago' (Ephesians 1:11 TLB). Notice, it says 'all things'. That includes the things you want to run from!

When Jonah tried to run from God's will, God's response was clear; 'No way. My Word is already established. If I let you escape, I wouldn't be God. If I have to send tornadoes, rock your boat, shake up your comfort zone or put your entire life on hold, I'll do it in order to accomplish my purpose.'  When Jonah could go no lower, he cried out and God saved him; just in time to preach to the lost people of Nineveh. You can do it the easy way or the hard way; who's gonna give in first; you or God! David said, 'Thy way...is in the sanctuary...' (Psalm 77:13 KJV). He also said, 'Thy way is in the sea [storm]...' (Psalm 77:19 KJV). The choice is yours.

You've been chosen for a purpose; God has too much invested in you to let you run away when you don't like what's on the road ahead. When He calls you, go for it. If you have to leave behind a relationship, a habit or a lifestyle, go for it. You will know it's God, because you'll be able to leave behind those things that once seemed important for those things that God has revealed are of much greater value. Aren't you glad He chose you?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...IF YOU ACCEPT CRITICISM, YOU WILL BE HONOURED.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 12:1 NLT</span><br>Christ-like confrontation involves risking rejection. It calls for putting the other person's need for character above your own need for comfort. So how can you do that?

1) be sure! Be sure there's a good reason to confront. Confrontation should be a rare event, not an everyday activity, you shouldn't look forward to the experience! If you do, stop and examine your motives. Are you feeling superior? Are you directing your anger over some other issue against this person? Are you lifting yourself up by putting them down? 

2) be specific! Being fuzzy and vague leads to confusion, no matter how tactful and gracious your words. Make sure you know the reason for the confrontation, then make that reason clear to the other person

3) be sensitive! Every person is unique. Some proper soul-searching and prayer should come before any face-to-face encounter. Without that you are cruising for a bruising! Pay careful attention to timing because the person you are confronting will be able to sense any uncertainty and uneasiness in your words. Don't run that risk. If you haven't taken the time to pray and seek godly counsel on the matter, stop. Don't push yourself into this on your own! We've all seen that type of Clint Eastwood; &quot;go-ahead-make-my-day&quot; approach. Without fail it leaves a bloody trail of wounded souls. Make sure your choice of words and tone of voice fit the person you are dealing with when your heart is beating fast always keep your own personal agenda in check. None of this is about you! That kind of Christ-like confrontation is the only way forward.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...IF YOU ACCEPT CRITICISM, YOU WILL BE HONOURED.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 13:18 NLT</span><br>Nobody enjoys confrontation, but it's impossible to grow without it. Confrontation is speaking the truth in a personal, face-to-face encounter. God lovingly confronts us in areas where we need to grow, and He expects us to do the same with others. Is it easy? No! Is it stressful? Absolutely! So, here are four guiding principles to help you:

1) don't talk about them, talk to them. Confrontation is useless when it's indirect and can be a nightmare done publicly. Be clear and thoughtful about what you say, find the right setting, then be firm but gracious

2) provide examples - without the added exaggeration, or emotion! Don't beat around the bush or try to hide behind 'I believe the Lord has shown me that you are wrong'. When Nathan confronted King David about his sin with Bathsheba he got straight to the point - and did it very cleverly (see 2 Samuel 12). Be careful to keep your emotions in check. Make some time between the issue and the confrontation so that you can pray about any anger you may feel

3) show them a better way. Don't leave someone to stew without clear direction on how to improve. That's not fair and not constructive. Actually, it can lead to more intense issues and unwanted complications. The best approach is simple.  Identify the problem then calmly suggest ways it can be corrected. Your goal should be to help them, not put them on a guilt-trip

4) show compassion and understanding. Don't miss this part! If you do, you'll find yourself accusing rather than confronting. Be honest, hasn't your own journey involved lots of failures? So confront people with love and genuine concern.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>HE HEALS THE BROKEN HEARTED...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 147:3 NIV</span><br>Are you recovering from a broken relationship? If so, don't rush into another one. Take your time. Unhealthy people make unhealthy choices. Some wounds take longer to heal than others, but you can count on this: 'He heals the broken hearted'. All God asks is that you give Him a chance.

Begin by taking time to search His Word and find out how He feels about you. His opinion is the only reliable basis upon which to base your self-worth. If a perfect God can love you with full knowledge of your struggles and imperfections, then the message is lighten up on yourself! 

You can love and be loved again, but first you need to recover your wholeness, the good feeling about yourself inside.  Then, you can be sure your choices are good ones, not influenced by unhealthy need or the fear of being alone. And be careful; when you don't value yourself you tend to attract people who do the same, including those who use you and belittle you. You deserve better so hold out for it. Remember, you show others how to treat you by how you treat yourself. 

As you go through this process some people may walk away. So? Sometimes you have to give up what's less in order to have what's more. God's got wonderful relationships in store for you, but nothing is going to click until your values and your perceptions line up with His. So follow where God's leading you, step-by-step, one day at a time. Let yourself smile again... your best days are ahead!

Did no one condemn you?&quot; She said, &quot;No one, Lord.&quot; And Jesus said, &quot;I do not condemn you, either. Go. From now on sin no more&quot;' (John 8:3-11 NAS). Notice two things:

1) those who are the most unqualified to condemn you, will! Stay away from modern day Pharisees who take pleasure in exposing your sin, lifting themselves up by putting you down. Find your friends among those who celebrate God's grace and know how to extend it to others

2) the One most qualified to condemn you, won't! Stay close to Him. By doing that, you gain strength much more quickly. Christ will bring his light to your dark places and heal the wounds of your past because His grace is greater than your shame. Where sin accuses, His grace shouts louder! There's no stubborn stain of shame He can't dissolve because there's no limit to the grace He can supply. If you are reading this, feeling conscious of your shameful past and stubborn sinful ways, come to Jesus. He's ready to forgive you and set you free; He says, 'Go and sin no more'.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THOMAS...WAS NOT WITH THE DISCIPLES WHEN JESUS CAME.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 20:24 NIV</span><br>How do you get through your doubts? Like Thomas - by facing them honestly, then bringing them to Jesus. Too many of us have received the message of Christianity but placed it in a box marked 'Do not ask - do not tell.' Do you feel like you need permission to weep when you lose a loved one? Do you lack the freedom to admit, 'I really don't know for sure?'

'So is it ok to doubt?'  Yes, it's ok - in fact sometimes it's necessary to help you grow. It's actually quite dangerous to go round with a head full of someone else's answers, which were never really relevant to your questions...that is, if you are even honest enough to ask questions. Are you? Or has some religious bully pushed you into a corner, telling you that your questions are an offence to Jesus? Listen again to the tender words of the One who knows your doubts and fears better than you do. He says, 'Peace be with you. Look at My nail-torn hands and feet. Look with eyes of faith and believe. You are blessed when you choose to believe in spite of your doubts.'

Why not pray today: 'Lord, like Thomas, I still struggle with some doubts. I have not put my life all together yet. Not until I'm with You will that happen. Thank You for accepting me in my struggles and not ignoring my questions. Thomas finally reached the place where he could say, 'My Lord and my God.' Thank You for being patient with me as I try to get to that place too.'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THOMAS...WAS NOT WITH THE DISCIPLES WHEN JESUS CAME.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 20:24 NIV</span><br>It's far too easy to put Thomas down for having doubts, especially when we have so many of our own. Thomas wasn't there when Jesus first appeared to His disciples after the resurrection. The experience of his mates wasn't enough for him; he had to have his own. And he got it!  Jesus understands that we will have questions to ask about things we find difficult to understand or believe.  Doubts will always pop up in an honest search for truth. Now listen: 'Eight days later the disciples were together again, and this time Thomas was with them. The doors were locked; but suddenly, as before, Jesus was standing among them... He said to Thomas, &quot;Put your finger here and see My hands.  Put your hand into the wound in My side; don't be faithless any longer.  Believe!&quot;' (John 20:26-27 NLT). There are two important lessons here for you:

1) honest doubt can lead to a greater relationship with Jesus. The testimony of other people can only carry you so far; ultimately you have to have your own experience with the Lord. And you can! Thomas started out doubting Jesus, but ended up giving his last breath to make Him known

2) honest doubt can lead to a new level of trust. When the bottom drops out, when the pain seems unbearable, when some shattering event occurs, doubts march in uninvited.  When they do there's no point pretending they aren't there.  Instead, let those times of doubting drive you to God and His Word for answers.  As you do that an amazing new level of trust is reached.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>UT ONE THING I DO. FORGETTING...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PHILIPPIANS 3:13 NLT</span><br>Are you struggling to forget what was done to you - or by you? Here's some good news. Contained in every promise God makes to you, is the power to fulfil it. In Phillippians 3v13, the great Apostle Paul chose to forget - and you can too! You can start by reading the following promises and personalizing them:

'...Do not fear disgrace; you will not be humiliated.  You will forget the shame of your youth...' (Isaiah 54:4 NIV). '...Forget what happened before, and do not think about the past.  Look at the new thing I am going to do.  It is already happening.  Don't you see it?  I will make a road in the desert and rivers in the dry land' (Isaiah 43:18-19 NCV). 'The former things will not be remembered, nor will they come to mind...be glad and rejoice forever in what I will create' (Isaiah 65:17-18 NIV). Notice the word 'create'. God can create order out of your chaos and beauty out of your ashes. 

Will the healing of your memories be instant or easy? No. You will do a lot of maturing and a lot of forgiving in the process, but listen: 'Jesus Christ, the Son of God...is the divine Yes - God's affirmation.  For all God's promises have been fulfilled in him.  That is why we say &quot;Amen&quot;...' (2 Corinthians 1:19-20 NLT). 

Today God wants to start healing those painful memories.  His grace is greater than your past. So, talk to Him!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...DON'T GET WORKED UP ABOUT WHAT MAY OR MAY NOT HAPPEN...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 6:34 TM</span><br>
What's making you worry? Take a closer look and you will probably find yourself doing the following things:

1) adding unnecessary pressures. You quickly lose your laughter when you think too much about the unnecessary pressure of how you look, or what you have or haven't got.  And it will stress you out if you try to fix everybody or live up to their expectations. A Chaplain called Peter Marshall prayed, 'Father, check our impulse to spread ourselves so thin that we're exposed to weariness and impatience that makes our tempers wear thin, robs us of peace of mind, makes skies grey when they should be blue and stifles a song along the corridor of our hearts'

2) leaving God out of the equation. Listen: 'The Lord tells his secrets to those who respect him...' (Psalm 25:14 NCV). Friendship with God is built by sharing all your life experiences with Him: every activity, every conversation, every problem and every thought. When you don't, you end up becoming unaware of His presence, insensitive to His voice, resistant to His correction, and out of sync with His timing. Living your life like that produces only one result - worry!

3) dividing life into the spiritual and unspiritual. You've not forgotten what we read yesterday already have you?  All that stuff Jesus was saying is totally relevant to us today.  Jesus was saying loud and clear that God is interested in all of your life - not just the 'holy' bits like praying and singing worship songs!  Open up fully to God today and leave your worrying behind.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…CARELESS IN THE CARE OF GOD…</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 6:26 TM</span><br>A guy called Eugene Peterson has re-written the whole Bible in up-to-date language; he calls it, 'The Message'.  In this bit he takes the words of Jesus: 
'If you decide for God…it follows that you do not fuss about what's on the table at mealtimes or whether the clothes in your closet are in fashion. Look at the birds, free and unfettered, not tied down to a job description, careless in the care of God. And you count far more to Him than birds. Has anyone, by fussing in front of the mirror, ever gotten taller by so much as an inch? All this time and money wasted on fashion – do you think it makes that much difference? Instead of looking at the fashions, walk out into the fields and look at the wild flowers…The ten best-dressed men and women in the country look shabby alongside them. If God gives such attention to the appearance of wildflowers…do not you think He will attend to you, take pride in you, do His best for you? What I’m trying to do here is to get you to relax, to not be so preoccupied with getting, so you can respond to God’s giving. People who do not know God…fuss over these things, but you know both God and how He works… Do not worry about missing out. You will find all your everyday human concerns will be met. Give your entire attention to what God is doing right now, and do not get worked up about what may or may not happen tomorrow. God will help you deal with whatever hard things come up when the time comes…' (Matthew 6:26-34 TM). 
There’s life in the words of Jesus – so read those words again and let them do you good!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…SHE GAVE ALL SHE HAD TO LIVE ON.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MARK 12:44 NCV</span><br>There will be times in your life when God will challenge you to give money to a particular cause or person, more than you think you can afford. In that moment faith will leap in your heart and say ‘yes’, or fear will rise like a brick wall saying ‘no’. Your response to God’s challenge is really important because when God talks to you about giving your money as seed, He has a harvest in mind. Some giving levels are effortless, others make us uneasy. Sooner or later you’ll hit that wall called fear. Until you recognize it you will never be able to break through it. As a result you will live on the wrong side of what God wants you to enjoy. 
So how do you break through? You shatter your idea of ownership! If you believe everything truly belongs to God, what do you have to fear? If God controls the comings and goings of your money, there’s no reason not to give, right? Easier said than done – right? Surrendering control of your money is scary!
Jesus’ model for generous giving was a widow who gave her last penny; she had nothing to rely on but God’s promise to meet her needs. Think about it for a minute; what was she really doing when she put in that last penny?
God doesn’t want your generosity to be limited by fear. Either you’ll trust Him totally and experience the buzz of being in on His plans, or you’ll trust your piggy bank and try to get by without His help. The danger of holding your cash in tight fists is that you can miss out on something great that God wants to do for you – and through you!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>NOW JACOB LOVED JOSEPH MORE THAN ANY OF HIS OTHER CHILDREN …SO ONE DAY HE GAVE JOSEPH A SPECIAL GIFT</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 37:3 NLT</span><br>Joseph’s Dad gave him an amazing new coat.  He must’ve been absolutely buzzing about it – it was the flashiest, trendiest jacket for miles around!  Joseph’s brothers were well jealous though and started picking on him.  Unfortunately Joseph made matters worse by shooting off his mouth and sharing his weird dreams which made him sound like he was on a massive ego trip.  As long as Joseph was dazzled by his flashy coat, he couldn’t understand the struggles and frustrations of his brothers who’d worked just as hard, deserved their father’s love just as much, but always seemed to keep coming up short. The flashy coat made Joseph the centre of attention – but he didn’t know how to deal with it, he wasn’t ready for it.  Like so many people in the Bible, it would be suffering that brought out the best in Joseph – not success.  
Joseph’s destiny was to be the centre of attention; one day he would be Prime Minister of Egypt, but first he would spend years as a slave and prisoner. It was in the prison, not the palace, that he would learn his most important lessons.  God wanted Joseph to inspire people – not depress them!
Before he could lead people, he first had to understand them. To understand them he needed to stop thinking about what was best for him.  Maybe you get the impression that one day God will make you the centre of attention – well maybe He will – but you won’t get there by showing off how flash you are.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>HAPPY ARE THOSE WHO LISTEN TO ME, WATCHING AT MY DOOR EVERY DAY...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 8:34 NCV</span><br>It’s not what we do every now and again that makes the difference in our lives; it’s what we do every day. King David made a massive impact in his generation because he learned this secret.  He even wrote it in one of his songs: ‘I will praise you every day…’ (Psalm 145:2 NCV). So, every day, make time to be alone with God. If you have to, wedge your bedroom door closed or go out for a long walk. Like the cheesy advert says: ‘You’re worth it’. And here’s a tip for how to get the most out of your Word 4U 2Day; read it twice. You’ll be amazed at what you get the second time that you didn’t see the first time round. If something jumps off the page and speaks to you personally, underline it; it’s your magazine, you can do what you like with it. Always take a few moments to pray about what you’ve read too. Don’t be ‘religious’, just chat to God like you’d chat to a close friend. And don’t try to resolve all your character issues in one go, or you’ll get overwhelmed and quit. Just deal with one thing at a time as God reveals it to you. 
If your life is a bit random and unstructured you might need to slow down for a few minutes and try to work out if there are actually any patterns or rhythms involved.  For instance you might catch a certain bus at a certain time.  Or you might get a natural pause in between doing different things.  Maybe you can start making the most of these moments as a way of deliberately increasing the space for God in your life.  Then you can squeeze more and more until God is the first and last thing on your mind every day!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...DANIEL SPOKE TO HIM WITH WISDOM AND TACT.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>DANIEL 2:14 NIV</span><br>A few years ago a James Bond film was released called 'Tomorrow Never Dies'. As usual the swish spy was trying to save the world from a megalomaniac - a powerful media boss whose communications empire stretched around the globe. The baddie brags to Bond about his achievements, 'Soon I'll have reached out to and influenced more people than anybody in the history of this planet, save God himself.' Why do some people work so hard at becoming influential when others seem to be influential without even trying. What about you? How strong is your 'sphere of influence'? In other words; does the way you live your life really affect those around you; and for better or worse?

Looking at the life of Daniel we see that he was not only clever in a brainy sort of way; he was relationally intelligent too. And that's what influence is; who you are and what you know affects how other people think and act. In chapter 2 of Daniel, King Nebuchadnezzar was freaked out by a dream. His magicians couldn't help, so he decided to kill them; all the wise men in his kingdom; after all if they can't help what's the point of having them around! Unfortunately Daniel and his mates were included in the death threat. It's then that Daniel shows us a lesson about influence, 'When Arioch, the commander of the king's guard, had gone out to put to death the wise men of Babylon, Daniel spoke to him with wisdom and tact' (Daniel 2:14 NIV). Now insert your name instead of 'Daniel' - that's right, God wants you to be an influencer for Him too.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I KNOW THE PLANS I HAVE FOR YOU...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JEREMIAH 29:11 NIV</span><br>Head-faith says, 'I believe!' Heart-faith says, 'I believe it's so for me,' then acts on it. God says, 'I know the plans I have for you...plans to prosper you...to give you hope and a future' (Jeremiah 29:11 NIV). The Lord can take every negative thing that's happened to you and turn it into something positive, if you'll only work with Him and trust Him. He offers you beauty in exchange for ashes (check out Isaiah 61:3).

One lady wrote, 'A lot of very painful and abusive things happened to me that soured my attitude toward life. I was trapped in my past and I didn't believe I had a future. But as soon as I believed God's Word, I was released from my pain and began making progress toward the future God always had in mind for me.'

When Lazarus died, his sister Martha doubted that Jesus could do anything about it, so Jesus had to have strong words with her, 'Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?' (John 11:40 NIV). And he says the same thing to you! He's asking you to put your trust in Him and believe that you can do anything He asks you to do. 

The Bible says, '...let the weak say, I am strong' (Joel 3:10). So change what's coming out of your mouth! When you begin to shout out that you're strong, even though you're feeling weak, the Lord's strength will rise in you. Paul was practicing this super-sizing principle when he wrote, 'I can do everything through him who gives me strength' (Philippians 4:13 NIV). Go ahead and super-size your belief today!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...I WILL PUT A NEW WAY OF THINKING INSIDE YOU...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EZEKIEL 36:26 NCV</span><br>When Jesus talked about being '...born again...' (John 3:3), Nicodemus couldn't get his head around the idea that spiritual birth and physical birth are completely different. Jesus told Nic that it doesn't matter how religious you are, '...no one can enter the Kingdom...without being born of water and the Spirit' (John 3:5 NLT). Water, as in, 'Aaah - quick - her water's breaking!' refers to your natural birth. 'Spirit,' as in, 'Aha - I've totally got it - I've ignored Him all my life but now I know He's real!' refers to your spiritual birth. But the new birth doesn't merely erase your past and give you a fresh start. God says, 'I will put a new way of thinking inside you...and...give you obedient hearts. I will put my Spirit inside you and help you live by my rules.' God doesn't just tell you what to do, He gives you the power to do it!

'But if that's true why do I keep falling?' 

Why did you keep falling after your natural birth? Because your muscles weren't strong and the signals from your brain to your legs were haphazard! As a toddler you stumbled more than you walked. When you tripped as a toddler you didn't say, 'Oops, I've fallen again, maybe I was never born in the first place.' Mistakes don't undo your spiritual birth, they're part of growing up. Some of us just grow up faster than others. So be encouraged! '...He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion...' (Philippians 1:6 NIV).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>BE STRONG AND COURAGEOUS...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>DEUTERONOMY 31:6 NIV</span><br>The times we're most likely to hear about courage nowadays, is when the media reports how somebody was rescued from a burning building or pulled from a frozen lake.

But being a Christian takes courage every day! It takes courage to start the journey of faith, admit you're a sinner and commit your life to Christ. It takes even more courage to 'walk the talk' when the going gets tough. There's always temptation to quit that subject you hate, stop talking to your awkward sister, settle for being popular instead of godly, stay home and watch TV instead of going to church, or not bother sharing your faith with your mates.

Every day you must choose between doing what's right or what's convenient. Have you noticed convenience never requires courage; only doing what's right will flex your courage. Courage involves not staying in your comfort zone. In other words, you must decide between trusting God (even when you don't understand His ways), or living a life based on your own feelings and other people's opinions. 

Old faith-guy Abrahams was given one of the most severe tests in the whole Bible. The story is in Genesis 22.  God will test you to your limits too! Sometimes you'll need every ounce of courage you've got - and then some! But you can't have a testimony without a test! Just like God told Joshua, 'Be strong and courageous...' He'll give you strength to equal the test. The road may be rough and the enemy casts long shadows, but remember, '...the LORD your God goes with you, he will never leave you...' (Deuteronomy 31:6 NIV).

<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>LET ME BE WEIGHED ON HONEST SCALES, THAT GOD MAY KNOW MY INTEGRITY.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOB 31:6 NKJV</span><br>Integrity. It's a word which describes a life being well lived, a trustworthy person who stays cool under pressure. Bill Hybels - a Pastor of a massive church in Chicago - says, 'People who never use the word... look around them at promiscuity... abortion... sexually transmitted diseases, and mourn its passing. They see officials taking bribes, business leaders demanding kickbacks... investors parlaying inside information into untold wealth, and they lament the demise of integrity. They read about battered wives, jobless husbands and abused children, and wonder what happened to caring.'

Unlike your reputation which is how others see you, integrity is who you are when they're not looking. Listen: 'The integrity of the upright shall guide them...' (Proverbs 11:3). What does that mean? Rebuilding your integrity means admitting, 'Often my thoughts aren't fit to print,' or, 'I've hurt that person, I need to go back and make things right,' or, 'I've cheated on my taxes and I need to make restitution.' 

After Zacchaeus met Jesus he said, '...if I have cheated anybody out of anything, I will pay back four times the amount' (Luke 19:8 NIV). Integrity doesn't stop with regret, integrity doesn't seek to minimize painful consequences, and integrity doesn't attempt damage control. Integrity calls for honest repentance, and makes amends whenever possible. Integrity means living in an accountable way, with real honesty. Ancient God-follower Job said, 'Does He not see my ways...If I have walked with falsehood, or my foot has hastened to deceit? Let me be weighed on honest scales, that God may know my integrity?'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>..HE HAD COMPASSION ON THEM...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 9:36 NIV</span><br>When you see a homeless person asking for money on the street how do you feel? Maybe you feel sorry for them - maybe you want to help. But do you ever secretly feel you're better than them? Come on, be honest! Our society admires beauty, power, money, and idolises people who flaunt God's laws to get it: the glossy magazines and satellite TV channels reduce people to packaging with no consideration whatsoever for the contents inside. Who care's if their life's a mess - look at that ...no wonder people get puffed up with ego.

God says, 'Pride lands you flat on your face...' (Proverbs 29:23 TM). Why? Because it blinds you to the truth - then you're likely to trip up. Pride made Adam and Eve wants to play God (Genesis 3:5). Wounded pride caused Joseph's brothers to sell him into slavery (Genesis 37:8). Pride made King Saul so jealous, he wanted to kill David, 'the competition' (1Samuel 18:8). Pride made Hezekiah foolishly reveals his nation's secret wealth to the enemy (Isaiah 39:2). Pride caused the disciples to compete for the top spot in God's Kingdom (Luke 9:46). Don't let pride get you!

If anyone ever had a right to be proud and feel better than other people it was Jesus - the Bible describes Him as '...the radiance of God's glory, the exact representation of His being...' (Hebrews 1:3 NIV). Amazingly, the Bible also says, 'When He saw the multitudes, He was moved with compassion...because they fainted...as sheep having no shepherd' (Matthew 9:36). Jesus didn't see people as bad, He saw them as lost! Once you begin to do that, you're becoming a bit more like Jesus.

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>KEEP A SHARP EYE OUT FOR WEEDS OF BITTER DISCONTENT</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>.</span><br>Letting weeds of bitterness grow in your heart towards another person is one of the worst things for your spiritual life. The heaviest thing you'll ever carry is a grudge. It'll make you sour and miserable to be around.  

What happens is this: satan enters the picture and convinces you its okay to feel resentment. After all, you're only protecting yourself from getting hurt again, right? So  you dig in, justify your position and get comfortable living with the issue. That is - until it starts choking all the good fruit in your life! The reason God says 'keep a sharp eye out,' is because bitterness can spring up from anywhere: like an absent parent we can't forgive; an obsessive relationship we keep reliving; the careless words of a friend who's not even aware of their effect; why let grudges live rent-free in your head and in your heart!

What's the solution? Forgive - before the problem becomes totally embedded in your emotions and starts messing with your memories. Replaying old hurts drives them deeper until their roots are really tough to weed out. Paul said, 'Make a clean break...Forgive one another as quickly...as...Christ forgave you' (Ephesians 4:31-32 TM). And the sooner you do it the better! What about today? God's grace is a powerful weed killer - it gets right down to the root of the problem. The question today is - are you ready to let Him?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>MEMORIZE HIS LAWS...TELL THEM TO YOUR CHILDREN...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>DEUTERONOMY 6:6-7 CEV</span><br>Robert Orben jokes, 'I take my kids everywhere; but they always find their way back home!' So some parents do have a sense of humour after all! The truth is most parents didn't get the job by first doing a college course and then passing an interview. Your parents learned from theirs and most of what they picked up was probably subconscious. Even model-parents, who seem to have it all together, still fall short. The only One who never fails is our Heavenly Father; He's the ultimate parent. Here are some examples of His parenting style: 

He's got high expectations, but He's also understanding (Romans 2:4 NCV) 

He always serves His justice with big dollops of mercy (Isaiah 30:18 CEV) 

He teaches us through values, and rewards us for results (Galatians 6:7 CEV) 

He exercises His authority, but He's willing to share His power (Psalm 115:16 NIV) 

He insists on 'His way,' but also gives us the freedom to fail, recover and do it better next time (Galatians 5:1)

He protects us as we go through life, but still teaches us about reality (Matthew 10:16 TM) 

He knows when to keep His distance and when to come close (1Samuel 12:22)

There's no such thing as a perfect parent, just like there's no such thing a perfect kid. Give yours some slack. Just hold your parents with one hand and God with the other, and keep growing!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...LET EVERTYTHING YOU SAY BE...AN ENCOURAGEMENT...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 4:29 NLT</span><br>Badmouthing &amp; Backstabbing have become features of life in schools, colleges and workplaces. But this kind of destructive gossips a sick form of entertainment - and a major sign of insecurity! Let's be honest, knowledge is power; the reason we gossip is to impress others with what 'we know.'

A student who was the subject of vicious rumours writes: 'I remember it like it was yesterday. The queasy stomach, the tears, the hurt. I thought I'd be sick as I sank to my knees on the cold concrete floor...I knew I didn't deserve this. But that didn't make it any easier. I felt like I didn't have a friend in the world. All because of gossip.' God says, 'Evil people relish malicious conversation...' (Proverbs 17:4 TM). Did you get that? Gossip isn't just frivolous, it's downright evil! So, how should you respond to those who whisper in your ear, 'Have you heard about so 'n so' 

1) speak up. Listen: 'Fire goes out for lack of fuel, and quarrels disappear when gossip stops' (Proverbs 26:20 NLT). Make it known that you think badmouthing and backstabbing is out of order. And when you hear it, vote with your feet. Walk away! 

2) consider the consequences. Wise up! Smart people know if you'll gossip to them, you'll gossip about them! And what's even worse, you're dishonouring God and degrading your testimony! The Bible says, 'Whatever you...say, let it be as a representative of ...Jesus...' (Colossians 3:17 NLT). Remember whom you're representing 

3) be an encourager. Paul says, '...Let everything you say be...an encouragement...' (Ephesians 4:29). So whenever you hear somebody being dished turn the conversation around and 'big them up.'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...YOU DO NOT RECEIVE BECAUSE THE REASON YOU ASK IS WRONG...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JAMES 4:3 NCV</span><br>Here are some prayers you may want to reconsider:

Prayer-blast. Direct your prayers to God, not others! For example, don't turn your cell group prayer time into a venting of your frustrations, or try to bounce your prayer off the ceiling to hit an unsaved mate from across the room! God gets enough bad PR without that kind of thing. Jesus said whenever we pray '...don't turn [it] into a theatrical production..' (Matthew 6:5 TM).

Pray snobbery. In one church a childless couple was praying for a baby but some members of the prayer group decided that the husband wasn't godly enough to be a father, so they spent their time asking God to change him. Listen to the way Daniel prayed: '...We do not ask because we deserve help, but because you are so merciful' (Daniel 9:18 NLT). If God only gave children to perfect parents, the human race would be extinct!

Prayer-spam. Maybe you think there's a better chance of getting answers to your prayers if you involve a lot of people. So you send out texts and emails to everyone you know and lots you don't! But with God, what matters is the faith with which you pray, not the size of the team. Jesus said, '...if two of you on earth agree about anything you ask for, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven' (Matthew 18:19 NIV). When you face a situation too big to handle alone, get together with someone who really knows God and pray in agreement with them.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>BLESS THOSE WHO CURSE YOU, PRAY FOR THOSE WHO MISTREAT YOU.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 6:28 NASB</span><br>If you've ever watched a reality TV programme like Big Brother or Wife Swap, you'll know that certain people build their own sense of identity and worth by pointing out the faults of the people around them. How does God want us to treat the fault-finders in our lives? Here are some pointers to help you:

1) your number 1 weapon is love. All the nit-picking and the mickey-taking fault-finder usually disguises deep insecurity; it lets them shift the focus off their own fears. The Bible says 'perfect love drives out fear.' 

2) move towards, not away from. It's natural to ignore or isolate difficult people. Don't! That will just create emotional distance  and confirm their belief that you don't care and you won't listen 

3) get behind the mask. Show genuine interest in their family, their dreams, their well-being. Fault-finders usually struggle with being read and open. They may not have any genuine friendships and could be hiding their loneliness. So be patient and prepare yourself for the unravelling of a trail of broken and mixed up relationships 

4) bless and encourage. Jesus said, 'Bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you' (Like Luke 6:28 NASB). Fault-finders will be totally stunned when you react so differently to them then everybody else does.  As novelist Mark Twain said, 'Kindness is a language that the deaf can hear and the blind can see.'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...THEY THINK THEY WILL BE HEARD BECAUSE OF THEIR MANY WORDS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 6:7 NIV</span><br>One Christian author writes: 'The purpose of prayer is to release our faith - not repeat phrases over and over. For example, if I need forgiveness I can pray: 'Lord, I lost my temper and I'm sorry. By faith I receive your forgiveness, Amen.' Or I can pray: 'Lord, I'm so wretched. I can't seem to do anything right. No matter how hard I try I'm always screwing up. I don't know what I'm going to do - I've gotta stop getting mad. Please forgive me. I'll never do it again. I feel so guilty, so bad; I don't see how you can use me. Well Lord I don't feel much better but I'll try to believe I'm forgiven.' You'll agree that the first prayer is much more effective than the second.'

Then she continues: 'My problem was I didn't have faith that my prayer would get through if it was simple, short and to the point. I'd fallen into the trap of the-longer-the-better. Most of the time I felt confused and unsure, as though I still hadn't gotten the job done. But not anymore. Now I 'keep it simple' and I experience a much greater release of faith, plus I've confidence that God has heard and will answer.'

What are your prayers like? Do you need to make any changes? If you're not praying enough, pray more. If your prayers are too complicated, simplify them. If you need to keep them more of a secret, quit talking about them to everybody you meet. In other words - keep it simple!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>FORGIVE...AS QUICKLY AND AS THOROUGHLY AS...CHRIST FORGAVE YOU</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 4:32 TM</span><br>There is a famous story about some scientists who set out to capture a rare species of monkey and bring it back alive and unharmed. To do this they devised a trap; a small jar with a narrow neck into which they place a handful of nuts. Smelling the nuts, the monkeys reached in to get them. But when they tried to withdraw their hands, they discovered that they couldn't get their clenched fists back out. They were trapped - unable to escape but unwilling to let go!

Sometimes we can be just like those monkeys. Unable to escape our past with its hurts but unwilling to let it go! Has someone mistreated you? Have you ever said to yourself, 'I'll never forget this as long as I live?' Whether you know it not, you aren't holding on to resentment - it's holding on to you. You're trapped. The real victim of resentment and anger is the one who carries it? Are you a carrier? 

The answer is forgiveness. Jesus said 'Forgive as quickly and as thoroughly as...Christ forgave you' So how did Christ forgive you? 

a) when you in no way whatsoever deserved it 

b) with no strings attached 

c) knowing that you would fail Him again.

So forgive and forget. To forgive is to set a prisoner free and discover that the prisoner is you!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...DO THE HARD WORK OF GETTING ALONG WITH EACH OTHER...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JAMES 3:18 TM</span><br>We've all seen the fly-on-the-wall documentaries filmed at airports with tourists laying into some poor air hostess. Well, a man arriving at an airport saw a well-dressed businessman yelling at a porter about the way he was handling his luggage. The angrier the businessman became the calmer the porter remained. After the businessman left, the first man complimented the porter on his restraint: 'Oh, it was nothing,' he said. 'You know, that man's going to Miami, but his bags - they're going to Kalamazoo.' When you disrespect others you not only hurt your testimony, you hurt yourself. In God's eyes everyone has value. So giving people respect is one of the most effective ways of reaching them. Now, that doesn't mean you can demand respect in return. No, you must earn it! But if you genuinely respect others and show them God's love, they'll almost always give you back respect.

The trouble is, some of us approach our dealings with others as a transaction. We're willing to give, only if we expect to get something back in return. Check your heart motives! Be sure you're not trying to manipulate others for your own gain. Jesus said, '...freely you have received, freely give' (Matthew 10:8 NKJ). 

Always start a new relationship by asking: am I trying to get something out of being their friend? Will I care for them with strings attached? Am I likely to use them?  If your answer to any of these questions is 'Yes,' leave them alone; they're better off without you!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...DO THE HARD WORK OF GETTING ALONG WITH EACH OTHER...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JAMES 3:18 TM</span><br>Ever seen someone that just has great relationships. They might not be the most popular person but their mates are really good mates and if they go anywhere they seem to get on with people. Maybe you even seen them influencing and helping others for God. How do they do it? To start with they put a high value on others.  Face it: if you're so wrapped in yourself and your problems. you won't make building good relationships a priority. You've got to place a high value on people - because God does! That means expecting the best of them; assuming their motives are good unless they prove otherwise; valuing them by their best moments, not their worst; giving them your friendship with no strings attached, rather than asking for theirs.

Also try to understand people, what makes us all tick, Yeah, we are all different but also there is a lot that's the same. Here are some things to remember that are true of most people, do something about these things and you will start to build great relationships: a) people are insecure, so give them confidence b) people want to feel special so 'big them up', tell them how great they are c) people need to be understood, so listen to them d) people are basically self-centered, so think about their needs first e) people get emotionally low, so encourage them, smile, do something kind to make their day f) people want to be associated with success, so help them to win. 

When you try to understand people and help them to succeed, you lay the groundwork for great relationships - and you influence people for God!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...I WILL GIVE MY SPIRIT TO EVERYONE...YOUR YOUNG MEN WILL SEE VISIONS AND YOUR OLD MEN WILL HAVE DREAMS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>ACTS 2:17 CEV</span><br>One day HC Booth was sitting in a rocking chair watching the sunset. Living in the midwest of America he was also watching the dust blow around. As he took in the scene he began to wonder, 'What if we could reverse the wind so that it sucks dust instead of blowing it?' Later that year he invented the vacuum cleaner!

God said, 'I will give my spirit to everyone... your young men will see visions and your old men will have dreams.' Did you get that? Regardless of your age, God's spirit can birth in your heart a dream, a vision of 'what can be.' Stop putting yourself down, thinking 'others are better and more qualified than me.' Listen: 'For it is God who works in you to will and to act according to his good purpose' (Philippians 2:13 NIV). You may have faults and limitations, but the God who lives and works in you has got neither! Don't allow fear to make you settle for less than the life God intends you to live. Go ahead, risk, reach, for 'It is God who works in you,' and longs to be glorified through you.

Historian Henry J Taylor, reminds us that 'Vision lit every lamp, built every church and business, performed every act of kindness, and created more and better things for more people. It's the priceless ingredient of a better day.' 

So start dreaming and don't stop!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...HE...MADE HIMSELF NOTHING...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PHILIPPIANS 2:7 NCV</span><br>Dr Maxwell Maltz tells a story about a man who was severely burned attempting to rescue his parents from a fire. But he didn't succeed and they died. Depressed and disfigured, he went into seclusion and hiding refusing to let anyone see him - not even his wife. Desperately looking for help she came to Maltz, a top dog plastic surgeon. Even though he told her he could probably restore her husband's face, the man stubbornly refused treatment. So when the woman came back to see Maltz he was surprised. But this time her question blew him away. She asked, 'Can you disfigure my face, so I can be like my husband and share his pain? That way maybe he'll let me back into his life again!' That's how much she loved him! Maltz was so moved, he kept nagging the woman's husband to accept his help and thankfully the story has a happy ending.

The Bible says before Jesus left heaven He 'was like God in every thing...But gave up His place...and made himself nothing. He was born to be a man and became like a servant.' Our limited human minds can't begin to take in the world Jesus left. The homes you see on MTV cribs are like run-down shacks by comparison! The Bible says, 'The Word became flesh and lived among us...' (John 1:14 NRSV). Just think: the God of the universe willingly left the splendour of heaven, was born into poverty and died on a cruel cross for dodgy old humanity. Why? Because that's how much He loves us!

Although he'd lost his fingers he learned to fly an airplane solo. Then one day while flying from Colorado to California, ice caused his plane to crash. Paralysed from the waist down (and you think you've got problems), Mitchell was understandably depressed about being confined to a wheelchair for life. Then a friend gave him the same advice he'd earlier given her: 'It doesn't matter what happens to you. What matters is what you decide to do about it.'

So Mitchell adopted what he called the Triple-A Formula. Accept what has happened, otherwise you live in denial, or open yourself to resentment and self-pity. Appreciate what you can learn from it. Built into every painful experience is the potential to be wiser, stronger and more effective for God. Adapt to the new opportunities it presents. It was darkness that drove Edison to keep searching until he discovered a source of light. Since then Will Mitchell has held public office, found love, and given hundreds of talks. He says, 'Before I was paralyzed there were 10,000 things I could do, now there are 9,000. Should I focus on the 1,000 things I can't do? No, I'd rather concentrate on the 9,000 ways in which life is still good.' So, whatever we're facing today, it's not too big for God. It can be turned around through 'His power that is at work within us.'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...STAY AWAY FROM COMPLAINING AND ARGUING.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PHILIPPIANS 2:14 TLB</span><br>Don't you hate it when other people moan all the time? But you forget that when you're in the middle of some whopper winge of your own. Once you earn a reputation as a complainer, people will avoid you like the plague! 

The thing is, right attitudes don't just happen, you choose them. Paul says, 'Rejoice in the Lord always...' (Philippians 4:4 NKJ). Joy is a command. It's non-optional and non-negotiable. 

Only problem is Christians seem to have more of a reputation to being sad and boring rather than buzzing and brimming with joy - how has that happened!

The Psalmist writes, 'This is the day the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it' (Psalm 118:24 NIV). He doesn't say 'yesterday was God's day, how happy I was then,' or 'tomorrow will be God's day, I'll hack it until then.' No, 'This day with its blessings and challenges is a gift from God, so I'm not going to insult Him by complaining.' Complaining is usually self-centered. It focuses on what you don't like. Get over yourself! True joy is a choice; one that comes to those who have devoted themselves to something greater than their own personal happiness. Listen: 'For we have sinned and grown old, and our father is younger than we.' A life of gratitude and service to others will keep you young till you die. But a life of complaining will age you prematurely and possibly hasten your death. So - stop your complaining!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>FEAR OF MAN IS A DANGEROUS TRAP...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 29:25 TLB</span><br>In school or youth group you've no doubt had talks about peer pressure. The bible calls this the fear of man and says: 'Fear of man is a dangerous trap.' This kind of people pleasing takes two forms: You turn yourself inside out trying to make others happy OR you quietly make all your decisions because you want to fit in or get their approval.

Maybe you became a people-pleaser early in life to get the love and attention you craved, or because no one has taught you to trust your own judgment. Either way it always backfires. Not only do others get annoyed with you, you end up disliking yourself when things don't work out. So why do we do it? Because it's always easier to listen to the people we can see, than to the God we can't see.

Peter struggled with people pleasing. One night, when a girl asked him if he was a friend of Jesus he replied, 'I don't even know that man!' (Matthew 26:72 CEV). When the prophet Samuel had a go at King Saul for failing to destroy the Amalekites, 'Saul...admitted...&quot;I was afraid of the people and did what they demanded...&quot;' (1Samuel 15:24 NLT). On the other hand, Paul said, 'I am not trying to please people...If I were...I would not be a servant of Christ' (Galatians 1:10 CEV). 

God doesn't want us to get caught up in people-pleasing. The Bible says He hasn't '...given us a spirit of timidity, but of power...' (2 Timothy 1:7 NASB). When you give in to the fear of others, you allow them - not God - to control you. God doesn't want you to serve others out of fear, but because you love them - and Him!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE MAN SAID, &quot;THE WOMAN WHOM YOU GAVE...ME...GAVE ME OF THE TREE, AND I ATE.&quot;</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GENESIS 3:12 NKJV</span><br>The blame-game is just another way of avoiding responsibility for our actions. It started when Adam blamed Eve: '...she gave me of the tree, and I ate.' Next Adam blamed God, 'The woman whom You gave...me.' And Eve? Well, she said, 'The serpent deceived me...' (Genesis 3:13 NKJV). Remember the song that was in the charts a couple of years ago - 'It wasn't ME!'?

Here's a common way of avoiding responsibility and dishing out blame: 'It's my genes!' Yeah right!  We'll do anything to avoid taking the rap! One blame-gamer, a recovering alcoholic and addict, admitted, 'Each time I was pulled over for drunk driving I'd reason that the police were out to get me because I drove a sports car. Or, if my doctor hadn't prescribed those pain pills I'd never have gotten hooked. Or, if they hadn't served champagne at my brother's wedding I wouldn't have ended up in jail.' 

Nowhere in the Bible does God let you off you because of somebody else's behaviour. Listen: '...we'll all have to...take what's coming to us as a result of our actions...' (2 Corinthians 5:10 TM).

God didn't buy Adam and Eve's excuses, and He won't buy yours either. Others may   have contributed to the mess you're in today, but it's your choice to stay there! What do you want - sympathy or solutions? Do you want to justify your past or change your future? Come on, it's time to clean up your act and admit, 'Lord, I'm the problem. Please fix me by showing me what to do to be forgiven, healed and restored.'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...YOU ARE WORRIED...ABOUT MANY THINGS, BUT ONLY ONE THING IS NEEDED...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 10:41-42 NIV</span><br>Sometimes the reason we approach God with a list of requests the length of Mr Tickle's arm, is because we're more interested in His 'presents' than His presence. Truth is, what we consider needs, are often wants. Can you imagine having 'only one thing' on your list; like just wanting to be with Him?  David said, 'One thing have I asked of the Lord...that I may dwell...[in his presence] all...my life...' (Psalm 27:4 AMP).

Speaking of His presence, Jesus told Martha, 'You are worried... about many things, but only one thing is needed.' (Check out Luke 10.) No doubt, Martha loved Jesus. In fact she couldn't do enough for Him. The problem was, she was so busy serving Him that she didn't know how to relax and just enjoy just being with Him! Sound familiar?

If you're not spending time enjoying God's presence, you need to change how you spend your time. Maybe like Martha you think that unless you do the job yourself it won't get done right (and that doesn't include completing the final level of your latest game!). And who knows, you may be right! But remember this: God will never ask you to do anything that gets in the way of your relationship with Him. He wants that to be your top priority! 

So, if you're so busy that you're not doing the 'one thing' He really wants from you, right now would be a good time to put that right. How about it?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...CHRIST...IS YOUR EXAMPLE. FOLLOW IN HIS STEPS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 PETER 2:21 NLT</span><br>Do you ever catch yourself moaning when your friends let you down? Do you ever think you're a 'better friend' than they are? Is it always you who invites them over? Are you always lending them your games and CDs but they never lend you any? Are there times when you feel that you give more than you get?

Jesus experienced all these things - and more! (Well maybe James and John didn't borrow his CDs without asking!) His closest friends let Him down; they were unreliable and immature. They learned slowly, and always the hard way. One even betrayed Him to death - that's heavy. Yet Jesus forgave them and loved them anyway. Listen, '...having loved His own...He loved them unto the end' (John 13:1). Jesus loved His friends, but not because they were worthy of love. His love made them worthy!

In 'Knowing God', JI Packer writes, 'There is tremendous relief in knowing myself. There is great cause for humility in the thought that He sees all the twisted things about me that others don't see. Indeed He sees more corruption in me than that which I see in myself. Yet He wants me as His friend, and desires to be my friend, and has given His Son to die for me in order for me to realize this purpose.'

So the next time a friend disappoints you, remember God's grace to you - His love that He gives you even when you don't deserve it. Use His Son as your role model and ask yourself, 'What would Jesus do?'

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...MAKE THE MOST OF EVERY OPPORTUNITY.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>COLOSSIANS 4:5 NIV</span><br>It's hard to get your head round but how you use your time makes a massive difference to the person you become and the way your life will turn out. Here are two questions to ask yourself every day which will get you thinking about how you use your time:

1) what's required of me? You might not realise this but God has given you things that He wants you to do. Follow him with every bit of strength and passion you have, love other people as you love yourself, honour you parents, love the geeks and freaks. It's important to ask yourself regularly - 'Am I doing all I can to become a better son/daughter, a better friend, a better pupil...?' Always ask yourself challenging questions. Give it time to process before moving on to the next 'big thing'
2) what brings me the greatest fulfilment? Some of the things that God requires will give you a greater buzz than others and that's because God has made us that way.  But we can't ONLY do the stuff we get a buzz from and love doing. Some of us want to jump to the fulfilment question before we've answered the requirement question. You might love playing in the worship band but God still wants you to be a good son/daughter. You'll never succeed if you don't have the discipline to take care of the first question, before addressing the second.
If you bring your priorities into focus by constantly asking these two questions, you've a good chance of fulfilling God's purposes for your life. ]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>IF YOU ARE TIRED FROM CARRYING HEAVY BURDENS, COME TO ME AND I WILL GIVE YOU REST.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 11:28 CEV</span><br>Have you ever noticed that the more busy you are and the more stressed you get the less time you spend with God?  It's a bit bonkers really because those hectic times are exactly when we need God's strength and wisdom more! Check out what Jesus said: 'If you are tired from carrying heavy burdens, come to me and I will give you rest.'

Everywhere He went people were hassling Jesus for His time and attention. Nobody was busier than Jesus, yet He was never in a hurry. He had a lot more to do than you, yet He never seemed to do it in a way that severed or cut off the life-giving connection between Him and His Dad. He regularly withdrew from activity to the place of solitude and prayer. And when His disciples returned, flushed with success, their adrenaline pumping from a busy time of ministry, He told them 'Come away...all by yourselves and rest a while' (Mark 6:31 NRSV). Constant hurry is the mark of an un-prioritized life. It's a sign that second and third things have become first things.

Getting involved in the Christian lunch club, playing in the band at church, going to the big youth service and youth group are all important but are you getting too busy to chill with Jesus? Following Jesus can't be done at a sprint; you can't go faster than the One who's leading. So, slow down. Don't just work for God - spend time with Him!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...HE WILL COMMAND HIS ANGELS CONCERNING YOU TO GUARD YOU IN ALL YOUR WAYS</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 91:11 NIV</span><br>Remember that 'close call' you had? Some called it 'a lucky escape'. Maybe God had sent an angel to guard you - the Bible says it's one of their important roles.

Chuck Swindoll (a Christian speaker) tells of a Church youth group who got lost on a mountain-climbing expedition. A snowstorm suddenly covered the trail and their leader hadn't a clue where they were or how to get back to camp. The sun was setting. The temperatures were plunging. The danger was real. Trudging through the snow and getting more and more panicky by the moment, they heard someone on the slopes above yell, 'Hey, the trail's up here!' They glanced up, and to their relief saw another climber just above them. Quickly they made their way up to the big boulder where the man had been sitting. But when they arrived they found nobody there, not even a footprint in the snow. When they looked, however, the trail stretched out before them leading safely back to camp. 

The Bible says, some people have hung out with angels without knowing it (check out Hebrews 13:2). Even children have guardian angels watching over them. Jesus said,

'Watch that you don't treat a single one of these childlike believers arrogantly. You realize, don't you, that their personal angels are constantly in touch with my Father in heaven?' (Matthew 18:10 TM). Paul discovered that when you go through storms God assigns an angel to protect you. Check this, 'There stood by me this night the angel of God...saying fear not...' (Acts 27:23-24 NKJ). Hey relax, God's got you covered!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE WISDOM OF THE PRUDENT IS TO GIVE THOUGHT TO THEIR WAYS...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 14:8 NIV</span><br>In order to become a better thinker, you need to: 

1) do what works for you. Immanuel Kant (philosopher and all-round brain box) would stare out of his window at a tower in order to think creatively; when trees grew up threatening to block his view, he chopped them down. Samuel Johnson (the bloke who wrote the English dictionary) said he needed a purring cat, an orange peel and a cup of tea in order to write. Some of us like music, some like to skate, some think better when chatting through ideas with other people. Do whatever works for you (but I bet it won't be sat in front of the TV!) 

2) write down your thoughts. If you don't write down your ideas you'll lose them. In 'Bird By Bird', Anne Lamott says, 'I have an index card and pens all over the house - by the bed, in the bathroom, in the kitchen, by the phones...I used to think that if something was important enough I'd remember it...but then I wouldn't...writing down your ideas right away is not cheating. It doesn't say anything about your character.'

3) put your thoughts into action quickly. Dave Goetz, founder of CustomZigns.com says, 'For me, when an idea hits it strikes fire...the more time that passes after the idea strikes, the less heat it gives off. I forget parts of it, it doesn't seem so great. Ideas have a short shelf life.' Author Alfred Montapert says, 'Every time a person puts an idea across, he finds ten people who thought about it before he did - but they only thought about it.' Don't just think creatively, put those God-given ideas into action and make a difference in His world!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>THE WISDOM OF THE PRUDENT IS TO GIVE THOUGHT TO THEIR WAYS...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 14:8 NIV</span><br>God gave you a brain - use it! That doesn't mean you have get A* in every exam. Football managers, film directors, the foreman on the building site all have to learn to be thinkers! One night at dinner, a friend of John Kilcullen's described something he overheard in a bookstore. A customer asked the clerk, 'Do you have any simple books on Microsoft DOS - something like DOS for dummies?' It was only a passing comment meant as a joke, but it stuck with Kilcullen and he did something with it. He launched the 'Dummies' books - you've probably seen them with their distinctive yellow and black cover designs. Some unknown customer had a good idea and it went nowhere. In fact, they probably didn't even know at the time that it was a good idea. But in the hands of a thinker, that good idea became a great idea. Then it became a bunch of great ideas. There are now 370 'Dummies' books, in 31 languages, with sales of more than 60 million copies (You can even get 'Prayer for Dummies'!).

On your way to becoming a great thinker, you'll come up with loads of rubbish and useless ideas... but keep developing your thinking and your ideas will get better. 

Coming up with the right solution, the winning plan, the new idea, is determined not by just wanting it, but by thinking it through properly. Once the ideas start flowing, they get better. And once they get better, so does your life!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>COMMIT EVERYTHING...TO THE LORD...AND HE WILL HELP YOU.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 37:5 NLT</span><br>Girls - you've done all the questionnaires in the magazines to find out if he is MR RIGHT. Lads - you chatted to your mates about her whilst thrashing them on FIFA Pro Soccer and they think she's fit. But here are four more questions you both should consider:

1) is the relationship based on honesty? The Bible speaks about, '...telling each other the truth' (Ephesians 4:25 CEV). Relationships need openness and trust. When dodgy deceit and little lies creep in, it's time to get truthful in a hurry, or call it quits 

2) can you be yourself? Paul writes, '...Each of us is an original' (Galatians 5:26 TM), and  '...let's...be what we were made to be' (Romans 12:6 TM). If you feel like you constantly need to reinvent yourself or you're just frontin', you're in the wrong relationship. Use your head! If you think they only go for the fake you then they don't KNOW YOU, and how long can that last?

3) is either of you possessive? The Bible says, 'Love is...never jealous...' 

(1 Corinthians 13:4 CEV). If one of you can't make a move without the other's permission, it's a red flag, back off!  

4) have you established physical boundaries? If your relationship finishes and you eventually marry someone else will you regret how far you've been with the person you are with now? You may know that the Bible says, 'Run...from sexual sin...' (1 Corinthians 6:18 NLT), but do you understand why God says He made sex as a commitment only for marriage? If you're not sure why Christians make such a big deal about this, ask a youth leader or someone you trust. Finally: 'Commit everything...to the Lord...He will help you.' Lasting relationships always put God first - always!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...I AM...EQUAL TO ANYTHING THROUGH HIM WHO INFUSES INNER STRENGTH INTO ME...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PHILIPPIANS 4:13 AMP</span><br>You know the score; when you wake up each morning, you've got no real idea what will happen to you (other than your mum pecking your head about the fact you got up so late). Sure, we hope for hassle-free days in which all our dreams come true. Yet we know from experience this isn't always how the day turns out. We live in a real world with real problems. Our enemy, the devil, is real and he works in every way possible to batter us and bully us with discouragement, fear and failure. That's why David said, 'If you make the Lord your refuge...no evil will conquer you; no plague will come near your dwelling. For he orders his angels to protect you wherever you go...The Lord says, 'I will rescue those who love Me. I will protect those who trust in My name. When they call on Me, I will answer; I will be with them in trouble. I will rescue them and honour them. I will satisfy them with a long life and give them My salvation' (Psalm 91:9-16 NLT).

No matter what comes our way, we should believe that when it arrives we'll be more than able to handle it. That's why Paul (who had a life packed with hassle and hardship) writes, '...I am ready for anything and equal to anything through Him Who infuses inner strength into me...' (Philippians 4:13 AMP). Inner strength is better than outer strength, because if you can stay strong inwardly you can handle anything that comes against you outwardly, and still keep moving forward.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...ASK HIM, AND HE SHALL GLADY TELL YOU...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JAMES 1:5 NTL</span><br>Here's 3 things that are worth asking God for regularly:

1) am I real? A little boy in Sunday school knew the sort of answers you're supposed to give. So when the teacher asked, 'What's grey, furry, has a long, bushy tail and stores up nuts?' He muttered, 'I suppose the answer is Jesus, but it really sounds like a squirrel to me.' So often we try to say spiritual sounding things to impress each other, when the world rest of the world hasn't a clue what we're talking about. Be real!

2) am I judgmental? On an episode of The Simpsons, the Flanders family had been away together. When they got back home Homer asked them where they'd been and got this reply: 'We went to a Christian camp; we were learning how to be more judgmental.'  Ouch! Is that what people think about Christians? Is that true about you? Does a little voice inside you categorize people: This one's hard work, got 'baggage' - stay away. That one's fit and has cool stuff, get in there - try to connect. Why do we constantly find ourselves scoring people, as if life's some kind of contest?

3) am I approachable? Speaking of the Pharisees Jesus said, 'they love...to have men call them &quot;Rabbi&quot;' (Matthew 23:7 NIV). In Jesus' day, some rabbis had the idea that being Godly required you to distance yourself from people. Jesus tipped that idea right on it's head getting close to the people at the bottom of the stack. Jesus was the most approachable person they'd ever met. How about you?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>IF I...HAVE NOT LOVE, I AM ONLY A RESOUNDING GONG...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 COR 13:1 NIV</span><br>When it came to making religious racket the Pharisees were experts: long, loud flowing prayers in public; fierce, judgmental criticism about anything and everything. Sound familiar? Dallas Willard writes, 'How many people are radically and permanently repelled by Christians who are unfeeling, stiff, unapproachable, boringly lifeless and dissatisfied? Yet such Christians are everywhere...Spirituality wrongly understood or pursued, is a major source of human misery and rebellion against God.'

When our lives are not marked by true happiness that come from devotion to Christ, it's easy to start looking for other ways of justifying ourselves as Christians - and that's how people get 'religious'. But Jesus didn't come across to people as religious at all.

When asked to identify what religion was about, He simply replied 'Love God and love people.' A few years later Paul would say in the same spirit, 'If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal' (1 Corinthians 13:1 NIV). It's possible to think you're becoming more spiritual when in fact you're becoming what Paul calls a 'gong'...a great big, hard piece of metal loosely dangling in the air. The only noise it makes is the one its name suggests, 'GONNNNNG!'

The strongest advert for Christianity is Christians displaying the love of Jesus. The strongest advert against Christianity is Christians who are smug, judgmental and complacent. So, don't be a gong today!

<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...PLEASE, LORD, GIVE US SUCCESS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 118:25 NCV</span><br>Here are 3 more success myths that trap us:

1) we believe success is the result of opportunity, so make excuses. Many people who try different things but don't seem to get anywhere, believe that the only thing they need is 'a break'. Their motto is, 'if only'. 'If only I had a better teacher for that subject'. 'If only my parents would let me stay out later'. 'If only they would let me sing in the band' Sound familiar? The problem with people who live with that kind of attitude is that when an opportunity does come along they aren't ready to take it

2) we think success comes from having power, so we push for it. This idea is reinforced by the words of people like industrialist Andrew Carnegie: 'Success is the power with which to acquire whatever one demands of life.' So we assume that all successful people have taken advantage of others to get to where they are, and we begin to look for ways to manipulate people. We believe we can force our way to success, but people just end up getting hurt

3) we believe success comes from connections, so we 'press the flesh'. People who believe in connections think they'll 'make it' by getting in with the right people - the Brit pack - the Jet set! But those beliefs are misplaced. Knowing cool people has its rewards. But connections alone won't improve your life if you're off track. For followers of Christ, success comes by chasing after God and His amazing plan for your life!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...PLEASE, LORD, GIVE US SUCESS.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 118:25 NCV</span><br>Let's look at some common success myths:

1) we believe success is impossible, so we sack it. Because we want to believe that life should be easy, we assume anything that's difficult must be impossible. So when the road to success gets tough we throw in the towel and say, 'Who wants success anyway?' And if success is achieved by anyone we consider less worthy than ourselves, we have a dig at them because we're jealous

2) we believe success is mystical, so we day-dream about it. The problem is, we want the gain without the pain. Businessman Seth Grodin says, 'We need to stop shopping for lightning bolts. You don't win an Olympic medal with a few weeks of intensive training. There's no such thing as an overnight opera sensation...every great thing has been built in exactly the same way: bit by bit, step by step, little by little'

3) we believe success comes by luck, so we wish for it. Why do people say stuff like, 'She just happened to be in the right place at the right time.'  Why do so many millions of people spend good money every week playing the Lotto? Because the believe in the cobblers called 'Luck'! Sadly, luck disappoints 999,999 times out of a million. That's why Paul said to the Romans '...we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God... And hope does not disappoint us, because God has poured out his love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit...' (Romans 5:2 &amp; 5 NIV).

<title><![CDATA[ Detox from criticism]]></title>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>TAKE CONTROL OF WHAT I SAY, O LORD....</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 141:3 NLT</span><br>A detox is a special kind of diet when you cut out stuff that's bad for your body. Really it's a modern version of what the Bible calls 'fasting' - except fasting is good for your mind, body and soul!

In A Closer Walk Catherine Marshall writes, 'One morning last week God gave me an assignment for one day. I was to go on a 'fast' from criticism. I was not to criticize anybody or anything.

'For the first half of the day I simply felt a void, almost as if I'd been wiped out as a person. This was especially true at lunch. I listened to the others and kept silent. In our talkative family nobody seemed to notice. Bemused, I noted that the Government, the judicial system, and the church could get a long just fine without my personal observations! But still I didn't see what this &quot;fast from criticism&quot; was accomplishing - until mid-afternoon.

'In the afternoon God gave me a new vision for my life. And it had His unmistakable hallmark on it - joy! Ideas began to come to me in a way I hadn't experienced in years. Now it was apparent what the Lord wanted me to see. My critical nature had not solved a single one of the things I had found fault with. What it had done was to stifle my own creativity.'

Listen, 'Take control of what I say, O Lord...' (Psalm 141:3 NLT). Negative words create a bad atmosphere in which positive people can't live. So have a detox from criticism today - in fact, why not see if you can keep it up all weekend.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>INTELLIGENT PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS OPEN TO NEW IDEAS. IN FACT, THEY LOOK FOR THEM.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 18:15 NLT</span><br>One idea can change everything! Bill Gates had an idea, but when he went looking for investors some of his big-money friends called it 'too risky.' Can you imagine how they feel now? 

Good ideas are great. God ideas are even better! You see, what God inspires, He also invests in. Paul said, 'My God will meet all your needs according to His glorious riches...' (Philippians 4:19 NIV). According to what? The Bank of Heaven!

God's problem has never been lack of ideas; it's finding people who'll leave their comfort zone and turn those ideas into action - people like Abraham, who, 'By faith...when called to go...went, even though he did not know where he was going' (Hebrews 11:8 NIV). And what was his reward? '...All the families of the earth will be blessed through you...' (Genesis 28:14 NLT).

Usually God gives us His ideas when: a) Ours have failed b) we've laid aside our conditions, and decided to do whatever He says c) we're willing to risk d) we're committed to giving Him all the glory.

Think for a moment about all the ideas you've been involved in so far this year. How many are good ideas and how many are God - ideas? Listen, '...What I have said, that I will bring about; what I have planned, that will I do' (Isaiah 46:11 NIV).  Ask God to help you to be open to His ideas today.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>REMEMBER LOT'S WIFE.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>LUKE 17:32</span><br>When the Sunday school teacher told her class, 'Lot's wife looked back and turned into a pillar of salt,' one child responded, 'That's nothin'! My mum was driving home yesterday, and she looked back and turned into a telephone pole!'

Abraham's nephew Lot lived in a well shady city called Sodom. His wife only appears briefly, in one scripture (Gen 19:26) so why did Jesus tell us to remember her? Two reasons:

1) she wouldn't put the past behind her. John writes, 'This world is fading away, along with everything it craves. But if you do the will of God, you will live forever.' (1 John 2:17 NLT). God got Lot's wife out of Sodom, but she couldn't get Sodom out of her. When she thought of what she was leaving, she looked back and was turned into a lifeless monument. When God says it's time to move, don't hang about! Don't become like those who once walked with Him, standing out as shining lights in their communities, but now have turned cold and unresponsive

2) your decisions have consequences. If Lot's wife had kept moving forward she'd have been there to protect her daughters in the future. Instead they led each other astray with some really wacko ideas. Before you lose your mates, poison your family, and tear up your life by refusing to break with your past, 'remember Lot's wife.' She didn't make it to safety, but she did make it into the Bible just long enough to warn us not to look backwards when God's called us forwards.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>HE SAID TO THEM, GO INTO ALL THE WORLD...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Mark 16:15 NIV</span><br>Jesus made it clear that our job is to 'Go.' But many churches think it's good enough to sit tight and invite people to 'Come'. Michael Frost from Australia explains:

'...I was watching my daughter play soccer in a local park. Next to the field was an area where a group of model-car enthusiasts had set up a track and were using remote controls to race their cars against one another's. The constant buzz of the miniature motors caught our attention and we wandered over to see what they were doing. We soon realized that we had encountered a lost suburban tribe. Everyone looked the same. They all wore tight black jeans and chequered flannel shirts. They wore baseball caps with car manufacturers' logos on them. They had parked their cars - virtually all drove pickups - beside the tracks, and their wives or girlfriends sat in one of the truck beds talking and laughing loudly. It was a tribe in every sense of the word - dress code, language, culture and customs... 

'If the nearby church decided that this suburban tribe needed to hear about the saving work of Christ, how would they reach them? The church would hold special services for model-car racers. It would design an excellent flyer explaining that Jesus loves model-car enthusiasts, and they would place one under the windshield wipers of each pickup. It would try to find a recently converted model-car enthusiast and have him share his testimony on a Sunday morning. The church would do anything it could to draw the car racing fraternity into its building.'

One of the best ever 'Go-errs' was Paul, who said, '...I try to find common ground with everyone so that I might bring them to Christ.' (1 Corinthians 9:22 NLT)  Will you go today?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>A GOOD PERSON WHO GIVES IN TO EVIL IS LIKE A MUDDY SPRING OR DIRTY WELL.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 25:26 NCV</span><br>The attitudes of the people we spend time with rub off on us. That's why Paul wrote, '...Your faith will help me, and my faith will help you' (Romans 1:12 NCV).

There are two kinds of people in any group: polluters and purifiers. The polluters are like chimneys belching out dirty smoke all the time. They hate clear skies. No matter how good life is they find a way to make it gloomy. When the people around them breathe their toxins they feel sicker and sicker. The purifiers, on the other hand, make everything around them better. It doesn't matter what kind of rotten atmosphere they encounter. They take in the toxic words of polluters, but they filter and neutralise them rather than just wafting them in someone else's direction. What goes in gloomy and negative comes out fresh and clear.

So, are you a polluter or a purifier? When you spend time with people do they walk away feeling better or worse? Do you clear the air giving them fresh perspective and encouragement, or do they leave you feeling hopeless about things? Watch how people respond to you and you'll know which group you're in.

Bottom line: Polluters usually get what they expect - nothing! But those who choose to stir up their faith and look for God's best in every situation see opportunities that others miss. Purifiers see people clearly through God's eyes. Is that important? Absolutely! Your attitude will reach them long before your message does.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>LET THE WISE LISTEN AND ADD TO THEIR LEARNING...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 1:5 NIV</span><br>If you're serious about growth, here are 4 things you can do: 

1) make a commitment to change. Many people want things to get better - without having to change anything. To grow, you must commit yourself to not only accepting change - but to making it! Listen: 'Let us...go on to maturity...' (Hebrews 6:1 NIV).

2) focus on your strengths.  Business boffin Peter Drucker said, 'The great mystery isn't that people do things badly, but that they occasionally do things well. The only thing that's universal is incompetence. Strength is always specific. Nobody ever commented that the great violinist, Jascha Heifetz, couldn't play a trumpet very well.' If you try to be good at everything, you'll end up good at nothing. God gave you specific gifts. Find them and use them for His glory!

3) put yourself in a growth environment. Certain fish grow according to the size of their environment. Put them in a small aquarium and they remain small. Release them into the ocean and they grow to their intended size. And you are the same! If you spend your time with the wrong crowd in the wrong place doing the wrong things, you'll squash your growth.

4) learn to enjoy the journey. Most Grand Masters of chess learn and relearn their moves over a period of about15 years before winning their first world title. That's almost a fifth of their lives! If you're going to spend that much time doing something, you'd better enjoy it. If the destination appeals to you but you're not finding any fun on the journey, you'd be smart to ask God if you're on the right path.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>LET THE WISE LISTEN AND ADD TO THEIR LEARNING.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PROVERBS 1:5 NIV</span><br>All of us want to grow in God. Yet so many of us don't - we get stuck! Why? 

1) we think growth is automatic! When we're children we grow naturally. During that time there are adults such as parents and teachers challenging us to grow on a daily basis. So we get used to growing. The problem comes when we become adults and nobody's pushing us to grow or improve anymore. As you make the step to adulthood, take responsibility for your own growth, or it won't happen!

2) we think growth comes from information! The greatest obstacle to growth isn't ignorance - it's the illusion of knowledge! Have you ever met someone who was a total brainbox but couldn't seem to do anything of benefit for God, themselves, or other people? Who wants to be a walking encyclopedia - filled with knowledge which has no value because it's never used?

3) we think growth comes with experience! Believing that growth comes simply from experience is like a soldier shooting bullets all over the place, believing he's improving because he keeps on shooting. No, experience is profitable only if you learn from it and start hitting your target! Prize-winning composer, Gian Carlo Menotti said, 'Hell begins on the day when God grants us a clear vision of all that we might have achieved, of all the gifts we wasted, of all that we might have done that we did not do.' Don't end your life regretting the time and opportunities you wasted. Give time to prayer. Read your Bible. Worship God long and loud.  Growth will come as you do.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I AM DOING A NEW THING!</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Isaiah 43:19</span><br>Lots of people have dreams and visions for their lives but very few actually reach them. The reason is often not that these people experienced some major set-back on the way - they never even got started!  Do you have a vision or a dream?  Well, don't just sit there, do something about it!  Because there are so many excuses and reasons not to start, here are some helpful suggestions:

a) start with yourself! If you want those around you to give you more respect, give them a different set of attitudes and actions to respond to b) start early! There's an old saying that Noah didn't wait for his ship to come in; he built one! c) start easy! Hard work is just an accumulation of the easy things you didn't do when you should have. The truth is, the work doesn't seem quite so hard when you stop putting it off d) start small! Just take the first step. You can't do step two until you've done step one. Taking the first step gets you moving in the right direction e) start simple! Don't expect to understand everything up front. Listen: 'By faith Abraham...went out, not knowing...' (Hebrews 11:8). You'll know as you go! Just take the first step f) start now! What are you waiting for? Until you finish school? Get married? Have kids? Your kids grow up? You retire? You die? If you wait long enough you'll have only one regret - that you didn't start now.

<title><![CDATA[ Handling temptation]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>GOD BLESSES THE PEOPLE WHO PATIENTLY ENDURE TESTING...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JAMES 1:12 NLT</span><br>Every time you are tempted and choose to do right instead of wrong, you grow in the character of Christ. And what are His characteristics? Listen: '...love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control...' (Galatians 5:22-23 NLT).

So, will you wake up one day and suddenly have a big fat crop of all this amazing fruit? No, fruit grows steadily throughout the course of a season. Don't get fed up if the season lasts longer than you'd like it to. 

Rick Warren who writes all the 'Purpose Driven' books says, 'God develops the fruit of the spirit in our lives by allowing us to experience circumstances in which we're tempted to express the exact opposite quality. You can't claim to be good if you've never been tempted to be bad. You can't claim to be faithful if you've never had an opportunity to be unfaithful.' 

One of the secrets to overcoming temptation is to be prepared before it comes! Even Paul confessed, '...I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out' (Romans 7:18 NIV). Certain situations will make you more vulnerable to temptation than others. Find yourself in the wrong place at the wrong time and you may stumble almost immediately, while at other times in other places you're solid as a rock. Satan targets his temptations to our weakest points! So, you need to identify them quickly because satan is a crafty old snake. He knows what trips you up and he's constantly working to get you into those situations. That's why Peter warns, '...Stay alert. The Devil is poised to pounce, and would like nothing better than to catch you napping' (1 Peter 5:8 TM). Make sure you're wide awake today.
