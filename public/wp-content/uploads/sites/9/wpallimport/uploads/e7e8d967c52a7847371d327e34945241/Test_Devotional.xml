You’ll need it for the next few minutes. Have a read of Proverbs chapter 9. There’s a nice little spiritual sandwich: a layer of wisdom, buttered with a warning against folly, filled with some meaty slices about attitudes and consequences. The character called ‘Wisdom’ is pretty switched on: she’s organised, enthusiastic and inviting. Which is more than can be said for the character of ‘Folly’ (have a look at Proverbs 9:13–18). ‘Folly’ is everything ‘Wisdom’ is not. She’s reckless, foolish and lazy. But here’s the deal: they’re both inviting people to feast with them. (Proverbs 9:3–6 and Proverbs 9:16). The difference between them is that ‘Wisdom’ sends out her servants, whereas ‘Folly’ waits for people to come to her. The outcome? Those who have dinner with ‘Wisdom’ extend their lives but those who dine with ‘Folly’ experience the tragedy described in Proverbs 9:18. Now, you’re probably wise enough yourself to figure out that there’s a difference between ‘Fun’ and ‘Folly’, but we’re going to state the obvious anyway: you can be a fun person but still take your faith seriously. Take a look at ‘Wisdom’. She’s having a great time, but she’s all about setting people on the straight and narrow. Why? Because ‘Wisdom’ is all about respecting God. Have a look at Proverbs 9:10—wisdom comes into our lives when we yearn for the real and living God.</p><p>Pray that God would help you to understand a little more about Him today and grow in wisdom as a result.</p><h4>SoulFood: Heb 11:4–12:3, 1 Chron 17:1–20, Ps 18:20–29</h4></body></html>
