<introtext><![CDATA[Hang in there!<br />'At just the right time we will reap a harvest of blessing if we don't give up.' Galatians 6:9 NLT<br />Are you feeling fed up? Had enough? Ready to throw in the towel and quit? Sick of not being appreciated, wanted or valued? Thinking about 'slacking off' school, college, uni, friends or family because you just can't take anymore? Listen, hang in there!<br />'Let's not get tired of doing what is good...at just the right time we will reap a harvest of blessing if we don't give up.' (Galatians 6:9 NLT) There are no short cuts with God. We can miss out on so much great God stuff-just because we give up too early.<br />A man named William Wilberforce had been pushing the British Parliament to abolish the slave trade. He was about to give up when his friend John Wesley heard of his campaign. From his deathbed Wesley wrote to Wilberforce, 'Unless God has raised you up for this very thing, you will be worn out by the opposition of men and of devils. But if God be for you, who can be against you? Are all of them stronger than God? O be not weary in well doing! Go on, in the name of God and in the power of His might, till even American slavery shall vanish away before it.'<br />Wesley died six days later. Wilberforce fought for 42 more years. Three days before his own death, slavery was abolished in Britain. Eventually it was abolished in America too. Hang in there-what God has in store for you is worth any price you have to pay.<br />SoulFood Reading: Deut 32:29-34:12, Luke 12:1-12, Ps 119:17-24, Pr 17:7-10]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Get real<br />'...your sin will find you out.' Numbers 32:23 NKJ<br />Heard about a guy called Moses? The man God chose to lead all the Israelite people out from Egypt? It was no easy feat but Moses did it! There were 12 tribes of Israel; it was a tough, gruelling journey and just as they were about to reach their destination, two of the tribes decided they wanted to settle somewhere else. (Read it in Numbers 32.) The thing was, the other ten tribes still needed help so Moses kinda said, 'Get real; don't be so selfish. You can't just stop and look out for yourselves. We've all chipped in to get us this far; you can't give up on the rest of us now!'<br />So they agreed, and promised they would help and then Moses said: '...if you fail to keep your word, then you will have sinned against the Lord, and you may be sure that your sin will find you out.' (Numbers 32:23 NLT)<br />We can all have good intentions to do the right thing, but when we mess up or 'sin', as the Bible calls it, we are sinning against God. God knows about it (there's no hiding it from Him) and if we don't put it right, things will only get worse. Today: Get real! Put it right! Ask God to forgive you. Then live, knowing He has! Take action! Ask God to help you stop going against Him and help you stop sinning. Then live, knowing He is!<br />SoulFood Reading: Deut 30:1-32:28, Luke 11:45-54, Ps 119:9-16, Pr 17:4-6]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Become a soul winner<br />'...he who wins souls is wise.' Proverbs 11:30 NIV<br />When was the last time you prayed for your friends and family to become Christians? How often do you pray for that compared with how often you pray for yourself? Are you getting possessive about God and keeping Him to yourself? Everyone needs to know about His love and forgiveness and how amazing it is to be a Christian, not just you. Are you being selfish: God's taking care of me, teaching me, helping me, guiding me? Are your prayers all about you? 'God do this for me, help me with this, get me that, I want, I want, gimme, gimme!'<br />What about those people who don't know Him yet? Your friends and family who don't yet understand who Jesus is and how much they need Him? What about those people who feel so hurt or vulnerable? Or those who are addicted or abused and who don't yet know about a God who can heal and set them free? What about those don't yet know He's their Saviour?<br />God's bigger than us; He can handle us all. We don't need to be selfish-there's enough of Him to go around. In fact here's a crazy thing: the more you give God away to others, the more of God you'll get back! That's why Proverbs says, '...he who wins souls is wise.' Want more of God? Then be a Soul Winner! Tell everyone about Him and don't hold back.<br />SoulFood Reading: Deut 28-29, Luke 11:29-44, Ps 119:1-8, Pr 17:3]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<div>Promises, promises (3)</div>
<div>'...The Word of our God stands forever.' Isaiah 40:8 NKJ</div>
<div>God's promises are powerful because '...The Word of our God stands forever.' Nothing and no one can break them, ruin them, stop them or destroy them. God's promises aren't just any old promises, they're 'Power Promises'. They are invincible! Grab your Bible and look up 2 Peter 1:3-11. Discover the power God's promises can bring into your life when you let them get under your skin and live by them:</div>
<div>(1) Nothing can stop you becoming who God intended you to be. 'By His divine power, God has given us everything we need for living a godly life...He has given us great and precious promises.' (v3-4 NLT)</div>
<div>(2) You can become pure. '...These are the promises that enable you to share His divine nature and escape the world's corruption caused by human desires.' (v4 NLT)</div>
<div>(3) You will be successful. '...The more you grow like this, the more productive and useful you will be in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.' (v8 NLT)</div>
<div>(4) You will live forever. '...God will give you a grand entrance into the eternal Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.' (v11 NLT)</div>
<div>But the responsibility rests with us. We have to choose to make this happen: 'In view of all this, make every effort to respond to God's promises.'(v5 NLT)</div>
<div>(5) Let God's promises do their thing in your life: 'His power at work in us can do far more than we dare ask or imagine.' (Ephesians 3:20 CEV)</div>

<introtext><![CDATA[<div>'...The Word of our God stands forever.' Isaiah 40:8 NKJ</div>
<div>Did you know that there are thousands of promises in the Bible? Why does God give us so many? The answer is so we can get to know the God of the promises. They show us who He is and what He is like. He wants us to not just read them but to soak them up in our hearts and minds. That's so we can really get to know Him and get into His way of thinking and acting.</div>
<div>He wants us to become so familiar with who He is that it becomes second nature to call on His promises, no matter what's going on in our lives. Whatever the situation, God wants us to remember His promises, just like Jesus did when He lived on Earth. Be challenged and encouraged by more of God's promises today. Don't just read them, but see what they tell you about God Himself and what He is like. Get to know the God of the promises:</div>
<div>(1) 'If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.' (Romans 10:9 NLT)</div>
<div>(2) 'Though your sins are like scarlet, I will make them as white as snow.' (Isaiah 1:18 NLT)</div>
<div>(3) 'The eternal God is our hiding place; He carries us in His arms.' (Deuteronomy 33:27 CEV)</div>
<div>(4) '...I can do everything through Christ, who gives me strength.' (Philippians 4:13 NLT)</div>

<div>Ever tripped up and fallen flat on your face? Ouch! And how embarrassing if you're in a crowded place at the time! The shame! If we're not careful we can go through life like this. No, I don't mean tripping up every time we leave the house! But blundering along, making serious, stupid or careless mistakes that cause our lives to crash-land. Can we avoid it? Is it possible? God says it is: 'The Lord directs the steps of the godly. He delights in every detail of their lives.' (Psalm 37:23 NLT) This means we are to:</div>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...encourage and strengthen him...</h2>
<span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Deuteronomy 3:28 NIV</span><br />Paul was bought a car for Christmas by his brother, a seriously generous gift! One day he came out of his office to find a young lad hanging round it. As he got nearer the young lad said, 'This your car Mr?'  'Yeah,' replied Paul '...it is. My brother gave it to me for Christmas'. 'No way,' said the lad, 'that's amazing, you mean your brother gave it to you and it didn't cost you nothing? I wish...' he hesitated. Of course Paul knew what he was going to wish for? He was going to wish to have a brother like that. But what the lad actually said, completely threw him, 'I wish' he said 'that I could be a brother like that'. So often we can live life looking what we can get rather than what we can give. This lad knew the value of being an encourager.  God asked Moses to 'encourage and strengthen' Joshua so he could take over as leader. Moses had led the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt. It hadn't been easy, the Israelites were not the best travellers, constantly moaning! This is why it was so important that Moses encouraged Joshua. He understood what the job was about. God wants us to encourage each other to help us through our lives: '...encourage one another daily... so that none of you may be hardened by sin's deceitfulness.' (Hebrews 3:13) So today, GO ENCOURAGE!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'&quot;I have given you authority...to overcome all the power of the enemy.&quot;'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Luke 10: 19 NIV</span><br />You have not been called to defeat Satan, Jesus already did that 2000 years ago. You have been called to enforce his defeat! Paul tells us in Colossians 2: 15 that Jesus disarmed Satan and made a public spectacle of him at the cross.<br />When General McArthur met the Supreme Commander of the Japanese forces at the end of World War II, he stripped the glittering medals from his chest, took the sword out of his hand, and as the world watched he declared total victory for the allies and enforced the terms of surrender. And that's what Jesus did for you at the cross. When He died and rose again He stripped the devil of his power, took the sword out of his hand and declared: 'All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me. Therefore go...' (Matthew 28:18-19 NIV). Go in His power! Go in His name! 'What's in a name?' you ask. 'Therefore God exalted Him to the highest place and gave Him the name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.' (Philippians 2: 9-11 NIV) <br />Any claim to authority is only as good as the power that backs it up. And for us, the power we need is in the name of Jesus. Whether in heaven, earth or hell: 'Every knee should bow' and 'every tongue confess that Jesus is Lord.' And He has transferred that power to you today. So go out and use it!<br />SoulFood reading: Deut 1-2, Luke 10:25-37, Ps 78:32-39, Pr 16:31</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...Be an example... in the way you live...'</h2>
<p><br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Timothy 4: 12 NLT</span><br />Heard of Nanny McPhee? You may have seen the film or maybe it's not your cuppa tea? But this story is able to give us a good picture, which can encourage us to, 'Be an example...in the way you live.' 7 children without a mum are now nannyless for the 17th time, driving their poor dad to despair! But all is about to change as Nanny McPhee walks into their life. She arrives, hunched over, her face disfigured so bad that she's never going to win any beauty competitions. The children do their worst, hoping to send her packing. But she doesn't leave! She stays showing them the right way to live and as time goes on, the children begin to behave. What's so cool about this story is that the more the children do the right thing the more beautiful Nanny McPhee becomes. She straightens up, warts vanish and blotches disappear from her face. Their behaviour affects her beauty. At the end of the film Nanny McPhee looks like a totally different person, certainly more appealing to the eye. <br />When we don't 'get our act together' as a Christian we make Jesus look ugly. When we act in the wrong way we don't show Jesus in all His beauty; we give people an uglier version of who[a16] He really is. Let Jesus be seen as He really is through 'being an example...in the way you live.' <br />SoulFood reading: Acts 27-28, Luke 10:13-24, Ps 78:17-31, Pr 16:26-30</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...Be an example... in the way you live...'</h2><p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Timothy 4: 12 NLT<br /></span>Behind the set, actors get ready preparing for the show that's soon to take place. How they appear back stage is very different to how they will soon behave during their performance. Lights and action! The play begins and all their focus and attention is about what's happening on stage, all they're thinking about is delivering their lines well, in the right place and time. When it ends, they're back to being their normal selves, they dress and act differently and their thoughts are no longer all about the show! That's ok, though! They're actors, that's how it is! If we are not careful, we can find ourselves living life as a Christian like an actor. In church we will be one character, focused on how to live as a Christian. We will speak and behave in a certain way and pray, worship, read the Bible, but then when we come home we live and act in a totally different way. Today God is saying, 'Be an example...in the way you live.' All the time! <br />So get your act together. Be a good example no matter where you are or who you are with: 'In every way be an example of doing good deeds....speak the truth so that you cannot be criticised. Then those who are against you will be ashamed because there is nothing bad to say about us.' (Titus 2: 7-8 NCV)<br />SoulFood reading: Acts 24-26, Luke 10:1-12, Ps 78:9-16, Pr 16:25</p>]]></introtext>

Whether you have or not, you'll know what it feels like, right? Because one thing is guaranteed-at some point you will have tough times! The Bible guarantees it! 'We must suffer...' (Romans 8: 17 NCV) So the question to ask is not, 'How do I avoid having a hard time?' instead we should ask, 'What do I do when things get tough?' Our answer would probably be, 'If life is difficult, then we can't possibly enjoy ourselves. We just have to moan and complain and look miserable, until it's over.' But God answers our question with a promise, 'I will keep in perfect peace all who trust in Me, all whose thoughts are fixed on Me.' What a great promise! We just need to do our best and let God do the rest as we look to Him for help. We don't have to worry or panic, we can feel calm and relaxed, because God will fill us with His peace. This way God has the last word. No more running around like a headless chook or getting caught up in your emotions or reacting to what people are saying. You'll know God's in control, you won't even have to look miserable, you could even smile. Imagine that! When things go wrong-and they will-do what God asks of you and then chill. Sit back and watch Him work on your behalf!<br />SoulFood reading: Acts 22-23, Luke 9:57-62, Ps 78:1-8, Pr 16:23-24</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...grow in grace...'</h2><br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Peter 3:18 AMP</span><br />We're sticking with this verse for one more day because there's one more thing we need to know about growing in God's grace. We have already learned that (a) we need it, and (b) it's free and our choice to accept it. But when we've got it, there's something that God wants us to do with it, He wants us to give it away! That's right-give it away! There is something very unique about God's grace: it never runs out and it grows when you give it away. When we allow God's grace in our lives we receive God's unconditional love, forgiveness, power, faithfulness. And He says, '...Freely you have received, freely give.' (Matthew 10: 8 NIV) If we got it from Him for free, He wants us to give it away for free. Now, this is where it gets tricky. It's easy to accept something you don't deserve for free, but harder to give something away to people whom you think don't deserve it. The means the next time someone does you wrong, God wants you to be gracious and forgive them, not go round and punch their lights out, or moan at them for months on end. In short, however God treats you, He wants you to treat others. Impossible? No! God wouldn't ask you to do something you couldn't handle. He'll help you. Grow in grace! You'll be surprised how much you enjoy it. :)<br />SoulFood reading: Acts 20-21, Luke 9:46-56, Ps 46, Pr 16:20-22 <p>&amp;nbsp;</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...grow in grace...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Peter 3: 18 AMP</span><br />Jesus told stories when He was on earth to help us understand grace! Like the story of a group of guys who worked on a vineyard for the day. Some worked all day, some for just an hour, but the owner of the land chose to give them all the same pay. Why? Because he could and he chose to do it. (Matthew 20: 1-16) Then there's the story of a son whose dad threw him a great big party to welcome him home, even though he had been really selfish and rebellious (Luke 15: 11-32). These are grace stories-about people who received good things that they didn't deserve. God has things He wants to give to you. Even though no-one deserves it, He wants to give to them, and He can, because of His grace! Some people believe that if they try really hard to be good enough they can get themselves to heaven. Some people believe that they are so bad that they can never get to heaven. That's not how grace works. Grace is not about what you've done in the past or about what you can do in the future. It's about what God can do right now. '...God loved the world (that's you too!) so much that He gave his one and only son that whoever (you again!) believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.' (based on John 3:16 NLT) Accept God's grace today.<br />SoulFood reading: Acts 18-19, Luke 9:37-45, Ps 42:6-11, Pr 16:17-19</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...grow in grace...'</h2><p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Peter 3: 18 AMP<br /></span>What's God on about when He tells us to 'grow in grace?' What is grace? Something you say at mealtimes like... 'God bless this bunch as they munch their lunch'. How do you grow in that? Do we 'grow' by 'saying grace' over our snacks as well? 'Thanx for this sweet, a tasty treat, please give me some dietary tips, to stop this clinging to my hips!' Or is grace something we say to each other in church? Like ...'The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all, Amen!' If it is, how can you 'grow' in that? Do we need to scrap the service altogether and just talk sentences? <br />GRACE= God's Radically Amazing Choice for Everyone! God's: It belongs to God, from God, He invented it, He gave it! You can't get in anywhere else. Radical: Extreme, there's nothing like it; it blasts beyond boundaries, leaves no-one untouched. Amazing: incredible, unbelievable, stupendous, inconceivable!<br />Choice: You get to choose whether you want it; whether you want to be transformed by it or not.<br />Everyone: No-one gets left out. It's for every single person, from the youngest to the oldest.<br />We all need it, for 'all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.' (Romans 3: 23 NKJV) <br />SoulFood reading: Acts 16-17, Luke 9:28-36, Ps 42:1-5, Pr 16:16</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...the testing of your faith produces patience.' <br /></h2><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>James 1: 3 NKJV<br /></span>Once upon a time a farmer's donkey fell into a dry well. When the farmer heard the donkey's braying and realised what had happened, he decided that neither the donkey nor the well was worth the trouble of saving. So he went and asked his neighbours to come and help him bury his donkey in the well and put it out of its misery. Initially, the donkey was very upset. You would be too, if you were in a deep hole and people started throwing muck on top of you! But as the dirt rained down on his back, the old donkey had a thought. He decided that every time a shovel of dirt landed on his back, he would shake it off and step up. And that's what he did. As the dirt cascaded down the well, the old donkey kept shaking it off and stepping up. Hours later, the exhausted donkey finally stepped over the wall of the well. What was meant to bury him actually helped him!<br />When troubles come, don't give up; like the donkey, have patience and persevere, then you too will discover that what you thought was hindering you is actually helping you. '...These troubles test your faith, and this will give you patience. Let your patience show itself perfectly in what you do. Then you will be perfect and complete and have everything you need.' (James 1: 3-5 NCV)<br />SoulFood reading: 2 Kings 5:1-17, Luke 4:16-30]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...God is our merciful Father and the source of all comfort.'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Corinthians 1: 3 NLT</span><br />Lots of children have a special blanket or a toy that they take everywhere. Perhaps you remember having one when you were little...you even may have it still! Have you ever been around a child who wants their comfort blanket but it has gone missing; 'AAAAGGHHH' the deafening sound is still ringing in your ears: utter chaos, frantic parents, screaming child, bedlam!<br />God is described as the 'God of all comfort'. We may grow up and no longer need our comfort blanket, but we never stop needing comfort. We all need to feel safe and secure; loved. There's no situation you can be in, nothing so bad you can experience, where God, the God of all comfort, can't meet your needs. He's like the ultimate comfort blanket, always there, always ready; He never goes missing and is never unavailable. <br />God promises that He will use all our hard times to help others, so nothing we go through ever goes to waste. Listen: 'Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ...who comforts us in all our troubles so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves have received from God.' (2 Corinthians 1: 3-4 NIV)<br />SoulFood reading: Acts 14-15, Luke 9:18-27, Ps 1, Pr 16:10-15</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...Who are you to judge...?'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Romans 14: 4 NKJV</span><br />You can just tell by that look on her face she's guilty. And he might not be saying it but you know he's thinking it. We think we've got people sussed, don't we? The way they look or act or just the tone of their voice 'says it all'. If we're not careful we can so easily 'write someone off' because we think 'we know', before we actually find out the facts. <br />Sometimes we can believe we're 'doing God a favour' by 'sussing that person out' on His behalf. If we're not careful, we can stop talking to certain people about Jesus, because we've 'sussed out' they're not interested, so decide 'not to waste our time' on them. We don't even ask God about it! When someone wrongs us, we believe we have the right to go and 'give 'em a good talking to' making sure everyone knows how great we are and how terrible they are, in the process. We act; we don't ask God about it! If we did we'd hear Him saying this: '...always be willing to listen and slow to speak...' (James 1: 19 NCV), and this 'No-one can know a person's thoughts except that person's own spirit, and no-one can know God's thoughts except God's own Spirit.' (1 Corinthians 2: 11 NLT) So before you go 'writing someone off', ask God about it, only He knows what's best. So butt out and let God in!<br />SoulFood reading: Acts 12-13, Luke 9:1-17, Ps 65, Pr 16:8-9</p>]]></introtext>

<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ephesians 3: 12 NLT</span><br />You're told about two events happening in church next week. The first is that youth event you've been waiting for; the second is a new prayer meeting. Your reaction is 'YAY!' &amp; 'Ugh!' You think one is going to be 'amazing', the other is going to be 'boring'! And we both know which we're talking about here! Why is it that when it comes to praying, lots of us think it's BORING?<br />One of the most sought-after people in the world is Barack Obama. He's made history as the first black American president. This time last year over 2 million people stood in a freezing cold Washington, DC, to watch the ceremony as he took the oath to become the 44th Commander-in-Chief! People travelled from all over the world to be there. But no-one had the privilege of chatting with him in person. But how amazing is this: you can get to speak to the One who is not just in charge of a country but the One who is in charge of the whole planet! The most highly placed person in the entire universe says that you can talk to Him ANYTIME YOU WANT! More than that He says you can go 'boldly and confidently' because He won't turn you away. In fact just the opposite: He's actually waiting for you! How can that be boring? The creator of the Universe is waiting to speak with YOU! So get praying today.<br />SoulFood reading: Acts 10-11, Luke 8:40-56, Ps 14, Pr 16:6-7</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...she could stand straight...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Luke 13: 13 NLT<br /></span>'DON'T SLOUCH!' Have you ever had it said to you by a teacher or parent? 'Stop slouching, sit up straight.' Well guess what? Today God is saying 'DON'T SLOUCH!' Now that doesn't mean God's having a go at you about the way you veg on the couch watching the TV or slump in the chair at your computer. He's saying, 'Know your worth, know your value, and walk tall, because with Me there is no need to slouch!' <br />If we get criticised, put down, bullied or made the punchline of someone's joke, what can happen is that we start to believe we are worthless. Instead of being able to walk with our head held high, knowing we are, '...fearfully and wonderfully made...' (Psalm 139: 14 NIV) we end up walking stooped over, head down feeling negative about who we are.<br />Luke tells us about a woman Jesus met who was bent over and couldn't straighten up. She was slouching big time and had done for 18 years; something inside her was crippling her. Then she met Jesus, 'He called her over... He touched her and instantly she could stand straight.' (Luke 13: 12-13 NLT) Jesus made a MASSIVE difference in her life &amp; He can do the same for you. Allow Jesus to touch your life, just ask Him, so you can stand up straight! Hear Him tell you your worth. You are a priceless precious person in God's sight! <br />SoulFood reading: Acts 8-9, Luke 8:26-39, Ps 146, Pr 16:4-5</p>]]></introtext>

<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Peter 4: 7 NIV</span><br />Walk along the road with your head down looking at the pavement, and it won't be long before you end up walking smack bang into something and it's gonna hurt! We need to look ahead to what God is sending our way, we need to watch out for it and prepare for it. Otherwise we won't see it coming! 'The end of all things is near. Therefore be clear minded and self controlled so that you can pray.' God wants us to talk to Him about what's up ahead and what's going to matter when we get there!<br />Have you seen the film Slumdog Millionaire? It's about a young guy from a very poor background in India, who wins Who Wants To Be A Millionaire. How does he know the answers? The film takes you on a journey through his life. For each question, he had learnt the answer through events that had happened in his life (often difficult and sad situations). He was not incredibly intelligent; he didn't have a massive knowledge about the world. It just so happened that the questions he was asked, he had learnt the answer through how he had lived his life.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...until Christ is formed in you...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Galatians 4: 19 NIV<br /></span>Think for a minute about all the things you've learned since you were born. You can walk, run, and talk! And that's just for starters!! They say you learn the most in the first 5 years of your life than at any other time. And you can see why! You're taking in massive amounts of information, growing and developing new skills. Wow, you're amazing! But we don't often think about that really do we, because it just seems to happen naturally. We expect it! <br />When you become a Christian, it's the start of a whole new life; it's time to learn and grow all over again. In fact we're actually, '...being transformed into His likeness...' (2 Corinthians 3: 18 NIV) We're becoming Christlike. It's not instant, it happens over time. And, just like growing up naturally, the way to do it is through food and exercise-eating God's Word, the Bible, and doing the things He says. First we have milk: 'Like new born babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation...' (1 Peter 2: 2 NIV), then solids: '...solid food is for the mature, who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil.' (Hebrews 5: 14 NIV) If we're not careful though, we can stay like babies and never grow up. 'I gave you milk not solid food for you were not yet ready for it...' (1 Corinthians 3: 2 NIV) Don't get left behind... keep growing!<br />SoulFood reading: Acts 3:11 - 5:42, Luke 8:1-15, Ps 133, Pr 16:2</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...but those who hope in the LORD will renew their strength...'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Isaiah 40:31 NIV<br /></span>When you pray to God, do you get a TXT from Him a few minutes later saying when and how He'll answer your prayer? Not likely! But God does promise that if we wait on Him, He will give us strength. Think of it a bit like papier mache; did you ever make it at primary school? You know, where you stick newspaper to a balloon. Newspaper itself isn't strong; it's well easy to rip. But the more layers you put on, the stronger it gets, until in the end, it's almost impossible to break. You're a bit like that balloon. Every time you wait on the Lord, another layer of paper is added, and you get a bit stronger. So if you're feeling like things are tough and you can't do it yourself, just wait on Him, read your Bible, pray; you will get stronger.<br />Don't panic; 'waiting' doesn't have to be all about sitting cross legged in silence, meditating. Sometimes it can be proactive too. If you're 'waiting' on someone in a restaurant, you're seeing to their needs; so sometimes, weird as it sounds, waiting on God involves proactively doing God's will, and serving others. Do you need more strength? Well grab hold of this promise that's yours as a child of God: 'Wait on the Lord; be of good courage, and He shall strengthen your heart...' (Psalm 27:14 NKJV).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'But Daniel was determined not to defile himself...'</h2>
<p><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Daniel 1: 8 NLT</span><br />It can be tough being a Christian sometimes, difficult to keep on doing the right thing all the time. Daniel had it really tough. When he was only 14 years old his country was invaded, he was taken away and forced to learn a different language and to work for the foreign government. He had no idea when or if he'd ever return home. You wouldn't blame him for 'slacking off' in a situation like that, would you? But Daniel didn't. He chose to trust God! <br />Daniel was constantly being tempted to forget about living for God. It's hard to do the right thing when you're at that party with your mates and the alcohol and love interests are in plentiful supply, isn't it? Well, Daniel was tempted every day to forget God's way. Did he say 'stuff it' and join in? No! Every day Daniel was faithful, doing what was right in all things. At one point Daniel was thrown into a den of lions. Did he panic? No! Every day of his life Daniel had chose to obey God, and as a result when a MASSIVE problem came his way, he could handle it!<br />If you're tempted to think it doesn't matter about getting the little day-to-day things right, remember Daniel. It was only through obeying in all the small things everyday that he was able to get the big things right too.<br />SoulFood reading: 1 Sam 5:1 - 6:16, Rev 11:15-19</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...encourage and strengthen him...'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Deuteronomy 3:28 NIV</span><br />Paul was bought a car for Christmas by his brother, a seriously generous gift! One day he came out of his office to find a young bloke hanging round it. As he got nearer the young bloke said, 'This your car Mr?' 'Yeah,' replied Paul '...it is. My brother gave it to me for Christmas'. 'No way,' said the bloke, 'that's amazing, you mean your brother gave it to you and it didn't cost you nothing? I wish...' he hesitated. Of course Paul knew what he was going to wish for? He was going to wish to have a brother like that. But what the bloke actually said, completely threw him, 'I wish' he said 'that I could be a brother like that'. So often we can live life looking what we can get rather than what we can give. This bloke knew the value of being an encourager. <br />God asked Moses to 'encourage and strengthen' Joshua so he could take over as leader. Moses had led the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt. It hadn't been easy, the Israelites were not the best travellers, constantly moaning! This is why it was so important that Moses encouraged Joshua. He understood what the job was about. God wants us to encourage each other to help us through our lives: '...encourage one another daily... so that none of you may be hardened by sin's deceitfulness.' (Hebrews 3:13) So today, GO ENCOURAGE!

<p><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Philippians 2: 3 NLT</span><br />'Hey what about me?', 'I am SO much better than she is!', 'That's the last time I help him!' Ever said or thought something like that? If we're honest, every one of us has thought, said and even acted on words like that some time. We are naturally selfish. 'It's all about ME, right!?' WRONG! We've read today words said by Paul to the Church in Philippi telling us that God doesn't want us to be selfish, that's not His way, that's not what He created you to be! Why not? After all, being the centre of attention and having everyone run round after you doesn't seem a bad idea, does it? James 3:16 (NLT)says, 'For wherever there is jealousy and selfish ambition, there you will find disorder and evil of every kind.' And in verse 15 it says that selfishness is motivated by the devil. WARNING! If you're thinking about being selfish today, THINK AGAIN! God has let you know that living selfishly will bring every kind of evil your way; you don't want that for your life! More importantly, God doesn't want that for your life! And He has promised to help you, '...when you are tempted, He will show you a way out...' (1 Corinthians 10:13 NLT) Talk to Him today, about things you find tough, ask Him to kick out the selfish attitude and fill you with His Spirit instead!<br />SoulFood reading: Acts 1:1 - 3:10, Luke 7:36-50, Ps 123, Pr 16:1</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;reference&quot;>'Do not withhold good from those who deserve it when it is in your power to act.'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Proverbs 3:27 NIV</span><br />Ever had this experience? Your excited about being a Christian and living for God when, WHAM! The warm fuzzy feelings suddenly fizzle. That's not bad or wrong. Feelings come and go all the time. What's bad is when we let those 'can't be bothered' feelings keep us from doing what is right. That's called apathy and God hates it (Isaiah 32:9; Amos 6:1). Apathy is one step away from a proper bad attitude, it always ends up destructive not productive. When a bad attitude infects our brains it spoils all the fun and poisons friendships. Somehow, even though it's not what you wanted you find yourself in a slanging' match with your best friend. The hurtful words are coming out your mouth faster than you can think to stop them. When did you stop caring about their feelings? Answer; when apathy arrived. <br />The key to overcoming apathy is not by trying to crank up a bunch of ooey-gooey feelings. You need to say sorry and then start doing the things you did at first. That means doing these three things today and every day:<br />1) Talk to God in prayer (Ephesians 6:18) <br />2) Listen to God by reading The Bible (Acts 20:32) <br />3) Show love by helping others. This is why God says, 'Do not withhold good from those who deserve it when it's in your power to help them'. God doesn't want you to become a-pathetic. So don't go there!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>John 8: 32 NIV</span><br />Julie hadn't been in touch with her parents for a long time, so she wrote them a letter: 'Dear Mum &amp; Dad, it's me! Just letting you know how I'm doing. I've fallen in love with a guy called Blaze. He's a great guy, but he quit Uni a few years ago to get married. That didn't work out, so he got a divorce last year. We've been going out a few weeks now and we're thinking about getting married in November. I decided to move in with Blaze last Friday and have dropped out of Uni. I really needed to get a job to support me and Blaze but will probably go back to Uni after the baby is born. Oh yes, I'm pregnant! Ok, don't panic, everything I've written in this letter so far is a lie. None of it is true. But what is true is that I didn't do very well in my 1st year exams and I really need some money. Could you please send me some? Thanks. Love, Julie.'<br />Julie was trying to make bad news seem like good news by bringing it from another perspective! When we stray from the truth, we can't make good decisions or know the difference between right and wrong. The good seems bad and the bad seems good. Our view of reality is always a matter of perspective, and the only viewpoint worth trusting is God's. Stay close to Him. <br />SoulFood reading: Joel 1-3, Luke 7:24-35, Ps 118:19-29, Pr 15:33</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'You intended to harm me, but God intended it all for good.'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Genesis 50:20 NLT</span><br />Yesterday we faced up to the reality that life can be painful, that things in our lives can go horribly wrong. It did for Joseph (read Genesis 37 - 50)! At first you think, will anything ever go right for this poor guy? He gets laughed at, bullied, beat up and left for dead by his brothers before they decide to sell him. As a result he has to live in Egypt as a slave, his boss's wife tells lies about him and he's thrown into prison, where he's forgotten about! Nothing's gone well and it's not even his fault. What's going on?<br />Listen to what Joseph says to his brothers. He basically says 'you guys planned evil against me but God used those same plans for good'. Rather than get angry, bitter and plot revenge, Joseph put his trust in God. No matter what was happening, Joseph kept on living for God. Later, he recognised how God had worked in His life all along. God used all the mess to enable him to save the lives of thousands, including the lives of his family. He had no reason to be angry but every reason to be thankful. <br />Romans 8:28 NAS says, 'And we know that God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God...' Remember today that no disaster, disease or delay is beyond God turning it into something good.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>John 8: 32 NIV<br /></span>Ok, so this is the third day we've read this verse. But rather than say, 'Give it a rest already!' read it over again and let it really sink in! When we're not living in God's truth, we're living in lies; we're going against God and getting trapped in the stuff we do wrong. So test out how you're doing.Imagine this: You have just found out that for the last two weeks your every movement has been picked up by secretly hidden cameras. Without realising it your life has been the latest Big Brother experiment. Everything that you have done and said over the last two weeks has been broadcast over the internet. The TV cameras and the press are outside waiting with their difficult questions. How are you feeling? Are you thinking back to certain moments hoping that no-one really saw that or heard you say that? Are you feeling confident about the press interview? Or do you want the ground to open up and swallow you? Are you just thankful it was this month it happened and not last month? If you're not feeling totally confident, take time to think where you went wrong and talk to God about it. Ask Him to forgive you and start again. Jesus says, 'If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.' (John 8: 32 NIV)<br />SoulFood reading: Jer 51-52, Luke 7:11-23, Ps 118:10-18, Pr 15:31-32</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'The Israelites groaned in their slavery and cried out, and their cry for help because of their slavery went up to God'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Exodus 2:23 NIV<br /></span>In the short time it takes you to read this, thousands of people will suffer. Death, disaster, disease, loss, trouble, violence, hardship, tragedy, failure are some of the harsh realities of life. They bring with them, grief, heartache, depression, agony, disappointment, sorrow, sadness, pain, misery. The Bible tells us that people on this earth, will always suffer, because of sin. Even Jesus said, 'In this world you will have trouble' (John 16:33 NIV). So the question we should be asking is not, 'will I suffer?', but 'how will I deal with suffering?'<br />Look what the Israelites did, 'they cried out (to God) for help'. In Exodus 3 we discover that when God's people are hurting: He sees, He Hears, He cares; and He acts. For years the Israelites had been held as slaves in Egypt and God promised to set them free (Genesis 15:16, 46:3-4). They had to wait a long time for that promise to be kept. God rescued them when He knew the time was right. God's rescue doesn't always come the moment we want it. <br />If you're suffering today, remember that even though God has a different time schedule; He sees, He Hears, He really does cares; and He will act. Do you know someone who is suffering? Ask God to show you how He could use you to help them. God used Moses to set the people free from slavery. God will use you too.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>John 8: 32 NIV</span><br />Do you know what the most deadly weapon in the world is? More deadly than any nuclear weapon of mass destruction! It's your tongue! The tongue is always right there at the start, the root source of every war that's started, every evil deed that's done, every weapon that's built, every scheme that is plotted to bring about death and destruction. The Bible says, '...our tongues get out of control...they are restless...always spreading deadly poison.' (James 3: 8 CEV) Who would have believed, that little pink muscle we're also encouraged to scrub clean along with our teeth each day (with specially made toothbrushes built to scrape the fuzz off), could be so dangerous? We have to be dead careful how we use it. If not, it will stop you living in God's truth-the 'truth that will set you free'. You wouldn't choose to live as a prisoner, would you? Locked up for your whole life? NO! So how do we tame our tongue and live in God's truth? (1) Trust God's Word more than your own. (2) Remember God's way is the best way. (3) Understand that we need God's help to 'tame our tongue'-never go it alone! (4) Think ahead. Get it right now-it makes it easier in the future. (5) Help others live the same way.<br />SoulFood reading: Jer 49-50, Luke 7:1-10, Ps 118:1-9, Pr 15:27-30</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work.'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Genesis 2:2 NIV<br /></span>Get this; God doesn't get tired! (Psalm 121:4) So what's He doing taking a rest then eh? Could it be that rest isn't just about stopping when you're tired to 'recharge your batteries'? Could it be that God is telling us something important? When God rested, He was telling us we need to rest too! So how exactly did God do it? <br />1) He rested after he had worked; sorry if you were thinking 'YAY I can rest all the time God says!' We too need to work first and then rest! <br />2) He worked 6/7 of the week and rested 1/7; when we come back from holiday, we can want to stay in 'holiday mode', and start dreaming of holidaying all year round. But God's way for our lives is about getting the right balance. <br />3) He blessed His rest time; He set it apart as something different. He gave a rule to live by (commandment 4 in Exodus 20) that our rest must be a priority, something special, different than any other day. <br />4) He used it to look back on all His work; we too need to regularly look back at what we've been doing and how we've been living, to avoid making the same mistakes. <br />God was able to look back and call everything 'very good.' Can you look back on your last week and say the same? Take time to chill!

<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>John 8: 32 NIV<br /></span>Have you seen the film Liar Liar? Actor Jim Carrey plays a character who is a compulsive liar until his son makes a wish that he will never be able to lie again-and his wish comes true. There are some funny moments as his dad struggles with telling the truth, but in the end he actually discovers that being honest brings out the best in him and his life changes dramatically for the better. Jesus wants us to live a life of truth. He says, 'If you keep on obeying what I've said, you are truly my disciples. You will know the truth and the truth will set you free.' (John 8: 31-32 CEV) Jesus knows that when we lie, it hurts, destroys and traps us. Jesus wants us to live a life of freedom. <br />No-one can force us to stop lying, but if they could would it make any difference to you? Seriously think about it for a moment, how often do you think it would be a problem for you? We've all got room for improving. We need to focus on living 100% in the truth! Why? Firstly: Because, 'The Lord hates...a lying tongue.' (Proverbs 6: 16-17 NKJV) Secondly: It traps us, 'A witness who lies will not go free, liars will never escape.' (Proverbs 19: 5 NCV) Talk to God today and ask Him to help you to live your life in His truth!<br />SoulFood reading: Jer 45-48, Luke 6:37-49, Ps 109:16-31, Pr 15:23-26</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...here is the conclusion of the matter: Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ecclesiastes 12:13 NIV<br /></span>If anyone ever 'had it all' Solomon did. Knowledge, power, and the biggest bank account ever! On top of that his house was full of 100's of beautiful women, plus he was a famous writer, a connoisseur of fine wines and his dinner parties resembled 'lifestyles of the rich and famous'. In his spare time he built magnificent palaces, gardens and parks! But here's the amazing thing: Solomon never found fulfilment in his unlimited possessions, power or pleasure (and he really did try... read Ecclesiastes and see for yourself!). That's why he made this statement near the end of his life, 'Here is the conclusion of the matter: Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.'<br />So there you have it. Solomon, one of the most powerful and people who ever lived - saying, 'Take it from a guy who's tried it all: This world, despite all its glitz and glamour, cannot fill the empty place in your soul. Only a relationship with God will satisfy your deepest longings'. So, what about you? Have you found the ultimate fulfilment that only Jesus Christ can bring? Open your heart to Him. Ask Him to forgive your sins and fill you with His life and love. Then spend your days getting to know Him. That's the smartest move you can ever make. And that's the way to true riches.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...He gave them their request, but sent leanness into their soul...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 106: 15 NKJV</span><br />Have you ever seen a child waving their ice-cream about with mum saying 'hold it still or it will fall on the floor'? After the 4th time mum goes 'fine have it your way'. Then you hear the siren start, the ice-cream is on the floor, the kid is at full noise and mum is going 'I wish you'd listen to me sometimes!' The mum knew best, and was saying 'don't' out of love, but the kid just wouldn't listen! <br />Sometimes, we can be like that with God-we think we know better than Him, and though He may be stopping us from doing something in His wisdom, if we keep on and on at Him, He may step back and let us have it our way. But that doesn't mean it'll always work for the best, just like the kid with the ice cream.<br />After God brought His people through the Red Sea, they soon forgot what He'd done, and tested Him-and He gave them what they asked, providing physically but 'sent leanness into their soul'. They were spiritually empty, coz they did things their way. Check out Exodus 2:11-14, when Moses took things in his own hands-he couldn't even keep one soldier that he killed buried in the sand. But doing it God's way later, a whole army was buried in the Red Sea! So today, make up your mind to do it God's way: it's so much better!<br />SoulFood reading: Jer 41-44, Luke 6:27-36, Ps 109:1-15, Pr 15:22</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'Be thankful in all circumstances, for this is God's will for you who belong to Christ Jesus..'</h2>
<br /><br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Thessalonians 5:18 NLT<br /></span>'Carpe diem', that's Latin for 'seize the day'. It means live for today, not tomorrow. We can often spend today looking forward to tomorrow. We decide we don't like the now, so daydream about the later. We find ourselves saying things like: 'I can't wait till the weekend', or 'things will be so great when I finally leave school.' Or 'once I get my license, my life will be perfect!' We focus on the future. If we always live like this - thinking mainly about tomorrow - we'll never be satisfied, because tomorrow never comes does it? <br />When things go wrong, we often look ahead to better days; try to avoid what's happening now. There's a problem with this futuristic obsession: It shields us from what really is (reality) by filling our minds with what might be (fantasy). The result is sad; we miss out on life, because we never stop to think about what's happening now! God doesn't want you to miss out, which is why he says, Give thanks all the time, 'no matter what is happening'. When you do this you recognise that every moment of every day He is there with you. Nothing is outside His understanding. When life is sad or difficult, taking time to thank God you realise He is there protecting you, loving you, encouraging you, supporting you. If you're always looking ahead you'll miss out on knowing Him. So seize the day; give thanks!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'Be imitators of God... as dearly loved children.'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ephesians 5: 1 NIV<br /></span>If you've got a little brother or sister, or have ever seen a child grow up, you'll know how true it is to say that children learn from their parents-from the little things like how they speak (do they say bath so it rhymes with naff or hearth?!) to the bigger things like a work ethic, opinions on money and how they treat people. You may even have had your great aunt Betty say to you, 'ooh, you are like your mum when you do that'! We learn from our parents-but not just them. As you've got a bit older and developed your own friendships, you may have realised that you've picked up habits or phrases from your mates too. The more time you spend with someone, the more you become like them. If we see God as our heavenly Father, and spend time with Him, then it follows that we should become like Him too-which is what we should want. Check out how 'the word on the street' paraphrases Ephesians 5: 1: 'Copy God: imitate him; mimic his mannerisms like kids end up walking and talking like their old man. Love people like the Liberator loved you... And the whiff of it all will float up to heaven where God will inhale and be moved to tears.' Study Jesus, spend time with God, and let that be what influences who you become.<br />SoulFood reading: 2 Kings 20:1-11, Heb 8:7-13</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will serve before kings...not...obscure men..'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 22:29 NIV<br /></span>On a list of your favourite words, responsibility is probably propping up the bottom along with exam and dentist. But think how life would be without any responsibilities. Your parents wouldn't have to provide you with a home, there would be no laws against anything at all, you couldn't do anything that involves working together; so no team sports. It's absolutely right to be thankful that God has created you to be responsible, hard working and skilled at what you do best. <br />Some people think that work, taking responsibility, is something that came after Adam and Eve got chucked out of the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3). Because they messed up, sin entered the world and so now we have to work. Gutted! But this isn't true; God actually designed us to work and be good and skilled at what we do right from the start. God put Adam in the Garden '...to work and take care of it' (Genesis 2:15). He wasn't expecting Adam to stuff it up either! He 'put him in charge'. More importantly we know that God Himself works and rests (John 5:17, Genesis 2:2-3) so there is no way we can excuse ourselves. Work is one of our God-given responsibilities.<br />Every day has 24 hours filled with opportunities to serve and to become better at what you do. So don't be scared of the 'R' word!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'Praises and curses come from the same mouth...this should not happen.'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>James 3: 10 NCV<br /></span>The Bible says: 'We use our tongues to praise our Lord...but then we curse people whom God made like himself...this should not happen.' (James 3: 9-10 NCV) When we're full on for God, praising Him in church or youth group on a Sunday, but then rip into someone at school or college on Monday, it breaks God's heart. Even if you think you're only saying something that's true, if it hurts someone else, or puts them down, God says it's wrong. Trying to justify our gossip doesn't help, because even if we don't say it to someone's face, what we say about someone affects the way that others see them-they can judge them without even knowing them. A good habit to get into with your mates, is to agree that if one of you starts to say something bad about someone, just say, 'Hang about, but did they hurt you, or put you down? Doesn't God love them too?' If someone has hurt you or upset you, ask your friends to pray about your attitude to them with you, instead of dissing them behind their back. We learn from the Bible that we should 'Be...gentle, and patient, accepting each other in love...' (Ephesians 4: 2-3 NCV) We all get stuff wrong and hurt others, so we all need this-why not start by practicing patience with others today, and loving them instead of gossiping about them?<br />SoulFood reading: Jer 36:27 - 40:16, Luke 6:17-26, Ps 79, Pr 15:18-21</p>]]></introtext>

<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 15:4 NIV</span><br />Maybe the toughest decisions you face during your teenage years are the ones involving your personal values eg what principles will you live your life by? Childhood means everybody else tells you what to think and how to act. Adulthood means it's your call. Will you take on board the ideals of your parents? That might be a good thing; or it might not! Will you launch out on our own? No-one can live your life for you. You have to decide.<br />Values aren't just something we think about but stuff we do. Our values cause us to act in a certain way. God unpacks many values in the Bible, teaching us how He wants us to live. Here's just one of them: ‘The tongue that brings healing is a tree of life, but a deceitful tongue crushes the spirit.' Do you ever think from one day to the next about the words you create with your tongue? Do you want your voice to be a voice of healing or a voice of destruction? The answer might seem obvious to you now but would it be obvious to someone on the receiving end of one of your rants! <br />Don't just think about this verse today. Take some time to write down the values you have about family, money, sex, relationships, friendships, education, work, church. Do your values match what God says? Listen to God's values and live them!

<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Corinthians 9: 24 NIV<br /></span>Today, we're going back in time... Imagine you're at primary school, and it's that day of the year you either love or hate-sports day! You've either been looking forward to it, or dreading it, for the same reason-because you want to win! Whether it's the three-legged, the obstacle, the egg and spoon race or the sprint, you run your heart out to win. And if you don't win, you're determined to try even harder next year. When little kids race, they put so much into it, even if they're unlikely to win, they still run their hardest and try for first place! That's the way we should be in our relationship with God. We should want the best, we should always be trying to get closer to Him. You'd never enter a race expecting or wanting to lose it, would you? No matter what, you try your very best, you want to win. Do you ever look at your mates and think that their relationship with God is so much deeper and better than yours, that theirs is taking off, while you're going round in circles? That's probably because they've committed to pursuing God until His presence is real in their lives; God honours that commitment. You can get that too; so get back that childish enthusiasm you had, and don't take your eyes off the finish line. Go for Gold in your relationship with God! <br />SoulFood reading: Jer 33:1 - 36:26, Luke 6:1-16, Ps 137, Pr 15:15-17</p>]]></introtext>

<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 10:4 NIV</span><br />Years ago a farmer on the Atlantic coast found it really difficult to find workers. No-one wanted to work for him because of the dreadful storms that hit the area. The farmer interviewed yet another man, 'Are you a good farmhand?' This man replied, 'Well, I can sleep when the wind blows.' The farmer didn't understand his answer, but was so desperate for workers, offered him the job. To his astonishment the guy accepted and worked really well. Then one night the farmer woke up to the sound of the wind howling. He jumped out of bed and went to the farmhand's room, 'Get up, Get up! A storms coming, tie things down before they blow away'. The man rolled over and firmly said, 'No Sir! I told you I can sleep when the wind blows.' Enraged the farmer ran out to see to the farm without his help. To his amazement he discovered that all the haystacks had been covered, all the animals were locked away safely, everything was tied down, and nothing could blow away. The farmer then understood what his hired farmhand had meant, and he returned to bed, to also sleep whilst the wind blew.<br />When you work hard you are prepared and have nothing to fear. Work hard at reading your Bible. Then whatever life throws your way, you can 'sleep when the wind blows' too.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Mark 14: 34 NIV<br /></span>Have you ever felt one way, but had people tell you that as a Christian you shouldn't? Ever heard 'Don't feel like that. If you trusted God and prayed more...sort it out and get over it!'? You feel like the bottom has fallen out of your world, things couldn't get any worse, then your so-called mate says that, and then you feel worse! They don't say it to make things worse; they really do mean well, but you don't need to hear it then. With friends like those...well, you know the rest of that saying! Are you on your own feeling like that? No! Check out Job's story in the Old Testament to see a bunch of well-meaning friends who didn't really help much! <br />So if 'encouraging' words don't help, what do we do when we feel we've hit rock-bottom? Firstly, understand that feelings are human emotions: even Jesus had them! He didn't deny or hide them, or beat Himself up for having them, He openly acknowledged them but processed them in a healthy way. He prayed that God would take them away. It's ok to want that! God didn't yell at Him or tell Him to get over it, did He? Secondly, know that feelings don't dictate your options or eliminate your choices. You can still make good choices when you're feeling bad. Follow Jesus' example in Mark 14: 36-choose God's will, whatever you feel, and He'll strengthen you to handle the tough times.<br />SoulFood reading: Jer 31-32, Luke 5:27-39, Ps 122, Pr 15:10-14</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'The wicked man earns deceptive wages, but he who sows righteousness reaps a sure reward.'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 11:18 NIV</span><br />A man asked for a member of his family to be left unmentioned in a book that was being written about his family history. The reason was that he wanted to hide the awful truth that this relative had been sentenced to death by electric chair for committing murder. 'No need to do that', said the biographer. 'I can report the situation in such a way that there will be no embarrassment to you. I'll just write that his death came as a real shock.' OK, sick joke alert! But seriously, the Bible teaches us that once we've died, there's nothing else that can be done in order to get us ready to meet God (Hebrews 9:27). It won't matter what people write about you or say about you to make you look good. God knows all about you, and you will be judged by Him.<br />Life can seem so unfair sometimes; some people get away all sorts of bad stuff, others make lots of money from doing wrong things, innocent people suffer. But remember, ultimately God is in control, He will be the judge, and the rewards some dodgy people appear to be getting for doing wrong, God promises, won't last long. 'Evil people get rich for the moment, but the reward of the godly will last.' Concentrate on being the best you can be and let God be the judge of others.<br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Sam 17:14- 19:43, John 5:1-15, Ps 15, Pr 24:7<br />]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...He poured water into a bowl and began to wash the followers' feet...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>John 13: 5 NCV<br /></span>Imagine... you're touring London; you've done the museums, the shops and the sights, and you're finishing up with a tour of Buckingham Palace. You're halfway through the tour, being shown the royal bathroom, when the Queen walks in, rolls up her sleeves, runs some water in the bath, then makes you take off your shoes and socks and starts washing your feet. Then she dries them, and moves on to your sister, then your mum and dad! How weird would that be?! Not what you'd expect from the Queen of England at all, is it? Yet Jesus did exactly that to the disciples; He did what they really weren't expecting, He went first, He led the way, in spite of who [a15]He was. He shows us that we have to be willing to put aside our image, put aside people's expectations of us, put aside our own comfort and status and remember that first and foremost, we're here to serve God. Check out John 13: 13-17. Jesus tells us to follow His example, and serve others. So if you want to be blessed, don't focus on making spiritual speeches, or letting everyone know how holy you are and what amazing things you've done-instead, roll up your sleeves and get serving those around you. And don't wait for everyone else to start. Someone needs to set the trend-so why not you?<br />SoulFood reading: Jer 28-30, Luke 5:12-26, Ps 110, Pr 15:8-9</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'Go to the ant, you sluggard; consider its ways and be wise!'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 6:6 NLT</span><br />Lots of people have dreams about being a superhero like Batman or Spiderman or maybe even the Incredible Hulk! But what about Antman (or Antwoman!)? How does that sound? Yes, Ants, those pesky little things that make us feel seriously grossed out if we find one in our jam sandwich! We instinctively want to squash them if we see them; we don't much care for them being around do we? But God says learn from them. He is thinking about the superhero Antman! Now before you get carried away designing your superhero outfit, listen to what God wants you to learn (proverbs 6:6-8).<br />1) The ant works hard: No-one has to tell the ant what to do. They have no Boss telling them, but they see the need and get on with their job. 2) The ant prepares for the future: They don't just live for today, but make plans for the year ahead. 3) The ant is focused: The ant knows what it should do, it has purpose.<br />God wants you to live the same: a) to work hard, not because some teacher or boss or parent is breathing down your neck, but because you want to b) to plan for the future, not just living in the moment, but thinking about where you're going c) to be focused, determined to live your life being all God intended you to be.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...I will make up to you for the years that the...locust has eaten...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Joel 2: 25 NAS<br /></span>You have to let go of what you failed to do: whether it was not talking to the new geeky kid at school coz you didn't want your mates to laugh, or not telling people about God coz you're scared of what they'll say; for whatever reason, we don't always do what we know is right. Today's verse isn't really about bugs eating stuff, it's more about God saying that even though there's stuff you haven't done, that He would have liked you to do, He can make up for it. God gives you a second chance: He can put you where you would have been if you'd not missed out in the first place. So instead of living your life thinking 'coulda, woulda, shoulda done that' and 'if only', leave behind the things you didn't do, don't beat yourself up about it, and have faith that God will give you a second chance. Remember: say sorry, and it's shredded, forgotten. Focus instead on not missing out on the future opportunities, but grabbing them with both hands. You may feel like you're completely going to miss out on something, some dream, because you didn't do what you should have done. So be outrageous: ask God for a new dream for the future, forgetting what's past, and reaching for the exciting future you know He's got planned for you!<br />SoulFood reading: Jer 25-27, Luke 5:1-11, Ps 102:18-28, Pr 15:4-7</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'One who is slack in his work is brother to one who destroys.'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 18:9 NIV</span><br />Ok so we all like to sit in front of the TV sometimes, or turn off the alarm and go back to sleep. We don't always do things when we should, 'I'll do it later!' we say. Does that make you lazy? The Bible's very clear that being lazy is as bad as vandalizing. Laziness is destructive! So we don't want to fall into that trap! Do we? (The answer is no - you don't!) So let's have a lazy checklist, so we can stop ourselves from hitting the destruct button by falling into the laziness trap.<br />L is for Lame: Lame excuses that you make up for not doing things! A is for Always: Always being the one other people have to clean up after! Z is for ZZzzz: ZZzzz - Are you spending far too many mornings having another lie-in? Y is for YoYo: YoYo describes your emotions that bounce up and down all the time - and when you're down nothing at all gets done because you 'just don't feel like it!' <br />So does that sound anything like you? Are you L-A-Z-Y? Make a change today or these lazy habits and attitudes will become a way of life, which means you're headed for a life of destruction. God wants you to value yourself far more than this. He sees your potential. You can do it. From today let's agree lazy days are over!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...I persecuted the church...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Galatians 1: 13 NIV<br /></span>Today you have to let go of what you've done to others. The things we've done to others can weigh us down like a ton of bricks-the guilt can really drag you down, even if they say it's fine now. It's a bit like living in A Christmas Carol, with the ghost of your past not letting you move on in life. How do you live with the things you've done? Take Saul (Paul) as an example, and you'll soon feel better about yourself! You can definitely learn from him, he was someone who had really messed up-he'd torn Christians from their families and dragged them away to be beaten and killed. Then he converted to Christianity himself, and went around preaching to and meeting the widows and kids of the guys he'd done over. How did he deal with that guilt? He had two choices, and so do we-either try to carry it around, and probably collapse in the process, or find someone with shoulders big enough to take it from us. What did Paul do? Enter Jesus, who has the biggest shoulders you could ever hope for. Paul handed it to Him, and thanked God for it. Check out Romans 7:24-25. God showed him mercy, and he let go of the hurts he'd caused, knowing God could heal them. Trust God to do the same for you, and let it go.<br />SoulFood reading: Jer 22-24, Luke 4:31-44, Ps 102:12-17, Pr 15:3</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control'</h2><br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Galatians 5:22-23 NAS</span><br />Approachable people are like this: 1) Personal warmth; they actually like people. Ok, so some people are a nightmare, but the truth is that people suss out whether you like them or not. And if you're going to be approachable you need to learn to love people! 2) Their moods are consistent. How frustrating are moody people? You never know how they'll be. If you're moody, people will be scared to talk to you. 3) Sensitivity to people's feelings. Although approachable people are emotionally stable, they don't expect everyone to be that way. They recognise that good people have bad days; and act sensitively to that. 4) They understand human weakness, including their own. Don't be down on yourself, but be honest about your own weaknesses. When you're not trying to show people how fantastic you are and admit your struggles other people will be honest too. An old proverb says: 'Blessed are they who can laugh at themselves, for they shall never cease to be amused.' And because they can admit their own faults, they don't have a problem allowing other people to have faults as well. 5) The ability to forgive, and ask for forgiveness. Sometimes you screw up. Fact. We all do. So why do we often find it so hard to admit that? When you've messed up, say sorry. Get over yourself and ask for forgiveness. When you can do this other people will do it too.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...God has made me forget all my trouble...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Genesis 41: 51 NIV<br /></span>Ok, more of 'Let it go'. Here's the point in super-simple terms: you have to let go of what other people have done to you. Have you ever had a nasty cut that got a HUGE scab on it, and did you have a little pick at the scab, and make it bleed and hurt again a bit? Well, think of that scab as the healing of bad stuff that other people have done to you-if you let it go, and just leave it alone, eventually it will heal. It may well sting a bit on the way, and you may be left with a little scar, but it shouldn't be too bad. But, if you pick at the scab, keep worrying it, once, twice, even more, it'll take way longer to heal, it may even get infected, and you'll almost definitely have a scar at the end of it. Yes, that person did hurt you and yes that stinks-but it's not going to change. However, the way you deal with the hurt can change. They're responsible for the original cut, but if you keep picking it, that's you, not them making it hurt-and you're not giving it a chance to heal; you're not letting God do His thing. So do yourself a favour-stop picking that scab, and ask God to help you each time you think about it.<br />SoulFood reading: Ruth 1:3-18, Acts 8:26-40</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'For a man may do his work with wisdom, knowledge and skill, and then he must leave all he owns to someone who has not worked for it. This too is meaningless and a great misfortune.'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ecclesiastes 2:21 NIV<br /></span>We're often told to 'build a good life for ourselves'; to 'look out for number one'. To get good qualifications, a good career, a house, a car, get married, have kids, have holidays abroad, nice clothes, lots of money. But at the end of the day, we're all going to die and then what? What was the point of living like that? It all seems pretty pointless don't you think? <br />Jesus warns us against living such pointless lives, &quot;Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.&quot; (Matthew 6: 19-21 NIV)<br />God doesn't want us to build our lives getting things that we can't take to heaven with us, or doing things that will mean nothing in heaven. He doesn't want you to live a pointless life. So when you're thinking about what to do with your time, your money, your life. Ask yourself this, will it make a difference in the light of eternity?<br />You only have one life to invest in the eternity to come. Don't miss the opportunity. Today make sure that what will be most important to you five minutes after you die, become the most important to you now.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'Forget what has happened before, and do not think about the past.'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Isaiah 43: 18 NCV<br /></span>What do you do when your memory drags crud from the past, and makes it seem real now, making it hurt all over again? Today's verse looks at letting go. Unless you decide to let it go, your past can, and will, infect your present, and influence your future. God doesn't want that for you!<br />First, you need to let go of what God has forgiven! When you confess sin to God and say sorry, He forgives and forgets-instantly! Imagine you write down the wrong stuff you've done, in detail, and every time you look at it you feel bad. When you confess, God takes that paper and shreds it beyond recognition; it's gone, rubbish, it is no more. You don't have it to remind you anymore. But if you don't let go of what God's forgiven, it's like you going through the bin, spending ages picking out all the bits, and painstakingly sticking them all back together. You wouldn't do that in real life, so don't do it with God; He shredded it deliberately, because once you've said sorry, it's gone. And what if you don't feel forgiven? Well, you don't feel oxygen, but you don't use that as a reason to stop breathing, do you? If you don't feel forgiven, just act like you are, and over time, you'll start to feel it too. <br />SoulFood reading: Jer 18-21, Luke 4:14-30, Ps 102:1-11, Pr 14:35 - 15:2</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'But the fruit of the Spirit is... kindness, goodness... gentleness,'</h2><br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Galatians 5:22-23 NKJV</span><br />Before we look at whether or not we're approachable, we've got to ask 'do we care?' After all, some of us quite like the idea that people are scared of us, or that we're 'hard'. People like this don't tend to be very approachable, because you never know what response you're going to get! But is this really how you want people to see you? You might feel good thinking people are scared of you, but it's hard to make good friends. Let's take Jesus as an example. He was the ultimate hardman, and talk about scary; He was the Son of God AND could do pretty much anything He liked! Yet people flocked to Him in their thousands, His disciples never left his side. And why? It was because Jesus showed all the fruits of the Spirit. He was no walk over, yet He had so much compassion for people. When people were trying to kill Him, He fought back with love. He was kind, He loved kids, He was gentle and humble but at the same time He knew He was the Son of God. He knew He had the strength of Father God to draw on when He felt weak. Let's think about how we can model ourselves on Jesus today. We've the same Father God watching our back so drop the act and do it, Jesus style!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'Blessed are those who have learned to...walk in the light of your presence...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 89: 15 NIV<br /></span>Wouldn't it be nice if God just handed you a book of your entire life right now. You could flick through the chapters about your jobs, relationships, money, dreams and ambitions. You could skim read all the outcomes of your life choices. It would save you a whole lot of worrying and stressing in the here-and-now about whether you'll ever find that 'special someone'. Or how you'll ever pay that money you owe. Or do you ever conquer that re-occurring struggle?<br />It might seem a nice idea, but that's not how God works. The Psalmist said, 'Blessed are those who have learned to...walk in the light of your presence...' (Psalm 89:15 NIV) In ancient European monasteries monks walked dark corridors with candles on the toes of their shoes, giving them just enough light to see the next step. That's how God leads us. Just enough light to see our next steps. We might pray to God over direction in something, and then complain that He's not listening just because He hasn't sent the floodlights on our entire future. With God, it's never the full floodlit laser lightshow, it's more like the small flickers of a candle. There's enough glow to stop us tripping over our own feet, but it's only a little glimmer in order that we keep our hand firmly placed in our Father's hand; in order that we walk in the light of His presence. <br />SoulFood reading: Jer 14-17, Luke 4:1-13, Ps 98, Pr 14:34</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'Then Isaac sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year a hundredfold; and the LORD blessed him.'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Genesis 26:12 NKJV</span><br />Sometimes what God asks us to do, can seem totally ludicrous, absolutely ridiculous! Are you up for that? Isaac was; he was well up for whatever God asked of him. Then he was in a land that was suffering from famine and God told him to stay put. Sensible people don't spend months doing the back-breaking job of planting seeds in a land where there's very little water. Not only is it bad for business, but you and your family are likely to die in the process! Even so, Isaac chooses to obey God, and God kept His promise and business was booming!<br />Unfortunately this just made the guys living around Isaac (the Philistines) mad with jealousy and they deliberately started to trash all Isaac's hard work. He could have fought back, big time. They were breaking the law! But he chose to be patient, he followed God's way, and as a result he got a bumper harvest and the people were able to live together in peace. What seemed ridiculous turned out better than ever!<br />We too can find ourselves in situations where it's so hard to give when you have so little, or so hard to be patient with people who are deliberately causing you trouble. Remember God's way won in Isaacs's life, so God's way will win in your life too. Are you up for the absolutely ridiculous today?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'Whoever pursues righteousness and unfailing love will find life, righteousness, and honour.'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 21: 21 NLT<br /></span>Fact: People who set goals achieve more than people of equal education and ability who don't. With that in mind, build these eight principles into your life. <br />(1) Decide what the goal is. Do this by consulting God-and not just once! Talk to him about it over and over again. 'Many are the plans in a man's heart, but it is the Lord's purpose that prevails.' (Proverbs 19: 21 NIV) (2) Think on paper. Writing your goals down gives them a sense of permanency, plus it energises you. (3) Establish a deadline. Without a definite beginning and ending it's easy to put it off and get nowhere. (4) Make a list of what you need to do to achieve your goal. (5) Convert your list to a plan. Decide what's most important and you need to do first and what things you can do later. (6) Act immediately. 'Be very careful, then, how you live-not as unwise but as wise, making the most of every opportunity...' (Ephesians 5: 15-16 NIV) Do something! An average plan put into action beats a brilliant one that's not. (7) Do something every day to move you forward. Build it into your diary. (8) Have a goal you're willing to devote your life to. And keep your eye on that goal at all times. 'Teach us to number our days aright, that we may gain a heart of wisdom.' (Psalm 90: 12 NIV) <br />SoulFood reading: Jer 10-13, Luke 3:21-37, Ps 95, Pr 14:29-33</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'I will bless the Lord at all times...'</h2><br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 34:1 NKJV</span><br />David said, 'I will bless the Lord at all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth.' A thankful heart isn't always easy to have but it's much better than being bitter and miserable, in fact it can save your life! When Jonah disobeyed God and ended up inside the whale, he told God, '...I will sacrifice to You with...thanksgiving...' (Jonah 2:9 NKJV). When he did, God made the fish spit him up on dry land. When you're down in the dumps and life's feeling rubbish, that's when you need to open your trap and praise God. Nothing shows trust like thanking God when life's smacking you round the head. This does two things:<br />1) It builds your faith. David said, '...magnify the Lord with me...' (Psalms 34:3). Picture a giant magnifying glass pointed at God. When you remember just how big God is, the problem becomes so tiny it's ridiculous! Plus, '...faith comes by hearing...the word of God' (Romans 10:17 NKJV). Hearing God's promises coming from your own lips, causes faith to rise in your heart. So start talking!<br />2) It restores life. Before raising Lazarus from the dead, Jesus looked up to heaven and said, 'Father...thank You that You have heard Me. And I know that You always hear Me...' (John 11:41-42 NKJV). As soon as you thank God for stuff you're faith levels rocket, then the grey can turn to colour.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Philippians 4: 6 NKJV<br /></span>Have you ever been at a prayer meeting, or youth group when people were praying, and either not prayed out loud coz you didn't think what you wanted to pray about was worthy, or prayed about something you really didn't know much or care about especially, coz you thought it'd sound more spiritual and make you sound more holy? You end up praying about those missionaries in Guatemala (wherever that is!) or world peace, when really your mind keeps wandering back to that coursework you've got to do but really don't understand? We all do that at times, but the solution to the ever-wandering mind is simple, and staring at us in this verse: don't worry! Pray what's in your heart, not what you think should be or wish was there. Don't worry about sounding 'spiritual'-God knows what's in your heart anyway, so why not try being honest with Him, and praying about what's really bothering or exciting you. Whether you think your request is big or small, whether your motives are mixed or pure, whether your thanks are genuine or a bit silly, God can sort it all out, and He'll respond to your prayers wisely. You just need to trust Him with your prayers. If He doesn't answer the way you want Him to, it's for a reason-He knows what He's doing. So don't be afraid; just pray!<br />SoulFood reading: Jer 7-9, Luke 3:11-20, Ps 64, Pr 14:25-28</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 6:4 NIV</span><br />A couple of weeks ago we were looking into what Jesus really meant when he called people 'hypocrites'. We found out that it was all to do with the ancient Greeks and their love of acting and theatre. Let's have another look at this today because there's more for us to discover... In Matthews Gospel Jesus actually mentions four types of Hypocrites: <br />1) The Poser; the Christian who makes themselves 'look good' by acting like they care about others when really they couldn't give a stuff <br />2) The Pusher; the Christian who pushes other people into doing what they don't do themselves <br />3) The Preventer; the Christian who is so obsessed with their own petty issues that they stop other people from experiencing God <br />4) The Preoccupied: the Christian who is more bothered about how they look on the outside than who they are inside.<br />So what's all this got to do with today's verse? Well Jesus is letting us know that He wants us to help anyone and everyone around us who's in need, anyway that we can, BUT, with the right motive! He doesn't want you to put on an act and do things to make yourself look good, that's being a hypocrite! Do it because you love Jesus and want to be more like Him. Then you'll find God smiling over you, saying 'that's my kid!' And get this....He'll give you a reward EVERYTIME!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...none of these things move me...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Acts 20: 24 NKJV<br /></span>You don't often hear about famous people before they 'arrive', do you? It's easy to think they never had it hard, never had stuff thrown in their way-but that's because it's part of their job to put up a front in public. Think about some of the most significant leaders in our nation, like Kevin Rudd or John Howard. Do you think they ever got told they wouldn't amount to much? Of course they did; they get criticised all the time in the press and take all sorts of knocks. And what about Barack Obama: did he let the colour of his skin hold him back when everyone thought the idea of a black President was impossible? The common theme is that these leaders have a vision for their life; nothing will stop them. That doesn't mean that things don't come along and get in the way, it doesn't mean everything's easy; but instead of letting the bad stuff knock them down, instead of giving up, they brush themselves off after every fall and see what they can learn from it. Yes, some of the stumbling blocks in life may hurt, but don't let them stop you. Follow Paul's example, and next time something tough comes your way, say to yourself, 'This won't move me.' Ask God to help you use it to grow and learn, and to shape you to be more like Him through your experiences. <br />SoulFood reading: Jer 4-6, Luke 3:1-10, Ps 59:9-17, Pr 14:23-24</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘God is our refuge and strength...'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 46:1 NIV</span><br />Yesterday we began to think a bit about the troubled world we live in. Terrorism, wars, hurricanes, tsunamis, crime, disease. Every night the media invades our homes bringing all this stuff to us in glorious Technicolor. The result is that our emotions can take a bit of a battering. Instead of having a true grasp of reality our minds start producing all sorts of worries about the future - what if we're next? In response to that the Bible says three things: <br />1) ‘God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.' When you're in a tight spot, God is totally available to help you. Read the whole Psalm - there's no catch, it doesn't say that God will help you occasionally or reluctantly. No, He's there for you, always. What more do you need? <br />2) ‘Therefore we will not fear' (v. 2 NIV). Don't panic, talk defeat, or give in to despair. A songwriter said, ‘He's as close as the mention of his name.' Just say His name in prayer, and He'll be there for you. <br />3) ‘...waters roar and foam and the mountains quake with their surging' (v. 3 NIV). When everything you once thought to be solid and dependable, is shaken to the core you'll be where you've always been; in the strong and loving arms of God; the One who's always available to help.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...we are more than conquerors...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Romans 8: 37 NKJV<br /></span>Do you think you have it bad? Life sucks, there's always something stopping you getting where you want to go? There's no way you'll ever succeed with all this stuff holding you back? Everyone else has it better than you; money or fame is all you need for success? Think again! Some of the most famous names we know had a tough time of it before they made it big. Take Beethoven as an example. Now, you may not like his music, and think it's just for old fossils, but you've got to admit the man is pretty well known; most people recognise his name. You may think he must have had a sorted life to make it-but no! His dad was an alcoholic slave driver, who forced him to work to support the family. He spent so much time playing the piano and composing to make money, he had no childhood. But he didn't let that stop him. He used the bad stuff to make a better life for himself, and started thinking positively. What had been stumbling blocks, he turned into stepping stones, which helped make him who he was at the end of his life. So don't stumble on problems and grumble about them; instead, step on them, and use them to help you move forwards in life. It's not easy, but with God, you can conquer the biggest problems and make good from them.<br />SoulFood reading: Jer 1-3, Luke 2:41-52, Ps 59:1-8, Pr 14:21-22</p>]]></introtext>

<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 11:29 NIV</span><br />Sometimes teachers get it wrong: The famous French sculptor Rodin was described by teachers as, 'the worst pupil in the school!' Albert Einstein's teacher described him as &quot;mentally slow, unsociable and adrift forever in his foolish dreams.&quot; He was expelled! Thomas Edison, the guy who invented the light bulb had a teacher who said, 'he was too stupid to learn anything!' The famous opera singer Enrico's teacher said, 'he had no voice at all and could not sing!' Beethoven's teacher called him 'hopeless' as a composer.<br />Miss Phillips, a teacher of Peter J Daniel, constantly said, &quot;Peter. J. Daniel you're no good, you're a bad apple and you're never going to amount to anything.&quot; Peter was totally illiterate until he was 26. Now he owns the street corners he used to fight on and published a book: Miss Phillips, You Were Wrong!<br />Jesus is the greatest teacher of all, He never gets it wrong! He knows everything about you, He sees your potential, He never listens to what others say about you, He knows you! Today He is saying, 'Hang out with Me, learn from Me! I'll show you how to get the best out of your life. Don't try and work things out on your own, don't try so hard! Walk with Me, work with Me; watch how I do it. Keep company with Me and I'll teach you the best way to live life!&quot;

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...God bought you with a high price. So...honour God with your body...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Corinthians 6: 20 NLT<br /></span>Remember yesterday when we learnt that we're made in God's image? Well, today we're going to look at how that should affect the way we treat ourselves. We have three key things to consider: exercise, eating and sleep. Here we go: <br />Firstly: an hour on the Wii or PS3 doesn't count as exercise! It's easy to get some exercise-especially while you're young. Join a netball or football team, or if you're not really sporty, go for a walk with your mates at lunchtime instead of just sitting around! <br />Secondly: you need to eat well. Yeah, we all have days when all we want is chocolate and chips, but honestly you've got to get a balanced diet. That doesn't mean you balance a Mars bar with a bag of corn chips, but means you need to eat fruit and veg as well as protein (meat, cheese and nuts) and carbs (bread, pasta and rice etc). If you struggle with this, why not try a smoothie? It's a great way to get loads of goodness in you, and pretty yummy too. <br />Thirdly: staying up late isn't the be-all and end-all. We need sleep. If you don't get enough sleep, you won't focus properly in school, college, work or uni, and you won't achieve your best. So try and get 8 hours most nights; it really is good for your health! Remember: you're a temple!<br />SoulFood reading: Ex 17:1-7, John 4:4-42</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘In everything give thanks...'</h2>
<br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Thessalonians 5:18 NKJV</span><br />Some days can be a real drag, can't they. You get up and leave the house in the morning... it's raining. You pack up to go home again later on in the afternoon... it's still raining. And the forecast for the weekend - rain. Yep, there are days when your mood can hit rock bottom and before you know it every other word off your lips is some kind of moan, groan or complaint. Well just be careful, if you let a bit of mouldy weather get you down what will you do when real hardship comes along? <br />Joseph was people-trafficked by his own shady brothers! He couldn't possibly have known that God would turn their actions inside out and establish him as Prime Minister. Joe just had to take each day as it came ‘making the most of every opportunity...' (Ephesians 5:16 NIV). And Joseph's not the only one, the Bible tells story after story where difficulty actually makes people stronger. Listen, there's a plan unfolding in your life, and it isn't affected by rain or snow or sleet or hail! Around this world there are some places that don't have a lot of God's kingdom happening, war zones, places of poverty, disaster sites. God loves the people in those places as much as he loves you and he needs people prepared to face the environments, that He might be glorified. So see this winter as a practice run!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...God bought you with a high price. So...honour God with your body...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Corinthians 6: 20 NLT<br /></span>One of the things the Bible tells you to do is honour God with your body. But what does that mean? And what on earth has it got to do with temples? Ok, time for a quick history lesson: the temple was a place where people went to meet with God, and to worship Him. It was a place of respect, and pretty ornate too: which is a posh way of saying it was nice to look at! <br />God made you to be like that, He calls your body 'a temple'-how awesome is that?! God wants to live in you, and He wants you to live out Him, so that when people look at your life, they see Him. It says in the Bible that you're made in the image of God, so that basically means there's a bit of God in you. If you think about it, treating your body like a temple kind of makes sense. It's basically all about not abusing your body, but instead, using it to glorify God. So how should that affect the way you treat yourself?<br />Well, have a think about what you'd do if Jesus came to stay, and you were in charge of His wellbeing. I'm guessing you'd make sure He ate well, got sleep, exercised, and kept generally fit and healthy, wouldn't you? So...if you're made in the image of God, why should you treat yourself any differently? <br />SoulFood reading: Hosea 11-14, Luke 2:34-40, Ps 21, Pr 14:17-20</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'I pray...that your heart may be enlightened...'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ephesians 1:18 NIV<br /></span>Imagine - you're having the worst day ever. Your best mate's been killed, and to top it all his body's been nicked from the grave. You're walking along with a mate, wallowing in your sadness, when some bloke comes along and starts chatting. Most people would probably want to tell him to get lost and leave them alone - even if he was trying to be helpful! <br />That's probably what the disciples were thinking in Luke 24:15 - 16. But how glad to you think they were that they didn't ignore the guy walking by them, when they found out it actually was Jesus! They'd been so focused on how bad they were feeling, they'd not even realised it was Him! When the disciples did actually look to Jesus, and recognise him, suddenly things changed. They went from fear to courage, pain to joy, despair to hope - all because they'd got back their focus on Jesus. And that is the story of Jesus - no matter how bad things may seem to be, how bad your day is going, when you fix your eyes on Jesus and focus on Him, He'll fill you with hope. Don't be so focused on what's going on that you lose sight of what matters - Jesus.<br />That's why Paul writes ' I pray that your hearts will be flooded with light so that you can understand the confident hope he has given to those he called' (Ephesians 1:18 NIV).

<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>They spread the word ... about this child.&quot;</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Luke 2: 17 NIV<br /></span>It's Christmas! Time for parties, parades, and presents-and that's ok. But the real story leaves these things way behind. To get the most out of it, take another look at: <br />(a) The shepherds. Sheep-herders were considered such low-life in first-century Israel that they weren't even deemed reliable enough to testify in court. Yet God chose them to announce His son's arrival, and they in turn went out and told it to the world! Luke records: 'When they had seen Him, they spread the word.' (Luke 2:17 NIV) Here's your answer to 'could God use someone like me?' You don't need to be a university graduate or look the part. Just tell people what you've seen and heard, and how Christ has changed your life. Share the Word; God will do the rest! (b) Those who heard their story. '...all who heard it were amazed.' (Luke 2: 18 NIV) God's grace still amazes people. 'God was reconciling the world to Himself in Christ, not counting men's sins against them. And He has committed to us the message of reconciliation.' (2 Corinthians 5: 19 NIV) Note the word 'reconciliation'. You're forgiven; your sin-debt is cancelled, your books reconciled, now you can have a relationship with God by simply trusting in Christ. Amazing! (c) Mary. Luke writes 'Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart.' (Luke 2:19 NIV) She wanted to understand what was taking place and how it related to her. And you need to do that too. Get off the Christmas merry-go-round and take the time to treasure what's important here, and what it means for you. God became a man; that we, who are the children of men, might become the children of God. Amazing!<br />SoulFood reading: Hosea 6-10, Luke 2:21-33, Ps 17, Pr 14:13-16</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...let grain from the bundles fall purposely for her...'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ruth 2:16 NKJV</span><br />OK, last day on Ruth. Let's keep going where we left off yesterday. Ruth, right in the middle of feeling loss, feeling hungry, feeling homesick, suddenly gets more than she ever needed dropped right into her lap. She didn't deserve it, didn't earn it, and couldn't even understand it. It's called grace; it's how God works!<br />But here's the health warning: If you're not used to being blessed it might not take long before it starts going to your head! That's why the Bible says: ‘But remember the LORD your God, ...gives you the ability to produce wealth' (Deuteronomy 8:18 NIV). And here's the small print (you should always read the small print!) God doesn't bless you so you can sit back and count your wads, or so you can strut around posing in all your bling. God's gifts are just tools to help you do His will. That's all that matters. At the end of the day what good is that stuff, if it takes you miles away from God? When God gives you something, He wants you to use it to make Him famous. So, when God gives you His blessings, be sure to read the instructions that go with them; only then will you find true fulfilment! So have you got it? God is the source of everything you have; and ever will have!]]></introtext>

<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Galatians 6: 9 NIV<br /></span>You may think you have to be old to make a difference in the world. Sorry. Wrong! You can see and do amazing stuff as a young person, and change the world around you for the better. You may have heard of a Dutch lady called Corrie Ten Boom; she's written books about her life, and is famous for saving Jews from the Nazis in the war. But you may not have heard of her nephew Peter. He made an amazing difference too; and he started young! When he was just 16, he was thrown into prison for his involvement with the Jews, and for defying the Germans. After World War 2, he travelled the world, preaching that forgiveness is the only answer to hatred, and people were changed and saved through him and his words. What he'd done when he was younger came back to help him too; he had a heart attack in Israel and needed surgery. It turned out the surgeon was one of the babies Peter's family had saved all those years ago. 40 years after he'd been saved, the surgeon repaid the debt, by saving Peter's life.<br />What you sow, good or bad, will come back to you. So make sure it's good stuff you're sowing in your life, and one day, you'll reap the harvest. It'll be in God's time, but it will happen.<br />SoulFood reading: Hosea 1-5, Luke 2:8-20, Ps 8, Pr 14:9-12</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...Go now and leave your life of sin'</h2>
<br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>John 8:11 NIV</span><br />Jesus always told it like it is. He would never put a bandage on an infected wound. He always insisted on getting right down to the root cause of a problem. When a woman who'd been caught having sex with a bloke who wasn't her husband was brought to him he first dealt with her accusers and then told her lovingly but firmly, '&quot;...Go now and leave your life of sin.&quot;' (John 8:11 NIV) We come to the same Jesus with the same burden of guilt and shame that woman felt. Listen: 'Since he himself has gone through suffering and temptation, he is able to help us when we are being tempted' (Hebrews 2:18 NLT). Sadly, in our 'Do it yourself' culture, we often try to sort our issues out everywhere else before coming to Jesus. Why? Because He's the only person we can't fake it to - we have to be 100% real with him and that's scary! But it's worth it! Job writes, '...prepare your heart and lift up your hands to Him in prayer. Get rid of your sins, and leave all iniquity behind you. Then your face will brighten in innocence. You will be strong and free of fear. You will forget your misery. It will all be gone like water under the bridge... you will have courage because you will have hope. You will be protected and will rest in safety. You will lie down unafraid, and many will look to you for help' (Job 11:13-19 NLT). Jesus invites you to step into the river of God's mercy today. Let it flow over you setting you free. Whether it's the guilt of something you have done, or the pain for something that was done to you - get real with Jesus!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'Do all things without complaining...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Philippians 2:14 NKJV<br /></span>So, we might not have won the World Cup or trounced the poms at cricket, but if you had to pay a dollar every time you complained and you got a dollar every time you showed gratitude would you be rich or poor? So you reckon you're hard done by and you warrant a whinge? Actually, no. Not in the face of a few hard facts. <br />Fact 1: Life expectancy in this country is 81 years. Life expectancy in the developing world is half that. <br />Fact 2: It would take $12 billion to provide safe water world-wide and $17 billion to provide basic health care and nutrition globally. However, we spend way more than that every year shopping in the suburbs! <br />Fact 3: 21 children die every minute from poverty related causes in the developing world. The point is if you're going to moan: moan about something worth moaning about. By all means nag about the injustice of this world. Complain about the poverty which destroys life. Make a noise about the West's indifference to the rest of the planet. But be thankful for what you've got. A final thought: if somebody gave you a buck every time you complained and collected one every time you were thankful; would you be loaded or stony broke? <br />SoulFood reading: 2 Kings 24-25, Luke 2:1-7, Ps 144:9-15, Pr 14:5-8</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...she found herself working in a field belonging to Boaz...'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ruth 2:3 NIV</span><br />Ruth had made a brave decision to travel with her mother-in-law to a place she didn't know. But now life was spiralling downward. Her husband was gone. Home was a long way away; there was no money in the bank. She was in survival mode which meant hanging around the fields picking up off-cuts from the harvest. Not a good look, ladies. <br />Then God started turning things around. The guys cutting the harvest started dropping handfuls of barley in her path; undeserved blessings. Why? Because the boss (Boaz) saw Ruth hanging around and told his workers, ‘leave them for her to pick up' (Ruth 2:16 NIV). Ruth had no idea that word had been spoken, she just started getting blessed! And you don't know what God will speak over your life. Suddenly everything can change! Doors can be opened, mountains can be moved. What's happening? Your steps are being ordered by the Lord (Psalm 37:23). And you don't even have to worry about somebody else getting what's yours, because nobody can pick it up except you; the boss says so! <br />The minute the boss started showing favour to her, Ruth's downward spiral was over. She came from the fringes to the foreground. Instead of only looking forward to off-cuts she got the cream of the crop. When God speaks, that can happen very quickly. So be ready!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...whoever says to this mountain, 'Be removed...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Mark 11: 23 NKJV<br /></span>Crack open the carbs and glug down those protein-shakes, you're going to need a whole lot of muscle to shift these mountains! Alright, so it'll take more than perfect pecs and well adjusted abs to shift the Himalayas in our lives. Here are three handy hints in mountain moving: <br />(1) Bench-press God's Word: Textbook example: When Satan tempts Jesus to jump off the temple without so much as a bungee rope, Jesus sees the lie and fights back with 'It is written...' (Read it for yourself in Matthew 4: 1 -11.) Your first mountain moving muscle is God's Word; learn to use it! <br />(2) Flex some forgiveness: After speaking about mountain-moving faith, Jesus said, '...Whenever you stand praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive him, that your Father in heaven may also forgive you your trespasses.' (Mark 11: 25 NKJV) Your mountain can't be moved (or your prayers answered) if you're tapped into un-forgiveness. So if you want to experience power, get busy with forgiveness. <br />(3) Keep up the reps: Jeremiah said that God's Word is '...like a hammer that breaks a rock in pieces.' (Jeremiah 23: 29 NKJV) Ever wonder how a hammer can hit a rock ninety-nine times, but on the one-hundredth blow it shatters? That's because all the previous blows kept weakening it. Live in God's Word; keep speaking it over your situation and soon mountains may move.<br />SoulFood reading: 2 Kings 21-23, Luke 1:67-80, Ps 144:1-8, Pr 14:1-4</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Romans 5:8 NIV</span><br />The old Bible sat in the bargain basket amongst hundreds of tattered books. A lot of people had picked it up and thumbed through its faded pages. It wasn't in very good shape - certainly not worth the $2 on the sticker. So it was thrown aside. But then a man picked it up and gasped in shock. He rushed to the counter and paid the puny amount for the old book. It was an original Gutenberg, 500 years old and one of the first books ever printed! It was worth more than $2,000,000! The world cast it aside, unaware of its value.<br />And we do the same thing, don't we? Seeds of greatness often lie buried within unpromising people that amazingly spring to life when they are watered and nurtured. <br />In truth, we were all overlooked until Jesus saw something of value in us. But rather than paying a bargain price He paid the highest price. Listen: '...While we were still sinners, Christ died for us' (Romans 5.8.NIV).<br />A different world would appear before our eyes if we could begin to see every man, woman, boy and girl as a precious treasure that God could not live without, that Christ died to redeem. Look at Matthew: when Jesus found him he was a dodgy tax collector, a wheeler-dealer working for the Romans. But Jesus said, '&quot;Follow&quot; Me' (Matthew 9:9 NIV). Matthew did and never looked back. Aren't you glad that God found you!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...we who teach will be judged more strictly.'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>James 3:1 NIV<br /></span>You know those adverts on TV, where good clean wholesome pupils (not like the tearaways you've grown accustomed to at your school) swoon at the feet of a drop-dead gorgeous teacher (as opposed to old Mr Cod-face who bores his way through your double geography lessons), hanging onto his every word as the on-screen caption spells out, 'those who can: teach'. Well, have you ever stopped to think about that? Could you teach? Not as in school teacher, but could you teach your peers, your family or your friends the way of Jesus?<br />There's an old saying: 'sometimes you're the only Bible some people will ever read'. What does that mean? Simple. For a lot of people, the closest they'll ever get to understanding anything the Bible goes on about is by what they observe in your life. If you're the only Christian they know, then you're their definition of what a Christian does. You may even be their only definition of what Jesus is like. <br />So, what lessons will people learn from your life? Will they see that a Christian is somebody who spouts on about love but then backstabs? Will they learn that it's ok for Christians to play the field? Will they see any difference in how you live your life, and how they live theirs? Can you live as an example of Christ? Those who can: teach. <br />SoulFood reading: 2 Kings 18:17-20:21, Luke 1:57-66, Ps 139:13-24, Pr 13:25</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...Where you go I will go...'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ruth 1:16 NIV</span><br />Ruth told Naomi, ‘Where you go I will go.' Relationships are weird. Suddenly you can meet someone and ‘tzzzzt' - there's an electric connection between you. It's what made Elisha quit farming and follow Elijah, a prophet with self-esteem issues; it's why Timothy hung out with Paul, an old man with a habit of getting into fights. You know instantly, ‘I won't reach my destiny without you in my life.' Looking back you realise if you hadn't met that certain person, you wouldn't be where you are today. <br />On the other hand, ‘Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye' (Ruth 1:14 NIV). Now Orpah's leaving didn't make her a bad person; it just meant her part in the story was over. Listen, you need to learn to recognise when somebody's part in your story is over, otherwise you'll just drive each other nuts. Yep, it can be hard to admit something is over, especially a relationship. Look, if God wants that for you He'll make it work. But if it blatantly ain't working then accept His will in the matter. Get up, go outside, put one foot in front of the other and start living again! Never beg a friend to stay with you against their will. Their leaving is no accident; it just means God has something better in store for you (and possibly them too), so trust Him and move on!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'The secret things belong to the Lord...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Deuteronomy 29: 29 NIV<br /></span>Sometimes we treat life as if it's a Maths lesson. We're faced with a problem, and if we look long enough we eventually find the solution. But life isn't all algebra and percentages. Life has a sneaky habit of raising questions we can't seem to answer: innocent children born with HIV; cancer robbing a young mum of her life; a tsunami devastating an island. Where are the answers to these sorts of questions? We try and make sense of it, we search for clues in the suffering, we blame ourselves, we blame others, and yet we're still no further down the line in understanding suffering's million dollar question, 'Why, God, why?'<br />The book of Job turns the spotlight on the question, 'Why?' It's about one good man's struggle against suffering. But it could just as easily be about the Holocaust, or 9/11, or you! It asks why God heals one person's illness but not another. Are we somehow to blame for our own misery? Is it right to question God? Will we ever get the answers we crave? The answers page seems to have been torn from the back of the text book. We find that suffering isn't a sum to be solved. We find that God has His ways and they're higher than ours. We're confronted with a hard truth: are we willing to trust God despite the uncertainty? The question is: are you? <br />SoulFood reading: Josh 6:1-25, Luke 7:36-50</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...God...reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ...'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Corinthians 5:18 NKJV</span><br />We see the golden arches of McDonald's and we think 'Big Mac'. We see a swoosh on a pair of trainers and think 'Nike': but what about the cross? What does that symbolise? A bling item we hang round our necks? A religious shape hung outside a church? Or a death penalty of its day?<br />How can we make sense of this picture of Jesus hanging from a death penalty? Firstly, we now know where God is to be found; He's on a cross. When we face raw suffering in a hurting world and we ask that million dollar question, 'where is God in all of this?' or our soul cries, 'where is God when I need Him most' the answer is hanging from the cross. Hanging from that same pain we are feeling. <br />Secondly, we see a crucified God who takes responsibility for our mess. An exchange is made as the ultimate price is paid for our ransom; blood money. In order to be restored to the Father, the Son stretches His arms across a large cross-beam, and we are able to walk across this bridge into the Father's arms. <br />Thirdly, we see God is staying with us to the very end of our wounded road. A miraculous exchange brings about change as we are released to grow into our God destinies. Thank Jesus today.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...for man's anger does not bring about the righteous life that God desires.'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>James 1: 20 NIV</span><br />So what do you do, when you know all the theory (yeah, sure, it's better to forgive and forget than spray paint, ‘you messed up my life, loser' all over their front door) but you're still struggling to apply it? Well, we need to check in with the black-belt of forgiveness, the man Himself: Jesus Christ. <br />He's the man who didn't wait for us to come crawling back, tail between our legs, before He started to think about putting things right. He took the initiative. Listen: ‘When we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son...' (Romans 5: 10 NKJV) Did you get that? Even when we were off doing our own thing, totally ignoring God, He'd put the plan in place to fix the relationship back together. He's the ‘forgiveness' master. He paid the price before we've even said the ‘sorry'. <br />So, you might not have even started to sort this whole mess out. They might still see you as the enemy, even though you've done nothing wrong. What an opportunity for you to practice forgiveness by God's standards. Try forgiving them right now, even if they don't seem sorry. Erase those fantasies involving their falling in front of huge dump trucks from your mind. Picture all the steps you could do to make this relationship work. Become an expert in forgiveness and a thicko in hatred. Take the forgiveness initiative. <br />SoulFood reading: 2 Kings 16:1-18:16, Luke 1:39-56, Ps 139:7-12, Pr 13:24</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...Naomi was left without her two sons and her husband.'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ruth 1:5 NIV</span><br />When hers sons died, Naomi experienced a unique bonding process with her daughters-in-law, Ruth and Orpah, who (obviously) had lost their husbands. Unless you've been through something like it, it's hard to understand that kind of bond. Tragedy can bring together the oddest people. When you're hurting, don't look for support from people based on what they look like or where they live. All you want is someone who's been there themselves, someone who really knows what you're going through. People can't give you what they don't have. <br />The old preacher Charles Spurgeon gets at this issue using the image of soldiers returning from battle, ‘Just as old soldiers compare stories and scars, when we arrive at our heavenly home we'll tell of the faithfulness of God Who brought us through. I wouldn't like to be pointed out as the only one who never experienced sorrow, or feel like a stranger in the midst of that sacred fellowship. Therefore be content to share in the battle, for soon we will wear the crown.' <br />So if you're fighting just to get through another day, remind yourself that you aren't the first and you won't be the last to do so. Like Naomi, God sees what you're going through and has plans for your life yet to be revealed. Be encouraged. You will gain through your pain. Hold on to His hand; He'll bring you through this!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...For if you forgive men when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 6: 14 NIV</span><br />God made you with a capacity for anger because when handled the right way it's the fuel that brings needed change and the medicine that heals. So what are this medicine's active ingredients? (a) reality. You don't have to focus on how you've been ‘disrespected, man'. The sooner you can get over yourself, the sooner you can get around to making sure it doesn't happen again. (b) humility. You're no goody-two-shoes either, own up to your share of the mess. Admitting you've been a grouch sometimes makes it easier for someone else to admit that they've been one too. (c) forgiveness. Forgive and forget, it's a bit of greeting card cheese, isn't it? But, actually, it's the only way. If we truly forgive, we need to make sure that we're not bringing it up every 5 minutes. Even if our minds can't forget that easily, we need to act like we've chosen to forget. Jesus was dead serious about this forgiveness stuff; just listen: '...if you forgive men when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive men their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.' (Matthew 6: 14-15 NIV) Hey, if Jesus can forgive the very people who wanted Him dead, surely we can forgive the person who winds us up. <br />SoulFood reading: 2 Kings 13-15, Luke 1:26-38, Ps 139:1-6, Pr 13:21-23</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'I have learned the secret of being content...'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Philippians 4:12 NIV</span><br />Michael Drosnin wrote a book about a man who wanted more. More wealth, so he built a huge financial empire. More pleasure, so he paid for the best women money could buy. More adventure, so he set air speed records, built and piloted the world's most unique aircraft. More power, so he got political clout that was the envy of senators. More glamour, so he owned film studios and hung out with stars. Drosnin tells how this man's life ended: 'He was a figure of ... power, ready for the grave. Emaciated ... thin scraggly beard ... sunken chest, hideously long fingernails in grotesque yellow corkscrews ... Many of his teeth were black, rotting stumps. A tumour was beginning to emerge from the side of his head...there were innumerable needle marks. Howard Hughes was an addict. A billionaire junkie.' All that, and he still wasn't content. So here's the question: If he'd pulled off another deal, made another million and tasted another thrill, would it have been enough? No. We think we'll be more grateful if we get more, but it's not always the case.<br />The same man who wrote, 'I have learned the secret of being content' also wrote, 'In everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you' (1 Thessalonians 5:18 NKJV). You cannot make yourself a more grateful or content person, but you can pray for it and open your heart to what God will do.

<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 5: 9 NIV</span><br />Jesus said, ‘The good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and the evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart. For out of the overflow of his heart his mouth speaks.' (Luke 6: 45 NIV) Notice that word, ‘stored'. When we store something as dangerous as anger, we give it room to fester and breed more danger. <br />If we leave a toothache untreated, the pain seems to grow and grow, until one day you can't even sleep because the pain has spread from one tooth to your entire face. If we leave anger untreated, the pain preoccupies us, it saps our energy, it drowns out our love, it controls our thoughts, it spreads right across our life until one day you realise it has hindered your progress in life, damaged your relationship with God, and your whole outlook is off centre. <br />Ask God for the humility and courage to deal with today's problems-today! When your head hits the pillow tonight, know you've exercised these words, ‘Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.' (Matthew 5: 9 NKJV)<br />SoulFood reading: 2 Kings 10-12, Luke 1:11-25, Ps 73:17-28, Pr 13:20</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘I went away full, but the Lord has brought me back empty...'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ruth 1:21 NIV</span><br />When it comes to valuable life-lessons, the book of Ruth is right up there. For the next few days we're gonna dig into it... <br />When famine came to Bethlehem, Naomi, her husband and two sons moved to Moab where the economy was thriving. What they hoped would be a short stay turned into ten years. The lads married two local girls, Ruth and Orpah. Then the unthinkable happened; Naomi's husband and both sons died! As you might expect she was absolutely gutted. She heard that things were back on the up in Bethlehem so she decided to go home. After arriving back safely she said, ‘I went out full, and the Lord has brought me home again empty' (NKJV). She was choking on the irony that she'd left a land of nothing for a land of plenty and come back with even less than she set out with. <br />The truth is, you can be blessed and not know it. You never miss the water till the tap runs dry! Only as you look back do you realise that what you have is much more important than the things you don't have. Have you been saying, ‘I'll be happy when...'? Forget it, happiness doesn't come from getting what you want, it comes from appreciating what God's given you. So take a few minutes today to put down that wish list and just say some simple thank yous.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[‘...don't sin by letting anger control you...'
<p>Ephesians 4: 26 NLT<br />Uncontrolled anger is like jumping into a Ferrari, gunning the engine, then discovering the brakes don't work. The Bible says: ‘Don't sin by letting anger...control...you...anger gives a...foothold to the Devil.' Did you get that? Uncontrolled anger opens the door to Satan, and then it's all downhill from there! So before you say something you'll regret or can't take back, ask yourself: (1) Is my anger appropriate? Some anger is. You can't love roses and not hate weeds. But it's easy to let small stuff like thoughtless comments and insensitive friends make you overreact. For anger to have a healthy result it needs to be measured and constructive. This is a control issue! Listen: '...the mind controlled by the Spirit is life and peace.' (Romans 8:6 NIV) A controlled response and a gracious response is a Christ-like response. It always wins! (2) Is it really worth dragging other people into? Anger invariably affects those around you because it's only human to take sides, even if not personally involved. Dragging others in is usually a way to feed our own ego and justify our bad behaviour. (3) Is the relief I'll get from venting worth the aftermath? The Bible says: ‘A gentle answer deflects anger but harsh words make tempers flare.' (Proverbs 15: 1 NLT) By sounding off, you usually end up making the finest speech you'll ever regret! By its very nature, anger encourages exaggeration. It makes you say things you can't take back. Long after you've moved on, angry words retain the power to wound and divide.<br />SoulFood reading: 2 Kings 7-9, Luke 1:1-10, Ps 73:1-16, Pr 13:17-19</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘I have learned the secret of being content...'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Philippians 4:12 NIV<br /></span>So, what's the secret of being content? Here are three things that may help you on your way... <br />1) Learn to be happy with less. Happiness isn't about getting what you want, but about enjoying what God's given you. Make a list of good things in your life, and thank God for them today. Paul said he had learned to be content, ‘whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or want. I can do everything through him who gives me strength.' <br />2) Remind yourself things could be worse. Snoopy was lying in his kennel one Thanksgiving Day, mumbling about being stuck with dog food while all those humans got to be inside with the turkey and gravy and pumpkin pie. ‘Of course, it could have been worse,' he finally reflected, ‘I could have been born a turkey.' Reminding yourself ‘It could be worse' can really help you to develop contentment. <br />3) Know that you're going for spiritual contentment, not just stuff. We may want more stuff, but underneath that is what we really want; God, the perfection of heaven - and that's to come. You're unlikely to feel totally content, as this world isn't your ultimate home; heaven is. <br />Today, try flipping your discontent on its head, and using it to pray ‘Your Kingdom come, Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven' (Matthew 6:10 NIV).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...don't sin by letting anger control you...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ephesians 4: 26 NLT</span><br />So, you want to be a ‘good Christian'. You want to love other people. It's just that sometimes other people can be so frustrating, so annoying, so downright unlovable. In fact, with some people, you suspect that the kindest way to show them love is by slapping them severely with a freshly filleted mackerel (or whatever punishment your raging emotions dream up). If only you could find permission for that in the Sermon on the Mount! So, here's today's question: how can we manage our anger healthily? <br />Tip for today is ‘honesty is the best policy'. ‘...don't sin by letting anger control you...' (Ephesians 4: 25-26 NLT) When you're angry, don't deny it-acknowledge it. We're right to feel angry when innocent people are mistreated. We're wrong to feel like smashing a brick into someone's head just because they push in front of us in the dinner queue. Now, we don't have to be Christian doormats that let everyone walk over us, but neither do we want to walk around like ticking time bombs about to explode. So start controlling your feelings before they control you. And when you have to take someone to task, keep it truthful, not hurtful. It's one thing to tell a person why you're angry with them, another to start dissing their very existence. ‘Words can bring death or life! Talk too much, and you will eat everything you say.' (Proverbs 18: 21 CEV)<br />SoulFood reading: 2 Kings 4:18 - 6:33, Mark 16:1-20, Ps 80:12-19, Pr 13:13-16</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full..'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>John 10:10 (NIV)</span><br />Living your fullest life needs help from two places: the inside and the outside. <br />1) The Inside: You need to be able to dig deep and to how to go the extra mile. Yep, that means extra effort and extra time. Mega business dude Andrew Carnegie had this sussed and was fond of saying, ‘There's no use in trying to help people who won't help themselves. You cannot push anyone up a ladder unless he or she is first willing to climb it.' The apostle Paul puts it like this: ‘each one should carry his own load' (Galatians 6:5).<br />2) The Outside: You need to be teachable, open to other people whom God brings along to input into your development. This isn't just a good idea, it's a God idea; called discipleship, or basically, mentoring. Good mentors lead by example; they know that to have influence they first need your respect. They treat you as an individual understanding your strengths and weaknesses. They notice whether you're right-brained (creative) or left-brained (methodical). They find out whether you learn visually or verbally. They know when you need a pat on the back or a kick in the butt! They're someone who, like the apostle Paul, can say ‘Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ.' (1 Corinthians 11:1 NIV) If you can get a mentor you'll be well blessed. So don't hang about, ask God to bring you one!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘Happy is he...whose hope is in the Lord...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 146: 5 NKJV</span><br />Whoever said money can't buy happiness, just didn't know where to shop, right? The Bible doesn't include the verse ‘Happy is the girl with her Dad's credit card in Sportsgirl' or ‘Blessed is the boy spendin' his birthday cash in EB Games'. It might seem that way at times, but if time has taught Aussies anything, it's that however much you blow, you're always left wanting more; you're always left feeling curiously empty. That's how this credit crunch got started, isn't it? People spending cash they never had in the first place in order to purchase ‘happiness'. <br />Happiness isn't found on a hanger in a dress shop, girls. Nor can it be downloaded on to your Shuffle, boys. ‘Happy is he (or she)...whose hope is in the Lord', the psalmist sang. Dead right. Clothes go out of season; this year's must-have fashions are next year's shoulder pads (ask your Mum). Technology evolves; today's Apple Mac is tomorrow's Commodore 64 (ask your Dad). The only constant we have in life is God. He's never old fashioned or out of touch. His hard-drive never fails you. He never rusts, busts or burns out. God is the same yesterday, today and forever. So if you think happiness is only your next purchase away, you're always going to be left feeling bankrupt inside. Isn't it time you started to cash all your cheques in the Bank of God?<br />SoulFood reading: 2 Kings 1:1 - 4:17, Mark 15:33-47, Ps 80:1-11, Pr 13:11-12</p>]]></introtext>

<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Corinthians 2:14 NIV<br /></span>Pastor Jon Walker writes: ‘Spirit warnings alert you to impending danger. A friend of mine was driving towards a green light when he was strongly prompted to hit his brakes. As he did so a truck ran a red light. Had it not been for my friend's instant obedience he'd probably have been killed. Spirit ‘stop signs' red-flag you not to go somewhere. A dog I owned...was used to being on a lead and when I took him to a neighbour's field to run, I'd simply say &quot;No&quot; when he approached a place he shouldn't go. He'd done nothing wrong, and my warning wasn't a rebuke; it was a caution for his own protection. Spirit timing is God telling you the time is not right. In university I planned to buy a computer through a discount programme... however, they told me it had been discontinued. I was very angry at God. Two months later the university reopened the programme offering upgraded models bundled with software that cost extra two months ago; the whole package was cheaper than the previous one...Turns out God knows what he's doing!' <br />Be sensitive to Spirit signals. Trust God's Spirit to guide you in the decisions and details of your life. Keep a list of the times He has prompted you; it'll remind you to obey in the future. Remember, God's promptings always line up with His Word; even when they don't line up with your ideas!<br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Sam 18:1 - 20:29, John 1:14-28, Ps 29, Pr 22:26-29<br />]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘Train up a child in the way he should go...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 22: 6 NIV</span><br />‘Growing older' and ‘growing up' is not the same thing. You can be forty and still wobble about in spiritual nappies. ‘Growing up' isn't just something that happens. It takes work. You must want to grow, choose to grow, make an effort to grow. When you first decided to follow Jesus, something in you was drawn to His invitation. That's great, that's all you need to get started. But where do you go from there? How do you ‘follow' Jesus? Do you simply put your feet up until Judgment Day, thinking: ‘well, that's my ticket sorted for the afterlife.' Well, you could, but you'd miss out on the full ride that God has planned for you. Following Jesus means trying to make Jesus-like choices and then asking his Spirit to help you stick with it. <br />The Jesus blueprint for choices always focuses on putting others first, not yourself. This kind of thinking is alien to our culture, where we are told ‘chase OUR dreams', or ‘make a name for OURSELVES'; it comes unnaturally to us. But it's the core of a Jesus lifestyle, it sums up his ‘love God; love people' attitude. So where are you at with your thinking? Ask yourself now: where do I need to stop wanting my way and start wanting God's way? Where can I grow up? Now ask the Holy Spirit to help you stick with it.<br />SoulFood reading: Ex 34:27-35, Col 2:9-15</p>]]></introtext>

<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Joshua 7:21 NIV</span><br />You know how it is, all of a sudden those trainers you thought were the bomb when you bought them 2 months back feel pretty sad compared to the new style that's just been released. Or what about that new mobile you mithered for months about? Yeah, you were well happy with it until first day back when you found out she had one too! If that sounds a bit like you then you need to pay attention today because it sounds like ‘stuff' has got a hold of you. <br />There's a story from the book of Joshua about the time when things started going wrong for Israel; they started losing battles. Joshua asked God why and God said it was because there was sin in the camp. When Joshua started doing a bit of detective work one of his soldiers, confessed, ‘While we were in Jericho, I saw a beautiful Babylonian robe... and a gold bar... I wanted them for myself, so I took them.' At the end of the story it cost the guy his life and the lives of his family. <br />When you get jealous about stuff you're basically putting something else in the place of God. If you think you really do need (not just want) something, pray about it and trust God to give it to you! In the meantime be grateful for what He's already given you.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘Through wisdom a house is built, and by understanding it is established.'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 24: 3 NKJV</span><br />Annoying, aren't they? Those brats you see on Supernanny. All that kicking and screaming and those award-winning temper tantrums make you want to wrap the kid in its soiled nappy and send it for recycling. Thank God we're so over the ‘spitting the dummy out of the pram' phase, eh? Or are we?<br />We can all have our moments of dragging our feet because we feel like God isn't playing fair or because we're so stubborn in wanting our own way. But get this: God wants us to ‘grow up in all things into Christ...' (Ephesians 4:15 NKJV) You see, a Dad may love a screaming brat but he's not likely to be a fan of the outburst; well, it's the same with our Heavenly Dad. That's where the discipline comes into play. Supernanny's legendary ‘naughty step' isn't designed to torture a child, it's there to get the child to change how they think. Well, guess what: '...we are no longer to be as children...' (Ephesians 4:14 NAS) To change our spoilt-brat ways, we must change the way we think. In fact, we are urged to ‘...think the same way that Jesus Christ thought...' (Philippians 2: 5 CEV) Imagine Jesus pulling a strop because He didn't feel like healing a leper today. Doesn't add up, does it? Little kids, by nature, think only of themselves, because they're immature. Don't just think of yourself-think like Christ. Grow up! <br />SoulFood reading: Rev 19-22, Mark 15:21-32, Ps 143, Pr 13:9-10</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...&quot;Come aside...and rest a while.&quot;'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Mark 6:31 NKJV</span><br />Check out Jesus' life in the Gospels; Matthew, Mark, Luke and John; and you'll see He sets us an amazing example. He was so controlled, even under extreme criticism. He never wavered from following God's plan. <br />The good things in life aren't always the right things, and that's hard. You might be chasing after something that God wants you to leave, or vice versa. So how do you know what God wants? Follow Jesus' example, and get away! (Luke 4:42). Go to a deserted place, and meet with the Lord. Now, that doesn't mean you have to go and sit in your little brother's sandpit in a heatwave; it just means a quiet place to think, pray, refuel and listen to God.<br />It's easy in the busyness of life to get carried away doing everything at 200 kph. We treat our brains like a Ferrari, thinking they're at their best when they're fastest. Everyone around you might tell you that time is money; and the devil loves that. If he can keep us so busy with life, surrounded by crowds and noise with no time to think, we won't be spending that quality time with God, which is what he wants.<br />Jesus turns the tables on the rest of the world, and says ‘come to me'. So will you? Will you stop, get away from it all, and check that you have been saying yes to the right things, according to God?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘The Lord turn His face toward you and give you peace.'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Numbers 6: 26 NIV</span><br />allas Willard writes about a little boy whose mum died. Every night he toddled into his dad's room to ask if he could sleep with him. Only when his father promised to sleep with his face turned towards him, did the little guy feel safe enough to doze off. <br />Moses prayed, ‘The Lord turn His face toward you and give you peace.' God watches over us, guides and protects us 24/7! In fact, the most common promise in Scripture isn't about salvation or heaven. No, the most frequent promise in the Bible is, ‘...I will be with you...' (Josh 1:5 NKJV) It's the promise God made to Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Sarah, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Mary and Paul. And it's the one that kept them going! David said, ‘Even when I walk through the darkest valley, I will not be afraid, for You are close beside me...' (Ps 23:4 NLT) <br />Do you believe it? Do you believe that God is looking you full in the face and smiling at the very thought of you? Well, whatever you choose to believe doesn't alter the truth. God is looking out for you. Just like He's reminding you today, ‘...Do not be afraid or discouraged...the Lord...is with you...' (Josh 1:9 NLT) Be at peace today, God is looking out for you!<br />SoulFood reading: Rev 15-18, Mark 15:1-20, Ps 132:11-18, Pr 13:7-8</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘Stop being angry! Turn from your rage'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 37:8 NIV</span><br />A bad temper is not something to be proud of, but prayed over. When you blow your top, you just reveal your contents. And which of us hasn't done that, and regretted it? Here's three ways to get your lid firmly back on! <br />1) Less is more: By cramming too much stuff into too little time, you wind yourself up! Like guitar strings that are pulled too tight, you end up snapping, then feeling guilty because you're not ‘spiritual' enough. ‘Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment, in accordance with the measure of faith God has given you.' (Romans 12:3-4 NIV). <br />2) Don't be a hammer: If you want to get on in life you'll need to tackle different problems in different ways. People whose only tool is a hammer have got no choice but to treat every problem like a nail. Before long they've got holes all over the house, so put the hammer (anger) down! You know, the Bible describes 9 different fruit of the Spirit but not one of them is anger. (see Galatians 5:22) <br />3) What's the point: Sometimes ‘enough is enough' and you need to speak up. When Jesus got angry in the temple he had a point because poor people were being ripped off and he was drawing attention to it. In this case, ‘If you don't do what you know is right, you have sinned.' (James 4:17 CEV).]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘Then he consecrated Jesse and his sons...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Samuel 16: 5 NKJV</span><br />Not yet shaving; voice barely broken; knee-high to a grasshopper. Yet, it was David, not his hairier, tenor-bass voiced, older brothers that had the guts to battle Goliath. Why? Because: <br />(1) His brothers weren't up for it. When Goliath started ranting, soldiers shook in their sandals. David's brothers saw a big noise rather than a big God. A lesson for us all, do we see big problems that will grind us down, or do we see a big God that will build us up? <br />(2) His brothers had no previous battles. There's nothing insignificant on our ‘God CV'. Our little battles equip us for big battles. The lion David killed as a boy was big; the bear was bigger; Goliath bigger yet. But David wasn't about to bail over this latest overgrown grizzly. Listen: ‘The Lord, who delivered me from the paw of the lion and...the bear...will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.' (1 Samuel 17: 37 NKJV) His past was shaping his destiny. <br />(3) His brothers had beauty not bravery. ‘...the Lord does not see as man sees; for man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.' (1 Samuel 16: 7 NKJV) Even today, we're still impressed with muscle or make-up, but real history-makers have it sorted in their core. The lives of frail old Mother Teresa or Nelson Mandela prove it. (Google them and see!)<br />SoulFood reading: Rev 10-14, Mark 14:66-72, Ps 132:1-10, Pr 13:4-6</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘Physician, heal yourself!...'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Luke 4:23 NKJV </span><br />In the Old Testament, a priest couldn't serve in God's house if he had a scab. Why? Because when you've a scab you're a health risk. We all have ‘scabs'. It could be some pain in your life or an issue you haven't dealt with that still hurts. <br />If you went to the doctors, and he tried to see to you while he had a huge gaping, bleeding, oozy cut on his head, you wouldn't really listen to what he was saying, would you? You'd think he needed to sort himself out first, before he sorted you. It's the same with you when you're witnessing to your friends, and working for God. It's hard to help your mates sort out emotional issues, when you've still got unresolved issues from the past. It's hard to talk about victory, and complete forgiveness to others, when you feel defeated by an old issue. Now, that doesn't mean you can't work for God if you have issues - completely the opposite in fact - often the broken become the best at mending. But you do need to be at least dealing with your issues not ignoring them. It's not wrong to have a wounded heart, but it is wrong not to deal with it. So spend some time with God and let Him heal you and make you whole, so you can be more effective in your mission to others.

<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Daniel 12: 3 NKJV</span><br />Why is it we all love to show off-whether it's guys talking about AFL as if they personally taught Jonathan Brown everything he knows, or girls posing in their new gear as if they're on a catwalk? Could it be that somewhere built within our biology God has placed a desire for significance? <br />What does every talent show wannabe crave? A record deal? Partly. A millionaire lifestyle? Probably. To make a name for themselves? Definitely. We all want to be a legend in our own lunchtime because God has built us for great things. He doesn't want us to settle for an average existence. He made us to make our own mark on eternity. So, what does that mean? Are we all to place ourselves up for public humiliation in Red Symon's firing line? Well, no. To really place your own personal print on history, you need to explore all that God has placed inside you. Has He given you the gift of the gab? Maybe you're a born evangelist. Do you hate it when people hate each other? Maybe you're destined to be a star peace-maker. Do people seem to look up to you? Maybe you're here to role-model a Godly life-style to others. The point is: whatever weird and wonderful concoction of gifts and talents bubble inside of you, they bubble for a reason. That reason is to shine like God's star in your generation. <br />SoulFood reading: Rev 5-9, Mark 14:53-65, Ps 48, Pr 13:2-3</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘In your anger do not sin.'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ephesians 4:26 NIV</span><br />Everyone, except the emotionally disturbed, likes to think of themselves as deep-down basically an OK person. And most people are, until they get angry. You see, anger dissolves personality. Anger is that it brews and festers invisibly waiting for its moment and then - KABOOM! The nicest, sweetest people can explode in a ball of rage. It ain't pretty! <br />So what if that's you? Or maybe you've not exploded yet but you can feel your fuse burning shorter and shorter. Listen to what Paul says: ‘In your anger do not sin.' (NIV). Does that mean it's always bad to get mad? No, Paul is making the point that we can't help things happening that stir us to feeling angry, but we have a choice not to let that anger lead to sin. You can scream something really hurtful and nasty at your sister / brother / mum / dad (or whoever) or you can let off steam in your bedroom by screaming into your pillow! One of those things is OK by God and the other isn't! <br />Sometimes we're angry because we think people don't appreciate us, or take advantage of us. Again Paul writes: ‘Get rid of all...anger...forgiving each other...as...God forgave you' (Ephesians 4:31-32 NIV). So, if you're inclined to be hot-tempered, ask God now to remind you of all the times He's forgiven you. It's a great way to cool off ;-)]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘Be self-controlled and alert. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Peter 5: 8 NIV</span><br />You'd have to be pretty clueless to eat a picnic in a minefield, or to try telling Russell Crowe that the Rabbitohs are rubbish without expecting to get an earful back. It's the same with your faith-life. You're acting pretty naïve if you think the devil isn't looking for the right moment to give you a slap or worse still blow you sky-high. The Bible gives us plenty of warning, ‘Be self-controlled and alert. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.' (1 Peter 5: 8 NIV) So, how do you keep your guard up against a dirty fighter? First, jab him with the Word. God's Word is like a weapon. If your opponent comes at you with lies, you need truth to sort your head out. Second, use the rabbit punch of prayer. Pray hard and long. Pray for a Godly perspective. Pray for God's strength. Pray for God's perseverance. Pray. Pray. Pray. Third, upper cut with praise. God loves it when we can say, ‘Life might be a female dog, BUT God is still good.' Satan hates that. You see, his plan is to take your eyes off God. But if he only succeeds in drawing you closer, he ends up on the canvas. And for the knockout hook? Easy: ‘Resist the devil and he will flee...' (James 4: 7 NIV)<br />SoulFood reading: Rev 1-4, Mark 14:43-52, Ps 1, Pr 13:1</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...for...a time like this.'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Esther 4:14 NIV</span><br />Did you know the Bible has a beauty queen in it? Not only that, but Esther also married a king, uncovered a plot to kill all the Jewish people, and saved them. Quite a life! Her story shows us how important it is to be in the right place, and let the right people influence you. Remember these two things:<br />1) Where you are today is no accident. If you think of your life as a swimming race, there's no time for you to just tread water - you should always be going forwards. Don't think that there's gonna be a better time, or more important opportunity - you don't choose your time, God does. He's got you where you are for a reason, so that when He calls you to do something, you're either in the right place to do it already, or on your way there. <br />2) God sends special people to guide us. Mordecai was Esther's mentor, her accountability guy. Without him, she may not have ever realised what her calling was. He helped her actually get stuck in and do what God wanted. Who is your Mordecai? Who helps you understand where you are, knows you well enough to give you a gentle kick up the bum if you go off on one? Who will encourage you when you feel ready to quit? None of us are perfect - that's why God sends friends, we really need them!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...If anyone wants to be first...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Mark 9: 35 NIV <br /></span>Sacrifice. A bit of an ugly word. We often associate it with gory death scenes from B grade horror movies. But the reality of the word couldn't be further away from that! Sacrifice is something beautiful. Think of the everyday heroes who bring beauty to the word: the single mum who works two jobs to give her child a better future; the soldier on the frontline risking his life for the security of his country; the young person volunteering her time to clean up the local park. Beautiful heroic acts centred on this beautiful word: sacrifice. You see, when we put other people's needs before our own we end up connected to some very wise words first said over 2000 years ago, ‘If anyone wants to be first, he must be the very last.' (Mark 9: 35 NIV) In God's kingdom, things are different. The least are considered the greatest (Luke 9: 48). Jesus knew if you want to turn the world kingdom side up, it begins with a revolution of the self. When we're able to help others rather than help ourselves, we begin to grasp the beauty of sacrifice. Jesus washed His disciples' feet before His own were cleaned. Sacrifice: Jesus gave up the five star luxuries of Heaven to live in poverty. Sacrifice: Jesus laid down his life so that others would gain theirs. Sacrifice: so, go on, do something beautiful today.<br />SoulFood reading: 1 Kings 21-22, Mark 14:27-42, Ps 129, Pr 12:27-28</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘He made known his ways to Moses, his deeds to the people of Isarel.'</h2>
<span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 103:7</span> <br />Have you ever known someone to do something that made absolutely no sense until they explained it to you? God can be just like that. Sometimes He does things we don't get, sometimes he doesn't do things we think He should. Like when He told Noah to build a boat, Abraham to sacrifice his only son, and Moses to cross the sea on foot. None of those things make any sense until you look at the whole story, from God's perspective. Then we can see He totally knew what he was doing! <br />When we are able to stop looking at things through our own eyes and see God's perspective it changes the way we see everything. When we understand Him better we learn to love Him more. When we see why He has asked us not to do certain things we naturally find quite appealing, it's much easier to do as He asks. ‘There is a way that seems right to man, but in the end it leads to death' (Proverbs 14:12 NIV). Just because something feels right, it doesn't mean it is. If it's not God's plan, it's a dead end!<br />Understanding God's point of view keeps us on track. We live in a world that has come to the conclusion that there is no truth and everyone's opinion is valid. The problem isn't that our culture doesn't believe anything, it's that it believes everything. Many say ‘It doesn't matter what you believe as long as you're sincere.' Rubbish! Hitler was sincere; and that definitely mattered. Seeing life from God's perspective keeps us stable, focussed and stops us being fooled by the latest fads!

<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 32: 3-4 NAS <br /></span>A woman who completed a walk around the world confessed she travelled part-way in a support truck. ‘I shouldn't be remembered as the first woman to walk round the world when I cheated,' she said. How many of us would even have admitted our deception?<br />The Psalmist said, ‘When I kept silent about my sin...Your hand was heavy upon me.' Confessing your sins: (1) lets you experience God's forgiveness: He already knows about them anyway, but how can He forgive you while you're busy making excuses and blame-shifting? John says, ‘...if we confess...he will forgive our sins...' (1 John 1: 9 NCV) The first move is up to you. (2) restores your emotional and physical energy: Nothing's more draining than denial and nothing gives you energy and enthusiasm like having a clean slate. David said, ‘I am weak from sin...' (Psalm 31:10 CEV) Reflecting on his affair with Bathsheba, he said, ‘When I kept silent... my vitality was drained...I acknowledged my sin...and You forgave the guilt.' (Psalm 32: 3-5 NAS) (3) allows you to move on: Confession allows you to hit the ‘reset' button and start again. It draws a line between the past and future. (4) lets you grow: Thomas Edison said failure taught him over a thousand ways not to make a light bulb! Your mistakes work for you instead of against you when you start confessing them to God and accepting His forgiveness. <br />SoulFood reading: Philip 4:4-13, Gen 11:1-9</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...Peter heard him say, ‘It is the Lord'...and jumped into the water.'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>John 21:7 NIV</span><br />Imagine: you've been up all night, sat in a stinky boat in the middle if the lake, fishing; that's your job, it's what you do. And what have you caught? Diddly squat! Then some bloke, who isn't a fisherman, tells you to throw your nets the other side of the boat. You'd be a bit reluctant, thinking ‘who does He think He is, telling me my job', but you do it anyway; and wow - not only one, but 153 fish leap into your nets! Just one question: Who is this man? One word from Him, and things change for the better. Answer: It was Jesus. <br />Peter's so excited that he leaves the fish he's been slaving all night for without a second thought, leaps off the boat, and runs through the water to Jesus. For Peter, even though his nets were full, he'd achieved his goal, he didn't stay and guard his blessings. He went overboard and committed himself fully to God. Could you do that? It's a challenge for you today. When you've got what you want in life, don't just watch over it, but be willing to leave it for Jesus. <br />Peter felt like he was giving up everything when he left his boat, his mates, his fish and jumped in to see Jesus; but when he got there, Jesus was cooking...fish! God knows what you need, He has it, and He'll give you it. So go on; jump out of that boat.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...I have stilled and quieted my soul...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 131: 2 NIV</span><br />If you're the kind of person who doesn't go anywhere without head phones stuck to your ears or can't work without the TV on in ‘the background', then you might be surprised to hear that the Bible is packed with people pursuing peace and quiet: ‘The fruit of righteousness will be peace; the effect of righteousness will be quietness and confidence forever.' (Isaiah 32: 17 NIV) ‘Better one handful with tranquillity than two handfuls with toil and chasing after the wind.' (Ecclesiastes 4: 6 NIV) ‘Make it your ambition to lead a quiet life, to mind your own business...' (1 Thessalonians 4: 11 NIV) ‘Be still, and know that I am God...' (Psalm 46: 10 NIV) You can't live a continually noisy life and expect to walk in peace. <br />Jesus made sure He had seasons of peace and time alone. Nobody had a greater life's purpose or more demands placed upon Him than He did. Yet the Bible says, He ‘...often withdrew to lonely places and prayed.' (Luke 5: 16 NIV) Surely if Jesus needed this type of lifestyle, you do too. Spending quiet time with God is essential to restoring your body, your mind and your emotions. The truth is, you need it regularly, so insist on having it and don't let anyone take it from you. Work your diary around God; don't try to work God in around your diary.<br />SoulFood reading: 1 Kings 18:16 - 20:43, Mark 14:12-26, Ps 124, Pr 12:26</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...to depart and be with Christ...is far better.'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Philippians 1:23 NKJV</span><br />A kid wrote a letter to God, addressed it to heaven and posted it. Letters like that usually end up in the bin in the corner of the Post Office, but somehow this one was opened. It read, ‘Dear God, what's it like to die? I don't want to do it, I just want to know. Your friend, Michael.' It's a big question that lots of Christians have spent a very long time thinking about. <br />Harold Sala sees it like this: ‘When I'm going to a part of the world I've never been to, I read and investigate to find out what it's like. I browse travel books, go on the Internet, talk with someone who can tell me what it's like from personal experience. No other book in the world can tell me what the Bible tells me about heaven. The only person who has been there and can tell me what it's like, is Jesus.' At the end of the final Narnia book The Last Battle, the characters die in a train accident and CS Lewis wraps up the story like this: ‘The things that [happened] after that were so beautiful I cannot write them. For us this is the end of all the stories, but for them it was only the beginning of the real story.' <br />But we'll leave the last word to the Apostle Paul: ‘...we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, an eternal house in heaven...' (2 Corinthians 5:1).]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...if there is anything praiseworthy-meditate on these things.'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Philippians 4: 8 NKJV</span><br />General Robbie Risner described the seven years he spent as a prisoner of war as ‘the essence of despair'. What's amazing is how he survived. He prised the cover off a floor drain in his cell and lowered his head into the opening. There he noticed a solitary blade of grass, the only scrap of colour in his colourless world. Calling it a ‘blood transfusion for the soul', Risner began each day in prayer, lying on the floor of his cell with his head down the vent, focused on that single blade of grass. <br />Jesus said, ‘Your eye...provides light for your body. When your eye is good, your whole body is filled with light. But when your eye is bad, your whole body is filled with darkness...' (Matthew 6: 22-23 NLT) What are you looking at? Each day you get to decide where you'll focus. Humans tend to find things to complain about. God gave Adam and Eve everything they needed in the Garden of Eden, but they chose to focus on the one thing they couldn't have. He divided the Red Sea and provided food so the Israelites would never go hungry. Initially, ‘They... sang His praise. But...soon forgot what He had done...' (Psalm 106:12-13 NIV) Don't be like that. The Bible says, ‘If there is anything praiseworthy-meditate on these things.' Surely you can find something to praise God for today!<br />SoulFood reading: 1 Kings 16:1 - 18:15, Mark 14:1-11, Ps 4, Pr 12:25</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...do not be like the hypocrites...'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 6:5 NIV</span><br />Hypocrite. Have you ever called anyone that? Do you know what it actually means? The word came from a city built by Herod the Great when Jesus was just a little boy, which had a huge outdoor theatre. The actors who performed there wore masks for each character, and were called ‘hypokrites'. So ‘hypocrite' basically means to wear a mask to impress or deceive other people. <br />Jesus was the only person in the New Testament who used the word ‘hypocrite', and he used it to refer to three specific things; giving, praying and judging. Matthew 6:2 basically says: don't tell the whole world when you give someone something, just to make yourself look good. Matthew 6:6 tells you that when you pray, it should be between you and God; not done to show off to others. Remember prayer is a conversation between you and God; you wouldn't shout out all your other conversations in life, would you? Finally, Matthew 7:2-5 reminds us that if you make a big deal out of judging others, it'll come back to bite you on the bum! You're not perfect, but don't try and make yourself look better by picking on other people's faults.<br />So the word for you today is, don't be a hypocrite. Be real in your giving, praying and judging. Don't wear a mask to impress or deceive those around you; let them, and God, see the real you.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘I tell you what it really means to worship the LORD...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Isaiah 58: 6 CEV</span><br />‘It's not a coincidence that in the Scriptures poverty is mentioned more than 2100 times...That's a lot of airtime.' Bono, famous for huge stadium gigs and record breaking albums, said this in front of world leaders in Washington reminding them that God cares about the poor. Rock stars, politicians, grannies, even teenagers! Throughout history God has caused people to speak up and stand out on behalf of the lost and least. He's still doing it today. <br />Isaiah 58: 6-7 CEV says, ‘I tell you what it really means to worship the LORD. Remove the chains of prisoners who are chained unjustly. Free those who are abused! Share your food with everyone who is hungry; share your home with the poor and homeless. Give clothes to those in need; don't turn away your relatives.' <br />There is a women's prison in Haiti, one of the poorest countries in the world, where 20 people sleep in the cell the size of your bedroom. Over 80% of the women there have never even had a trial. Too hard to get your head around? Ok, what about the kids in your school, whose parents show them violence more than love, who get no breakfast, then when they get to school are called names for being smelly and scruffy, while you keep quiet. Worship is when we speak out, when we get alongside, when we give ourselves to God, and the people made in his image. Worship God today.<br />SoulFood reading: 1 Kings 14-15, Mark 13:24-37, Ps 121, Pr 12:23-24</p>]]></introtext>

<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘Remember today what you have learned about the Lord through your experiences with him...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>DEUTERONOMY 11:2 TEV</span> <br />A woman was recently in a local newspaper announcing with immense pride that after years of study and hard work she had achieved a Phd in her greatest passion; air guitar. There was nothing she didn't know about the history, the various stances and how to identify a truly great air guitarist. Most people reading that article had identical reactions; what a tremendous waste of time! Sadly, for many Christians the same can be said of their Bible study. You see in churches we love Bible Studies. They are less effort than prayer meetings and certainly easier than making any attempt to meet people outside of church. You sit, you listen, you drink tea, you go home. <br />Now of course Bible study is absolutely essential to our faith! Without gaining God's wisdom from his word we're absolutely stuffed. But, if we take His word and don't act upon it, it's as useless as a Phd in air guitar. In fact it's worse because we can become judgmental and very proud. By taking a scripture we know from the Bible, applying it to our lives then living an experience, the Word comes alive! We can relate to the characters, we can understand the tests of faith. James writes ‘Do not deceive yourselves by just listening to His word; instead put it into practise' (James 1:22 TEV). You wouldn't read a holiday guide and think ‘I've read the book, now I don't need to go', you read the guide to get the best possible experience from your adventure! The Bible is exactly the same - a guide book to living life to the max, not a substitute for it!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘If someone forces you to go one mile, go...two...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 5: 41 NIV</span><br />In Roman times soldiers could legally make Jewish citizens carry their gear for a mile (a bit over 1½ kilometres). But Jesus says: ‘If someone forces you to go one mile, go...two.' Max Lucado writes: ‘We have a second-mile servant in our church. By profession he is an architect. By passion, a servant. Prior to each worship service he does his rounds through the men's restrooms...wipes sinks, cleans mirrors, checks toilets and picks up paper. He tells no one and requests nothing in return...Let me tell you how to spot second-milers. They don't wear badges or uniforms; they wear smiles. They've discovered ...joy in the extra effort...satisfaction ...in helping... Why? They're free! They've passed from slave to volunteer. When Mary anointed Jesus' feet, one-milers like Judas criticised the deed as wasteful. Not Jesus. He received the gesture as a demonstration of love, a friend surrendering her most treasured gift. There's an elderly man or women in your church who just lost their partner. An hour of your time would mean the world to them...How about this one? Down the hall is a person who shares your last name. Shock them with kindness...your homework done with no complaints...coffee served when they awake... Alabaster poured out ‘just because.' Jesus chose the servants' quarters. Can't we?' John Gardner said, ‘When people are serving, life is no longer meaningless.' You're not called to ‘get by', you're called to go ‘above and beyond'.<br />SoulFood reading: 1 Kings 12-13, Mark 13:12-23, Ps 117, Pr 12:20-22</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...having done all...stand...'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ephesians 6:13 NKJV</span><br />Have you ever watched some YouTube clips and asked &quot;what were they thinking?&quot; You see a bunch of nutters, doing crazy stuff, risking serious injury; and what for? Nothing! <br />As a Christian, you'll face some pretty tough fights too; with the devil. But you'll be pleased to know that when it comes to fighting with the devil, there is a prize! ‘Blessed is the man who endures...when he has been approved, he will receive the crown...' (James 1:12 NKJV). ‘Endures' means you're being tested; can you stick it out? ‘Approved' means that with victory comes great things. So although it's tough when you feel like you're being attacked by everyone and everything, and you're stretched to your limits, stick with it. ‘Having done all ... stand'. <br />You may ask how long the attack will last, but there's no set answer, Daniel's prayers took three weeks until the angel came (Daniel 10:13). The enemy is relentless, so you must be too. Don't give up. Pray, pray and pray some more. Your persistence will overcome the enemy's resistance ... in the end. ‘...you have need of endurance, so that after you have done the will of God, you may receive the promise' (Hebrews 10:36 NKJV). So stay there, keep fighting, and God will come to your aid.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...let us lay aside every weight, and...run with endurance...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Hebrews 12: 1 NKJV</span><br />The Bible says, ‘Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may obtain it.' (1Corinthians 9: 24 NKJV) Here are some lessons to help you run in life's race: (1) To avoid stumbling or losing your place, don't look back. You can't change the past but, thanks to God, you can learn from it and leave it behind. (2) Don't be anxious about the next lap, focus only on the next step. If you miss that, you may fall and not get up again. (3) Make every lap count: ‘Let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us.' Many of us carry the weight of stress that experienced ‘runners' understand is not worth worrying about. Maybe you spend too much energy trying to impress people and desperately wondering if they like you, or getting wound up by that certain person who only has to give you ‘that look' to flip you into hours of a fuming temper. Do you worry that you might disappoint or upset someone and so spend all day running around to ‘keep them happy'? To run well you need to learn to drop these kinds of worries. There are enough painful trials in life-why carry the ones you can lay aside? <br />SoulFood reading: 1 Kings 10-11, Mark 13:1-11, Ps 82, Pr 12:18-19</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...speaking the truth in love, we will...grow up...'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ephesians 4:15 NIV</span><br />There are two ways to tell the truth. The ‘give them a piece of your mind' style, which only makes things worse, or God's way: ‘Speaking the truth in love.'<br />Suppose a couple always argue because he's always late. How can she get her message heard by ‘speaking the truth in love'? Here's a five possible ways: <br />She could say to him: 1) ‘I feel frustrated.' No blame, no attack; just an honest expression of her own emotion 2) ‘When you are late.' No judging or name-calling, just a description of reality 3) ‘It seems to say to me that my time is not really important to you.' Sharing how it looks from her point of view 4) ‘Please try to be on time, or call and let me know when you'll be here.' Instead of focusing on the past (which nobody can change), she's telling him what she'd like him to do differently next time 5) ‘Would you like me to do that to you?' This final option is drawing him out of his own little world and into hers. <br />At the end of the day, there's always a whole load of ways to say what needs to be said and maturity is being aware of the options and choosing the right one at the right time. Question is, are you going to give it a go? Who's your guinea pig going to be?]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘He saved others...Himself He cannot save...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 27: 42 NKJV</span><br />This Scripture is beautifully illustrated by the story... When the pastor introduced the visiting speaker, an elderly preacher walked to the pulpit and told this story: ‘A father, his son, and his son's friend were out sailing when a storm overturned their boat sweeping all of them into the ocean. Grabbing a rescue line, in a split second the father had to make an excruciating decision-which boy to throw the other end to and which one to sacrifice. He knew his son had accepted Christ and his friend hadn't. Anguished, the father yelled, ‘I love you son,' and threw the rope to his son's friend. Sadly, his son's body was never recovered. The father knew his son would step into eternity with Jesus and couldn't bear the thought of his friend facing eternity without Christ.' At the end of the service a teenage boy said to the preacher, ‘What father in his right mind would sacrifice his son's life in hopes that the other boy would become a Christian?' The old preacher replied, ‘It doesn't sound realistic. But that story gives me a glimpse into what it must have been like for God to sacrifice His only Son for us. You see...I was that father, and your pastor was my son's friend.' <br />The crowd who watched Jesus die said, ‘He saved others; Himself He cannot save.' It wasn't a matter of ability; it was a matter of choice. He chose to save you!<br />SoulFood reading: 1 Kings 8-9, Mark 12:28-44, Ps 113, Pr 12:15-17</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...&quot;Blessed...are those who hear the Word...and obey.&quot;'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Luke 11:28 NIV</span><br />Loads of your mates may say success is measured by who has the latest PS3, Wii, iPod, clothes... the list goes on - but Jesus disagrees: He said, '&quot;[Real]...life does not consist in the abundance of the things he possesses&quot;' (Luke 12:15 NKJV) but by how you live. So how do you make sure you live well?<br />1) Challenge yourself. Examine how you spend your time. After a stressy day at school, it's easy to just switch off and veg out in front of the TV. Why not take time to read God's Word and pray, even when you don't feel like it. <br />2) Reach out to others. The smallest good deed in action is worth way more than the hugest good idea, so - help others. The enemy doesn't like you walking what you talk, but God loves it! He always gives you a chance to put into practice what He's taught you. Jesus said, 'Blessed...are those who hear the word...and obey.' <br />3) Be more patient. There was a guy who got the ferry to work, and was always on time. One day he overslept and worried he'd be late. So he sprinted to the dock, saw the ferry two metres from the edge and did a huge leap to land on the deck. Great! ...only, seconds later the ferry actually docked; what a prat he looked! Don't always be in a hurry. The Bible says: 'Patience...can...overcome any problem' (Proverbs 25:15 CEV).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘Jesus answered... ‘It is also written...''</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 4: 7 NIV</span><br />After Jesus' baptism ‘...the Spirit sent Him out into the desert' (Mark 1: 12 NIV) and, after fasting forty days, He was hungry. That's when Satan showed up and said, ‘If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.' (Matthew 4: 3 NIV) You can count on the enemy to show up at your most vulnerable moments. And when he does you'd better know what the Word of God actually says-not just selected snippets and quotes you've heard from your youth leader. ‘All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching ...in righteousness.' (2 Timothy 3: 16 NIV) Often we re-read the bits of Scripture that fit our lifestyle comfortably but avoid challenging passages. Listen, when the enemy manipulates God's Word and uses it against you, you need to be able to say, ‘It is also written.' You need to know what else God has to say! The Bible says Satan ‘...will speak against the Most High...oppress his saints and try to change...times and ...laws.' (Daniel 7: 25 NIV) Yes, Satan knows the Word of God is ‘...a double-edged sword...' (Hebrews 4: 12 NCV), but like a true psycho he'll still try to engage you in a scrap! Jesus knew what His Father had actually said, and refused to allow Satan to get the upper hand with lightning reflexes like: ‘It is also written: ‘Do not put...God to the test.&quot; Get into God's Word and get it into you! <br />SoulFood reading: Lev 23:15-22, Acts 2:1-18</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...I no longer live but Christ lives in me...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Galatians 2:20 NIV</span> <br />Do you make New Year's resolutions! Have you ever wondered why we do that? Is it to impress friends? To try and be a better, nicer person? Because you think people expect you to? And do you ever actually manage to keep them all?!? How long is it before you broke you last set? <br />Hebrews 12 urges us to keep striving, while Romans 3:23 reminds us that we're all going to slip up; so why bother?! Which one do we pay attention to? Our word for today, Galatians 2:20, goes on to say that God loves you and gave Himself for you. Think about that for a minute - it's a pretty huge thing! Verse 21 says that we can never get to a point of supreme goodness by effort. So that means no matter how many resolutions we keep, we'll never reach perfection. But that is why Jesus died for you - so that unreachable goal is brought right to us. <br />So although resolutions aren't the be-all and end-all at New Year, if you remember how amazing it is that God gave Himself for us, and that we have Christ in us to help us, you might find it easier to do the right thing, for the right reasons, whatever your resolutions. And when you find it hard going, you know on whom you can call for help!</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...if you have faith in Me, you will do the same things that I am doing...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>John 14: 12 CEV</span><br />Two more things about calling: (1) Your calling is often connected to what troubles you deeply. For William Wilberforce it was slavery. He devoted his entire life to seeing it eradicated in England, which finally happened shortly before his death. For Dr Martin Luther King Jr, it was the injustice of a society that insulted and oppressed black people. So he dreamed and he preached and he marched and he organised and he boycotted, and the Civil Rights Movement advanced to victory. If you want to discover your calling, begin praying about what troubles you deeply. Allow your heart to be moved, carry within you the conviction that things must change, and keep praying, ‘Lord, make me a change agent.' <br />(2) Your calling means God believes in you. When Jesus called His disciples they didn't look like winners. A Rabbi normally wouldn't recruit followers, instead the best religious students would come to them and apply to be a disciple. But not Jesus. He picked a doctor, a tax collector and fishermen and said that He believed in them and would teach them what He knew. He promised, '...if you have faith in Me, you will do the same things that I am doing...' (John 14:12 CEV) No wonder they left their nets! Jesus empowered His followers to go out to live as He lived. Today, that's what He is calling you to do. <br />SoulFood reading: 1 Kings 6-7, Mark 12:13-27, Ps 108, Pr 12:14</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'If you know these things...'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>John 13:17 AMP</span><br />How much have you got in your piggy bank? Some people think the key to happiness is money, and they spend their whole lives stressing about where to save, where to invest and thinking of ways to get more. Although that can be important, what's more important is working out how you're going to invest your life.<br />Three top ways to invest your life are:<br />1) Making time for friends and loved ones. 'Let no one seek his own, but each...the other's well-being' (1Corinthians 10:24 NKJV). Don't always put yourself first; ask your mates how they are, and spend time listening to their answer. <br />2) Giving thanks. If you're finding it hard to be grateful for what God has given you, look around you and be grateful for what He's protected you from. The enemy doesn't have to steal anything from you to get between you and God, just make you take things for granted. Thank God for what He's given you today. 'From the fullness of his grace we have all received one blessing after another' (John 1:16 NIV). <br />3) Practicing contentment. Paul writes, '...whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable-if anything is excellent or praiseworthy-think about such things' (Philippians 4:8 NIV). Don't wish your life away, always wanting more things. Count your blessings today, and be content with the life God has blessed you with.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...What is that in your hand?'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Exodus 4: 2 NIV</span><br />When God called Moses, one of the questions He asked him was, ‘What is that in your hand?' (Exodus 4:2 NIV) Moses held his shepherd's staff. It represented what he was doing with his life, his job, his income, his talents. God still asks, ‘What is that in your hand?' What has been given to you? Your gifts, your money, your temperament, your experience, your relationships, your mind, your education. God made you and He has built into your character certain strengths. He's given you: (a) wisdom and knowledge, which includes abilities like curiosity, love of learning, sound judgment, and social intelligence; (b) courage, perseverance and integrity; (c) the capacity for kindness and expressing mercy; (d) justice, the ability to bring about fairness and leadership; (e) temperance, qualities like self control, prudence, humility; and (f) transcendence; the appreciation of beauty, the expression of gratitude, the ability to hope and experience joy. We all have elements of these abilities but as you read the list some will jump out as ‘more like you'. Identifying your strengths will help you understand your calling. But your calling isn't just about your strengths; God uses our weaknesses and broken experiences too. For example, no one can speak to those who grieve better than those who've suffered loss. So: ‘What is that in your hand?'<br />SoulFood reading: 1 Kings 3-5, Mark 12:1-12, Ps 101, Pr 12:12-13</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘Nobody should seek his own good, but the good of others.'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Corinthians 10:24 NIV</span><br />Let's be honest, selfishness is a battle we fight daily. But it's a battle we've got to keep fighting. Left to get out of control selfishness will gradually dissolve your personality from the inside out. Thankfully the Bible is full of amazing examples to keep us focused: Paul and Silas were beat up and thrown in the cells but they still found the strength to minister to their jailer (Acts 16:32). When young Stephen was being stoned to death, he prayed for those who were killing him, ‘do not hold this sin against them' (Acts 7:59-60). And of course the ultimate example, when Jesus was hanging on the cross in intense pain, He took time for a condemned criminal hanging next to Him (Luke 23:39-43). <br />How tempting it must have been for all these heroes to just think about themselves; they had every excuse, but their acts of love brought the fragrance of heaven down to earth.<br />When we begin to win the war against selfishness and walk in love, people will take notice; it's totally opposite to the way of the world. And let's remember, we'll never win the world by being like the world! So here's the question you need to answer: How many people might come to know Jesus if you could get your eyes off yourself and start paying attention to what they're going through? It's time to find out!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...each one should retain the place in life...to which God has called him...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Corinthians 7: 17 NIV</span><br />Sometimes what a person contributes doesn't get noticed until they're no longer around to do it. The story's told of the husband who came home from work to find his house in a complete mess. The baby was crying, there were dishes piled up in the sink and dirty laundry on the floor. Beds weren't made, carpets weren't vacuumed and dinner wasn't ready. His wife said, ‘You know how you always ask what I've been doing all day? Well, today I didn't do it.' The Bible says, ‘...each one should retain the place in life ...to which God has called him...' (1Corinthians 7: 17 NIV) This doesn't mean that we should not aspire to greater things but sometimes God wants us to focus on where we are NOW and not always on what is NEXT. Sometimes, if we just stopped doing the things we aren't called to do, it would make a bigger impact than starting to do something new.<br />One day Jesus healed a demon-possessed man. After being set free, the man wanted to travel with Jesus. But Jesus said, ‘Return home and tell how much God has done for you.' (Luke 8:39 NIV) Jesus knew that the man, at that time in his life, had a story to tell and a unique opportunity right where he lived that no one else could fulfil. Maybe you do too. <br />SoulFood reading: 1 Kings 1-2, Mark 11:27-33, Ps 128, Pr 12:10-11</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'Fear of the LORD is the foundation of true knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and discipline.'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 1:7 NLT</span><br />Do you think Terence Tao got to be a whiz at maths by ignoring his teachers? Or Beckham got to be so good at bending balls by laughing at his footie coaches? Did Rebecca St James get to top the charts by never having a singing lesson? No; of course not! If you want to get good at something, you have to learn, and the best people to learn from, are those who are already good at it. So if you want to develop your Christian life, a good place to start is by finding someone you respect who can help you through stuff, who can help you learn. This proverb suggests your parents may be a good source of wisdom; now, you may see them as a pain, always telling you how to do stuff and getting on at you, but, hard as it may be to admit, they probably come up with some good advice sometimes! Listen to what they're saying, and weigh up whether it actually could be wise to follow their advice.<br />Just like Terence, Rebecca and Beckham got to be good at what they do by studying hard, practicing, and seeking advice, so should it be for you with your Christian life. To get to know God better, study His word, learn from others and respect Him. So don't be a fool; get some training and advice, and wise up.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...He lets us be called His children...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 John 3: 1 CEV<br /></span>Someone said when talking about Jesus, ‘Imagine being God's son, I should think you get good pocket money.' In the Bible, John, Paul, Peter and of course Jesus tell us that WE are God's children. God is our Dad. So does being God's kid mean good pocket money?<br />In the Old Testament, only kings, prophets and ‘special' people were given the gift of the Holy Spirit, so when Jesus said: ‘...If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!' (Luke 11: 13 NIV), it would have blown the minds of those listening. What a gift to get from your heavenly Father!<br />Paul tells the Christians in Ephesus, ‘All praise to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms because we are united with Christ.' (Ephesians 1: 3 NLT) Every spiritual blessing-ok, now that's serious pocket money! But most importantly God gives His kids, what every great father should... love: ‘For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.' (Romans 8: 38-39 NIV) <br />SoulFood reading: Heb 11:17-13:25, Mark 11:12-26, Ps 45, Pr 12:7-9</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Daniel 3:30 NIV</span> <br />We can learn a few things from those guys in the fiery furnace: <br />1) Obeying God doesn't mean you'll never have trouble. Don't expect the world to always get you - sometimes, it'll be hard work for you 2) You're not alone, God is with you in your trouble. If you've ever seen the Veggietales ‘Rack, Shack and Benny', you'll remember that when King Neb threw them in the fire, suddenly there were ‘four men, and one was reeeaaal shiny!' (check out the whole story in Daniel 3:19 - 27). The fire didn't kill them, ‘cos Jesus was there too. So be encouraged. It may feel like you're stuck in the flames, but God is with you - He'll bring you out of this victorious. 3) Your trouble will become your testimony. Your mates are watching. When what they're trusting in doesn't work, they'll look to see if what you're trusting in does. Your faithfulness to God and His to you, will challenge them in ways nothing else can. Everybody in Babylon knew what Rack, Shack and Benny believed, but they wanted to know if it worked when the heat was on (literally!). It did, and lives changed! 4) On the other side of your trouble, there's great blessing. Our word for today is a Scriptural principle: when you're faithful in a tough place, God can trust you in a high place.</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘Get Mark...he is helpful...to my ministry.'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Timothy 4: 11 NIV</span><br />When John Mark decided to take time off to visit his family, it didn't sit too well with Paul. Later when Barnabas wanted to take John Mark on their next mission trip, Paul exploded! ‘...the contention became so sharp...they parted from one another...Barnabas took Mark and sailed to Cyprus; but Paul chose Silas...' (Acts 15: 39-40 NKJV) But the story doesn't end there. Later an older and wiser Paul, who had learned to add grace to his grit, has changed his mind about Mark, ‘Demas loves the things of this world so much that he left...Mark can be very helpful to me, so please find him and bring him with you.' (2 Timothy 4: 10-11 CEV) There are three important lessons here for you:<br />(1) Always be willing to give someone a second chance. After all, that's what God does for you. You can get hurt and disappointed but, if you're going to be Christ-like, it's a risk you must take. (2) It doesn't matter that we are different. Paul didn't have a family, Mark did; they had different priorities. Just because someone doesn't see things the same way as you doesn't mean they are against you. (3) When you look for the best in others you usually find it. The Bible says, ‘...we have this treasure in jars of clay...' (2 Corinthians 4: 7 NIV) Learn to look pass the scruffy clay and find the treasure in people. <br />SoulFood reading: Heb 9:1 - 11:16, Mark 11:1-11, Ps 47, Pr 12:4-6</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord...'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Kings 22:2 NIV</span><br />A violent leader, filling a city end to end with blood; his father, killed by his own officers - it sounds like a trailer for the latest action movie! But actually: it's the story of Josiah's dad and granddad. <br />What a start in life! You'd think there was no hope for him with a family like that, but &quot;uh uh&quot;, you'd be wrong. Josiah was just a kid when he became king (only eight years old) and he chose to live righteously, to live for God, and didn't stop living that way all his life (check out 2 Kings 22). What's the point? We can't pick our parents, but we can pick our role-models. Your parents may have given you your DNA, but God can give you a new birth and a new beginning. You're God's child so you get His DNA. Ephesians 5v1 says 'You are God's children whom he loves, so try to be like him'. Just like Josiah, you can't control the way your family or mates respond to God, but you can control the way you respond to Him. Your past, your history, doesn't have to be your prison; you have a say in your life, a choice in the path you take. If you choose well now, maybe someday, years in the future, someone will be thanking God for the history you left for them, for your legacy.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘If a man's gift is...leadership, let him govern diligently...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Romans 12: 6-8 NIV</span><br />More and more schools, colleges and churches are giving opportunities to young people to be leaders. After a childhood of being told what to do by adults, some teenagers can't wait to have a turn at making their own decisions. But there is a lot more to leadership than wanting to be in charge: the Bible talks about leadership as a gift. People with a leadership gift can look at a person, problem or opportunity and can see a way of taking it forward. Do think you are a leader?<br />‘Not a chance'-If you know that leadership is not your thing, that's ok. God gives some people gifts that will support the leaders. Often these people put the leader's ideas into action. Without these people nothing gets done. <br />‘Not sure'-Maybe you've had an idea or you want God to use you to change or start something but you are not sure how. Don't worry! You don't need to know all the answers, you just need someone to help your leadership gift to grow. All leaders need other leaders who've ‘been there' to help them, teach them and inspire them. Think of some of the leaders you respect; ask if you can meet up and chat about your ideas. <br />‘Not a doubt'-Great! Remember Jesus, the ultimate leader, said ‘...the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve...' (Matthew 20: 28 NKJV)<br />SoulFood reading: Heb 5-8, Mark 10:35-52, Ps 97, Pr 12:1-3</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others.'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Philippians 2:4 NIV</span><br />Do you want to know what God's plan for your life is, in one sentence? OK, here it is: God wants to make you a channel through which His blessings flow to others. That's it. Finito. What more do you need to know? <br />Well, most people aren't satisfied with just knowing that. We're curious; we want to ask more questions, the most obvious one being: ‘How?' God's cool with us asking those sort of questions because questioning is a great way to get to know Him better. King David asked those kinds of questions a lot, ‘Show me your ways, O Lord...' (Psalm 24:4). When we ask God questions, He is less concerned with the question and more concerned with the attitude with which we ask it. When we read about the life of Jesus in the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John we see that He was always being asked questions, some easy, some hard. The way He responded very often depended on what was in the heart of the one doing the asking. Were they after a word to help them get ahead or were they wanting to learn about how to truly live for God? <br />So what's in your heart today? Are you ready for God to show you His ways; that always lead to others being blessed, or are you secretly hoping that you'll be able to keep the blessing for yourself?]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...you did it for me...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 25: 40 CEV</span><br />Jesus is preaching to the crowds and begins to tell a story about one of the Jewish people's favourite subjects-Judgment Day. In the minds of Jesus' listeners, Judgment Day was a great and terrible day-great for them, terrible for their enemies. In his story, Jesus talks about the nations being brought before God, who is the great King, and separated, some on the left and some on the right. The crowd's smiles must have been growing as Jesus talks about the group on the left being blessed and rewarded. ‘That must be us,' the Hebrew listeners were thinking, ‘at last God will dish out some justice.' But Jesus goes on and as he does some of the smiles may have turned to sneers. Jesus says that the first group are being rewarded for giving the King food, water and clothes. Because when they did these things for ‘any of My people, no matter how unimportant they seemed' the king says, they ‘did it for Me.' In Jesus' story justice was being dished out but, for Jesus, justice wasn't about Israel's enemies getting punished, rather the poor being treated like God's children. Yesterday we thought about the importance of remembering that you are made in God's image. Jesus reminds us of the importance that others are made in God's image too no matter how unimportant they seem. Take some time right now to ask what you can do for the King today.<br />SoulFood reading: John 5:1-15, Isa 54:9-17</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...I will give it into your hand...'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Joshua 8:18 NKJV</span><br />Imagine strolling up to the school bully with Aussie boxer Anthony Mundine two paces behind you. The mouthful of abuse old bully-pants screams your way, wouldn't faze you; you've got Anthony Mundine fighting your corner. The flexing of Mr. Bully's rather gigantic pecs wouldn't worry you; you've got Anthony backing you up. In fact, wouldn't you be tempted to make the first move; Anthony won't let you down. How brave would you be if Anthony Mundine had you covered? Well, duh! Don't you know that God has got you covered? Whatever battles you're facing, God is fighting your corner. That doesn't mean we go looking for trouble, that's not God's way, is it? Remember, Jesus prayed, 'Your will be done on earth as it is in Heaven'. However, it does mean, when we know God is taking us out of our comfort zone to tackle some unjust bullying situation, we can trust that God, Himself, is backing us to the hilt. <br />Before going into battle God said to Joshua: 'Stretch out the spear that is in your hand toward Ai, for I will give it into your hand.' Joshua kicked some butt. Not because he flashed his 'God card' everywhere he felt like it, but because God, Himself prompted him to fight this particular battle. Likewise, don't mouth it off in the name of Jesus, unless Jesus has prompted you.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘So God created humans to be like himself, he made men and women'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Genesis 1: 27 CEV<br /></span>Thousands of years ago, most people (especially the kings and emperors) believed that if you were a king or an emperor then you were created in the image of God. You were special, God's rep on earth. Which meant everyone should treat you like a god and worship you. If the king made a statue or image of himself, they would worship that too! Being king was a cushy deal if you could get it. However, these words in Genesis take the deal to a whole new level. The author of Genesis reminds the readers that it wasn't just one special king or pharaoh who was made in God's image, but all humans! This was incredibly empowering. The Israelites knew what it was to be a slave, to be bought and sold like the cows, sheep and donkeys. But Genesis told them that they weren't just animals that talk, they were like God. Wow! Of course in today's modern society we don't think some people are more special than others, we don't worship people like gods and treat others like donkeys. We don't have images of these people to help us adore and worship them more...or do we? Don't be so desperate to be like the people you admire (or even worship). You don't have to be thinner, cleverer, richer or famous to be special. You don't have to be like THEM coz you are already like HIM! <br />SoulFood reading: Heb 1-4, Mark 10:23-34, Ps 93, Pr 11:30-31</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘Lazy hands make a man poor, but diligent hands bring wealth.'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 10:4 NIV</span> <br />Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft (and the world's richest man), was asked about his success, and offered some insights to anyone starting out. He makes a lot of sense! <br />1) Life isn't fair - get used to it 2) The world doesn't care about your self-esteem; it expects you to accomplish first, feel good second 3) You won't make $80K a year right out of school, or be a Company Director. You have to earn it 4) Do you think your teacher is tough? Wait till you have a boss - he's worse! 5) Flipping burgers isn't beneath you; it's opportunity 6) Some schools may have abolished winners and losers, but life hasn't. They may have eradicated ‘failing grades' and given you as long as you want to get the right answer. This bears no resemblance to reality 7) Life isn't divided into terms. You don't get summers off. Employers aren't interested in helping you ‘find yourself;' you do that on your own time 8) Be nice to nerds; chances are, you'll end up working for one someday! <br />OK - it's not gospel but it's useful advice <br />The writer of Proverbs sussed this a long time before Bill Gates did: ‘Lazy people want much but get little, but those who work hard will prosper' (Proverbs 13:4 NIV). So don't try and take shortcuts in life - you've got to work for it!</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘Fear not, for I am with you...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Isaiah 41: 10 NKJV</span><br />A big part of listening to God is learning to hear what He says to us in the Bible. So it's important to know what the Scriptures say.<br />When you're about to make a wrong turn or a bad decision God can use His Word to give you a prod; that's because '...a man's heart plans his way, but the Lord directs his steps...' (Proverbs 16: 9 NKJV) When you don't feel you've got what it takes to get the job done His voice will whisper that He will '...guide you continually...satisfy your soul in drought... strengthen your bones...You shall be like...a spring of water, whose waters do not fail...' (Isaiah 58: 11 NKJV) You have an unfailing supply. When you run out of answers and don't know what to do He will reassure you: ‘I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I will counsel you and watch over you.' (Psalm 32: 8 NIV) When the load gets too heavy to carry you'll hear His voice saying, ‘Cast your cares on the Lord and He will sustain you...' (Psalm 55: 22 NIV)<br />Hearing God's voice may mean you have to sacrifice other things and deliberately tune out those other voices, but hearing Him correctly takes top priority. Nothing, absolutely nothing, is more important than learning to recognise God's voice when He speaks to you. <br />SoulFood reading: Titus 1-3, Mark 10:13-22, Ps 88:9b-18, Pr 11:27-29</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'Keep your tongue from evil...'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 34:13 NIV</span><br />Imagine, '&quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot;, the Director's cut'. The DVD extras of the bits they never used. Including the scene where Jesus stitches up Judas before he can reach for his pieces of silver. Or the scene where Jesus becomes the last Samurai, and together with Peter they chop off all the lynch mobs' ears. Or even the deleted 'resurrection scene', where Jesus comes back to life, but this time it's personal; He wants revenge! It just doesn't fit with the rest of the story does it? It doesn't sit with His teachings. It stands against all the Christian faith has to offer. When Peter sliced off the High Priests' ear, Jesus rebuked him and healed the man's ability to hear. <br />What about us? Do the things we say or do just stand against all the Christian faith has to offer? Do our habits not fit with the rest of the story? Do we cut off people's ability to hear the message of God through the hurtful words we speak? We can't just fly off the handle whenever we feel like it. We must be sensitive to God: If He tells us, 'Say nothing,' we must keep silent. How many times do we show the DVD extra bits that just aren't part of the story? When we get off script we ruin God's story. Stick to the facts. Stick to the story.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...your ears will hear a voice...saying, ‘This is the way...''</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Isaiah 30: 21 NIV</span><br />Whenever you step out to try something new a voice within you will whisper, ‘You must be out of your mind. You're not capable of this. You just jumped in way over your head.' Don't listen to it! It's the voice of Fear, and it doesn't play fair. It loves to hit the rewind button on your past failures and feeds on your deepest insecurities. <br />But there's another voice: Faith! It says: ‘Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you, yes, I will help you, I will uphold you with My righteous right hand.' (Isaiah 41: 10 NKJV) Tuning out Fear and tuning into Faith doesn't mean your problems are automatically solved or that the other voice just fades away. No, it's more like having an intense conversation with a close friend in the middle of a noisy, crowded place. There may be other voices around you but you don't hear them because you're so focused on what your friend is saying. That's how it is with God's voice. Whether He speaks to you through the Bible, through a friend, or through your favourite podcast, He's always communicating with hearts that love Him. His promise to you is, ‘Your ears will hear a voice...saying, ‘This is the way; walk in it.&quot; One Word from God, just one, can totally change your mood. So today, take time to listen to God's voice.<br />SoulFood reading: Jonah 1-4, Mark 10:1-12, Ps 88:1-9a, Pr 11:24-26</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...each according to his ability.'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 25:15 NIV</span><br />One of the stories Jesus tells is a bit like the TV programme Dragon's Den; it's all about investing in people who've got ideas about how to turn a little into a lot. In Jesus' story though there's only one dragon who decides to invest money in three different people. They weren't all given the same amount, they were given, ‘each according to his ability.' As the story unfolds we are impacted by a scary truth: God only gives what you have the ability to handle. Why is that scary? Because it means if you don't make the most of what God gives you it's not like you can go back to Him making excuses like, ‘Well, I got the jitters so I decided to do nothing.' That won't wash. It's tough but it is the truth at the heart of this story. The first guy doubled his. The second did the same. They both got big fat promotions as a reward. But the third caved in to fear and buried his cash in a hole. What did he get in return for that? He got his butt kicked that's what. Message? When you fail to use what God gives you, He's not impressed and you lose the rewards you would have enjoyed.<br />Listen, fear of failure is not of God. That's why you need to ask Him for the gift of faith; today and every day.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...each according to its kind...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Genesis 1:24 NKJV</span><br />Question: How many giant killers were in Saul's army? Answer: Zero! When Goliath challenged Israel every soldier quaked with fear. Yet David, who turned up half by accident, sussed the situation and, recalling his experiences with God, went out and killed the giant. <br />Question: After David became king, how many other giant killers arose in Israel? Answer: Loads! ‘...then Sibbecai...killed Sippai, one of the descendants of the giants, and they were subdued. And there was war with the Philistines again, and Elhanan...killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver's beam. Again there was war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature who... also was descended from the giants. When he taunted Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea, David's brother, killed him. These were descended from the giants in Gath [Goliath's home town], and they fell by the hand of David and by the hands of his servants.' (1 Chronicles 20: 4-8 NAS) Why do you suppose there were no giant killers in Saul's army? Because Saul himself wasn't one! But under David's leadership giant killers multiplied because David was a giant killer. This is the ‘it-takes-one-to-make-one' principle that runs right through the Bible. Prophets raise up prophets, healers raise up healers, pioneers raise up pioneers. <br />So the Word for you today is: be careful who influences you, and be careful how you influence others.<br />SoulFood reading: Num 34-36, Mark 9:38-50, Ps 75, Pr 11:23</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...God...put him in the garden...to tend and keep it.'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Genesis 2:15 NKJ</span><br />Work well done is its own reward. It gives us a sense of value. When we're not achieving anything we tend to get depressed. Don't fall for the media hype that says successful people don't need to work. We were all created to fulfil a purpose regardless of how much money is in our bank account. <br />From the time Adam and Eve were created it's been clear that God intended us to be like our Creator - productive, fruitful and involved in work that contributes to His master plan. Adam and Eve were given responsibility over the garden of Eden and enjoyed a maximum level of fulfilment in their jobs before their selfish decision to start doing things their own way. Listen: '...God took the man and put him in the Garden...to tend and keep it... Out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them. And whatever Adam called each living creature, that was its name' (Genesis 2:15&amp;19 NKJ).<br />The first job description included naming and overseeing - the ultimate manager's position! Eve was created to share in these endeavours as Adam's business partner! A man who is not busy doesn't need a business partner! So you don't need to look any further than your Bible to realise that productive work is God's plan for your life. So what are you waiting for? Put this magazine down and get stuck in today!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...Why are you so fearful?...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Mark 4: 40 NKJV</span><br />Have you ever been on a plane when the weather outside is really bad? There's a nervous atmosphere amongst the passengers. Everything starts to shake and rattle. The captain's voice crackles through the intercom saying it's all normal. You're not convinced! Well, that's probably the closest you'll get to how Jesus' disciples felt when they got stuck in a storm out at sea. But check this out: Jesus ‘...was in the stern, asleep on a pillow. And they awoke Him and said to Him, 'Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?' Then He arose and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, ‘Peace, be still!' And the wind ceased and there was a great calm. But He said to them, ‘Why are you so fearful? How is it that you have no faith?&quot; (Mark 4: 36-40 NKJV)<br />Here are two lessons you only learn in life's storms: <br />(1) Jesus never, ever gets rattled. He is the original ‘shaken not stirred'. Once you've invited Him to be your permanent travelling companion He'll never walk out on you.<br />(2) Jesus never started a journey He couldn't finish. So when He permits you to go through storms stop asking Him to get you out and start asking Him to lead you through. Storms can be pretty intense experiences, but with Jesus you'll come out stronger and wiser on the other side.<br />SoulFood reading: Num 32:25 - 33:56, Mark 9:30-37, Ps 18:30-50, Pr 11:22</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...that in the coming ages he might show...his grace, expressed...to us...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ephesians 2:7 NIV</span> <br />Whatever you're going through right now is important. God wants to use it to help shape your future. God doesn't measure us in terms of what we're doing now, or how we feel. No, He's got a much greater plan in mind. Read Romans 8:29. Thousands of years ago, God knew you; and one day, your character will be just like Jesus'. Doesn't that blow your mind? God is going to put us on display and say, ‘Look at My workmanship. Can you believe that I made these awesome creatures from clay? When I first scooped them off the ground they wouldn't hold water. But I worked with them, moulded them and raised them up until they held relationships and jobs. What you heard about them was true. They were a disgrace and a disaster, but My grace was sufficient. Now they will sit with Me, ruling and reigning forever!' <br />People think that Houdini and David Blaine performed the impossible; but when it comes to that, they were amateurs. Could they have split an ocean down the middle, caused an eclipse for 24 hours, turned water into wine, resurrected the dead, and done it all with such style? Well, guess what? That same God is at work in your life, and He plans to show you off some day. Incredible as it may sound, when God gets through with you, you'll be ‘something else.'</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘Above all...guard your heart...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 4: 23 NIV</span><br />These challenging words come from Jesus himself-in fact they were part of his most famous sermon, ‘...anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.' (Matthew 5: 28 NIV) Now before all the girls switch off, it's not only lads who need to hear this. Every human being has wrong thought patterns that need laying at the foot of the cross. Jesus knew that lustful, pervy thoughts are at the root of human beings treating each other like objects rather than equals. And you know what, pretty much all of the world's problems boil down to that in one way or another. <br />The Bible directs us to ‘...take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.' (2 Corinthians 10: 5 NIV) It's saying that you need to police your mind-put dirty thoughts under arrest before they lead you to do something you might regret. Instead of giving in to your daydreams fill your mind with God's Word and visions of the amazing adventures He has in store for you. The Bible also says ‘Above all...guard your heart.' Policing your thoughts will also protect your emotions. Obsessing over someone God hasn't matched you with will only lead to heartache. When the time's right God will make sure you get introduced to the person He wants to use to bless your life spiritually, emotionally-and physically! ;-) So don't rush ahead, choose today to be fully committed to God. <br />SoulFood reading: Num 30:1 - 32:24, Mark 9:14-29, Ps 18:1-29, Pr 11:19-21</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'As iron sharpens iron, so a man sharpens...his friend'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 27:17 NKJV</span><br />You've seen him on YouTube. The weird busker bloke with a thousand instruments strapped to every orifice. A mouth organ wrapped round his gob, a bass drum by his size tens, a guitar nestled to his coat, and a pair of cymbals tied like a backpack. He calls it a one-man-band, but it sounds more like a loose fan-belt. Wouldn't he be just better off joining fellow loonies and forming a band? What if The Beatles was one strange bloke, chewing on a pasty, and banging out a racket with every available limb- how many albums would they have sold then? To make beautiful music, it's better to share out the instruments, share out the parts. Singer Bono said this:<br />'I would be terrified to be on my own as a solo singer...I surround myself with...a band...you're only as good as the arguments you get. So maybe the reason why the band hasn't split up is that people might get this: even though I'm only one quarter of U2, I'm more than I could be if I was one whole of something else.' Solomon says something similar: 'As iron sharpens iron, so a man sharpens...his friend' (Proverbs 27:17 NKJV). Don't you get it yet? There's something about coming together with other people, if we want to create something beautiful.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...Jesus showed Himself again to the disciples at the Sea.'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>John 21:1 NKJV</span><br />You've been trying, trying and trying but it's useless. It worked yesterday, but that was yesterday. We all know what that feels like, right? Well in today's story we meet the disciples having one of those days. Looking out at them faffing around in their little boat, Jesus shouts from the shore, ‘Cast the net on the right side of the boat...' (John 21: 6 NKJV) When they did, they caught so many fish their net was stretched to its limit. <br />Lesson #1: Often, God gives the breakthrough right at the end of your struggle. As long as you think you can do it on your own, He'll let you try. But when you run out of natural energy you discover it's ‘Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit says the Lord...' (Zechariah 4: 6 NKJV) <br />Lesson #2: He never takes His eye off you. The mists of early dawn meant they couldn't see Him, but He could see them. In spite of your disappointment and the frustration of your own efforts, you're never beyond His care-or His reach. <br />Lesson #3: He invites you to come and eat. Jesus already had a cooked breakfast waiting for the tired fishermen and invited them to join Him. He knew there's nothing more ‘spiritual' that a proper brekkie! It's the human life at its most basic-and most fantastic-beach, fire, mates, chilling, laughing. Bring it on, Jesus! <br />SoulFood reading: Ex 16:1-35, John 6:30-40</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘I want to know Christ...'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Philippians 3:10 NIV</span><br />What's the most impressively powerful thing on the planet? A rocket blasting off into space? A nuclear reactor exploding atoms deep underground? Paul writes: ‘I want to know Christ and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings.' Resurrection Power. The power that raised Jesus from the dead. That's truly impressive. Who else can do that! Think: what problem or need do you face that resurrection power can't handle? What's dead in your life that needs to be raised? So how can you touch this power without just melting or exploding in the process? The answer is right there, ‘That I may know Him.' When you make intimacy with Jesus your top priority, you tap into His power. <br />But a lot of us would like to put a full stop after the words, ‘The power of His resurrection.' If we do we're stuffed. If we're going to know Jesus intimately we must also know Him in ‘the fellowship of His sufferings.' Depressed yet? Yep, ‘sufferings' means more than just putting up with bad hay fever or having to share your room with your little sister. For Paul it meant being beaten up and locked in jail! But it all created a special kind of friendship with Jesus that's impossible any other way. Think about it, what kind of friend say, ‘I only want to share the good times with you, keep your suffering to yourself.' Getting the idea?]]></introtext>

<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Acts 13:22 NKJV</span><br />Ok, this is our last day on the life of David-a life that could be summed up in these words: ‘I love God supremely, and there's nothing He asks of me that I won't do.' Can you say that? <br />The Bible records, ‘These are the last words of David...' (2 Samuel 23:1 NLT) A man's last words are considered to be some of his most important words. So what will he talk about? Goliath, Saul, Samuel, Bathsheba, Solomon? No, listen: ‘...David, the man who was raised up so high, David, the man anointed by the God of Jacob, David, the sweet psalmist of Israel. ‘The Spirit of the Lord speaks through me; His words are upon my tongue. The God of Israel spoke. The Rock of Israel said to me: ‘The one who rules righteously, who rules in the fear of God, is like the light of morning at sunrise, like a morning without clouds, like the gleaming of the sun on new grass after rain.' ...God... made an everlasting covenant with me. His agreement is arranged and guaranteed in every detail. He will ensure my safety and success.' (2 Samuel 23:1-5 NLT). These words were recorded in Scripture for all of us who like David wish to be one after God's own heart. Like everybody, David finally died, but only after he had fully lived. Everyone dies but not everyone fully lives. Will you?<br />SoulFood reading: Num 27-29, Mark 9:1-13, Ps 67, Pr 11:16-18</p>]]></introtext>

<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Acts 2:42 NIV (2)</span><br />Does it irk you in some stores when some assistant reels off in your face, 'Have a nice day'. She couldn't care less whether your day consisted of being repeatedly poked in the eye with a burnt stick, she's just told to say it, because that's the company line. Not so fast though, perhaps we do the same with people at church. Have you ever said, 'I'll pray for you' knowing full well you won't, you just said it because that's the company line. Don't you think that person can tell the difference between the company line and somebody who is genuinely concerned for their welfare? Don't you think God knows the difference? When we commit ourselves to each other like the early church did, actions speak louder than words. We pray for someone, not out of duty or because it's on the job description, we do it because we feel their hurt, we want God's good in their situation, we love them as we love ourselves.<br />When a man and a woman commit themselves to each other in marriage, they're committing themselves to the bad times as well as the good, that's why we have the famous line, 'For richer, for poorer, for better, for worse'. What if we were to commit ourselves like that to the people God has placed in our church. For better or worse.

<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Acts 13:22 NKJV</span><br />The Bible says: ‘And David said with longing, ‘Oh, that someone would give me a drink of the water from the well of Bethlehem...' So the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines, drew water from the well...took it and brought it to David.' (2 Samuel 23:15-16 NKJV) What an amazing story! These 3 ‘commandos' risked their lives-for a glass of water! <br />(1) Are you ready to be someone like that? Do you have true loyalty to your leaders and your mates or are you only ‘in it for what you can get out of it'? No wonder David said, ‘I am a friend to anyone who fears You-anyone who obeys Your commandments.' (Psalm 119: 63 NLT)<br />(2) Will you refuse to settle for less than God's best? These men risked their lives to bring David a glass of precious water from the well in his home town. They didn't stop at any of the other wells on the way and then pretend it was ‘Bethlehem Spring'! Only the genuine article-the best of the best-would do for the king. <br />Think and pray about those 2 points for a while. Which one does God want to highlight to you today? Is there a situation in which He wants you to show extra courage or commitment? Is there an opportunity to do something with exceptional effort or excellence? Listen, hear, then do! <br />SoulFood reading: Num 25-26, Mark 8:27-38, Ps 62, Pr 11:15</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘If you bite and ravage each other, watch out-in no time at all you will be annihilating each other...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>GALATIANS 5:15 NIV</span> <br />You know what it's like; your ‘so called friend' says something or does something, so ‘bang out of order' that in an instant, you decide they are no longer your friend. Or your boyfriend/girlfriend goes from being your soul mate to a ‘so over mate' when they do or say something that makes you wonder what you ever saw in them in the first place! Aaggh! Well that's the way it's got to be right? You can't just let them humiliate you like that, you can't let them walk over you, you've got to stick up for yourself, and you don't care anyway, there's plenty more friends you can make, there's plenty other hunks/babes you can date...Right? Or is it?<br />God knows how people let us down and hurt us, which makes us, want to lash out. But God says ‘whoa hang on a minute! You keep lashing out at each other like that and it won't help you, it will destroy you!' We need to learn to fight right! Fight to make your relationships work - not end! Fight to do things God's way not your way! Jesus said, ‘...I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.' (John 10:10). So if you want to live your life to the max, want to get the very best out of life, then fight right!</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...I have found David...a man after My own heart...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Acts 13:22 NKJV</span><br />It's true that some of God's promises become reality quickly. It's great when that happens. Get in! But others, like the one God gave to David telling him he'd be king, have to be fought for. A tribal family called the Jebusites controlled Jerusalem (Zion); they taunted David saying, ‘You will not get in here...' (2 Samuel 5:6 NIV) They were pretty cocky coz they knew Jerusalem was on top of a big hill way above David's army. The only way up into the city was through a secret water passage where they had to wade and climb through pitch-black darkness. ‘Nevertheless, David captured the fortress of Zion...' (2 Samuel 5:7 NIV) Understand this: if He has to, God will bring you up through the gutter to get you to the throne! <br />Are you in a dark place today, hidden, out of view? Well, that doesn't mean you're not on your way to Zion. You can be steadily making progress towards your goal ready to burst onto the scene at any moment. Those Jebusites got a shock when David's men burst out as if from nowhere! So, when you're up to your neck in problems and the enemy is saying, ‘You won't make it,' stand on God's Word and remember David's victory in Jerusalem. God can show you how to use the situation you are facing for your good and His glory. <br />Today, go forward, knowing God is with you!<br />SoulFood reading: Num 22-24, Mark 8:14-26, Ps 57, Pr 11:14</p>]]></introtext>

<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Corinthians 13:5 NIV</span><br />A bad football team is a bit like an old bra. No cups and little support! OK, bad Dad joke alert, but perhaps there's a little wisdom in it for us, as a church. See, wherever there's a group of people bunched together, there's a team. Whether it's a State of Origin team of muscled, professional athletes or your church's mob including the dear old couple who always sit third row from the back; wherever there is people, there's a team. <br />Do you ever wonder whether there are days when AFL guys fight over the hair gel? Or whether our cricketers argue over the finer details of the 'predestination' theory (OK, that's probably a no). Whatever differences they may have in the dressing room, gets left behind when it comes to the real action on the field. They're fighting for a greater cause than themselves. Shouldn't that be the way in our church? Don't we have a greater fight on our hands than worrying over whether we sing a hymn with an organ or a song with a phat bass line? Top teams are made up of stars with strengths, and weaknesses. The trick is to cancel out weaknesses by playing to your strengths. What is the greatest strength of the church? LOVE!!! When we realise the game is not just about us, it's about others, we tap into the manager's top tactics. To win the cups, we need to support each other.<br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Cor 1-4, Luke 22:63-71, Ps 39 , Pr 21:9-13<br />]]></introtext>

<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Acts 13:22 NKJV</span><br />David knew Samuel, the famous man of God, was coming to his house looking for a king. But he hadn't been asked to line up to meet him. That hurt. So how did he respond? By sneakily asking somebody to put his name down on the guest list? No! David knew that nobody could keep God from blessing him so he sat tight. After a while it dawned on Samuel that somebody was missing. Listen: ‘...as David stood there among his brothers, Samuel took the flask of olive oil he had brought and anointed David...' (1Samuel 16:13 NLT) If you remain faithful, God will lift you up in the midst of those who put you down. But be prepared for trouble! Like Joseph's brothers, they'll lay traps thinking, ‘...we'll see what comes of his dreams.' (Genesis 37:20 NIV) Why would those who are supposed to love you say such a thing? Usually jealousy or self-preservation-they like to keep you in your place-below them! Be ready for a dose of rejection, especially when there's no evidence to prove your God-given dream. Check this out: even when David was ready to take on Goliath, his oldest brother called him arrogant and dissed him to his face. (1Samuel 17:28) Why did God put these stories in the Bible? ‘These things happened to them as examples and were written down as warnings for us...' (1 Corinthians 10:11 NIV)<br />SoulFood reading: Num 19-21, Mark 8:1-13, Ps 44:17-26, Pr 11:12-13</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...we were...chosen...'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ephesians 1:11 NIV</span><br />One of the impossible mysteries of God is how He can know all about our life and how it will unfold even though He has blessed us with free will to make whatever choices we want. It's mind boggling! The New Living Translation puts it this way: ‘Furthermore, because we are united with Christ, we have received an inheritance from God, for He chose us in advance, and He makes everything work out according to His plan.' Within that purpose God knows the things (and people!) you'll be attracted to and also the things (and people again!) that you'll want to run from! <br />When Jonah tried to run from God and go to Tarshish, God loved him too much to let him escape his destiny so He sent a storm to wreck the boat and get Jonah back on track. Jonah was squeezed into a desperate place of prayer and then God answered him, by sending him off to his original destination. And God loves you too; much too much to let you escape His plans for you. God has too much invested in you to let you get away. If you have to leave behind a relationship, or an addiction, or a selfish dream, you'll come. Why? Because the echo of God's voice deep in your heart will never go silent. <br />So, for your own good, make up your mind to follow Him today.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘I have found David...a man after My own heart.'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Acts 13:22 NKJV</span><br />David was chosen to be king in his teens, but he only made it to the throne at age thirty. There are lessons here: <br />(1) God calls the person. In spite of being unappreciated by his family and overlooked by the prophet Samuel, God picked David. He also picked Deborah to lead the nation in a male-dominated society. Stop trying to figure God out, and stop comparing yourself to others! ‘Does not the potter have the right to make out of the same lump of clay some pottery for noble purposes and some for common use?' (Romans 9:21 NIV). <br />(2) God decides the plan. ‘...He who has begun a good work in you will complete it...' (Philippians 1:6 NKJV) Who began it? So who should your confidence be in? God! God's plan for David involved years of ducking Saul's spears, living in caves with misfits who redefine the word ‘dysfunctional'. God trains you in a small sphere so you can handle a bigger one. <br />(3) God knows the span of time required. Endurance means standing firm under pressure. The Bible says we ‘inherit the promises' ‘through faith and patience.' (Colossians 1:11-12) That means being like Joseph who refused to let go of his dream; it's what helped him through all sorts of agro, including years of unjust imprisonment. But the day came when a whole Kingdom was handed to Joseph. So keep your eyes on the prize and don't give up!<br />SoulFood reading: Num 16-18, Mark 7:24-37, Ps 44:9-16, Pr 11:10-11</p>]]></introtext>

<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Luke 6:28 NIV</span><br />Has your mum or dad ever said 'If someone smacks you, smack 'em back'. And the award for bad parenting goes to....!<br />When somebody hurts you, you may want to hurt them back, twice as hard. But where does that get you? Does hurting them heal your wound? No. Does humiliating them make your humiliation any easier to stomach? No. What about holding a grudge? Who feels the weight of that? Them? Or you? Bitterness can pour salt into our gaping wounds. It takes control of our moods, it robs us of our joy, it kills our attitude, it destroys our relationships. So, what's the antidote for hurt? Forgiveness. 'Ah, but you don't know what I've been through' you say. Nobody ever said this 'forgiveness' business was going to be easy. It's not. That's why we need to tap into God's power through prayer. If you can't forgive somebody, start by praying, 'Lord, I can't forgive in my own, natural strength, help me to press into Your supernatural strength to forgive in this situation'. But why forgive at all? Jesus said, '...if you forgive men...your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive men...your Father will not forgive your sins' (Matthew 6:14-15 NIV).<br />Hard teaching, but Jesus was willing to back it up with His life. Even from the cross He prayed, 'Father, forgive them'. How about you?<br /><br />SoulFood: Gen 2:7-25. 1 Cor 15:39-55<br />

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...I have found David...a man after My own heart...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Acts 13:22 NKJV</span><br />There aren't many people in the Bible God describes as ‘a man after my own heart'-in fact there's just one: David! For that reason it's probably worth taking a good long look at his life-so we'll take the next few days to do that. We'll see that David had a humble start but it didn't stop him reaching dizzy heights. He began as a shepherd and ended up as a king! The chances of that happening were slim to none. In those days shepherds were so low on the ladder they couldn't even witness in a court of law; their word wasn't considered reliable; yet by age thirty he was wearing the crown. <br />But the story's not all success, during his forty years in leadership he experienced devastating failure. There are two lessons here: <br />(1) Don't rush to judgment. It is not over until God says it's over. David's story is a warning to the self-righteous, a testimony to the justice of God that won't allow us to escape our sin's consequences, and to His love that will never let go of us. <br />(2) God can bring good out of it. He can take every experience you've been through, both positive and negative, and make it work for good, either your good or the good of others. When you chase God's purposes in spite of your flaws, He makes ‘...all things work together for good...' (Romans 8:28 NKJV) <br />SoulFood reading: Num 14-15, Mark 7:14-23, Ps 44:1-8, Pr 11:9</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...You are one of them...your speech shows it.'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Mark 14:70 NKJV </span><br />You can hide who you are by changing your address, clothes and name-but how you speak will give you away every time. It happened to Peter. After Peter said he didn't know Jesus twice people said to him ‘&quot;...you are one of them...your speech shows it&quot;' (Mark 14:67-70 NKJV). So, to convince them that he wasn't a friend of Jesus, Peter ‘Began to curse and swear, &quot;I do not know this Man of whom you speak!&quot;' (Mark 14:71 NKJV). And it worked! With a mouth like that no one accused him of knowing Jesus again. Using bad language in any setting will make people question the quality of your relationship with Jesus. <br />Swearing is becoming more and more common amongst Christian young people and youth groups. People use arguments like ‘it doesn't matter that much' or ‘it stops people thinking we're geeks'. The bad news is, they're the world's worst arguments! You will be judged on your language by other people and swearing in front of non-Christians won't make them think you're a ‘cool' Christian, they'll just think you're a rubbish Christian. Paul says, ‘Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up...that it may benefit those who listen' (Ephesians 4:29 NIV). If you want to win people to Jesus, start with how you talk. Words are powerful things. They either build up or tear down, add to or take from. It's not important that people can tell from your accent where you're from, but when they can't tell by the way you talk that you know Jesus, something's seriously wrong.</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘Do your best to present yourself to God as one ... who correctly handles the word of truth'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Timothy 2:15 NIV</span><br />Ever go back upstairs to remind yourself of why you originally went downstairs? Well, just like our bodies don't work too well without proper exercise; neither do our minds! Doctors say that all those hours in front of the TV, avoiding mental stimulation, result in the shrinking of our mind's capacity, including our memory. ‘Brain fitness' experts assure us that our brains don't grow old from working too hard, but from hardly working at all! When you just let your mind ‘vegetate' and don't stretch it with deep reading, creative thinking or challenging conversation, it can become old-even when it's young! On the other hand, if you challenge your mind regularly, your brain stays young even as you get older. <br />Here's a great way to strengthen your mind: ‘Do your best to present yourself to God as one ... who correctly handles the word of truth.' Paul is telling Timothy to push his mind by studying God's Word. Paul didn't want Timothy's mind to turn into a vegetable! He knew that God promises those who feed on His Word daily will become ‘...like a tree planted by streams of water...which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither.' (Psalm 1:3 NIV) Don't let your mind ‘wither'; exercise and strengthen it by studying the Scriptures today!<br />SoulFood reading: Josh 1, Acts 3:1-21</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...The gift of God is eternal life...'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Romans 6:23 NIV</span><br />Ever feel 'there must be more to life than this?' Ever wondered what happens after you die? Do you long to get right with God? Your soul is hungry for the life Jesus can give you. Follow this:<br />Step 1: We've compiled a very long and sorry record as sinners and have proved that we are utterly incapable of living the glorious lives God wills for us. (see Romans 3:23). Face it, we need help from God to live right. <br />Step 2: If you sin your whole life then your pension payout is death. But God's gift is real life, eternal life, delivered by Jesus (see Romans 6:23). Jesus has bought you a ticket to life before and after death. He's paid for it by giving his life for you on the cross. <br />Step 3: God put His love on the line for us by offering his only Son in sacrificial death, even while we were still of no use whatever to him (see Romans 5:8). You can't buy the ticket off Him, all you need to do is accept the ticket as a gift from one friend to another. <br />Step 4: '&quot;...if you confess with your mouth, &quot;Jesus is Lord,&quot; and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved' (Romans 10:9 NIV).<br />Now pray these words: 'Lord Jesus, I'm sorry for trying to go it alone. I place You in charge now. By faith I receive Your ticket to life now and forever. Thank You for setting everything right between You and me, amen.'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘I looked, and I saw...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ezekiel 1:4 NIV</span><br />God gave Ezekiel some of the maddest visions any human eyes have ever seen. His book in the Old Testament (in between Lamentations and Daniel) is bursting with vision after vision-for 48 chapters! If you're serious about getting to know God through His Word, sooner or later you'll need to tackle books like this. The understanding won't come all at once-and you'll probably need quite a bit of help from Christian friends further down on the journey than you-but God wants to speak to you from every single page of His Word. None of it is just padding! <br />One of the special things about Ezekiel, like many of the ‘prophetic books' (including Revelation too), is that it is full of picture language-pictures that have meanings deeper than just the surface. Let's look at an example. In his first vision Ezekiel is shown four heavenly creatures: with four faces each! The face of a lion, the face of an eagle, the face of a man and the face of an ox. Can you guess what these faces might represent? Pause for a minute and think about it. If you can, then you're on your way to understanding the Bible on an even deeper level. <br />So what did you get? Well, the lion is a generally a sign of kingship, the eagle of vision, the man of intelligence and the ox symbolises strength in service. Still scared of those ‘prophetic books'? Nah! <br />SoulFood reading: Num 11-13, Mark 7:1-13, Ps 37:32-40, Pr 11:7-8</p>]]></introtext>

<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Philippians 2:3-4 NIV</span><br />People will often say that relationships are more important to them than anything else, but their actions don't show it. How about you? Relationships are living things and like any living thing if you don't feed and protect them, they will die. While things are going well we can take the people close to us for granted, then a crisis comes along to remind us how valuable the people in our lives are. <br />One author writes: ‘The Intensive Care waiting room is different from any other place in the world. And the people who wait are different. They can't do enough for each other. No one is rude. The distinctions of race and class melt away. The truckie loves his wife as much as the university professor loves his, and everyone understands this. Each person pulls for everyone else. In the Intensive Care waiting room the world changes. vanity and pretence vanish. The universe is focused on the doctor's next report. If only it will show improvement. Everyone knows that loving someone else is what life is all about. Could we learn to love like that, if we realised that every day of life, is like a day in the Intensive Care waiting room?'<br />The apostle Paul says, ‘...if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing' (1 Corinthians 13:2 NIV). He's absolutely right isn't he?!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...a Samaritan woman came to draw water...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>John 4:7 NIV</span><br />John tells us that, ‘When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, ‘Will you give me a drink?&quot; After five failed marriages her trust levels are demolished so she approaches Jesus cautiously. Brick by brick, Jesus takes down the wall she's hiding behind. When He gets through, she leaves transformed. There are (at least!) two big lessons in this story for us today: <br />(1) Christ sees potential in you when others don't. Jesus was forever winding up a bunch of religious people called ‘The Pharisees' who complained, saying, ‘This Man receives sinners and eats with them.' (Luke 15:2 NKJV) They were right! That's exactly the category this woman fitted into and yet she was the first person Jesus introduced Himself to as the Messiah. Why didn't He do that when He called His 12 disciples, baptised John, cleansed the temple, performed His first miracle or chatted to Nicodemus? Because Jesus doesn't measure you by your past, He measures you by your potential. <br />(2) Christ will change you, then use you to change others. She didn't mess about, they very same day she went off and started sharing about Jesus. She was the first person to ever preach the gospel in town! And ‘Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony...' (John 4:39 NIV) <br />Why don't you take a leaf out of her book and tell someone about Jesus today?<br />SoulFood reading: Num 8-10, Mark 6:45-56, Ps 37:25-31, Pr 11: 5-6</p>]]></introtext>

<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Isaiah 51:16 NIV<br /></span>The radio announcer says &quot;Call now if you can tell me...&quot; Next thing you know there's some bloke on the line who hasn't got a clue. The announcer is saying 'I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to hurry you for an answer' and he's going &quot;can you tell me the question again?&quot; Do you ever come across pushy people who pressure you for an answer, but you've not got no idea what to say? What about when your mate at school says &quot;How come if God is all loving and all powerful, so many people are starving in Africa?' Now, you know you've heard some really clever way you could answer this at Church once, but you'll be blowed if you can put it into words now, what do you say? Do you stand there like a stunned mullet with your mouth opening and shutting and no words or do you babble for the sake of saying something? Sometimes it's wise to wait, to say, 'I don't have the answer right now but I'll look into it'. <br />If you ask Him, God will tell you what to say and when to say it. His promise is: 'I have put my words in your mouth and covered you with the shadow of my hand...' (Isaiah 51:16 NIV). Your mate might yell 'Don't just stand there, say something' but Wisdom says, 'Don't just say something, stand there!'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...take up the whole armour of God...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ephesians 6:13 NKJV</span><br />Simon the Sorcerer was doing good business. The people ‘...followed him because he had amazed them for a long time with his magic.' (Acts 8:11 NIV) But to everyone's astonishment he chose to accept Paul's Gospel message and got baptised. Sadly though, before long, traces of his old ways emerged: he offered Paul money to buy the gift of the Holy Spirit! How did the apostle handle this? Simple! He confronted this flaky guy with the truth in Jesus name, saying: ‘Repent of this wickedness and pray to the Lord.' (Acts 8:22 NIV) You see, Paul knew something that every good pastor knows: when a new Christian starts turning back to their old ways you must quickly crack on and deal with it or they'll end up hurting themselves and other people too. Being fuzzy and soft in those moments helps no-one. <br />For all of us, whether disciples for 10 minutes or 10 years, the forces of evil around us are real; we can't just ignore them and hope they'll play nice or maybe just go away. To fight and win you must know what you are up against. There'll be times when you have to be decisive and draw a line saying, ‘That's it, the other side of this line is out of bounds for me now that I follow Jesus.' Do you need to draw or re-draw some lines around your life today?<br />SoulFood reading: Num 7, Mark 6:30-44, Ps 37:16-24, Pr 11:4</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...ABLE TO DO IMMEASURABLY MORE THAN ALL WE ASK OR IMAGINE...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>EPHESIANS 3:20 NIV</span> <br />How big is your vision? Do you even have a vision? Martin Luther King Jr famously declared in one of the best known speeches in history: ‘I have a dream'. Martin Luther King's dream was to see a future where blacks and whites would live together in harmony as equals. But Luther King's dream wasn't just a dream; a distant thought of ‘wouldn't it be nice if'. He devoted his whole life to promoting nonviolence and equal rights for everyone and as a result he did more to advance the cause of Black Americans than anyone else has ever done. <br />Martin Luther King's dream was a God-given dream. In a time where black people were not much better than slaves with hardly any legal rights, poor access to education, no right to be in authority, and no opportunity to have a normal job and provide for their families, surely Martin Luther King's dream was impossible? Well, he knew that the Bible says that God is able to do ‘more than we can ask or imagine'. But the verse doesn't stop there, here's the key part: ‘according to his great power which is at work in us.' This verse tells us that:<br />1) No matter how big we dream, God can do way more than the greatest thing we can even imagine<br />2) He won't just do it, he does it through us! Can you imagine what the world would look like if Martin Luther King woke up one day having had his dream and thought ‘that's nice, it'll never happen though' - turned over and went back to sleep?! If you don't have a dream or a vision, ask God for one today.</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘Let your light shine before men...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 5:16 NIV</span><br />Driving down the road a man is being tailgated by a woman who's in a hurry. He comes to an intersection and, as the light is turning yellow, he hits the brakes. The woman behind him goes ballistic. She blasts her horn, shouts out of the window and gestures with her finger. As she's ranting and raving someone taps on her window. To her horror she looks up and sees a policeman. He's not impressed and takes her to the station where she's searched, fingerprinted and put in a cell. After a couple of hours she's released and the arresting officer gives her her personal effects and says, ‘I'm very sorry for the mistake. I pulled up behind your car while you were blowing your horn and using ugly gestures and foul language. I noticed the &quot;What Would Jesus Do?&quot; sticker and the little fish sign stuck on the boot, so I naturally assumed you had stolen the car.' Obviously he was following a Christian who wasn't doing a very good job at following Christ.<br />The world is sick of people who wear WWJD wristbands, read fat Bibles in the canteen, sing along to worship songs on their iPods, but don't have the love of Jesus in their hearts. What's the answer? ‘Let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven.'<br />SoulFood reading: Num 4:34 - 6:27, Mark 6:14-29, Ps 37:8-15, Pr 11:3</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'To me...grace was given, to preach...the unfathomable riches of Christ.'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ephesians 3:8 NAS </span><br />If it's not, 'Kum-by-ya' it's 'Amazing Grace'. Anyone who can barely tune a guitar and strum a chord has probably tackled it. A song so famous, it must've just always existed, right? It fell from the sky one day and landed on a worship leader's fretboard, right? Actually, no. <br />John Newton showed no early signs for musical masterpieces. A rough sailor, in trouble with law, at odds with authority, and always the first to diss a Christian, he cared only for himself. One night, however, he woke to find his PJ's soaked with salt water, his boat was sinking fast, his life moments from ending, when he turned to the Lord, asking for forgiveness and new life in Christ. <br />The rest is musical history. The song Newton wrote about this episode in his life went a little like this: 'Amazing grace! How sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me! I once was lost but now am found, was blind but now I see. Through many dangers, toils and snares I have already come; 'tis grace hath brought me safe thus far and grace will lead me home.' How amazing is grace! How amazing is Jesus! Maybe, you feel a little like John, perhaps circumstances are drowning you at this moment. Take a note from Newton, remember, God's amazing grace is just a prayer away from rescuing you.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...when they were alone, He explained all things to His disciples.'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Mark 4:34 NKJV</span><br />S-T-R-E-S-S! Unless you're one of those one-in-a-million people who just breeze through life as if nothing at all is a problem you probably get hit by the ‘S' word every single day. You scuff your new shoes, the bus goes past and doesn't stop, the battery on your phone dies, next door's stupid dog starts barking in the night and wakes you up... nnnNNNGGG!!! <br />So if stress is part of our day how do we handle it? Mark's Gospel says, ‘When they were alone, [Jesus] explained all things to His disciples.' Just like He did with His disciples, there are things Jesus will reveal to you only when you get one-to-one with Him. He's not interested in shouting them at you over your busy schedule. No, you need to take responsibility for yourself and set aside time to study His Word and to pray. Jesus explained things to His disciples when they were alone, away from the busyness of ‘doing' ministry and the crowds and He'll do the same for you. <br />A minute of silence with God is more powerful than a whole week of words without Him. Bottom line: you need one-on-one time with God! Take some time out today to just be silent with Him; see how long you can listen for ;-) <br />SoulFood reading: Num 3:1 - 4:33, Mark 6:1-13, Ps 37:1-7, Pr 11:1-2</p>]]></introtext>

<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Timothy 3:16 NKJV</span><br />By December 29th all that's left of that massive tin of lollies your Gran brought round for Christmas are about a dozen of ‘nobody's favourite'; they're just sitting there in their wrappers. Who put them in there? They don't even have chocolate on! We all have our favourites; Minties, Strawberry Creams, Jelly Beans those crunchy ones in the blue wrapper. But be careful; don't go treating the Bible like a tin of lollies. You can't just pick the bits you like and leave out all the rest. To grow in your faith you need to take in all the different tastes of God's Word because ‘all Scripture is... profitable...' (2 Timothy 3:16 NKJV). To make a profit in business you have to know your business inside out, otherwise you'll soon be out of business. To get on in your Christian life, make it your business to know your Bible. <br />There's nothing like just setting aside half an hour to get into your Bible. Without it you won't be able to hear what God is saying to you. You'll always have to depend on somebody else. Imagine dealing with your mates on that basis, never bothering to listen to a word they say? How long do you think your friendships would last? The same is true with God, so put down your Word4U2day and open your Bible... now.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘Am I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God?...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Galatians 1:10 NIV</span><br />How much energy and emotion do you use up trying to change somebody else's opinion of you? Would you really feel so much better if they suddenly woke up tomorrow morning and decided you actually are ‘good looking / funny / intelligent / whatever' after all? Why base your worth on the opinions of those who are committed to putting you down? Let's face it, most of the people you've spent all that effort trying to impress, may never, ever, be impressed. So, why don't you make an agreement with God today to only see yourself the way He sees you: loved, unique, precious, forgiven, full of potential, destined for life in all its fullness. <br />If you're not willing to do that then really you're walking into a prison of your own making. Until you quit agreeing with those who've mistreated you or bowing to the events that crippled you emotionally, you'll stay stuck. This is what the apostle Paul was banging on about when he said, ‘Am I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? ... If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ.' He knew that to get on in life you have to interact with people without allowing yourself to be controlled by their moods or dominated by their opinions. All you need to know is that Jesus loves you unconditionally. So what else matters? <br />SoulFood reading: Num 1-2, Mark 5:31-43, Ps 2, Pr 10:30-32</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...&quot;All that the Lord has said will we do...&quot;'</h2>
<br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Exodus 24:7 NKJV</span><br />So you've bought your new recipe book. You're going to make the world's greatest 'Super-double-whipped-cream-marshmallow-chocolate delight'. You read the recipe five times over, you memorise it, discuss it with friends, you copy it out in a journal. What more do you need to do? The cake will bake itself, right? Of course not! It's no good merely studying the recipe! In order for the cake to rise, you need to act on the words on the page, apply what it says to reality. It's the same with God's Word. We can study it at church, we can memorise favourite verses, we can create amazing pictures in our journals, but at some point don't we need to act upon it? It's not theory, it's practical. 'Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says...the man who looks intently into the perfect law...not forgetting what he has heard, but doing it - he will be blessed in what he does' (James 1:22-25 NIV). If we think reading, knowing, and even believing God's Word is all there is to it, we end up with cake on our faces. God wants us to get the most out of life, He's not interested in us being 'Bible nerds' who can quote every scripture, He's interested in seeing His Word come to life in our lives.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...The Lord has taken away your sin...'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Samuel 12:13 NIV</span>
<p>Look, there's no point asking God for blessing when you're carrying around a sack full of unforgiveness you're not willing to let go of, or a sack full of arrogance you need to repent of. Jesus said, ‘...when you offer your gift to God at the altar, and you remember that your brother or sister has something against you, leave your gift there at the altar. Go and make peace with that person, and then come and offer your gift.' (Matthew 5:23-24 NCV) Get it sorted! Make things right with that person you need to forgive. Ask forgiveness from that person you've wounded. And what if the person isn't around any more? Then Bible says, ‘...confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed...' (James 5:16 NIV) Share the issue with someone trustworthy. You'll be surprised how amazing peace of mind can be found through the prayer and the presence of a godly friend. After King David committed a terrible sin he tried to cover his tracks with even greater crimes, but God wouldn't let David carry the guilt in private. He sent a prophet who cleverly cornered David into breaking his silence. Broken, he finally sought forgiveness, pouring out his heart. He then wrote Psalm 51 as his heartfelt prayer. If you have sin to sort out today, you really should take a look at it. <br />SoulFood reading: Isa 51:1-16, Mark 5:1-20</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'Be still before the LORD and wait patiently for him'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 37:7 ESV</span> <br />Waiting! Not many of us enjoy waiting do we? Waiting for the bus to come, school to finish, or even for the microwave to warm up our leftover pizza. We don't want to wait do we? It's hard. When we want something we want it NOW!!!. ‘Hurry up!' we shout at our friend who's late or the traffic lights. Just hurry up!! <br />It's Christmas Eve and everyone's waiting for Christmas Day. Are you one of those people who can't wait to see their presents so has already found them and even opened a few? It can be hard to wait. But the Bible tells us to ‘Be still before the LORD and wait patiently for Him'. Waiting for God patiently, not screaming at Him to hurry up but patiently waiting, being still; listening for God, not rushing ahead of Him.<br />It can be hard to wait! When we want something to happen and nothing is changing, it can be so tempting for us to try and make that change ourselves. <br />A major cause of car crashes here in Australia is people running red lights. They are in too much of a hurry to wait for the next green.<br />It's important to wait. Sometimes it's a matter of life and death. Ask God, today, to give you the patience to wait when you need to. To do things in His time not yours.</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...My words will by no means pass away.'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Mark 13:31 NKJV<br /></span>Some recipes just can't be improved upon. You don't melt a mars bar on top of fish and chips. You don't add curry sauce to a Big Mac. You don't do an ice cream any favours by dipping it in salt. They're all recipes that need no updating. The Word of God is the same. 'Heaven and earth will pass away, but My Words will by no means pass away.' When we eat the Word we get tried and tested, 100% pure perfection. No added preservatives or any of that junk. We get a diet that we know will do us good.<br />Joshua says: '&quot;Do not let this Book of the Law depart from your mouth; meditate on it day and night...do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful&quot;' (Joshua 1:8 NIV). In other words: Eat, drink and be merry. Note how he says 'meditate' on it. Meditation is when we allow our brains to have a good chew on God's word. Watch how your Alsatian can get the most out of his chewed up little bone, how much more can we get when we chew over God's wisdom. Note, also, the word, 'success'. Any athlete wishing for Olympic glory watches what they push through their face. Grant Hackett wouldn't get far on a kebab, and neither will you. To stay the distance you need regular helpings of the Word.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘Lord, if it's you...tell me...'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 14:28 NIV</span><br />One of the most famous Jesus-stories is the one when He walked on the water to His disciples in the boat. His mate Pete shouts out, ‘Lord, if it's you...tell me...' (Matthew 14:28 NIV). Jesus gave him one word, ‘Come,' and with that Pete hops over the side of the boat and starts walking! Was he scared? Wouldn't you be? Ice skating is hard enough but how the heck do you stand up when the water's still wet and wobbly! But Peter's desire was greater than his fear. And that's all you need to get started, a desire for God that's bigger than your doubts. <br />There's another detail in this story we should note: The disciples didn't exactly back Peter up in his surfing-without-a-surfboard experiment! So bear in mind that when God gives you a Word and you step out in response to it, not everybody will cheer and shout out encouragements. It's normal for you to want people to see what you see and believe what you believe. But if you're not careful, people's opinions will short-circuit your faith and make you doubt what God has said. God says: ‘I'm not going to confirm what I've told you through them. In fact, I don't even need them to agree with what I've spoken concerning you.' Relax. You may want your mates to back you up, but the truth is, Jesus is all you need!<br />]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...open your ears to the words of his mouth...'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Jeremiah 9:20 NIV</span><br />It may have been a sad day in the school tuck shop the day the Board decided 'healthy' was in and cream donuts were out...but here's the thing, it was done for your own benefit. We need to be careful what we digest. It's not just our stomachs either, we need to watch what we feed our brains. Our favourite mags may give us the lowdown on what's hot and what's not, but there's not enough substance there to sustain us. Our spiritual lives need a good dose of iron and all the right ingredients. We need to tuck into our Bibles for a healthy feed. It's a diet of a) POWER. Read Luke 4 to understand the power of Jesus' Word. It's a healthy tale of forces submitting to God's Word b) FORCE. '...by God's word the heavens existed and the earth was formed...' (2 Peter 3:5 NIV). God didn't call in the builders when He made the world, His Word alone was enough to create all that exists c) LIFE. 'The words I have spoken to you are spirit and they are life' (John 6:63 NIV). When you eat the Word of God, it can't just sit there and do nothing, it comes to life. It gets to work in you and starts to produce results. So don't just sit there drooling, tuck in, feed your face with the Word.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘He who guards his lips guards his life...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 13:3 NIV</span> <br />Paul Galvin's business had gone bust. He went to the auction of his own company, and with his last $750 he bought back the department which later became Motorola! He was ‘down' but definitely not ‘out!' ‘When times are good, be happy; but when times are bad, consider: God has made the one as well as the other. Therefore, a man cannot discover anything about his future.' (Ecclesiastes 7:14 NIV)<br />‘Good times' can be less helpful than ‘tough times'; and the ‘hard times' can be better for you than the ‘easy times'. Whatever changes and challenges come your way; whether planned or unexpected, whether you feel like you're going forward or sliding backwards - God is waiting for you to turn to him and know him. ‘If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives generously...' (James 1:5 NIV) ‘Ask and it will be given to you...' (Matthew 7:7 NIV). And there's more; God can make you a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17), give you strength (Isaiah 40:31), guide and comfort you (Psalm 23). ‘You will have to live with the consequences of everything you say'. Proverbs 18:20 reminds us that, for better or for worse, repeated actions create behaviours, behaviours create character and character creates a destiny. So make sure you are careful, with an attitude like the Israelites of Deuteronomy 11:18, and protect your life!</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'Give, and it will be given to you.' <br /></h2>
<br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Luke 6:38 NIV</span><br />Three reasons to hang on to your purse strings: 1) with the credit crunch in full bloom you'll need every penny you can get 2) it's a tight month you can always give a little next month 3) wait til you've landed that dream job with that dream salary, then give! <br />If you're not going to give, feel free to choose any of the above as your reason. For those of us, who want to give, feel free to choose one of the following: <br />1) When we give - we get! Jesus said, 'Give and it will be given to you...the measure you use...will be measured to you' (Luke 6:38 NIV). Test Jesus in this, put your money where his mouth is, see what happens. 2) We get back more than we give. If a bank lends you money, they whack a load of interest on top - so in effect, you always pay back way more than you borrowed. The Bible says when we give to the poor we lend to God (Proverbs 19:17). Imagine that- loaning to God! What kind of interest does God pay back? <br />3) We get into good habits. Giving is not just how the church raises its budget, it's how God raises His children. Parents want to raise their children to cultivate beautiful qualities such as: generosity. Our heavenly parent is no different. So, pick a reason!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...receive...the engrafted word...'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>James 1:21 KJV</span><br />Have you ever turned on the TV and caught a few minutes of any of those gardening programmes? Yes, it is a bit baffling how people can get so excited about borders and rockeries. But if you're going to understand some of the things in the Bible you'll need to know a bit about gardening; Eden, home of the first people is a pretty big clue that God is into gardens. <br />Today's verse is a gardening image. In some translations of the Bible the word ‘planted' is used but the original word is actually ‘grafted' or ‘engrafted' which is when a gardener carefully slices a branch off one tree and then transplants it into a hole he's made in a branch of another tree. From then on the branch that's been relocated starts receiving all its water and life from the new tree. <br />Now let's get creative, picture yourself reading your Bible, and as you do, those words from God are becoming attached to you, they start growing in you and producing fruit in your life. That's how God's Word works, and that's why you need to read it every day. As God's Word actually becomes part of who you are, you will find that it frees you from fear, lifts you when you're low, directs you the way to go, and gives you the strength to fight and win. <br />So, how do you feel about gardening now?]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'He cancelled the record...against us...by nailing it to [Christ's] cross.'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Colossians 2:14 NLT<br /></span>So what do you think of when you hear the words, 'criminal record'? Your Dad's 'Phil Collins' Greatest Hits collection'? A special certificate awarded to those who break the law? Or a long list of sins committed by your good self? <br />However good we may think we are, we're never good enough by 'holy' standards. So you might not be on par with some when it comes to dodgy dealings, but can you honestly say, 'I've never told a lie', 'I've never dissed someone behind their back', 'I've never in my darker moments wished someone would get run over by a bus'? The Bible says we've all fallen short of God's standards. We've all created our own list of sins, our own catalogue of wrongs, our own criminal record. So what is the sentence for all this rubbish? Community service? Probation? Life imprisonment? Actually, there's no way we could ever serve our sentence. How can imperfect creatures like us satisfy the holy perfect standards of God? The answer is we can't. But we know a Man who can! We know a Man who did. He's served our sentence for us. He's paid our bail. He's got us off the hook. His name is Jesus. When Jesus hung on the cross, a penalty was being paid. A death penalty. Our death penalty. Our criminal record was being wiped clean by the blood of the lamb. Er...praise to Jesus, anyone?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...he who invokes a blessing on himself...shall do so by saying, May the God of truth...bless me...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Isaiah 65:16 AMP</span> <br />Words are powerful things. From ‘God said' in creation, to God's Word being a sword in Ephesians 6:17. Words can change things big time. When Wally Lewis was being tackled as a five year old, or when Stephanie Rice was struggling down the swimming pool lane for the first time, did they give up? No! Read Isaiah 65:15, and you'll see that: a) you must rise above what others might say to you (in words or actions) b) there is power in what you say to yourself.<br />In a way, rising above what others say is the easier of those two points. Follow Lewis' and Rice's example, and filter those put downs from others. And then get tough on what about what you're saying to yourself; don't ever run yourself down. Instead read the Bible out loud to yourself and pray God's promises into your life. Go on; start now! The more time you spend hanging out with God and reading His love-letter to you, the more it'll change how you see the people and situations around you, and even how you view yourself. <br />Your mouth, your body and your brain are precious to God - so take care of them (check out 1 Corinthian 3:16 and Ephesians 4:29) and let God use them to take care of you.</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...in the morning I lay my requests before you and wait in expectation.'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 5:3 NIV</span><br />Start your day off smacking the snooze button on your alarm for the umpteenth time. When it doesn't stop buzzing in your brain, throw the wretched thing at the wall. Shout obscenities at your poor old Mum, when she does her best to wrestle the duvet off you. Burn your toast and spill juice down your school uniform as you scribble down bits of unfinished homework in between watching the telly and TXTing your mates. Start your day off like that and is it any wonder you're fit for a panic attack before you've even caught the school bus? The way we get up can set the mood for the rest of the day.<br />What if, tomorrow, you were to set your alarm 20 minutes earlier? What if, the first thing you did was say, 'Morning God, thanks for the night's sleep and thanks for a new day, help me find the beauty in this morning, and help me not embarrass myself or your name by my attitude today. Amen'. Try it. Note down any differences about your day. See if your worries are put into perspective. Can starting your day with God alter the way you close your day with God? <br />Tomorrow morning, sprinkle this Scripture on your cornflakes: ‘Satisfy us in the morning with your unfailing love, that we may sing for joy and be glad all our days (Psalm 90:14 NIV).

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘During the fourth watch of the night Jesus went out to them.'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 14:25 NIV</span><br />Night time is when God does some of His best work! It's mentioned in loads of Bible stories, like when the Israelites faced the Red Sea, ‘...all that night the LORD drove the sea back' (Exodus 14:21 NIV), also, during ‘the middle watch' of the night, Gideon defeated the Midianites (Judges 7:19-24), and let's not forget, Jesus rose from the dead before ‘daybreak' (Matthew 28:1). <br />Matthew says: ‘...in the fourth watch of the night He came to them, walking on the sea. When the disciples saw Him ...they were terrified...immediately Jesus spoke...&quot;Take courage, it is I; do not be afraid&quot;' (Matthew 14:25-27 NAS). The ‘fourth watch' mentioned here is from 3:00 am ‘til 6:00 am. Check these two things out: 1) Jesus waited until the storm was so bad that the disciples had lost all hope. That's because God decides the timetable for our rescue, and He's never late 2) the disciples didn't recognise Jesus until He shouted to them. Often the answer you need is right beside you, but you can't hear it because of all the other chaos you're paying attention to. <br />So now we know this what should we do with it? The answer is simply this: to know that in life there are dark times, guaranteed, but that doesn't matter one bit to God, ‘...to you; the night will shine like the day...' (Psalm 139:12 NIV). He's always ready and able to save.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...the wisdom that is from above is...peaceable...'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>James 3:17 NKJV</span><br />Peace, man, peace! When we think of 'peace', our heads might jump to a picture of a hippie as if the they copyrighted the word. But the Bible had a lot to say about peace long before those hemp wearing tree-huggers got a whiff of it. James 3:18 tells us that God's Word is 'sown in peace'. Colossians 3:15 tells us ‘Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace.' Even Jesus, himself, promises us, 'My peace I leave with you'. So, why the big deal? Because it's God's way. And what happens when we live God's way? We develop care and concern for others. We gain a kick in our step. We get passion and compassion for those in need. We want to bring peace to the places where there's destruction. <br />The world's way is to 'look after number one', God's way is to 'discover the beauty in everyone'. Do you know someone who seriously tests your patience? You know the type, they could turn Ghandi into the Karate Kid, they just have that knack of winding people up. Well, next time they're testing your peace, rather than hit back in retaliation, ask God to reveal their beauty to you, ask God to show to you how He sees them. Exercise self-control and keep your peace!<br /><br />SoulFood: Ezek 24:1 - 27:24, Luke 21:1-11, Ps 78:17-31,Pr 20:15-19<br />]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘Love others as much as you love yourself.'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 22:39 (CEV)</span> <br />Do you ever look around at everyone, and think they're so much better than you? Your mates have the looks of the cast of High School Musical, the charisma of Rove and are as funny as The Umbilical Brothers; whereas you feel like you have the looks of Shrek and the personality of a broom handle? Don't be so down on yourself! Not only are you being unfair to yourself, but with an attitude like that, you can't love others as God wants you to. You're the one person you can never get away from, so unless you learn to love and accept yourself, you'll probably end up miserable; which no-one wants. The devil loves any opportunities to ‘prowl[] around...looking for someone to devour' (1 Peter 5:8 NIV), so don't give him that pleasure by sitting around moping. Stamp on his head and tell him to get lost, and start to think positively about yourself! Read about what God has to say about you (Isaiah 43:4 is a good place to start). When you can see good stuff in you, that's evidence that God is at work in you. Yes, the Bible cautions us about having an over inflated opinion of ourselves - but don't go to the other extreme! Check out 2 Corinthians 4:7. Recognise God's treasure in you, and the potential you have, and run with it. Go on; love yourself!</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...whoever sows generously will also reap generously.'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Corinthians 9:6 NIV</span><br />So it's Saturday afternoon, you're in town and ready to throw some serious money at a shopping spree. You're within sight of the inviting mall entrance when you spy a Salvo between you and the door. You pause for a second, and then you decide to do the right thing. You boldly approach, open up your wallet to find, horror of horrors, the smallest thing you have is a 20! What do you do? a) tell him, you'll come back later, once you have change from your latest purchase b) laugh and say sorry mate, I've only got a 20 and I don't want to give you that much, I'll have to make a donation another time c) sow generously. Pull out your 20 and without hesitating put it into the tin and say ‘God bless the Salvos'. <br />When we sow generously, there is always a cost; if you were to part with your hard earned cash (like in option c, above), it may mean not being able to afford those 'to-die-for' jeans, but as we ditch one purchase we end up with the better buy. We buy the happiness of others and in return bless ourselves, because if we believe the word of God, 'whoever sows generously will also reap generously'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...I will put my laws in their hearts...'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Hebrews 10:16 NIV</span><br />Take a survey in the street and you will not find anyone who likes being called a dog. Yes, you might find plenty of pooch lovers but they won't appreciate you saying they might be a bit canine themselves! One of the amazing things about dogs is that they can understand human language; but only in a very limited way: Sit! Fetch! Heel! So if we're so much smarter than Rover and Fido why do so many of us have that sort of Christian life? Following Jesus gets reduced to: ‘Stop that; come back here; don't do that,' and don't forget the classics: ‘Read your Bible; pray; go to church; pay your tithes; witness.' Now, this is all stuff we should be doing, but God never meant us to do them at the end of a lead! <br />Let's listen to what the Bible says on the matter: ‘But now we have been released from the law, for we died to it and are no longer captive to its power. Now we can serve God, not in the old way of obeying the letter of the law, but in the new way of living in the Spirit.' (Rom 7:6 NLT) and repeats this again elsewhere saying: ‘...I will put my laws in their hearts...' (Heb 10:16 NIV). The point is quite clear: living life as a Christian is about changing first on the inside, the heart, so that works its way outside in your behaviour. Trying to keep to an external system of rules is a dog's life!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'The...many parts...form one body'</h2>
<br /><br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Corinthians 12:12 NIV</span><br /> Have you ever tried painting with your eyes closed, swimming without your legs, or having a conversation without opening your mouth? They're all possible, but really difficult! It's much easier to use your eyes, legs and mouth. But what does that have to do with 'church'?<br />Well, there may be people in your church that you struggle with, that you never speak to - maybe even avoid. Sometimes, you may think it's better if you don't even go to church, 'cos everyone's so different to you'.<br />This passage is saying that's not the way to go about it at all. Just like you work better, when your body is working together, and you don't isolate one bit, 'church' is the same. The Bible talks about us as all being different parts of the same body - and all the parts are important, and help things to be done better. So rather than trying to go it alone, you'll find life easier if you've got the other bits of the body to help you through it. You'll be helping others too - 'cos if you're not there, that means there's a bit missing for other people! Just as much as you need them, they need you - so don't be disheartened, but encouraged by church, and embrace all the differences that people have. God made us all that way for a reason, so that together we can do stuff well.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...you have taken off your old self...and have put on the new self...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Colossians 3:9-10 NIV</span> <br />Have you ever spent ages getting ready in the morning; slapping on that makeup, or spiking up your hair? Making sure you look the best you can, so you can impress that guy or girl that you fancy? I bet you wouldn't dream of letting them see you not looking your best; so why should it be any different with God? Don't settle for letting Him see you looking second best. Look in the mirror at the reflection of your heart and your mind and see what God sees. Ask yourself, are your attitudes and behaviours what you want God to be seeing? If not, then you need to think about changing them. How? By taking off the old, chucking it away, and putting on the new. Your focus each day must be to ‘Clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the sinful nature' (Romans 13:14 NIV). It's your choice, and only you can make that change. He's not going to force you to. <br />The devil ain't gonna like you making that change, and he's gonna do what he can to stop you; so expect it to be tough, but stick with it. That's why you need to get on your knees and ask God to help you keep off those old ‘clothes', and stick with the new.</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...shine like stars in the universe'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Philippians 2:15 NIV</span><br />Have you ever had a really bad day? All you want to do is have a go at everyone, to make them feel as bad as you do?<br />Here, Paul says 'DON'T!' Don't try to drag others down just because you're feeling manky. Instead, build them up. Even though it's really hard, try and be positive. Remember, no matter how bad your day is, you've got a message of life; eternal life. That message isn't just for you, you know; it's for everyone. And it's your job to help share that message, to make sure that everyone gets a chance to hear it and choose how they're going to respond to it. You can't get away with thinking that it's your mates' job, or expecting your youth leader to tell everyone. Not even your pastor will do it for you. It's your job. Yours. And what's one of the best ways to do that, to show others what God can do for them? By standing out from the crowd. Not for being grumpy, but for being positive. By shining like a star, being the light in the darkness. The message of God is a message of hope. Today, why don't you try and be positive to those around you, and share with them the best news in the world! No-one else can make you shine; only you can do it, with God helping you.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘Each of you must bring a gift in proportion to the way the LORD your God has blessed you.'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Deuteronomy 16:17 (NIV)</span><br />The award-winning film Schindler's List, is the story of one man's efforts to bring hope in a desperate situation. As the boss of a factory in Germany, Oskar Schindler decides to use his position to save lives. By employing Jews from the concentration camp in his factory, Oskar rescues them from the gas chambers. But it's expensive, so he starts selling his personal possessions in order to keep the business afloat. <br />At the end of the story the Nazis are defeated and the full impact of Oskar's effort is revealed as the dead are counted and the living stagger back to freedom. But kneeling by the railway tracks that carried thousands of Jews to their death, Oskar realises he could have saved more. Overwhelmed with regret, he thinks of the few goods still remaining in his possession; what else could he have sold to save a life? But it was too late. Yes, Schindler was a hero. But interestingly, all he could think about was what he didn't do. He wished he had done more. <br />We learn a powerful lesson about giving from this man; if even generous givers look back on their lives and wish they'd done more what about those who never gave at all, or gave less than they could, what will say when they stand before God?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'The Lord turn his face toward you and give you peace.'</h2>
<br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Numbers 6:26 NIV<br /></span>There's a story of a little boy whose mum died. Every night he toddled into his dad's room to ask if he could sleep with him. Only when his father promised to sleep with his face turned towards him, did the little guy feel safe enough to doze off. He needed to know his dad was looking out for him. When we're struggling, we need to remember that God is looking out for us, His face is towards us. It's not just when we're struggling either, but God watches over us, guides and protects us 24:7. How awesome is that?!<br />The most common promise in the Bible is, '...I will be with you...' (Joshua 1:5 NKJV). God made that promise to Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Sarah, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Mary and Paul; quite a list! And that promise kept them going through the stickiest of situations! David said, 'Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me...' (Psalm 23:4 NIV). God used all sorts of ways to remind His people He was with them constantly; from the manna in the wilderness to the pillar of cloud and fire that went before them. How is God reminding you He's with you today? Remember, 'Do not be terrified; do not be discouraged...the Lord...will be with you' (Joshua 1:9 NIV). Be at peace; your Heavenly Father is looking out for you!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘Bring...(the whole tenth of your income)...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Malachi 3:10 AMP</span> <br />Before you skip today's reading thinking it's not for you, just stop and think. Do you get pocket money or an allowance, ever get paid to babysit your little sister, do odd jobs around the house, or have a Saturday job? Yes? Then this IS for you. No? Read it anyway, ‘cos one day soon it will be!<br />‘Tithing' means giving God back some of your money. How's that fair, ‘cos it's your money isn't it? Well, no, not really! Everything we have is ours thanks to God. He gives us everything we need. The Bible says we should give back at least 10%; which may seem a lot, but just remember, it was His to start with! We're also told to give the first 10%; that means before anything else, not after you've got that new top or DVD you've been wanting for ages!<br />Giving God the first tenth of whatever ‘income' you have shows Him that He's first in your life. God promises two things to those who tithe: His blessing and His protection. By tithing, you're partnering with God. He'll bless you back more than you could ever bless Him, and He'll protect you when the devil tries to attack you financially.<br />So get into good habits now; it'll make it much easier to stick to in the future.</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'Then he consecrated Jesse and his sons...'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Samuel 16:5 NKJV<br /></span>Back in the good old days of Bible times, the people of Israel were always scrapping with the neighbouring nations. David's seven brothers were all in the army but none of them would fight Goliath; why? Three reasons:<br />1) They let the fear of others get to them. Fear is more contagious than the 'flu. If you listen to it long enough you'll get infected. Listening to Goliath and his scare tactics wore down David's brothers. Who are you listening to? Get God's opinion, build your life around it and let His Word to settle every issue. <br />2) They didn't have a personal track record with God to rely on. David's little battles prepared him for the big ones. He killed a big lion as a boy, a bigger bear later, and Goliath was massive. Was he freaked out by it? No. Listen: 'The Lord, who delivered me from the paw of the lion and...the bear...will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine' (1 Samuel 17:37 NKJV). He relied on his ‘God moments' from the past, and you can do the same. <br />3) They may have been fit, but they weren't going for God. You've heard the phrase 'don't judge a book by its cover' - well, people might, but God doesn't. He goes straight to the heart (1 Samuel 16:7 NKJV). David's heart was moulded by years of spending time with God. Can you say that too?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘When you enter a house, first say, &quot;Peace to this house.&quot;'</h2>
<span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Luke 10:5 NIV<br /></span>The neighbours are holding big party, the music's pumping, (some tune from the last century) and it starting to sound like the maddest night of the year. People are going nuts; and probably sadly going to end up in a right state. But what are those people like the morning after? (If you're reading this and it's still before 10 o'clock you might want to sneak out and have a look) It is deathly quiet. There's hardly anyone around. It's probably the most peaceful morning you've enjoyed all year. <br />When Jesus sent out 72 of His followers to go and take the good news of salvation to the towns of Galilee He told them to find a ‘person of peace' and stay at their house, saying ‘Peace to this house'. But what did He mean? Did He just want the disciples to have a nice, quiet place to stay? Well, to understand what He meant we need a deeper understanding of the word ‘peace'. In Hebrew it is ‘shalom' which is a deep emotional word meaning ‘Nothing missing, nothing broken'. It is about wholeness, completeness, wellbeing. That's what Jesus was all about; bringing God's shalom to a broken and hurting world. <br />And just like He sent out the 72, He wants to send you too. Will you be one of His shalom-bringers this year? <br />]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Philippians 3:14NIV</span><br />Did you watch any of last Olympics? Thousands of people meeting together, trying desperately to be the best and win the gold medal. Now, do you think that any of the people who actually won gold just turned up on the day with no planning? Did they just wake up and decide they fancied winning a medal that day? Of course not! Your relationship with God is a bit like a race, so follow these key tips to help you get it right: <br />1) Be prepared. Make sure you know your race, and know your prize. <br />2) Good foundations lead to good results. You won't get there without training, and doing your homework on what obstacles you might come across. <br />3) Being 100% fit gives you the best head start. No athlete would go into a race without being fit for it, so exercise in your bible reading and praying. <br />4) Keep your eye on the goal. Focus on your prize; an eternity with Jesus. Watch a sprint race on TV; all the athletes are so focused on the finish line that nothing distracts them from getting there.<br />It might feel like those around you are running a different route, or following a different training programme. You may even feel you're in the wrong race sometimes. Don't let that distract you from God's plan for you. Stay close to Him, know your race, focus on the prize; and you'll get the gold.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>But I the LORD will speak what I will, ...I will fulfil whatever I say</h2>
<span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ezekiel 12:25 NIV</span> <br />It was either the most astounding coincidence, or an act of God; literally. The small Methodist Church needed a new building, so when somebody donated a piece of land they accepted. It was low-lying land so they constructed a wooden church and put it up on brick pilings. Days later a storm lashed the town and the locals witnessed something amazing. The church building, still intact, was afloat! The flood had lifted it off its pilings and sent it down the road. At the town centre, as dozens of people watched helplessly, it made a sharp, inexplicable right turn and continued on. Finally, in the same decisive manner it veered off the road, it headed straight for a vacant lot and stopped dead in the centre! The flood waters eventually receded but the building is still there. In fact, 130 years have passed since the church, now called Providence Methodist Church, floated itself to the most desirable location in town. What’s amazing is this: The lot where it settled had <em>originally</em> been the congregation’s first choice for their building, but landowner Sam Sadler turned them down. The morning after the flood, he presented the pastor with the deeds to the land! ‘For I am the Lord. I speak, and the word which I speak will come to pass’. No doubt about it; when God makes up His mind, <em>nothing</em> gets in His way!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…God planted a garden…there He put the man whom He had formed.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Genesis 2:8 NKJV</span><br />Before God put Adam into the garden, He ‘formed’ him.God knows where he wants you (remember yesterday?) and how he wants to use you. Maybe He’s told you about it, but now you’re frustrated because it’s not happening yet. There’s a process of preparation God takes us through, but preparation takes time. God must deal with our inconsistencies, personality defects, areas of distrust, and a sackful of other stuff. How long does it take? Only God knows. The Bible says the Lord ‘formed man out of the dust of the ground’ (Genesis 2:7 NKJV). What is God working with? Dirt! And the tools He uses to form you are the experiences you go through in life. They shape and alter you. And the more you keep trying to have it your way, the longer the process takes. It may take you five years to learn to stop people-pleasing, or ten years to stop feeling sorry for yourself, or twenty years to stop going back and reliving your childhood. All the while God is telling you, ‘Stop it,’ and you’re saying, ‘Yeah, I know. I’m gonna do better.’ Then finally a crisis happens and the truth hits you. You need to change. At that point you say, ‘You know what? I’m going to forget those things which are behind and start reaching for those things which are before’ (Philippians 3:13). Why wait?]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>God planted a garden…there He put the man whom He had formed. </h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Genesis 2:8 NKJV </span><br />It’s pretty likely that gardening programmes aren’t filling up your sky+ hard-drive so let’s deal with the basics: what does it mean to plant? Technically it is ‘To bury seeds beyond human view so that they germinate and eventually produce fruit.’ (you did know that, right?) Now think of the Creator of the universe, as He stoops down and plants blessings and opportunities to grow in your life. Can’t see the blessings or opportunities? If you walk out into a field (ok, you might not do that often but use your imagination) and don’t see a crop, it doesn’t mean the seeds aren’t there; God has planted things in your life that will spring out of the dirt at different times. Everything God has for you hasn’t come up yet, so don’t give up, or walk away and say, ‘That’s all there is’. There are talents in you that haven’t been discovered and dreams that haven’t been fulfilled. That’s what the battle is about! The Devil is fighting you over your destiny. He knows good stuff is planted in you and he’s trying to kill the seed. Don’t let him. You’re not the person you’ll be six months or six years from now, because there’s a time factor; everything doesn’t come to harvest at the same time. You have to have <em>faith</em> and <em>patience</em>; otherwise you’ll miss what God has for you.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>God planted a garden…there He put the man whom He had formed.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Genesis 2:8 NKJV<br /></span>Do your parents ever watch ‘<em>Location Location Location’</em> on TV? In the programme, people talk about moving to find their perfect home in the perfect location! Notice in the verse, God <em>placed</em> the man in the garden, ‘eastward in Eden’ (Genesis 2:8 NKJV). It’s not enough to be in the garden, you’ve got to be in the right location. That doesn’t have to mean the school you go to or the house you live in (those things might be out of your control) but it might mean what group of mates you hang out with, or if you join the worship team at church, or if sign up for that mission week. God has a plan so ask Him to place you in the locations, relationships and opportunities that are perfect for you. Remember, God doesn’t want to dump you, drop you or shove you somewhere, He wants to <em>place</em> you. Ever played chess with someone who spends ages thinking about his or her next move? They pick up the queen slowly place it on a square, keep their finger on for a moment and then finally sit back. It was thought through- it was placed! God knows what He is doing! It’s easy to drift into your future but instead go to God, who will place you. If He places you somewhere you know it’s in the plan.]]></introtext>

<span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Genesis 2:8 NKJV<br /></span>Some restaurants and hotels buy plastic plants; you know, a few flowers on a table or a tree in a lobby, and they never need watering or pruning! Yes, plastic plants are hassle free but they’re fake; they have no life! God doesn’t want your relationship with Him to just LOOK like the real thing, He’s not into plastic Christianity, but if you don’t want a fake life with God it will take a bit of work. The Bible says: ‘God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it’ (Genesis 2:15 NIV). Today God may be saying to you, ‘I’ve prepared you, placed you where you need to be, planted blessings in your life that are scheduled to come up at different times, but now you’ve got to work it.’ God may have placed you in a church or group of people; that doesn’t mean they won’t wind you up. God might have planted opportunities in your life; that doesn’t mean making the most of them isn’t hard work. No one likes being formed and prepared, especially if that means we have to change! It takes time, but it’s worth it. In our comfort obsessed culture we can forget that what is easiest isn’t always best. Don’t expect <em>God</em> to do things He’s expecting <em>you</em> to do- Get to work!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>...a prudent man gives thought to his steps.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 14:15 NIV<br /></span>If you’re still making the same mistakes you were last year, you need to ask God for wisdom. ‘Everyone with good sense wants to learn’ (Proverbs 18:15 CEV). Think about it- you are where you are today because of decisions you’ve made in the past. Both good and bad. If you want to change your future, learn to make better decisions: a) never make permanent decisions based on temporary circumstances. If you do, you’ll regret it b) don’t let your emotions take over. Pray, weigh things carefully looking at all the fact not just feelings c) surround yourself with People who will tell you the truth; even when you don’t want to hear it d) take the time to consider all options. What looks good to you today, may not look so good tomorrow e) consider the consequences of each action. Ask yourself, ‘Am I ready to handle this right now?’ f) be realistic. If you can’t count, don’t apply for a job in the finance office. If you can’t sing, don’t record an album. Focus on what God gifted you to do. That’s where you’ll succeed g) time is your most limited and valuable resource. Don’t waste it h) allow yourself a 10% risk of being wrong, a 50% likelihood of betrayal, and a 100% commitment to trust God, go forward and survive it all.]]></introtext>

It’s a gruelling test of heart, mind and body. She knew she wasn’t going get an amazing time she just wanted to finish the race; to say she did it! And it wasn’t easy! As she ran huge blisters developed on her feet. She was hit and injured by a bicycle. Several miles short of the finish line she was utterly exhausted, yet she kept going. Then within a few hundred yards of her goal, late at night when most other runners had finished or dropped out, she fell and lay flat on her face too tired to get up. But her friends put a bit of tape across the finish line and began to cheer her on. She lifted her head, saw the tape and realised her goal was within sight. With supreme effort she got back up, and with a burst of energy dredged up from deep within her, ran the last few metres.’]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>I judge only as I hear….</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>John 5:30 NIV<br /></span>Ever wonder why Jesus was always on form and knew what to do? He tells us: Jesus gave them this answer: ‘I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does. For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does.’ (John 5:19-20 NIV) and ‘By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me.’ (John 5:30 NIV). Here’s the secret, Jesus didn’t just <em>talk</em> to His Dad, He took time to <em>listen</em> and get instructions. Your parents might say that you never listen to them and they are chatting away right in your ear; so how do you do when it comes to listening to your heavenly Dad? It’s not easy, but when the Bible says, ‘Pray without ceasing’ (1 Thessalonians 5:17), it means we are to stay in touch with God at all times, to be spiritually sensitive and attuned to the still small voice of His Spirit within us. That calls for having an uncluttered mind and heart. It’s easy to tell God what we want but what does He want? God designed the plan for your life; so today, why not get quiet before Him, so that He can tell you about it?]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…the blood…cleanses us from all sin.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 John 1:7 NKJV<br /></span>John writes: ‘But if we live in the light, as God does, we share in life with each other. And the blood of his Son Jesus washes all our sins away.’ He gives us three ways to shine! <br />1) <em>By living in the light</em>. Live life bright! If you are hiding stuff or hoping your Mum doesn’t find out, then you are living in the shadows not the light! <br />2) <em>By sharing life with each other.</em> Other people can inspire you to reach higher, tell you when you’re out of line and help you when stuff is tough. Make sure you have people who are a bit older and a bit wiser who you are 100% honest with and will be 100% honest with you even when you don’t what to hear it!<br />3) <em>By dealing with your sin right away</em> the moment you know you’ve messed up then make sure you ‘fess up. Jesus died to deal with that sin, sort it with God and hold on to the forgiveness He gives you. Get it sorted then get up and go on with God; don’t wallow in self-condemnation. <br />God has put everything in you to blaze brightly in like a star. He’s given you friends, family and leaders to draw out the best in you and the blood of Jesus to cleanse your heart. So what’s stopping you! LIVE IN THE LIGHT!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…Jesus…made Himself nothing...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Philippians 2:5-7 NIV</span><br />The story is told of an ambitious student at a top notch uni. Just before entering his final year he met an old hippy who said, ‘Your idea of happiness is to work around the clock, to study so you can get a better grade than the next guy. That’s not how you’re supposed to live. Come discover peace, man.’ Before you know it the student had called his parents and told them he was dropping out of uni to live in a hippy commune. Six months later they received a letter: ‘Dear Mum and Dad, I know you were upset about my decision. But I’ve changed! I have peace. Here there’s no competing, no trying to get ahead of anyone. This way of life is so in harmony with my inner self, that in only six months I’ve become the number two disciple in the entire commune. And I think I can be number one by June.’ Hello! Listen, competition hardly ever leads to serving but often leads to <em>striving</em>! <br />The disciples had started arguing about who would be the greatest in His kingdom. Jesus listened, then He picked up a towel and a basin of water and began to wash their feet. When He finished they were speechless, their hearts exposed, their attitudes corrected. ‘Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus (who) made himself nothing.’ Bottom line: serve, don’t strive!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…Think on these things.</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Philippians 4:8 KJV<br /></span>Your ability to succeed in life often comes down to a single choice: how you react to what has been done to you in the past, or is being done to you right now. Dr Viktor Frankl endured the Holocaust by this principle. The Nazis killed his family, placed him in a concentration camp, starved and beat him. When the war ended Frankl was neither broken nor bitter. When asked how he endured such treatment with a positive outlook he said, ‘Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of human freedoms, to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.’<br />Listen to the attitude God’s Word calls us to adopt: ‘I'd say you'll do best by filling your minds and meditating on things true, noble, reputable, authentic, compelling, gracious; the best, not the worst; the beautiful, not the ugly; things to praise, not things to curse’ (Philippians 4:8)<br />Every day you choose the clothes you wear, the food you eat, and the attitude you adopt. And there are only two kinds of attitudes; good ones and bad ones. A good attitude is the one the Psalmist adopted when he woke up each morning: ‘This is the day the Lord has made; we will rejoice and be glad in it’ (Psalms 118:24 NKJV). Make that your attitude too!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>He provided redemption for his people...</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 111:9 NIV<br /></span>You’ve seen it in the movies; the kidnappers trap the billionaire’s son, and send a ransom note: ‘give us 10 million or never see your son again’. The word <em>redeemed</em>, which gets used in church in songs and stuff means this: TO BUY BACK. If the billionaire paid up, he has redeemed his child. He has paid the price to get back what was his in the first place. In the movies the hero normally crashes through a window and rescues the kid, but the in the Bible the hero is also the redeemer. The hero pays the price to get us back to God. Have you ever thought of <em>yourself</em> as somebody who needs to be redeemed or bought back? The Bible says our selfishness and sin caused us to fall into ‘…the trap of the devil…held captive to do his will’ (2 Timothy 2:26 NIV). Getting back to God, your rightful owner, could only come through redemption and that’s exactly what God did! ‘For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life’ (John 3:16 NIV). Christ’s death on the cross was the price of your redemption, your ransom; <em>that’s</em> how much God values you! A Christian simply is someone knows they needed rescuing. If you’ve never asked God to rescue you, you can do it today; what’s stopping you?]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him…</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>James 2:23 NIV<br /></span>Old Abe; He lived about 4000 years ago and was pretty comfy with his well-to-do family in a big buzzing city. One day he heard God calling him to pack his tent and sleeping bag and head off somewhere new. Cool! Except God didn’t say where! But Abraham wasn’t thick, he knew that searching for God’s ‘somewhere’ was better than settling for the world’s ‘anywhere’. Abraham is an example of faith at its finest. The Bible calls believing what God says ‘FAITH’ and says Abraham’s faith was so great that; it was credited to him’. Just like you need credit to make your mobile phone work, God accepted Abraham’s faith as credit to make his life work. <br />Are you feeling today as if your life is low on credit? Have you started accepting the world’s ‘anywhere’ rather than God’s ‘somewhere’? Choose to believe God and take the example of Abe; his faith had to stand many tests: a) when he left his family and country, he didn’t have a clue where God was taking him b) he wasn’t a real hard nut but he fought the enemy to save his family c) he believed for a son, even when he and his wife were well too old for all that making babies stuff! <br />So keep believing God and don’t run out of credit.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Carry each other’s burdens…</h2><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Galatians 6:2 NIV<br /></span>The Bible says we’re a body with different parts doing different jobs. Instead of gazing at our own belly-buttons we should be looking at how we can help each other, just like the soldier in this story...‘I noticed a guy out of sync. A big, raw-boned redhead named Sanderson. His legs were pumping but he was out of step with the rest of us. His head began to loll from side to side. He was close to losing it. Without missing a step the ranger on Sanderson’s right reached over and took his rifle. Now one of the rangers was packing two weapons. The big redhead did better for a time. But then, while the platoon kept moving, his jaw became slack, his eyes glazed and his legs pushed like pistons. Soon his head began to sway again. This time the ranger on the left reached over, removed Sanderson’s helmet, tucked it under his own arm and continued to run. Our boots thudded along the dirt trail in heavy unison. Thud, thud, thud! But Sanderson was hurting ; really hurting. He was buckling, going down. But no, two soldiers behind him lifted the pack off his back, each taking a shoulder strap in his free hand. Sanderson gathered his remaining strength, squared his shoulders and the platoon continued to run; all the way to the finish line.’ Whose load can you help to carry today?]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'…we are the clay, and You our potter…'</h2>
<span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Isaiah 64:8 NKJV<br /></span>Imagine a beautiful china teacup saying: ‘I wasn’t always like this. There was a time when I was just a cold, hard lump of clay. One day the potter picked me up and said, “I could do something with this.” Then he started to put pressure on me and change my shape. I said, “What are you doing? That hurts. Stop!” But he said, “Not yet.” Then he put me on a wheel and began to spin me around and around until I shouted, “Let me off.” He replied, “Not yet.” Then he shaped me into a cup and put me in a hot oven. I cried, “Let me out of here, I’m suffocating.” But he looked at me and said, “Not yet.” When he took me out, I thought his work on me was over, but then he started to paint me, then I was back in the oven, it was so hot! Then I he put me on shelf till I thought he’d forgotten me. Eventually I saw what had happened; I had become a beautiful teacup.’ There are things going on in your life today that you don’t understand. When you finally get to the place God wants you to be, you’ll realise that He has been making you into a vessel He can use, bless, and use to bless others. So, allow God to shape you!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...I will...heal your wounds...'</h2>
<span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Jeremiah 30:17 NIV</span>
<p>Addressing students at Virginia Tech after a shooting rampage that left 32 of their fellow students dead, Philip Yancey said: ‘You've heard, &quot;Things will get better, you'll get past this.&quot; Those who offer such comfort mean well, and what you feel now you won't always feel...Yet you're a different person because of that day. When three of my friends died I came across these lines: &quot;Grief melts away like snow in May,&quot;... It did melt away, but like snow it came back in fierce, unexpected ways, triggered by a sound, a smell, a fragment of memory.'<br />Yancey, who was recovering at the time from a car crash continued, ‘Pain is a sign of life and love. I'm wearing a neck brace because I broke my neck in an accident. The doctor kept asking, &quot;Does this hurt? Can you feel that?&quot; The answer he desperately wanted was, &quot;Yes, it hurts, I can feel it&quot;; proof that my spinal cord hadn't been severed. Pain offers proof of life, of connection. In deep wounds two kinds of tissue must heal: connective tissue, plus the outer protective tissue. If the outer protective tissue heals too quickly the inner connective tissue won't heal properly, leading to complications later.' <br />Real healing takes time; it takes place where God's presence, God's peace, and God's people are. Are you hurting today? Turn to God. His promise to you is ‘I will...heal your wounds.'</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...Let us go into the house of the Lord.'</h2>
<span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 122:1 NIV</span>
<p>What's your reason for not going to church? Before you answer, read Ten Reasons Why I Never Wash! <br />1) I was forced to wash as a child 2) people who wash are all hypocrites; they think they are cleaner than everyone else 3) there are so many different kinds of soap; I just can't decide which one is best for me 4) I used to wash, but I got bored and stopped doing it 5) I only wash on special occasions like Christmas and Easter 6) none of my friends wash 7) I'll start washing when I get older and dirtier 8) I don't have time to wash 9) the bathroom is never warm enough in winter or cool enough in summer 10) the people who make soap are only after your money! Sound familiar?<br />Watchman Nee, who went to prison for going to church in China says, ‘Alone I cannot serve the Lord effectively, and he will spare no pains to teach me this. He will bring things to an end, allowing doors to close and leaving me effectively knocking my head against a wall until I realise that I need the help of the body, as well as of the Lord.' We need church; you'll find a spiritual family to belong to, a faith to live by, and a focus that gets your eyes where they should be; on Jesus!</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...you will forget the shame of your youth...'</h2>
<br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Isaiah 54:4 NKJV</span> <br />Parents have 1001 ways of embarrassing their teenagers. It just comes naturally to them! The worst of them all is reserved for that special occasion when you bring your boyfriend or girlfriend round for the first time. It's all going really nicely and then it happens: ‘Ooh, I bet you'd like to see some old pictures of...' ...and you can insert your name at the end of that sentence. The family photo album comes out and you wish the ground would swallow you up. <br />The scary thing is, you've now entered a stage of life when for lots and lots of people, really big mistakes are made, really bad choices leading to all sorts of mess. Are you going to be a casualty or will you get through to adulthood with mind, body and spirit in good shape? Imagine 10 years from now looking back at a video of your teenage years - will it be embarrassing or will you be happy to let it be seen? Is today's Bible verse going to be something you need to reach for in the future or will you make sure that it doesn't apply to you? <br />One thing's for sure, if you commit each day to God then the chances of you stuffing up are seriously reduced. So what are you waiting for; ask Him to show you which direction to go in today.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...perfect love casts out fear...'</h2>
<span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 John 4:18 NKJV</span>
<p>What are you afraid of? ‘A real love for others will chase those worries away. The thought of being punished is what makes us afraid. It shows that we have not really learned to love.' (1 John 4:18 CEV). Today, ask God to give you a fresh understanding of how much He loves you, for who He loves He prizes, protects, and provides for. <br />Paul writes:[I pray that you] ‘may have power, together with all the saints, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ' (Ephesians 3:18 NIV). That's extravagant love! God's love is MASSIVE, He couldn't love you any more than He does right now! You say, ‘What does God's love look like?' Look at the cross. If you had been the only person who ever lived, Jesus would have died just for you. Even if you're thinking ‘yeah but you don't know how I've messed up' He never stops loving you! You didn't do anything to deserve it, so when you fail you don't lose it. The Bible says: Nothing in all creation can separate us from God's love' (Romans 8:39 CEV).<br />Don't even be afraid of your weaknesses. As you get your head round it and you're more secure in God's love you can begin to acknowledge your weaknesses, seek His help, grow strong, and use the gifts He's given you. When you know God loves you, not despite but because of who you are, you have the ultimate self-esteem; and it comes from God's esteem for you.</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...those who were scattered went everywhere preaching the word.'</h2>
<br /><br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Acts 8:4 NKJV</span><br />As we read through the New Testament we see the young church exploding with growth. They were obviously doing something right. Did they have great worship leaders that played guitars? Did they have nice buildings with comfy seats? Did they podcast their sermons around the world on iTunes? Actually, no to all those. The crazy thing is that the Bible shows us how it was in times of persecution (agro, intimidation, prejudice and violence) that the church grew most quickly. It's a powerful reminder that the bad times, not just the good ones, cause us to grow. <br />Some of the people who give you a hard time for being a Christian can actually help you out without them even knowing it. As you stand your ground your faith-muscle gets stronger. Like Joseph, you can look back years later and say, ‘...you meant evil against me; but God meant it for good...' (Genesis 50:20 NKJV). <br />If God lets you to go through a tough time then it must be for your good or for the good of others through your example. Understanding this takes you deeper in your walk with God. So, whether the battle is over your family, your education, your health, or your friendships, expect three things: <br />1) the closer you get to victory the more intense the battle; 2) what matters isn't your comfort but your calling; 3) God is totally on your side, so keep fighting!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...the rod of Aaron...sprouted and...produced blossoms...'</h2>
<span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Numbers 17:8 NKJV</span>
<p>New leadership was urgently needed in Israel. So God ordered an elder from each of the twelve tribes to bring a wooden staff with his name on it, and leave it overnight in the tabernacle - the big tent that they used as a portable temple. He said, ‘the staff belonging to the man I choose will sprout...' (Numbers 17:5 NIV). Next morning Aaron's rod ‘sprouted and...produced blossoms.' Notice: <br />1) Whose staff grew blossom; Aaron's! Obviously God doesn't pick His leaders because they're perfect. Aaron's CV included making a golden calf for Israel to worship, then defending himself by saying, ‘That cow just walked out of the fire all by itself.' Would you pick somebody like that? God did. That's because He sees in us potential qualities He can use to fulfil His purposes. Keep that in mind, next time a leader disappoints you. And remember it, should God call you to lead. <br />2) Where it blossomed; in the presence of the Lord. Certain things only happen in God's presence. In Aaron's case a walking stick came to life in ‘...the tabernacle of meeting...where I meet with you' (Numbers 17:4 NKJV). So, sort out your priorities, set time to meet with God each day, and keep it. <br />3) When it blossomed; during the darkness. Remember your faith grows when you are going through hard and dark times rather than when everything is cool.</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...Jesus took...Peter, James and John...up a high mountain...'</h2>
<br /><br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 17:1 NIV<br /></span>There're five things to look at in this story - we'll look at three today and two tomorrow: <br />1) Not everybody gets to go up the mountain. Jesus didn't take everybody and He didn't explain or apologise to those disciples who stayed behind. He loves us all equally but He doesn't give us all the same experiences with Him. He knows what He's doing, so trust Him. <br />2) Those who go up the mountain aren't more spiritual. After seeing Jesus glowing with God's glory, Peter blurted out, ‘Let's build three tents and stay here.' Peter was keen, but a bit daft too. Learn from his mistake and keep quiet so you can listen what God has to say, then take steps to make sure you build your life on His Word. <br />3) God's plan is to make Jesus famous, not you. ‘While he was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them, and a voice from the cloud said, &quot;This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him&quot;...When they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus' (Matthew 17: 5-8 NIV). The number one challenge in your life is getting to the place where you focus on ‘no one except Jesus.' The most important relationship you have is with Him and the only plan that will work out right is the one He gives you.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us...'</h2>
<span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Romans 8:26 NIV</span>
<p>When you go to a foreign country you can feel uncomfortable and a bit lost, because you don't speak the language. The language of the spiritual world is prayer and since the spiritual world is the source of our power; victory, peace, joy, and everything else we need; it's essential that we learn to speak it. The good news is, we have the perfect teacher and interpreter; the Holy Spirit Himself. One of His jobs is to teach us the language of prayer and guide us when it comes to addressing God and He's good at this job! The Bible says the Holy Spirit can interpret our prayers to God even when we don't know what to say. ‘In certain ways we are weak, but the Spirit is here to help us. For example, when we don't know what to pray for, the Spirit prays for us in ways that cannot be put into words.' (Romans 8:26 CEV). Isn't that cool? <br />Prayer is the link between the physical and the spiritual world; remember Jesus listened to His Dad. He looked into heaven and copied it on earth. The Spirit also shows us what God is saying. That's why prayer cannot be rushed. It's also why taking time to be still before God is so important. It allows the Holy Spirit to share God's thoughts with us, so that we begin thinking His way and be like Him on earth?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...if you have faith...'</h2>
<br /><br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 17:20 NIV<br /></span>When the disciples came down from the mountain they encountered an epileptic boy who kept having fits. His dad was totally desperate. What happened next was a valuable lesson for them, and for us...<br />4) Do what you've always done, get what you've always got. It takes more than personality and religious catch-phrases to set people free from illness; and this was a biggie! Sadly the disciples were powerless because they were prayerless. Jesus said: '...this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting' (Matthew 17:21 NAS). Persistent prayer is the price we have to pay if we want to walk in power. <br />5) Rise above the attitudes you see around you. Jesus confronted the core problem: '...&quot;O faithless...generation&quot;' (Matthew 17:17 NKJV). Now before you say 'That's a bit heavy!' just think, why should we act all wishy-washy in the face of a faithless generation moulded by godless media? If we let it, it will pull us down and wear us out. So we need to get tough. That day Jesus said, '&quot;If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move'&quot;...and it will move&quot;' (Matthew 17:20-21 NIV). Here're two final thoughts: a) ‘If you have faith.' Everybody around you doesn't have to have faith in order for you to see miracles b) you don't have to be a spiritual giant; just use your tiny mustard-seed faith and God will move stuff for you.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘You...are a letter from Christ...'</h2>
<span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Corinthians 3:3 NIV </span>
<p>‘This is how much God loved the world: He gave his Son, his one and only Son...by believing in him, anyone can have a whole and lasting life' (John 3:16) God sent Jesus to demonstrate His love and He sends us to tell people ‘You...are a letter from Christ...written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God.' <br />When a letter arrives two questions immediately spring up in our mind: <br />1) Who is it for? John's answer is ‘ANYONE'! For every person you meet, you will have something they need. Friends, enemies, relatives, neighbours and strangers need the message you have and the hope you bring. <br />2) Who is it from? A letter from someone you fancy is more interesting than some junk mail! Remember, you are a letter from Christ, about Christ. ‘For we do not preach ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord...' (2 Corinthians 4:5 NIV). Our message is not about us; it's about Jesus. ‘But are people really interested in Jesus?' you ask. In His lifetime Jesus was a national celebrity who could draw big crowds. Statistics say 1 billion people across the world are Christians today. Jesus isn't junk mail. ‘But I, when I am lifted up...will draw all men to myself' (John 12:32 NIV). Today nothing is more needed than a living portrait of Jesus Christ, so deliver your love letter to ‘anyone' who crosses your path!</p>]]></introtext>

<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>John 21:6 NIV</span><br />Have you ever had an amazing day, a day when everything went right, when you were totally in the zone, a day you hoped would never end? And then you woke up the next morning and everything was plain and ordinary and boring again. Why is life like that? <br />The four gospels all give us a different angle on the life of Jesus and, especially when it comes to the events after His resurrection, they all pick out different details we have to stitch together. We know this: Jesus rose from the dead, met Mary Magdalene first and later that day appeared to the 11 disciples. But then, maybe a week or so after that, they went back to what they were doing before they met Him: fishing. After something massive has happened we can crave the simplicity and security of what we know, we end up like the disciples: back at square one. <br />But there's good news: If God called you, you're still called. Jesus shouts to the guys from the shore giving them identical instructions to the very first day He met them (Luke 5). Once again an ordinary day is touched with the extraordinary as Jesus steps into the scene. That morning Jesus ate breakfast with them, chatted with them, encouraged them and reminded them that they should always be ready to be interrupted by a visit from the Master.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘You...are a letter from Christ.'</h2>
<span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Corinthians 3:3 NIV</span>
<p>The Bible says your life is a love letter from Jesus, ‘known and read by everybody.' But a letter is only effective, if it is easily read and understood. Adults moan because they can't understand text language, ‘what's &quot;C U L8R M8&quot; mean?' They don't get it; which isn't a problem when you txt your mate but might cause difficulties when you txt your mum! People must understand your message. <br />How can you make sure your love letter from Jesus gets through to the people He's sending it to? Here are things that some common things can confuse your message: a) a begrudging, resentful attitude when a friend, teacher, or parent asks you to go the extra mile and help at an inconvenient time b) not giving your best to the things you've committed to c) being unreliable, not keeping promises d) touchiness, like when you wear your feelings on your sleeve, are easily upset and overreact to unintended offences e) temper tantrums or sulking, where you're moody and grumpy because things don't go your way f) compromising, where you go with the flow and don't take a stand or have the guts to stand out. <br />Instead of Jesus they see moody or unreliable or compromising Christians. How we live says something; we can give people the wrong message. Jesus has a letter of love. Make sure people can get it.</p>]]></introtext>

<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Corinthians 10:5 NIV </span><br />Nineteen-year-old Liu Shih-Kun was an amazing pianist in China until the 1966 Cultural Revolution banned all things of Western influence. Refusing to renounce his beloved music, Liu was branded an enemy of the state and thrown into a tiny jail cell with no friends, no books, and even worse; no piano. Six years later, for political reasons, he was asked to play in Beijing with the Philadelphia Orchestra. After years without an instrument to practice on, he performed brilliantly. Eighteen months later when he was finally released, he again played flawlessly. His secret? Stripped of everything musical, for seven and a half years Liu disciplined himself to shut out negative thoughts and practice hour after hour on an imaginary piano.<br />What if you were in that position; all alone, the things you love taken away, would you find a positive focus or would you freak out and think of the worst thing that could happen? Police shout 'Freeze!' when they want to stop a suspect and protect themselves. And you can freeze out harmful thinking by capturing every thought and making it 'obedient to Christ.' Paul says: 'For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against... the spiritual forces' (Ephesians 6:12 NIV). Your thoughts have power. To win over them, you must totally surrender to Jesus and control what you allow your mind to dwell on.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘You...are a letter from Christ.'</h2>
<span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Corinthians 3:3 NIV</span>
<p>‘...if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!' (2 Corinthians 5:17 NIV). The message in our letter should make it clear that we're not the people we used to be, because: <br />1) Christ has changed us mentally. Being ‘...transformed by the renewing of [our] mind' (Romans 12:2 NIV) we now look at life, ourselves, others, our challenges and options in light of God's thoughts, not ours. We see opportunities where we saw only obstacles, and possibilities where we saw only problems. Minds that were frazzled with worry, are now filled with confidence and peace. <br />2) Christ has changed us morally. 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 says ‘...evil people won't have a share in the blessings of God's Kingdom?' then it lists: immoral, worships idols, unfaithful in marriage, a pervert, thief, a greedy person, drunkard, or anyone who curses and cheats others.' and then we're hit with verse 11: ‘Some of you used to be like that. But now the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and the power of God's Spirit have washed you and made you holy and acceptable to God' (CEV). He has transformed our character. <br />3) Christ has changed us spiritually. That's why only someone who has God's Spirit can understand spiritual blessings. Anyone who doesn't have God's Spirit thinks these blessings are foolish (1 Corinthians 2:14)! Your letter should read: ‘Jesus changed my life, and if you let Him, He will change yours too!' So, today, deliver your love letter to everyone you meet.</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...do not worry...'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Matthew 6:31 NIV</span><br />King David writes, 'I was young and now I am old, yet I have never seen the righteous forsaken or their children begging bread' (Psalm 37:25 NIV). Nobody can say that King David lived a 'sheltered life'! He lived on the front line, and so when as an old man he shares his reflections about the way the world works we need to pay attention. His advice to the next generation is to learn how to lean on God: 'Trust in the LORD and do good; dwell in the land and enjoy safe pasture. Delight yourself in the LORD and he will give you the desires of your heart. Commit your way to the LORD; trust in him and he will do this;' (Psalm 37:3-5 NLT). The sad thing is, even though David, Israel's greatest King, took the time to write down this advice, and even though it was taught year in year out in the schools and the synagogues of the land, the people just didn't follow it. When Jesus began to minister He had to deal with the same issue saying: 'Do not worry, saying, &quot;What shall we eat?&quot; or &quot;What shall we drink?&quot; or &quot;What shall we wear?&quot;...your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well' (Matthew 6:31-33 NIV). So today, relax, no really, chill, trust, God will provide!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘He went a little farther...and prayed...'</h2>
<span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Mark 14:35 NKJV</span>
<p>Throughout history God has looked for men and women to passionately pray on behalf of a lost world. More often than not, He's been disappointed. ‘...I sought for a man...who would...stand in the gap before Me on behalf of the land, that I should not destroy it; but I found no one' (Ezekiel 22:30 NKJV). <br />The disciples were willing to go with Jesus into the garden of Gethsemane but they didn't get how important it was to pray that night and all fell asleep. Even Peter, James and John, the guys in the inner circle, didn't ‘get it,' so in the end Jesus went ‘a little farther' and prayed alone. Prayer can be a lonely business and you have to stick at it. You can go for months and years before seeing some of the changes that you've prayed so hard about. On the other hand, when you go deeper with God, you get to share things that the disciples missed and only angels got to see to that night in the garden.<br />Why not get your youth group to set up a 24/7 prayer room for a week, or turn your bedroom into your own garden of Gethsemane and give up some sleep to go deeper with God? You could even join the grannies at your church for the early morning prayer meeting! How about it, is God calling you to go ‘a little farther?'</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'Love the Lord your God with all your heart...'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Deuteronomy 6:5 NIV</span><br />There's an interesting sequence of events leading up to Peter's denial of Christ. First, Jesus warned Simon Peter that he was a target: '&quot;...Satan has asked to sift you as wheat. But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail...&quot;' (Luke 22:31-32 NIV). Next we read that when the guards had arrested Jesus, Peter '...followed at a distance' (Luke 22:54 NIV). Later that same night Peter, the man who swore he'd die for Jesus, denied knowing Him. Then the cockerel crowed, Peter realised what he'd done, and he '...went outside and wept bitterly' (Luke 22:55-62 NIV). <br />Can you see the three steps? 1) you don't pay attention to the warnings about the enemy's attack 2) you allow situations to get between you and Jesus; you start to follow 'at a distance' 3) you end up denying Jesus by your words or actions. It's a classic process that happens to lots of people, so don't say, 'That will never happen to me.' That's what Peter said! Instead make sure you stay on your guard, and stay passionate. That red-hot fire inside you to make Jesus known is like your fuel for the race. Craig Lowndes wouldn't win many V8 Supercar races without fuel, but he also has to stay focused too, as every lap contains new dangers. So there's the word4U2day, keep your passion alive and stay focused, then you'll withstand any attacks.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘If you are wise, your wisdom will reward you...'</h2>
<span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 9:12 NIV</span>
<p>We all love the idea of a better world, city or school. Maybe you've even been praying for God to DO SOMETHING, what if he has done something - sent you! <br />In a graduation speech he was giving to a whole load of uni students, Chief Judge Alexander Saunders said, ‘As responsibility is passed to your hands it will not do to assume that someone else will bear the major burdens, that someone else will demonstrate the key convictions, that someone else will be elected Member of Parliament, take care of the poor, visit the sick, protect civil rights, enforce the law, transmit value, and defend freedom. What you do not value will not be valued, what you do not remember will not be remembered, what you do not change will not be changed, what you do not do will not be done. You can, if you will, craft a society whose leaders...are less obsessed with the need for money. It's not a question of what to do, but simply the will to do it.' <br />Paul writes: ‘...each one should carry his own load' (Galatians 6:5 NIV). Don't leave it to someone else! You've got a job to do! Sometimes we don't take responsibility because we believe others are more qualified. No, people who make a difference in life, only do so because they decided to try. Plus: God doesn't call the qualified, He qualifies the called!</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...live a life of love...'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ephesians 5:2 NIV</span><br />The great Scottish writer Thomas Carlyle married his secretary, Jane Welsh. She kept working for him but when she got ill, Carlyle, who was devoted to his work, didn't really notice. But she had cancer and was eventually confined to bed. Although Carlyle loved her, he found that he didn't have much time to give attention to give to her. Then she died. After the funeral Carlyle found Jane's diary and began to read it. On one page she'd written a single line: 'Yesterday he spent an hour with me and it was like heaven: I love him so much.' A reality he'd somehow been too blind to see now revealed itself with crushing clarity. He'd been too busy to notice how much he meant to Jane. He thought of all the times he'd been preoccupied with his work and failed to notice her. He hadn't seen her suffering. He hadn't seen her love. Turning the page, he read words he'd never forget: 'I've listened all day to hear his steps in the hall, but now it's late, he won't come today.' Thomas was devastated. Later, friends found him at the side of her grave, covered with mud. His eyes were red from weeping, 'If only I'd known, if only I'd known,' he cried. After Jane's death, Carlyle made little attempt to write again. <br />Nothing is more important than love. Is there anyone you need to spend time with today?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘Each one should use whatever gift he has received to serve others...'</h2>
<span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Peter 4:10 NIV</span>
<p>When someone tells you to be more ‘responsible', it's usually the last thing you'd ever want to do. After all, isn't that for people who are old and boring, and people who never have any fun? In fact the opposite is true; as you grow up the more responsible you are, the more freedom you're going to have to have fun, because things are far less likely to turn to custard! It's not about being old or boring or mature, it's about realising you're responsible for your own life and making good choices instead of doing something stupid and regretting it for the rest of your life. Here are three ways in which we can be more responsible. <br />1) Following through. If you're a quitter; someone who never finishes what they start, try giving yourself smaller things to finish. Do stuff that really matters to you, and when you start to finish those, think about tackling some other areas. <br />2) Taking care of the small stuff. How often do you forget small things; that are big things to others? Like forgetting anniversaries and birthdays, not taking the bins out or not calling someone back. Start sorting out the small things first, they matter to other people! <br />3) Do it yourself. Too many people expect others to do things for them, especially if you're used to your parents doing things. So start doing things by yourself!</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'If My people who are called by My name...'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Chronicles 7:14 NKJV<br /></span>This time last year nobody was thinking about saving money; it was 'business as usual', spend, spend, spend. Wow, haven't times change? Job security is more important than climbing the corporate ladder. Other people were talking about 'climbing the property ladder'; now they're struggling to pay their mortgage. And what about the weather... storms, floods! It feels like our security blanket has been ripped away and our comfort zone shaken to its core.<br />But there is an ancient Word for these crazy days; it's an old message for a new generation. 'If My people who are called by My name will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land' (2 Chronicles 7:14). Have you heard those words before? Can you sense God speaking from eternity? Those words are a reminder that every action brings a reaction. If we spend money we haven't got, if we treat the planet like it's disposable, trouble will definitely come our way. <br />Listen, we need to turn things around and someone needs to set an example. Even within a pampered church that majors on 'what God will do for you, and how to get Him to do it', God has people willing to be humble and get praying. The question is, will you be one of them?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘I have been crucified with Christ...'</h2>
<span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Galatians 2:20 NIV</span>
<p>When you became a Christian, did you really look at the label and read the small print? Did you think through what you were buying into? Our churches and youth groups are full of ‘Christians', but how many of them can really be called ‘followers of Christ'? It's all too easy to miss-sell Christianity as a free ticket to heaven and cushy life with ready-made mates. But this is not what it means to be a true follower of Jesus. <br />Paul writes: ‘I am crucified with Christ.' To our selfish lives those words are about as appealing as having a tooth out; yet that's exactly what we're supposed to be as Christians! In theory we should have laid down our own lives, given up our plans, our relationships, our gifts, our possessions; put them before Jesus and said ‘You have them, I'll do whatever You want me to do'. But how many of us have really done this? We can all probably remember the odd moment in an incredible time of worship and intimacy with Jesus when we gently whispered ‘You can have it all'. But the sad truth is most of us walk out of that place and within 24 hours we've picked everything back up again for ourselves and carried on as normal. Think today, do I want to be a Christian; or a follower of Jesus?</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'Let each of you look out...for the interests of others.'</h2>
<br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Philippians 2:4 NKJV </span><br />You see one of your mates and shout, 'How's it going?' Thinking you're actually interested, they come over to tell you something cool that happened to them yesterday. But you're not really interested are you so you jump in as fast as you can saying, 'Think that's cool? Let me tell you about...' You're off and running, making every effort to outdo them and prove that your life is way more interesting that theirs! Meanwhile, your mate's wishing they'd just kept walking when they first saw you. They'd hoped to hear something like, 'That's awesome, tell me more.' Instead they just get an earful of your ego. <br />The Bible says, 'Let each of you look out not only for his own interests, but also for the interests of others.' In other words, give up 'centre stage.' That's easier said than done when we tend to only be bothered with one person - me! Whatever happened to 'Rejoice with those who rejoice...?' (Romans 12:15 NIV)? Those simple words remind us that life is not supposed to be a competition - it's supposed to be a celebration! So next time you feel the urge to interrupt, practice saying, 'Enough about me. How are things with you?' Then listen! Listen with your ears, your eyes, your mind and your spirit. Try to understand the feelings coming through. Then you can 'Rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn.' (Romans 12:15 NIV)

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘Selling their possessions and goods they gave to anyone as he had need.'</h2>
<span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Acts 2:45 NIV</span>
<p>The Bible says that God wants to bless us. There's an understanding amongst lots of Christians that says God's blessing means if we give $10 we'll get back $100; but it's interesting that nowhere in the whole Bible is this the case! In fact, if you read about the start of the church in Acts you'll see just the opposite. Back then, anyone who had ANYTHING they didn't need, whether it was a building, a camel or a PS3(!) sold it. They then put all the money into a big pot and gave it to the poor. That way no one had too much but everyone had enough, they simply shared what God had given them. How amazing is that? Of course as Christians we all read our Bible and think ‘ahh, that's really great. Maybe I should put an extra $10 in the offering this week'. But maybe as followers of Jesus, it's time for an eBay revolution! After all, why is it we pick and choose what bits of the Bible we like and ignore the rest (telling ourselves that bit's not relevant for today)? Maybe as Christians we spend too much time trying to interpret the Bible to make it fit with what we want it to say. After all, Jesus never owned a thing. So why does the stack of DVDs in the corner keep getting higher?</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...bring them down to the water, and I will test them...'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Judges 7:4 NKJV</span><br />Are you a nurturer by nature, somebody who will spend hour after hour, day after day, week after week trying to help your mates overcome their issues? If so you'll know that it can be frustrating, very often one step forwards two steps back! God loves that kind of faithfulness but be careful; He doesn't need you to do His job for Him, you need to know where your work ends and His work starts! <br />Gideon was surrounded by too many people and lots of them were in the 'high maintenance' category! Through a series of tests God showed Gideon who he should keep with him and who he should send home. During the first test, the 'fear test' Gideon lost 22,000 men, leaving only 10,000. Next was the 'water test' to 'Separate those who lap the water with their tongues like a dog from those who kneel down to drink' (v5). Only 300 soldiers passed the test! We learn two lessons from this story: 1) you need to be able to see your enemy approaching. Those who got down to drink like dogs, sacrificed their vision to satisfy their immediate need 2) when God reduces your support, it's in order to give you a miraculous victory. So when the people around you can't pass God's 'water test,' let them go and trust God. He has something better in mind.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...your faith has healed you.'</h2>
<span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Luke 8:48 NIV</span>
<p>Read Luke 8:43-48. In this story a woman who'd been bleeding for 12 years crept through a crowd to touch the edge of Jesus cloak. After she was instantly healed, Jesus knew something had happened because He ‘felt the power go out of Him'. The woman confessed it was her and Jesus blessed her. <br />Notice three important things in this story: <br />1) She did something she'd never done before. She decided to try Jesus. Smart move! Faith means stepping into the unknown and taking a risk you've never taken before. <br />2) She recognised her moment. She knew that Jesus was visiting her town, and might not be back. There are ‘God-moments' in life when you've got to get over your fear and move out in faith. If you don't, you'll miss them. <br />3) She started a new thing. Until then no one had been healed by touching His cloak but her act of faith was a new day. ‘People brought all their sick to him and begged him to let the sick just touch the edge of his cloak, and all who touched him were healed' (Matthew 14:35-36 NIV). God is looking for people who are willing to break with tradition. When He finds them, He uses them to open doors and show new ways of how He can work. So don't be scared to step out and take a risk, it might just start a new thing!</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...I die of thirst...'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Judges 15:18 NKJV<br /></span>Samson was an extreme character who swung from massive highs to major lows, listen: 'The Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him; and...his bonds broke loose...He found a fresh jawbone...took it, and killed a thousand men...Then he...cried out to the Lord and said, &quot;You have given this great deliverance...now shall I die of thirst?&quot;' (Judges 15:14-18 NKJV). Check out these three things:<br />1) Samson allowed the enemy to bind him. What has you tied up today? What's holding you back? Even super-macho Samson couldn't win every battle in his own strength. It took God's Spirit to set Samson free and that's what it's going to take to set you free too. 2) Samson needed to use what had already been given him. Just the jawbone of a donkey, but with God's help it was enough to win the day. The answer you're looking for may be right under your nose. Ask God to help you recognise what He's given you, and use it. 3) Samson was victorious, yet dying of thirst. It happens, particularly to those who work for God but don't spend enough time with Him. Jesus promises '...whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst.' (John 4:14 NIV). It's hard to celebrate a victory when you feel dry and tired, so jump into the refreshing river of God today. The One who gives you victory, can also quench your thirst.

<p>George dreamed of joining the Navy, but his mother, who was a widow raising her children alone, didn't like the idea. Nevertheless she put on a brave face and agreed to let him go. The day he was due to sail he hugged her good-bye but to everyone's surprise she started to cry. After going through so much heartbreak she just couldn't take any more. George must not board that ship; instead he must stay and be strong for the rest of the family. The boy in the midshipman's uniform wanted a Navy career, but not if it meant adding to his mother's grief. So reluctantly he returned his uniform and ordered his belongings ashore. Of all the young men who might have left home in search of adventure and didn't, he was just one more. Yet his decision had profound influence on the Revolutionary War. A mother's upset stopped her fifteen-year-old from ascending the ranks of the British Navy and embarking on an adventure very different from the one for which he eventually became famous. That's because the boy's name was George Washington, first president of the United States of America.<br />‘We make...plans, but the Lord decides where we will go.' ‘A man's steps are directed by the LORD. How then can anyone understand his own way?' (Proverbs 20:24 NIV). God knows where he wants you, so don't be afraid if your plans don't quite work out!</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...God loves a cheerful giver.'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Corinthians 9:7 NIV</span><br />There are two kinds of givers: those who give what's left over, and those who give off the top. The first group isn't necessarily greedy, they just live a different way. They see themselves as being responsible for meeting their own needs, so whatever's left over goes to God's work. The problem with giving leftovers is that you will never give what you think you can't afford. As soon as you feel a bit tight, you decide not to give. The other problem is that you buy the new phone which you've convinced yourself you absolutely need and have no money left over anyway! God says he wants you to be a 'cheerful giver'. But if your heart is more desperate for those new shoes, how can you ever be generous the way God wants?<br />On the other hand, those who give 'off the top' understand that God owns and controls all the blessings in their life anyway, so they feel free to give to Him first and themselves second. Leftover givers always struggle in this area. They know all the stuff about God providing but there are clothes to buy, nights out to fund and friends' birthdays coming up, so they hold back, afraid they can't do all this and give to God. <br />Fear has the power to make you act the opposite to what you believe. Basically fear makes you irrational. Doesn't it make more sense to trust God with your money since it's all His anyway? <br />SoulFood: 1 Pet 1-5, Luke 13:18-35, Ps 119:65-72, Pr 17:23-26<br />]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see'</h2>
<span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Hebrews 11:1 NIV</span>
<p>Did you see the movie, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull? If you're an Indy fan you will have no doubt seen one of the earlier films, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. In this film Indy sets out to find the treasure with the help of his father. Along the path Indy reaches what looks to be a massive canyon, a sheer drop, making it impossible to get to the other side. Indy trusts his father's words, figures out the clues, takes a leap of faith and finds his feet are safely on solid rock. Indy doesn't fall to his death! There was a bridge there all the time, he just couldn't see it. Only when he steps out does he find it. If Indy had only believed in what he could see at that moment he would never have reached the treasure. It took faith. He needed to trust his father's words and walk on the bridge, even though he couldn't see it. Very scary!<br />We need to have faith in God. Faith is spelt: LBA; Listening to what God says, Believing it's true and finally Acting on it. Faith is living our lives by what we believe to be true about God; even if it doesn't seem to make sense. It's about believing God is right and trusting him to do what He says, and guess what? He is and He will!</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him...'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Samuel 3:19 NKJV</span><br />Welcome to life; disappointment guaranteed! So here are some examples to help you when: <br />1) You're disappointed with those you look up to. Think of Samuel and Eli (1 Samuel 1-4). Sam's mum, Hannah, entrusted her child to Eli the Priest, confident he'd be a great mentor to the young boy. But Eli turned out to be a weak parent who stood by while his sons abused their priestly privileges, bringing shame to the ministry. Who'd have blamed young Samuel for taking a nose dive when the man he looked up to failed so badly? But somehow Samuel looked beyond his disappointment and kept his eyes on God: 'Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him.' As a result God turned him into one of Israel's greatest prophets.<br />2) You're disappointed in those you live with. Surely your family won't let you down. Right? Wrong! Ask young Joseph. When God gave him a big dream he thought his brothers would celebrate. Instead they were so jealous and angry that they sold him to human traffickers! What an open door to a life of bitterness - surely that kind of disappointment would leave Joseph emotionally paralysed? But no, even though many years of his life were very, very tough Joseph lived for God in every situation. Finally, many years later the breakthrough came, he became Egypt's Prime Minister and was re-united with his family. So don't let disappointment get you down today.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see’</h2>
<span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Hebrews 11:1 NIV</span><br />Ever felt disappointed? It’s not a nice feeling is it? It’s that feeling you get when things just don’t turn out like you’d hoped they would. It stinks! Life feels so unfair doesn’t it? Ever felt disappointed in God?
<p>Sometimes, when we hear what God has done for other people, we can hope that God will do the same for us. We begin to put our faith in God to do these things for us. We may want God to make us into a fantastic worship leader or preacher or help us get that job, or get that girl/guy to go out with us, just like He did for those other people. Or maybe we want God to do amazing miracles through us like we read about in books. ‘If God has done it for them’ you say, ‘then I believe God will do it for me. I have faith!’ But sometimes that thing we hoped for doesn’t happen and we can get really disappointed. :(</p>
<p>If this has happened to you, ask yourself this, ‘Did I hear God promise to do that for me, or did I just tell God I wanted it?’ Remember what you read yesterday? The first part of faith is listening. What God promises to one person he may not promise to you. Listen to what God is saying to you and put your faith in that; He won’t disappoint you!</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'Now go, lead the people...'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Exodus 32:34 NIV</span><br />Here are two more types of disappointment you'll deal with in life:<br />1) Disappointment in those you work with. In life you need people, going it alone sometimes sounds attractive but the reality is pretty harsh, that's why we choose to work together. But when the people in your team fail you it hurts. Imagine Moses' disappointment. He left his brother Aaron in charge while he went to meet with God. When he came back Aaron had totally lost the plot and made the people a fake God; a golden cow! But watch Moses; his true leadership shines in the face of this disappointment. He confronts Aaron, takes it to God for resolution, and prays forgiveness for Israel. With God on his side Moses makes some great decisions and the horrible mess gets sorted out. <br />2) Disappointment in those you've poured your life into. Let's check in again with Moses, Pastor of the ‘Church of the Ungrateful'. This congregation of former slaves were on their way to the Promised Land, but how did show their thanks to the man who put everything on the line to make it possible? By moaning and groaning and blaming him for everything bad that happened (Exodus 14). Was Moses disappointed and hurt? Yes. But each time he wanted to quit he'd come to God and offload. You know you can do that too, right?

<span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Hebrews 11:1 NIV</span>
<p>Seven times in the Gospel of John Jesus describes himself as ‘I AM...'. I AM: bread, light, gate, good shepherd, the resurrection and the life, the way, truth and life, and the true vine. He never said ‘I might be', ‘I could be' or ‘I want to be'. He said ‘I AM'. He was definite, positive, confident, absolutely sure whom He was. Every time He said ‘I AM' He told us an amazing truth about himself. Chew over these:<br />1) ‘...&quot;I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will never be hungry again...&quot;' (John 6:35 NIV) <br />2) ‘...&quot;I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life&quot;' (John 8:12 NIV) <br />3) ‘I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved' (John 10:9 NIV) <br />4) ‘I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.' (John 10:11 NIV) <br />5) ‘...I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will live, even though he dies' (John 11:25 NIV) <br />6) ‘I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me' (John 14:6 NIV) <br />7) ‘I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener' (John 15:1 NIV) <br />Today be confident in the faith you have in Jesus. Be confident in I AM - I AM CONFIDENT!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'But we have this treasure in jars of clay.'</h2>
<br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Corinthians 4:7 NIV<br /></span>Finally there's the biggie: Disappointment in ourselves. This kind of disappointment can throw you into a downward spiral that's hard to stop or recover from; so watch out! <br />Peter had sworn undying love to Jesus. 'Even if all fall away on account of you, I never will' (Matthew 26:33-75), and he meant every word of it. But under the pressures surrounding the crucifixion he crumbles and three times denies knowing Jesus. Heartbroken by his own dismal failure, '...went outside and wept bitterly' (Luke 22:62 NIV). Have you ever asked, 'God, how can you possibly use someone as messed up as me?' Welcome to Peter's world. Peter became overwhelmed by feelings of failure and went on a major downer. But Jesus wasn't shocked. He was well aware that Peter was a work-in-progress. He knew that this impulsive, outspoken disciple had a tender heart, so He extended extra grace to him. After his resurrection He took time out to restore the failed disciple. For Peter the years after his biggest failure were more spectacular than he could've ever imagined. <br />So, when (not if!) you fail: a) don't drown in disappointment b) come to Jesus honestly and say sorry. Confess your sin; don't make excuses, or blame circumstances or people c) receive God's grace by faith, not by feelings. You are never beyond grace d) get whatever help you need to get back on track; sooner, not later.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘With all your heart you must trust the LORD and not your own judgment.'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 3:5 CEV</span> <br />‘I told you so! I knew it! I'm right!' We all enjoy saying words like that don't we? We all want to be right and hate being wrong. But we need to get used to being wrong if we want to live the Christian life. 1 Corinthians 1:25 says: ‘For the foolishness of God is wiser than man's wisdom...' That means that even the cleverest thing we could ever say sounds so not clever to God. <br />A guy in the Bible called Job, had to go through some really rotten stuff in his life and one day he was moaning on to God about it and asked God if He really knew what He was doing? Job thought he was being clever! But God put him in his place saying things like, ‘Right Job, did you put the stars in place? No, you didn't! So until you can do stuff like that, don't even think about questioning me, because I obviously know well more than you. Just trust me!' (for the full version of this chat, read the last few chapters of the book of Job). It silenced Job good and proper. How can you possibly answer that? Well that's just the thing...you can't...no-one can. We were never meant to figure everything out by ourselves, we were meant to ask God and learn from Him. So go on ask...and keep asking. He'll tell you everything you need to know.</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...you are...fellow citizens...members of God's household... a holy temple...'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ephesians 2:19-21 NIV</span><br />Do you know that you can enjoy God's presence at any time? You are 'No longer strangers...but fellow citizens...of the household of God...a holy temple' (NKJV). Let's unpack what that means:<br />1) as 'fellow citizens' we represent God on the earth. We're His 'ambassadors' (2 Corinthians 5:20). 'What does an ambassador do?' Well it's a lot more than putting on posh parties where people eat chocolate! The ambassador lives in a foreign country showing everyone who lives there how amazing his home country is. He doesn't belong there permanently, he could be called home at a moment's notice. Getting the idea? <br />2) because we belong to the 'household of God' we can open the door to God at any time, with any need, and know that we'll be met with love. God is the father you always hoped for and you are the child He always wanted. If you have any doubts, look at the cross; that's how much God loves you. <br />3) we are 'a holy temple.' In the Old Testament God had a temple for His people, but now God has a people for His temple. What's the difference? Well are you made of stone?! The Bible says, 'Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God?' (1 Corinthians 6:19-20 NIV). Just like the temple of old your life now displays the awesome greatness of God!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘Fools think they know what is best, but a sensible person listens to advice'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 12:15: (CEV)</span> <br />You probably know some loud mouth who thinks they're always right and everyone around them is wrong. You know the type they never listen properly to what other people say, they shout and force their (usually uneducated) opinion at anyone within earshot. No-one can tell them anything. <br />Then there is the person who listens, hears what others say and adds that to their knowledge bucket. Thomas Edison (the light bulb inventor guy from your science class) once said &quot;about the only invention I can claim as absolutely original, is the phonograph. I'm an awfully good sponge. I absorb ideas wherever I can and put them to practical use. Then I improve them until they become of some value. My ideas are mostly the ideas of other people who didn't develop them themselves.&quot; Edison stayed open, hungry for knowledge and teachable throughout his life. And to succeed, you must too. <br />God says ‘Fools think they know what is best, but a sensible person listens to advice'. Sometimes we get things wrong. Sometimes it's easier for people around us to see where we are going wrong than it is to see it ourselves. Listen to what is being said about you. Listen to what God has to say about it. Is it time for you to change? Be wise!</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'Not that we are sufficient of ourselves...but our sufficiency is from God'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Corinthians 3:5 NKJV</span><br />The Israelites were slaves in Egypt, tortured and beaten and desperate for freedom. So Moses turns up, bugs and bugs the Pharaoh to set the Israelites free (he even uses real bugs!) and finally they've got freedom and the promise of a new life in a new land. Sorted. Well until lunchtime! In the wilderness, God gave them food every day, called Manna, but it wasn't long before they were whingeing like toddlers...'If only we had meat to eat! We remember the fish we ate in Egypt at no cost; also the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions and garlic. But now we have lost our appetite; we never see anything but this manna!' (Numbers 11:4-6 NIV) They'd forgotten all about the whips and beatings now all they remembered was the cucumbers! That might make Jamie Oliver happy but not God! He had promised them a land where they could grow their own cucumbers with the added bonus of NOT being slaves. But before they enter the land and grow veggies, they need to grow up and that meant learning to depend on Him. <br />Remember your first week at High School, it might be scary but you can't go back to primary! Growing with God isn't always easy, but we can't go back, we have to learn to trust Him. God has great plans for you to grow. When it's tough don't look back just look to Him!

<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 91:15 NIV</span> <br />A child picks up the phone and dials 000 and asks ‘is Santa there?' Why? Because he had been annoying his Mum!. Did you know that every day people call 000 when they shouldn't. Calls that say ‘I've stubbed my toe' ‘There's a dead cat in the road' ‘I've lost my keys' ‘there's a spider in my bath' ‘There's a rat in my kitchen' ‘I've ran out of credit!' sound funny at first. But when you see posters about town saying ‘Call an ambulance for the wrong reason and someone might die' and you realize the seriousness of the situation.<br />What's so great about God is that He can always cope with the amount of emergency calls He gets. He doesn't even mind if they're trivial or not. He just wants you to call. He wants you to know He's always there to help you. Whatever is bothering you bothers Him. You are so important to Him, you matter so much.<br />‘The Lord says, &quot;I will rescue those who love me. I will protect those who trust in my name.&quot;' (Psalm 91:14 NLT). Or as it says in the CEV ‘I will rescue you and keep you safe.'</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'In it was a swarm of bees and some honey, which he scooped out...'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Judges 14:8-9</span><br />There's a story in the Bible that talks about Samson. You remember Samson right, the guy with superhuman strength and no hairdresser? One day Samson is really peckish, he spots some bees making some honey and just sticks his hand in and grabs some (the hive was in a dead lion but I don't think he was that bothered about health and hygiene regulations!). Fresh, golden, delicious! <br />How often do we miss out on something sweet because we're scared of getting stung? Maybe someone is scared to go out with someone they fancy in case they get hurt. Or someone else doesn't take up the opportunity of a role in the school production in case they fail or look stupid. Most times in life we have to get past the bees to get the honey. If your life feels boring don't blame God. Neither bees nor honey are boring! God has dreamt up some great opportunities for you but they don't come gift-wrapped (remember the lion!). In fact a lot of the time they look impossible; but that's the idea. Think about David standing in front of Goliath or Peter stepping out of the boat to walk towards Jesus riding the waves without a surf board. These guys became giant-killers and water-walkers but they had to get past it being scary or even looking impossible. They had to get past the bees and so do you!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Hebrews 4:16 NIV</span> <br />To boldly go where no man has gone before! Recognise the phrase from Star Trek? The space ship, reaching places that had never been seen before! Of course it's just Sci-Fi fantasy; we've not mastered travelling through space in that way just yet! But because of Jesus we are all able to boldly go where no man or woman could go before; directly to God. Before Jesus came to earth not everyone was able to talk directly to God. Animal sacrifices had to be made and certain people were chosen, priests, to go into a place in the centre of the temple and talk to God on behalf of all the people. Often they would tie a long rope around one ankle, so they could be dragged out in case they died in there! Can you imagine having to pray like that? Those guys didn't walk in there with confidence to enjoy Gods' company. They went in scared stiff wondering if they'd be coming out alive! Crazy huh? <br />But because God loves us so much, He chose to send His only Son, Jesus, to the earth, to die the ultimate sacrifice, so through believing in Jesus, we can talk with God whenever we want to, we can be forever with God (John 3:16) It's amazingly fantastic! Go confidently, boldly, to God; He's waiting.</p>]]></introtext>

<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 Peter 4:11 NKJV</span><br />When God gives you an assignment He gives you all that's needed to fulfil it. In fact, by working out what you're really good at helps you figure out your calling. Winston Churchill said, 'To each there comes in his or her lifetime a special moment when they are tapped on the shoulder and offered the chance to do a very special thing, unique to them and fitted to their talent. What a tragedy if that moment finds them unprepared or unqualified for that which could have been their finest hour.' <br />You can't always be what you want to be (see X-factor!), but you can be everything God wants you to be. That's because He assigns us '...each according to his own ability' (Matthew 25:15 NKJV). What do you love doing and do consistently well? Is music your thing? What about computers or maybe helping with little kids? Paul says, 'Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good.' (1 Corinthians 12:7 NIV). That means some of the things other people find boring, will give you a buzz. That's not an excuse to ONLY do the stuff you love-not many people feel gifted to be pick up rubbish or stack the chairs-we can ALL do that! But stop apologising for the skills you don't have and discover the gifts God has given you and put them to work for His kingdom.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘If I had cherished sin in my heart, the Lord would not have listened.'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 66:18 NIV</span> <br />Have you seen that programme on UKTV ‘How Clean Is Your House'? If you have you may have found yourself screaming at the TV, ‘Uggh!! How can they live like that?' as you look in horror at the amount of dirt and rubbish that's inside. Thankfully by the end of the programme you're feeling relieved, as the house is how it should be; nice and clean! But it only got clean because those brave souls asked for help. They decided that it was better to deal with the humiliation of having their dirty houses shown on TV than for them to live that way any way longer. And even though they are named and shamed in front of thousands watching, by the end of the programme they are looking happy, relieved. Their houses look completely different and their lives have changed for the better. <br />When we do things wrong and go against God, it's like we are messing our lives up as much as those people messed up their houses. If we don't ask for help it stays there. Our lives get messier and messier, dirtier and smellier. Carrying this around all day can make us feel, ashamed, guilty, angry, unloved, useless, hopeless, all negative feelings. That's why God says, ‘Talk to Me, tell Me all about it; ask for My help, My love, My forgiveness. Just ask and it's yours'. Hide nothing, tell God everything and keep clean!</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'When the crowd saw what Paul had done...'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Acts 14:11 NIV<br /></span>Ever had an adult ask: &quot;what do you what to be when you grow up?&quot; Currently a common answer young people give is &quot;I want to be famous&quot;. They might not know what they want to be famous for DOING, as long as they get to be famous. Celebs are like gods in our culture. People worship and adore them. Let's look at what happened to Paul, in a town called Lystra, after he prayed for a disabled man who then started walking for the first time; 'When the crowd saw what Paul had done, they shouted...&quot;These men are gods!&quot;... But when... Paul heard what was happening, they [shouted] &quot;... we are merely human beings-just like you!&quot;' (Acts 14:11-15 NLT). God used Paul to do something awesome but instead of focusing on God the people start to big up Paul. This is so easy for US to do in a celeb-crazed culture.<br />1) Don't get giddy about &quot;famous Christians&quot;: Festivals and events are full of young people who &quot;worship&quot; the bands, preachers or even the worship leaders. They are just doing God's stuff so get excited about HIM not THEM. <br />2) If God uses YOU don't let it go to your head: The next day in Lystra, the same people who were cheering were chucking rocks at Paul (v19) It was a good job Paul was doing it for God and not for the cheers!

<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>1 John 5:14 CEV</span><br />You know it would be pointless to keep asking your school's Principal to let you play sports or computer games all day, don't you? You know it would be pointless to walk into a bank and ask them to give you as much money as you wanted whenever you wanted it, don't you? Why? Because these things will never happen will they? If the teacher and the bank manager agreed to your request they wouldn't be doing their job properly would they?<br />Be careful you don't keep asking God for pointless things! Just like the teacher and the bank manager, God has got a plan of how best to do things. And get this; He knows what's best! So if you come along with a stupid request like, ‘make me invisible so I can go and spy on everyone in school', you should know it's not going to happen! And that's not because God isn't listening or doesn't care. It's because you are asking Him to go against what He knows is right and He will never do that! Even if your reason for wanting to be invisible is valid; like you want to find out what the school bullies are planning, so you can stop it before it happens; God won't do it! So get real! Tap into God's agenda and know with confidence He is listening and will act!</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'He has shown kindness by giving you rain from heaven...'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Acts 14:17 NIV</span><br />Yesterday we read about Paul preaching to the villagers of Lystra. They weren't like the boffins in Athens, or religious Jews that Paul would end up talking to. These guys didn't know a lot about philosophy or religion but they did know about farming. Check out Paul's sermon: <br />&quot;We are bringing you good news, telling you...turn to the living God who made heaven and earth and sea and everything in them... Yet he has not left himself without testimony: He has shown kindness by giving you rain from heaven and crops in their seasons; he provides you with plenty of food and fills your hearts with joy.&quot; (Acts 14:15-17 NIV)<br />In other sermons Paul bangs on about Jewish history or the words of Greek poets but to the farmers he talks about rain, crops and lunch. Why? Because he wants them to get it, so he talks about the stuff THEY understand. Today, words like 'born again', 'sin', 'redeemed', 'house of God' often make it into our talks and songs yet don't make much sense to non-Christians. So when we talk to our mates, we need to think about HOW we talk about God. Here's a challenge: write down what a Christian is without using church words; if you're into skating or hip-hop use the words from your culture, just make sure it makes sense. Then tell your mates.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘When you ask, you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, that you may spend what you get on your pleasures.'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>James 4:3 NIV</span> <br />‘What am I doing this for?' It's a good question to ask yourself often; especially when you're praying! Sometimes we can seem to be doing something good and right but the reason behind what we're doing is all wrong. You might look good making a cup of tea for your dad and buying him his favourite chocolate bar, but if you're doing this because you've just had your mobile phone bill and want him to pay for it; then your reason for being kind is all wrong. The Bible says in 1 Samuel 16:7 ‘People judge by outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart'. You might be able to fool people that you are doing things because you are such a lovely person, but you can't fool God; He looks right through you and sees the reasons behind your actions.<br />Always check your reason for praying is a good one not a selfish one. Why are you praying for this person or situation? Is it just to make your life easier? God wants our reason for doing things to be because we love Him and because we love people. Being selfish, revengeful or manipulative, will get you nowhere with God. In fact He says if we ask Him for good stuff but our motive is wrong, then forget it. He's not interested, we won't get it! So, why are you doing that?</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'[Jesus] understands our weaknesses, for he faced all of the same testing we do'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Hebrews 4:15 NLT</span><br />Ever found yourself saying, &quot;You don't understand what I'm going through&quot; or &quot;Isn't there anyone who understands how I feel&quot;? If you have then like most, you probably have experienced times when you're struggling with what's happening in your life, or you're finding living a Christian life difficult, because the temptation to do the opposite is so strong. You could even be experiencing this today? At times like this we can long for someone to 'be there' for us, someone to just 'get' what we're going through. But sometimes rather than feeling supported we can feel misunderstood, ignored, alone.<br />Well today there is some great news coming your way. Never again do you have to feel like no-one understands what you're going through. NEVER! The Bible tells us that, 'Jesus understands everything you're going through!' and that means EVERYTHING!<br />Now before you start thinking, &quot;Don't be daft, how can Jesus possibly understand EVERYTHING about me and my life? How can Jesus know what I'm going through, he never even did anything wrong.&quot; - GET THIS: The Bible tells us that 'because Jesus lived on this earth He was tempted in every way and experienced the same feelings that we go through' AND because of this he 'talks to God about you, asking Him to help you.' How good is that?! Today whatever you're going through, know Jesus does understand and is, 'for you not against you!'

<p>Your true identity is found only in Jesus. Listen to whom the Bible says you are: You are ‘a child of God' (John 1:12), You are ‘Christ's friend' (John 15:15) You are ‘a new creation' (2 Corinthians 5:17) You are ‘God's workmanship - His handiwork - born anew in Christ to do His work' (Ephesians 2:10) You are ‘a saint' ( Ephesians 1:1) You are ‘righteous and holy' (Ephesians 4:24) You are ‘a citizen of Heaven' (Philippians 3:20 ) You are ‘hidden with Christ in God' (Colossians 3:3) You are an ‘expression of the life of Christ because He is your life' (Colossians 3:4) You are ‘chosen of God, holy and dearly loved' (Colossians 3:12) You are a ‘child of light and not of darkness' (1Thessalonians 5:5) You are a ‘member of a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own possession' (1 Peter 2:9-10) You are an ‘alien and stranger to this world in which you temporarily live' (1 Peter 2;11) You are an ‘enemy of the devil' (1Peter 5:8) You are a ‘child of God and you will resemble Jesus when He returns' (1 John 3:1-2) You are ‘born of God - and the evil one cannot touch you' (1 John 5:18) You are ‘fearfully and wonderfully made' and that's just the start! Know your worth, know your value. It's found in Jesus</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...watch out or you will be destroyed by each other.'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Galatians 5:15 NIV</span><br />Mates sometimes fall out. After all, being friends doesn't mean you have to act like Wiggles characters, hold hands or constantly grin, but how you deal with disagreement makes or breaks friendships. Ever felt like you've won the argument but lost a friend? Here are three ways to that people handle conflict. <br />1) Avoid them: These are the people who hate to rock the boat, they fear confrontation and don't what to upset everyone; even if THEY have been upset. So they bury their feelings. But like the bad guy in a cheesy action movie, just when you think you've killed off those feelings, they spring back to life. If you try to clam up, the feelings build up and then you blow up - often at the wrong person! <br />2) Attack them: These are the 'get them before they get you' people; who use words, gossip and maybe fists to wound each other. The Bible says, 'If you keep on biting and devouring each other, watch out or you will be destroyed by each other.' Attack leads to counterattack, both sides 'dig in' and nothing gets resolved <br />3) Approach them. These people are sensitive to the feelings of others, yet talk about their feelings to God and their friend. They try to deal with the issues without blaming or scoring points and will try to be the first to say sorry. <br />Which are you?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘Good people are remembered long after they are gone, but the wicked are soon forgotten. '</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Proverbs 10:7 CEV</span> <br />A cheerful thought for you today; one day, you'll die! When you do, what will people remember you for; fame, or faith? <br />Barnabas isn't the most famous guy in the Bible, but he's called ‘...a good man...full of...faith...' (Acts 11:24 NIV) He wasn't a ‘Paul', doing the kinds of things that made him stand out, and he's only mentioned three times in Acts: for selling his land to help finance God's works; vouching for Paul's character; and giving John Mark a second chance. Barnabas didn't earn much fame, but he was known for his faith! The Bible says: ‘A good and honest life is blessed'; in God's eyes it's not what society considers important that counts, but faith.<br />Check out the story of the rich man and Lazarus (Luke 16:19-31). For starters, we know Lazarus' name, but we don't have a clue who the rich man was? He may have been famous when he was alive, but where did that get him with God? Precisely nowhere! He had no faith on earth, and now he's only remembered as a nameless ‘how not to do it' example! Lazarus may not have had the best life, or been known for anything special when he was alive, but his memory is much more blessed than the rich man's.<br />So how will you be remembered when you're gone; for fame, or faith? Start living that good and honest faith-filled life today.</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'Speaking the truth in love, we will...grow up.'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ephesians 4:15 NIV</span><br />The Bible talks about 'Speaking the truth in love'; yeah but how? Suppose a couple fall out with each other because he's always late. She could give him a piece of her mind and list off all of his faults, or give him the silent treatment, or give them both a chance to find a solution and try something like this: <br />'I feel frustrated....' No blame, no attack; just an honest expression of her own emotion. 'When you are late...' No judging, name-calling or labelling; just a concrete description of his action. 'It feels like the other things you are doing are more important than me...' No moralising; just honestly sharing her feelings. 'Please try to be on time, or call and let me know when you'll be here...' Instead of focusing on past actions he can't change, she's telling him what she'd like him to do differently next time. <br />'Do you mind doing that for me?' No demanding or taking for granted; just asking for consideration and cooperation. You might not have a &quot;late boyfriend&quot; it might be your parents, mates or people at work who keep doing stuff that winds you up. How can you go further than just speaking your mind but be honest without blaming and look for a solution not just a fight? Think about that and you will be closer speaking truth in love.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...another generation arose after them who did not know the Lord...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Judges 2:10 NKJV</span> <br />When Joshua was almost ready to kick the bucket, he called the nation's big bosses together for a bit of a business meeting. The leaders could remember being supernaturally fed for forty years, seeing the Red Sea sliced in two and the walls of Jericho crumbling. Knowing this, our mate Josh asks them who they're gonna serve. What's the response? ‘Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua...' (Joshua 24:31 NKJV). Sounds great so far! But it's not all as rosy as it looks. They served God partly, and only when it suited them. The one thing they had to do after Josh was dead and gone, was to vacuum up the last pockets of pagan worship. But Israel ‘...did not drive out the inhabitants...' (Judges 1:27 NKJV). <br />While Joshua had been fully committed to God, the others were only partly committed. So what were the consequences? Their kids messed up big time (Read how in Judges 2:10-19). What shaped the spiritual values of these children? The compromise of their parents! Parents don't always get it right; but unlike these guys here, you can get it right. You don't have to follow the path that everyone else around you is taking; instead, follow God's path, and do things His way. Flip it on its head and be an example to your parents, showing them that if you can live God's way, so can they.</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'Let him who walks in the dark, who has no light, trust in the name of the LORD and rely on his God.'</h2>
<br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Isaiah 50:10 NIV</span><br />Yes, God promises us peace, but we also know that bad things can happen to good people. Isaiah makes it clear that there will be times when darkness will even surround people who love God. Check your Bible, there's plenty of examples. What about Job who was well blessed before suddenly losing everything? He cried out, 'He has blocked my way...he has shrouded my paths in darkness' (Job 19:8 NIV) But is darkness our enemy? Maybe not. Think about this: Faith is like film - you remember that stuff - the stuff you used to put into cameras before everything went digital! Well the thing about film is that has to be 'developed' in the dark - the tiniest bit of light will ruin the photograph. Our dark days make us lean on God in ways we normally wouldn't. The truth is, if our faith was never tested we wouldn't be motivated to draw closer to God. It's like the old song: 'When darkness seems to hide His face, I rest on His unchanging grace. When all around my soul gives way, He then is all my hope and stay. On Christ the solid rock I stand, all other ground is sinking sand.' Anyone can praise God when life is good. It's when darkness falls that we find out what our faith is made of. It's in those times that we start to develop night vision!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...no one pours new wine into old wineskins.'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Mark 2:22 NIV</span> <br />Imagine it's your lucky day - you've been given $2,000 to get yourself a whole new wardrobe. You jump on the bus and hit the shops, grabbing yourself some amazing outfits for every occasion. When you get home, the first thing you do is try everything on again, and do a little fashion show in front of the mirror. After a shopping trip like that, you proudly wear your new clothes every day, showing the world just how mighty fine you look. <br />You wouldn't get home, throw your clothes all over the floor, chuck food on them to cover them in stains, get out the scissors and cut a few holes in them, roll them about in some mud and get the dog to use them as his bed for a week, and only then would you put them on and wear them. If you did, that would be crazy, right?<br />So if that's the case, why would you even think about doing that with your spiritual clothes? When you become a Christian, it's like God gives you that whole new-life-wardrobe. He gets rid of the old rough edges. So, don't go jumping straight into the old scabby clothes of your life before. Be proud of the changes in you, and show love instead of hate, humility instead of conceit, and worship of God instead of idolatry. Why bother with rags when God's given you riches?</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Psalm 23:4 NIV</span><br />Psalm 23 is amazing in all sorts of ways, one of which is this: David goes from talking about God, 'The Lord is my Shepherd,' to talking with Him, 'You are with me.' What happened in between? David learned that no matter how dark the way is, God is there to guide us by the hand. He realised that it's better to walk through the dark valley with God than stand on the mountaintop alone. <br />God doesn't always send you places where the sun is shining, but He promises, 'When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and when you pass through the rivers, they will not sweep over you.' (Isaiah 43:2 NIV). When you feel like you're out of your depth or in over your head, claim that promise! When you can't find the reason, trust the relationship. God won't fail you. <br />It's amazing just how many of the important steps forward taken by people in the bible happened in the darkness. Another one of the famous Psalms gets this point across really poetically, '...the night will shine like the day, for darkness is as light to you.' (Psalm 139:12 NIV). So instead of running from the darkness today, ask God to develop your night vision, to show you 'the treasures of darkness, riches stored in secret places' (NIV).

<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>John 5:6 NKJV</span> <br />He hasn't walked for 38 years, the pool didn't have lifeguards to help, and there are no stair lifts like oldies have to help them up and down the stairs. So when Jesus rocks up and asks this dude ‘...&quot;Do you want to be made well?&quot;' it may seem like a bit of a ‘well duuh' moment! But actually, He asked it to make the guy think. He obviously wanted to be well, but had he thought about what that would mean to his life; would he take responsibility for himself, look after others as well as himself, what job would he get to earn a living?<br />When we ask God for stuff, we need to be prepared for His answer; it might come with an instruction to change. Sometimes, God's solution is a challenge to us. You're stuck for money? God says ‘Ok, here's a paper round!'. He solves the problem, but we have to change too; you can't just sit on your butt and treat God like a free vending machine! <br />The good news is, solving bigger problems brings bigger rewards. So ask God to stretch you today by helping you ‘...take up your bed and walk' (John 5:8 NKJV). Throw away that dependency and helplessness and move on to bigger and better things. Be prepared to do what God asks, and you'll see a change. Choose life; God's way.</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'all you who... walk in the light of your fires... will lie down in torment'</h2>
<br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Isaiah 50:11 NIV<br /></span>When the darkness around you is part of God's plan don't try to create your own light: 'You who live in your own light...will soon fall down in great torment.' Abraham tried that when he sensed the light of God's promise of son going dim over time. Tired of waiting, he decided to go get it on with his maid instead of his wife - errr - big mistake Abe! And what about Peter who promised to follow Jesus to prison and to death (Luke 22:33)? When darkness fell he didn't wait for instructions and ended up chopping off an innocent man's ear! <br />Let's get one really important point clear: when you're in darkness by divine design you don't have to be scared, God will bring you through, night always gives way to morning! The Bible gives us great promises: '...weeping may remain for a night, but rejoicing comes in the morning' (Psalm 30:5 NIV). The forty dark days Moses spent alone on the mountain, the same time spent by Jesus in the wilderness being tempted, they were essential to God's plans. Jesus said, 'What I tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight...' (Matthew 10:27 NIV). So remember, 1) It may be in a really dark moment that God gives you an amazing revelation. 2) People will listen to you because you've 'earned the right to speak' - you've been there. So you never need to be scared of the dark!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘He made known his ways to Moses, his deeds to the people of Isarel.'</h2>
<span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 103:7</span> <br />Have you ever known someone to do something that made absolutely no sense until they explained it to you? God can be just like that. Sometimes He does things we don't get, sometimes he doesn't do things we think He should. Like when He told Noah to build a boat, Abraham to sacrifice his only son, and Moses to cross the sea on foot. None of those things make any sense until you look at the whole story, from God's perspective. Then we can see He totally knew what he was doing! <br />When we are able to stop looking at things through our own eyes and see God's perspective it changes the way we see everything. When we understand Him better we learn to love Him more. When we see why He has asked us not to do certain things we naturally find quite appealing, it's much easier to do as He asks. ‘There is a way that seems right to man, but in the end it leads to death' (Proverbs 14:12 NIV). Just because something feels right, it doesn't mean it is. If it's not God's plan, it's a dead end!<br />Understanding God's point of view keeps us on track. We live in a world that has come to the conclusion that there is no truth and everyone's opinion is valid. The problem isn't that our culture doesn't believe anything, it's that it believes everything. Many say ‘It doesn't matter what you believe as long as you're sincere.' Rubbish! Hitler was sincere; and that definitely mattered. Seeing life from God's perspective keeps us stable, focussed and stops us being fooled by the latest fads!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...HE PRUNES THE BRANCHES THAT DO BEAR FRUIT SO THEY WILL PRODUCE EVEN MORE'.</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>JOHN 15.2 NLT</span><br />Listen: 'He cuts off every branch that doesn't bear fruit and he prunes the branches that do bear fruit so they will produce even more' (John 15:2NLT). There's a time for planting and a time for pruning. Maybe God is at work in your life today taking away branches that don't belong, and pruning ones that do. What kind of things does God take away? Things that have served their purpose. Things that refuse to change. Things that will give you trouble later on. Things that are standing in the way of greater fruitfulness. Things that are holding you back. Things He has not chosen for you.<br />Have you ever seen a freshly pruned tree? Doesn't look too good, does it? And when God starts to cut back certain things in your life in order to re-direct your energies, you won't look too good either. Sometimes this means: a) having less nice stuff for a while b) letting go of things you depended on, c) being unable to explain to your mates why you are even going through the pruning process. <br />God knows what needs to be cut back in your life; He also knows what needs to be cut off. Trust Him. Even though you can't understand what He's doing, just pray, 'Lord, if I needed it You would let me keep it, so I open my hand to You today. Send whoever You will and take away whoever You will. I'll praise You when they come and I'll praise You when they go, because Your approval is my reward, and Your purpose is my reason to live.'

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Isaiah 43:2 NIV</span> <br />You may be in the middle of your parents' splitting up, and nothing feels worse than being stuck in the middle. It may feel like you're being torn in half. So, can you really ‘walk through this fire' without being burned? The Bible says yes, but first you must:<br />1) Forgive yourself and your parents. Realise it's not your fault. You're not responsible for your parents' relationship, but it's easy to blame yourself. If you do feel responsible, read Isaiah 43:25. God forgives and forgets, and He'll give you the grace to forgive yourself, too. Forgiveness is the one power you always have over anybody who hurts you. So keep on forgiving your parents no matter what; every day. Only by forgiving will you be able to move on. <br />2) Take your time and stick with God. Don't expect it to all be sorted instantly. You've been hurt, and it will take time to heal. You may be on an emotional roller coaster, flitting between wanting them back together, and wanting them to suffer. Healthy people make healthy choices, so spend time reading God's Word, praying, asking advice, and letting God love you. ‘...your God is gracious and compassionate. He will not turn his face from you if you return to him' (2 Chronicles 30:9 NIV). It won't be easy, but realising God hasn't turned His back on you will help you through this.</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'WITH YOU THERE IS FORGIVENESS...'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>PSALM 130:4 NIV</span><br />Some people grow through failure; others never recover from it. They talk about the past all the time because they can't get beyond it. What's the answer? See your mistakes as stepping-stones rather than stumbling blocks! 'How do I do that?' By doing three things.<br />1) You must push! You've got to push through emotions like Regret: 'If only I hadn't failed.' Frustration: 'I thought my idea was great, why didn't they?' Self-pity: 'They hurt me so I will just sit here and lick my wounds.' Paralysis: 'I will never get beyond this.' When it comes to emotions, the only way out is pushing through!<br />2) You must bounce! Solomon says, 'Though a righteous man falls seven times, he rises again...' (Proverbs 24:16 NIV). You must be like the lady who said, 'I'm never down, I'm either up or I'm getting up!' So, if you fall, will you bounce back up and try again? <br />3) You must remember! There's only one way - God's way! Samson blew it by getting too close to the wrong woman (see Judges 16). Jonah blew it by trying to run from God's call (see Jonah 1:3). Peter blew it by denying his Lord (See Matthew 26:74) But God used all of them eventually - when they were willing to do it God's way. So remember, don't blow it by thinking your way is better than God's.<br />The Psalmist writes: 'With You there is forgiveness...' God's forgiveness is received by faith - and it involves forgiving yourself! 'But what about my past?' The moment you accept God's forgiveness you don't have a past, you only have a future. You're free to get on with your life!

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego...'</h2>
<span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Daniel 3:30 NIV</span> <br />We can learn a few things from those guys in the fiery furnace: <br />1) Obeying God doesn't mean you'll never have trouble. Don't expect the world to always get you - sometimes, it'll be hard work for you 2) You're not alone, God is with you in your trouble. If you've ever seen the Veggietales ‘Rack, Shack and Benny', you'll remember that when King Neb threw them in the fire, suddenly there were ‘four men, and one was reeeaaal shiny!' (check out the whole story in Daniel 3:19 - 27). The fire didn't kill them, ‘cos Jesus was there too. So be encouraged. It may feel like you're stuck in the flames, but God is with you - He'll bring you out of this victorious. 3) Your trouble will become your testimony. Your mates are watching. When what they're trusting in doesn't work, they'll look to see if what you're trusting in does. Your faithfulness to God and His to you, will challenge them in ways nothing else can. Everybody in Babylon knew what Rack, Shack and Benny believed, but they wanted to know if it worked when the heat was on (literally!). It did, and lives changed! 4) On the other side of your trouble, there's great blessing. Our word for today is a Scriptural principle: when you're faithful in a tough place, God can trust you in a high place.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'...His peace will guard your hearts and minds...'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Philippians 4:7 NLT</span><br />Jesus said, '&quot;Can all your worries add a single moment to your life? Of course not&quot;' (Matthew 6:27 NLT). Worry changes nothing. When was the last time you solved a problem by worrying about it? Imagine somebody saying, 'I got behind on my bills so I decided to worry my way out of debt. And you know, it worked! You can't add one day to your life or one bit of life to your day by worrying; all worry will do is bring you wrinkles and grey hairs!<br />Listen to these two Scriptures: 'Those who trust in the Lord are like Mount Zion, which cannot be shaken but endures forever' (Psalm 125:1 NIV); 'You will keep in perfect peace him whose mind is steadfast, because he trusts in You' (Isaiah 26:3 NIV). We don't get up in the morning and decide 'Today I'm going to doubt God' yet when we worry that's what we do.<br />Paul writes, '...His peace will guard your hearts and minds...' Paul uses a military word here - guard. The Philippians lived under Roman occupation and were used to seeing the Centurions guarding their town. What security! Before an enemy could get to them they first had to get past the rock-hard Roman guards. And you know what? God gives you the same guarantee! His peace is not wishy washy - it is solid. Your heart and mind are completely safe if you'll let His peace stand guard. Why don't you ask Him for His peace right now?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...grace was given me...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Ephesians 3:8 NIV</span> <br />If you were asked to describe yourself in two words, what would you choose? I'm guessing you probably wouldn't get what God would say about you; He says ‘pure joy'. Maybe not the first two words that spring to mind! But that is what grace is all about. It means ‘pure joy' - although you don't deserve it, God considers it a pure joy to save you. What do you make of that?!? This ‘grace' stuff can be a bit hard to get your head around.<br />In John 8, a woman is caught committing adultery. The law makes no bones about her punishment; the Pharisees are eager to stone her. Jesus, being righteous, surely must agree? Without a lawyer to defend her, or even a character witness, things aren't looking good. But suddenly Jesus starts to write in the sand. We're not told what, but some have suggested maybe a list of their sins, complete with times and places. Ouch! When He's done, her accusers are gone. He says, ‘...&quot;neither do I condemn you...Go now and leave your life of sin&quot;' (John 8:11 NIV). Jesus lifted her from a position of undeniable guilt to one of unconditional pardon. She didn't deserve it, and didn't know it was possible. And that's your story too, isn't it? We all mess up, and don't deserve God's love; but by His grace, we get it. How awesome is that!</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'Be ready in season and out of season.'</h2>
<br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>2 Timothy 4:2 NKJV</span><br />Have you thought about what job or career you're aiming for? Or what university or college you're going to go to? Whatever your options are you're probably not expecting to be doing it 24-7-365 - you need some time off in between all that work! Right?? Holiday time's great isn't it? Taking time off from the humdrum routine of school, college, uni or work - we love it!! But God is quite clear that there's one thing that we should never take time off from and that's being a Christian. What!! No time off? - EXACTLY! <br />Living as a child of God is 24/7 - no time off included. God wants us to always be ready - not only speak to anyone who'll listen about Him, but also to show His love through what we do and what we say.<br />That means being a Christian not just on a Sunday, but when you're at home....yes even when your little brother has just robbed your diary and blabbed it to mum, yes even at College when you discover someone's been spreading nasty rumours about you, yes even when you're stuck behind that doddery old man in the queue at the shop. God wants you always to be ready to let people know by your words and actions how much Jesus loves them. <br />Remember being a Christian isn't a Sunday only commitment with the rest of the week off - it's every moment of every day.

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘...I no longer live but Christ lives in me...'</h2>
<span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Galatians 2:20 NIV</span>
<p>Do you make New Year's resolutions! Have you ever wondered why we do that? Is it to impress friends? To try and be a better, nicer person? Because you think people expect you to? And do you ever actually manage to keep them all?!? How long is it before you broke you last set? <br />Hebrews 12 urges us to keep striving, while Romans 3:23 reminds us that we're all going to slip up; so why bother?! Which one do we pay attention to? Our word for today, Galatians 2:20, goes on to say that God loves you and gave Himself for you. Think about that for a minute - it's a pretty huge thing! Verse 21 says that we can never get to a point of supreme goodness by effort. So that means no matter how many resolutions we keep, we'll never reach perfection. But that is why Jesus died for you - so that unreachable goal is brought right to us. <br />So although resolutions aren't the be-all and end-all at New Year, if you remember how amazing it is that God gave Himself for us, and that we have Christ in us to help us, you might find it easier to do the right thing, for the right reasons, whatever your resolutions. And when you find it hard going, you know on whom you can call for help!</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'Every man shall give as he is able.'</h2>
<br /><br /><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Deuteronomy 16:17</span><br />There are over 2,000 Scriptures in the Bible on money and giving. Check out Deuteronomy 16:17 and 2 Corinthians 9:7 as just two examples of passages that are relevant to all Christians - even you!<br />Now, you may be thinking &quot;but I don't have much money - only my pocket money, allowance, or a bit from my Saturday job&quot;. That may be true, but no matter how much money you have - or haven't - got, these passages are still important. <br />Firstly, you need to recognise that whatever you have, God still asks you to cheerfully give with it. That doesn't mean you have to give every penny away - it just means don't be selfish with it and keep it all for yourself. Think about putting a bit in the collection at church, or giving to a charity who you think do good work, because you want to help. <br />Secondly, these passages aren't just talking about money. Think about all the other things God has given you - gifts, talents, skills - and think about the ways you could use those ‘as you are able', and how you can give of those gifts cheerfully. That may mean offering to help with the Sunday school or kids' church, if you're good with kids, or singing in the band if God's given you a good voice, or helping serve tea if you've got a gift of hospitality. <br />So have a think today - how can you give with a smile on your face?

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart...'</h2>
<p><span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Deuteronomy 6:5 NIV</span> <br />Sometimes it may seem that life is just one big stage show. You may act like one person at home, another at school and yet another at church, and you choose which personality and character traits you want people to see. Your life is like a chest of drawers, and each drawer has a costume and mask in that you put on for different occasions. You could become an impressionist you have that many different personas! You probably do it without even thinking. But just stop and think now; which mask do you put on when you're with God? Because whatever it is, it's pretty pointless. God doesn't see us as a chest of drawers or a collection of separate performances, He sees us as a whole person. When no one is looking, He sees; when you're at school, He sees; when you're in church, He sees. God made us with one will, one mind, one heart, and one spirit. It's the devil's lie that we can ‘have it both ways,' being who we want, when we want; but that just leaves us mentally and emotionally frazzled, and worse; distant from God! God wants us to be the same all the time; no masks, no costumes. How can we do that? By living with integrity, and striving to ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and all your soul and all your strength'.</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>The ultimate source of wisdom</p>
<p>'...the wisdom that is from above is...' James 3:17 KJV</p>
<p>A young executive told his secretary he had an important meeting and didn't want to be interrupted. A few minutes later his boss came to his office needing to see him urgently so, without knocking, he just swung the executive's door open and walked in. There in front of his desk, kneeling on the floor, was the young executive, praying. Totally shocked he stepped right back out again and asked the secretary, 'Is this usual?' 'Yes,' she replied, 'he does it every morning.' 'No wonder I come to him for advice!' said his boss.</p>
<p>Everyone needs wisdom; from the businesswoman high up in the glass-fronted office block to the single dad wondering how he can hold down his job and look after his kids. You see, God's wisdom isn't just a bunch of airy-fairy ideas that bear no relevance to life; God's wisdom is all about how to live life, the way He designed it to be lived! So how do you get wisdom? You ask God to give it to you: 'For the Lord gives wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding.' (Proverbs 2:6 NKJ) 'If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally...and it will be given to him.' (James 1:5 NKJ) So what's going on in your life today? What choices are laid out before you? Ask God for wisdom to take the right path.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>God's incredible love for us</p>
<p>'...love of Christ... surpasses knowledge...' Ephesians 3:18-19 NIV</p>
<p>George Matheson was told by his doctor that he was going blind. Still, he studied hard and despite deteriorating vision graduated from Glasgow University in 1861 at the age of 19. Just a few years later he lost his sight for good. To make matters worse, his fianc‚e returned her engagement ring to him with a note that said, 'I cannot go through life bound by the chains of marriage to a blind man.' George never married and never recovered from his broken heart. Through all this though, he became a successful pastor and led a fulfilled life. But just occasionally the pain of loneliness flared up, like at his sister's wedding. The ceremony brought back memories of the love he'd lost. In response, he turned to the incredible love of God for comfort and wrote an amazing hymn of praise! Here's how it begins: O love that will not let me go, I rest my weary soul in thee; I give thee back the life I owe, that in thine ocean depth its flow may richer, fuller be.</p>
<p>That's what worship is all about; praising God no matter what, because He's more than worth it!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>Information overload! (1)</p>
<p>'...many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall increase.' Daniel 12:4 NKJ</p>
<p>Are you reading this copy of word4U2day on paper? Or are you reading it online? Or on your phone? Technology is everywhere these days and it lets us do things we've never been able to do before, and to do several things all at the same time. But you can become tied to technology in ways that end up becoming unhealthy and unhelpful. Here are a few signs for you to watch out for:</p>
<p>(1) if you chat with people all day by texts, tweets, MSN, Facebook or whatever, but you still feel horrendously lonely, then the chances are the technology isn't helping. You need to go back to more old-fashioned ways of communicating-like having a face-to-face talk!</p>
<p>(2) if you find yourself lying in bed feeling pleased that you've got 10 more online 'friends' today than yesterday, go to the bathroom and splash some cold water on your face! The whole point of friendship is quality not quantity!</p>
<p>(3) if you use technology to have fun and organise your social life but never to develop your relationship with God, then you aren't getting the most out of it. Change your surfing habits so that you spend time listening to some of the great worship and teaching podcasts, bookmark some blogs that explain the Bible in language you can understand. Make technology serve you; don't be its slave!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>Information overload! (2)</p>
<p>'...the...servant is not greater than his master.' John 13:16 NKJ</p>
<p>A respected researcher says we've trained our brains 'to constantly flit around the universe of messages and information, seeking brief hits of excitement. Grazing ceaselessly, we never dig too deeply before moving on to the next distraction'. As a member of the 21st century tech-generation, you get more information in three days than your parents received in a whole month when they were your age. But when information overload starts to happen important things get forgotten in the battle for your attention. How often do you find yourself apologising to people for really simple things you just never got round to doing because your mind was on something else?</p>
<p>So, let's get down to it, when was the last time you enjoyed some relaxed, uninterrupted time without tech? When was the last time you walked in the park without your iPod, and listened to the birds instead? Can you remember? The fact is you need time away from the never-ending waves of information so you can reflect and recharge. Jesus had places to go, people to minister to, disciples depending on Him; even so, 'He...withdrew...into the wilderness, and prayed.' (Luke 5:16 NKJ) Now, since '...the...servant is not greater than his master', do you think you're above all that? Jesus said, 'Come with Me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest.' (Mark 6:31 NIV) Make it your number one priority today to take Him up on that offer!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>Receive His peace</p>
<p>'...My peace I give you...Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.' John 14:27 NIV</p>
<p>Jesus says to us: 'My peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.' The peace Jesus gives is like a miraculous blanket that wraps around you silencing every unkind word, soothing every out-of-joint emotion. This peace comes from knowing you're God's child-that's right, the God who controls the universe loves you and always has your best interests at heart. That's why people who've lost everything will often tell you they wouldn't want it all back because of how precious that peace has become to them.</p>
<p>Joni Eareckson Tada discovered this supernatural peace when an accident paralysed her from the neck down, and Corrie Ten Boom found it in a Nazi death camp. Missionary Elisabeth Elliot found it ministering to the primitive Amazon tribe who'd killed her husband. She wrote, 'Only in acceptance lies peace...not in resignation.' There's a big difference between those two words! Writer Creath Davis points out that: 'Resignation is surrender to fate; Acceptance is surrender to God. Resignation lies down quietly in an empty universe; Acceptance rises up to meet the God who fills that universe with purpose and destiny. Resignation says, 'I can't'; Acceptance says, 'God can.' Resignation says, 'It's all over for me'; Acceptance says, 'Now that I'm here, what's next, Lord?' Resignation says, 'I'm alone'; Acceptance says, 'I belong to you, Lord.''</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>Glorious living!</p>
<p>'God always does what He plans, and that's why He appointed Christ to choose us.' Ephesians 1:11 CEV</p>
<p>Most of us spend our lives focusing on what we have... until we realise that we're running out of time, then we begin to focus on what we've done. Understand this: when you leave this world your material possessions will be forgotten. The only thing that will stay is your life's impact! During your lifetime you will directly or indirectly impact the lives of approximately 10 000 other people. The question is: how will you impact them? Money, or the lack of it, does not necessarily determine your life's impact. People with fat fortunes have lived, died and made little or no difference. Other people, totally broke but full of vision, have done what Jesus said when He prayed, 'Your will be done, on earth, as it is in Heaven.'</p>
<p>At the end of a life well lived the Apostle Paul wrote, '...I have finished my course...' (2 Timothy 4:7 KJV) Having said that he handed the ministry over to Timothy, walked to the executioner's chopping block and was relieved of his duties. Yet his impact is greater now than ever. He writes: ' God always does what He plans, and that's why He appointed Christ to choose us.' What kind of plans? Not just making a living but making a difference! In the movie Forrest Gump, Tom Hanks plays a character with disabilities, both physical and mental. By following wise advice he goes on to achieve some incredible things. You know what? You have within you huge potential for achieving incredible things. God's given you a gift. Believe it. Discover it. Develop it. Cherish it. Use it. Give it. That's glorious living!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>Time out, not burn-out</p>
<p>'...Come to Me, all of you who are tired and have heavy loads... learn from Me... and you will find rest for your lives.' Matthew 11:28-29 NCV</p>
<p>God doesn't want you to get frazzled by the hectic pace of life. He created you to have a balance of work, rest and play; so make sure you do. It's easy to let life get so busy with school, work, mates, sport, exams, church stuff...the list goes on. You're busy, you may even be enjoying it, and you definitely don't want to miss out on anything. But, before you know it, you're exhausted, you've not had time alone with God for weeks, and you feel like you're going to fall apart. Not good. So-learn early how to get the balance right. Learn to say no. Don't be afraid of time by yourself-in fact, make sure you have time for yourself. When you've had proper rest, you'll have way more energy for all the other stuff; and probably find you enjoy it even more! Don't let yourself get so caught up in doing 'stuff'-including helping other people-if it means you forget to think about yourself and how you're doing. It's easy to forget about your own problems when you're so immersed in other stuff-but Jesus wants to help you deal with it, not file it away</p>
<p>So take time out every now and then-even put it in your diary or on your phone as 'you time'. Spend some quality time with the Big Guy, and make sure you're getting your balance right.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>God's cedars (1)</p>
<p>'...The glory of Lebanon shall be given to it...' Isaiah 35:2 NKJ</p>
<p>When Solomon built God a temple, he used different types of cedars-that's trees, to you and me! When the job was finished, they held a ceremony and God turned up in an awesome way. We're going to take four days to look at four types of trees God still uses now to build His church.</p>
<p>First, little cedars: these trees made fence posts for sheep pens, and if you chuck them in a truck driving down a bendy, pot-holed road, they won't fall out. They're consistent, and stick to the job. People who are God's 'little cedars' have what it takes to survive the potholes life throws at them, and its twists and turns.</p>
<p>It's said that people don't control their future, only their habits; and their habits control their future. 'Little cedars' have good habits, like: (a) praying; that's talking AND listening to God. '...He teaches me to listen like a student.' (Isaiah 50:4 NCV) (b) Bible reading; but not just reading-being prepared to hear, learn and live it, like Ezra did. '...Ezra had devoted himself to the study and observance of the Law of the LORD...' (Ezra 7:10 NIV) (c) sharing; having a credible testimony (that's your story of what God's done for you) to tell others. (d) giving; offering God the first bits of whatever money you have.</p>
<p>Put God first, and His blessings will overflow into all areas of your life.</p>

<p>'...The glory of Lebanon shall be given to it...' Isaiah 35:2 NKJ</p>
<p>Secondly, Solomon used fire cedars (which shepherds used to make fires at night, because they ignited easily and burned for ages).</p>
<p>At Pentecost, God gathered 120 'fire cedars' in the upper room. 'Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting. They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them. All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages as the Spirit enabled them.' (Acts 2:2-4 NIV) That day 3000 people became Christians; wow! The church as we know it was born through fire, and is sustained by fire; we can't let the fire go out. <br />God's fire leads to revival. We need to be spiritually hungry to be 'fire cedars' for the future revival. But be aware that you'll be a target for attack from the enemy when you are-revival is the devil's worst nightmare. To be sure your fire always stays hot ask yourself these four questions regularly: (1) Am I living life the way the Bible reveals? (Isaiah 8:20) (2) Do my words and actions reveal Christ? (John 3:30) (3) Do I offer other people God's love, acceptance and forgiveness? (Colossians 3:13) (4) Do I win souls and make disciples? (John 15:8)</p>

<p>In Acts, you can read about a couple of 'humming cedars' who were chucked in prison in Philippi, locked in stocks and beaten. How did they respond? '...at midnight Paul and Silas were...singing hymns to God...Suddenly there was a great earthquake...the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone's chains were loosed.' (Acts 16:25-26 NKJ) A preacher once said that 'God got so caught up in their praises that He began to tap His foot. And when God taps His foot, you get earthquakes!'</p>
<p>Praising God through bad times breaks chains and opens doors; it's the way to victory. But Satan will do everything he can to stop you, because he knows (a) the importance of praise; 'Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised...' (Psalm 48:1 NKJ) (b) the healing effects of praise; God's answer to 'the spirit of heaviness' is 'the garment of praise' (Isaiah 61:3 NKJ) and (c) the power of praise; '...when they began...to praise, the Lord set ambushes against the [enemy]...' (2 Chronicles 20:22 NKJ) Don't let Satan rob you of that 'garment of praise'. Choose to put it on, praise God, and watch Him turn your situation around.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>Men are from Mars, women are from Venus!</p>
<p>'...male and female He created them.' Genesis 1:27 NIV</p>
<p>Sometimes it feels like that, doesn't it? Maybe you've had a row with your brother, or your girlfriend's in a mood with you and you've no idea why. It feels like they're on another planet! But they're not. God created guys and girls differently; our brains work in different ways. Whereas a guy may have school, home, mates and hobbies all in different boxes in his brain, where one doesn't affect the others, a girl has all the same things, but the boxes are all joined and they affect each other. Something happening at home can affect all the other boxes. So your brother may forget your argument by the time you get home, and be all cheery when you're fuming with him, because he left that box behind hours ago and has done so much since then, and only when he gets back in the 'family' box will he be ready to deal with it. Or your girlfriend may be in a mood with you because of something going on in a completely different part of her life and, until that's sorted, she won't be happy.</p>
<p>It's unlikely that guys will ever completely understand girls, and vice versa, but by understanding some of the differences, we can learn to get on with each other so much better, and give each other the space to be who God created us to be, whether that's male or female!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>God's cedars (4)</p>
<p>'...The glory of Lebanon shall be given to it...' Isaiah 35:2 NKJ</p>
<p>Fourthly, tall cedars. Their strength wasn't in their height, but in their roots; they could bend almost to the ground without breaking, and come back stronger. God uses 'tall cedars' to build great churches. Don't think that just deciding to be a Christian is enough; that's only 5% of it really, like the bit of the tree you see above the ground. The other 95% is all about growing your spiritual roots. Without roots, the tall cedars would have been useless, and would have toppled in the slightest storm. You must strive to be mature and fully grown, becoming more and more like Jesus. How? '...though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you the elementary truths of God's Word all over again. You need milk, not solid food! Anyone who lives on milk, being still an infant, is not acquainted with the teaching about righteousness. But solid food is for the mature, who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil. Therefore let us leave the elementary teachings about Christ and go on to maturity...' (Hebrews 5:12-6:1 NIV) You need to constantly train yourself in the word of God. So study your Bible, listen to good teaching on it, but more than that, think about it yourself, about what it means to you, what God's saying to you through it. And little by little, your roots will grow.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>Lukewarm or boiling over?</p>
<p>'Don't sin by letting anger control you...' Ephesians 4:26 NLT</p>
<p>Anger! It affects everyone! There's the story of the guy who stalled his car at a green light, bringing on loads of honking horns from other drivers. He got out, went to the car behind and calmly said, 'Sorry mate, I can't get it started. Feel free to give it a go, and I'll sit here and honk your horn-anyone can do that.' Nice one!</p>
<p>You need to know how to handle anger properly, or one of two things will happen: (1) You stay angry. You're permanently boiling over, and that's not healthy. Be realistic; not every problem will be resolved the way you want it to be. Sometimes, you just have to give it to God and move on. (2) You don't get angry even when it's appropriate. You're always lukewarm, you show no emotion, and people start to wonder if you're actually human!</p>
<p>If you lack the courage to confront someone, you're more likely to explode at home, and that's not good for anyone. Jesus said, 'If your fellow believer sins against you, go and tell him in private what he did wrong...' (Matthew18:15 NCV) Sometimes we're supposed to get angry; but in the right way. Be angry with the problem, not the person. So, say what you have to say, but in kindness, and not in front of others. That's called speaking the truth in love, and it's not boiling over, but not lukewarm.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>Stop it!</p>
<p>'...He has made perfect forever those who are being made holy.' Hebrews 10:14 NIV</p>
<p>'I'm too fat!' 'I'm ugly!' 'I'm always getting it wrong!' 'I'm no good!' 'They don't like me'. How many times do you say those things to yourself? Well, what you need to do is STOP IT! Focus on what's right with you, not what's wrong, or you'll end up so negative you can't appreciate the gift of life. If you're always putting yourself down, or beating yourself up, you're setting a bad example to others-which no-one wants. We've all got bits of ourselves we want to improve, none of us will ever be perfect- but being negative isn't the answer. Look at the verse chosen for today. Slowly read what it says. And again. That's you it's talking about!<br />Max Lucado writes: 'Underline the word perfect. Note, the word isn't better. Not improving... God doesn't improve; He perfects. He doesn't enhance; He completes... I realise there's a sense in which we're imperfect... We still stumble. We still do exactly what we don't want to do...that part of us is 'being made holy'. But when it comes to our position before God, we're perfect. When He sees each of us, He sees someone who has been made perfect through the One who is perfect; Jesus Christ.'</p>
<p>It's ok to want to improve yourself, but take it easy! Stop and remind yourself that you're '...being made new...becoming like the One who made you...' (Colossians 3:10 NCV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>Got what it takes?</p>
<p>'...I said, &quot;Here I am, send me!&quot;' Isaiah 6:8 NLT</p>
<p>Are you one of those people who's always sticking their hand in the air, volunteering, saying, 'pick me, pick me,' a bit like the donkey in Shrek? Are you saying to God, 'Send me'? Before you do, check out these three key 'Cs' for leading and succeeding for God:</p>
<p>(1) Commitment: Real leaders don't quit even if they want to. Have you ever started tidying your room, and it gets messier before it gets better? It'd be easy to give up halfway through, thinking you'd failed, but that'd be a disaster! Just like leadership, you have to see it through to the end to get good results, to see the tidy room. You can't quit halfway through, even if it gets tough. With God's strength, you'll be able to handle the demands of people, pressures and problems that come your way</p>
<p>(2) Creativity: Just before the birth of Jesus, a Roman poet called Horace wrote: 'Adversity has the effect of eliciting talents which in prosperous circumstances would have lain dormant'-which can be put simply as: problems unlock creativity. Wise leaders look for a solution to every problem, then act on it.</p>
<p>(3) Compassion: What moves you? What gets you excited? If you're going to lead, you need to love-and you can't always pick and choose who you'll be leading. So before you say, 'Lord, send me,' ask yourself: Am I ready? Do I have what it takes?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>Lessons from Lazarus (1)-back from the dead</p>
<p>'But even now I know...' John 11:22 NKJ</p>
<p>Lazarus; the second most famous guy to die and come back to life! Not surprisingly, we can learn loads of stuff from his story, and we're going to look at that over the next two days.</p>
<p>Lesson one: Jesus knows how you feel. He knows what it's like to lose someone you care about (read John 11:35-36). God isn't a holy power-pack who raises the dead, He totally sympathises with us too.</p>
<p>Lesson two: Jesus can give you back what life's taken from you. Claim the promise of Joel 2:25. Martha (Lazarus' sister) realised that with God, it's never too late. She said, 'Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died. But even now I know that whatever You ask of God, God will give You.' (John 11:21-22 NKJ) Don't pray 'if only', but pray 'even now I know' with faith that God can do it.</p>
<p>Lesson three: Jesus can set you free. Read the story in John 11 for yourself, and see how God's Word was greater than the grave clothes that bound Lazarus. It's greater than whatever it is that binds or limits you too.</p>
<p>You may not completely understand it, but if you trust that He knows what you're going through, He can restore what you've lost. And He will set you free! Pray that your faith will grow and you'll be amazed that things that seem impossible will be changed by God.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>Lessons from Lazarus (2)-the bigger picture</p>
<p>'...that the Son of God may be glorified through it.' John 11:4 NKJ</p>
<p>The next three lessons today:</p>
<p>Lesson four: God has a bigger and better plan in mind. You may wonder why Jesus waited four days before sorting Lazarus out. Here are two reasons: (a) so there would be no doubt about the miracle. In those days lots of Jews believed the spirit only left the dead body when four days had past. So if Jesus had stepped in earlier, they'd have claimed that Lazarus wasn't really dead (b) so that our faith is strengthened. Jesus said, 'I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, that you may believe...' (John 11:15 NKJ) In life, crises will come and go, and be different each time. What must always stay strong is your faith.</p>
<p>Lesson five: God will ask you to face the facts and deal with the stench. Martha wanted Lazarus to be alive, but didn't want the stink of death when the stone moved. When you're praying and God tells you to do something, it's for a reason; until you do it, you can't win! So move your stone and face that stink!</p>
<p>Lesson six: God wants to make you a living testimony. Everywhere Lazarus went afterwards, he didn't even have to open his mouth to proclaim that Jesus was his Lord; his life spoke loud and clear. God's saved you and raised you up to do the same. Don't just talk the talk, but walk the walk too. Is your life a living testimony today?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>You're in it together</p>
<p>'...whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus...' Colossians 3:17 NIV</p>
<p>Every one of us has to work in some way, whether it's at school, college, uni, job or home. But most of us 'work' by ourselves which we're not meant to do. We're told to do everything in the name of Jesus, not just some things. So today, why not make the decision, whatever you're doing, to do it together with Jesus? Tell Him now that you want to go through the day with Him. John Ortberg says: '...when you have a tough problem, ask Him for help. When you have a difficult decision to make, ask Him for wisdom, then listen and be really open. When you find your energy flagging, ask Him for renewed strength. When you find your attitude turning negative, ask Him to re-focus your heart...Every few hours... pause for two or three minutes. Thank Him for His help. Hand Him your worries. Ask for His energy. Every moment is an opportunity to be with Jesus. When you forget, and you will, when you mess up, and you will, remember this really important rule: there's to be no beating yourself up! Every moment is another chance. God just keeps sending them. That's grace. Every moment ... is a new chance for you to be with Him.' Remember, Jesus wants you and Him to be in it together-so why not make that your mission today, and give it a go.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[From scabs to salvation!<br />'As He was going into a village, ten men with leprosy came toward Him...' Luke 17:12 CEV<br /><br />Imagine...your fingers so numb and damaged you can't work, next your toes, and you can't walk. Now your internal organs are failing. You're all scabby, and every day you lose a bit more life-then a guy speaks to you, and suddenly you're not dying a slow, painful death anymore... you're completely restored! Read all about it in Luke 17:11-19. <br />Ok, so things may not be nearly that bad for you, but here are five helpful hints if you feel like you're losing more bits of yourself every day: (1) Turn to Jesus-make the choice to let Him help, and He'll give you back your peace and joy. (2) Shout to Him! -if you want something desperately, act like it! Lift up your voice to God, and He will hear. (3) Do it! Just do what He tells you; faith doesn't demand a reason! Don't try and bargain with God; it doesn't work! Your experience won't be the same as everyone else's. Some Jesus spoke to, some He touched, some He told to go; and they were all healed. You've got to walk it out (Luke 17:14). Each step brings you closer-but nothing happens 'til you take that first step of faith. (4) Praise Him! Only one of the ten came back and said thanks to Jesus; and He noticed. So don't forget your manners; it's much easier to ask for help next time if you've said thanks this time.<br />SoulFood: Rev 1-4, Mark 13:12-23, Ps 117, Pr 12: 20-22]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Self-controlled, not a control freak!<br />'...the fruit of the spirit is...self-control...' Galatians 5:22-23 NIV<br /><br />Everyone knows a control-freak; you know the type. Everything has to be done their way, but if anything goes wrong, it's something or someone else's fault-the weather, the devil, the in-laws! These blame games are just the surface of a need to manipulate every situation. But people don't like being manipulated, so a control-freak's relationships end up turning into power struggles. The more they try to control, the worse they feel; the worse they feel, the more they try to control. No-one wins. Don't let yourself be a control freak.<br />Instead, be self controlled. Understand that the devil can't do anything without your co-operation; and you don't have to give it! Listen, other people's actions and attitudes aren't your problem, but how you deal with them is. Remind yourself that: (a) the one person you need to control is you (b) sometimes you just have to hand people to God to let Him deal with them (c) you must ask daily for the Holy Spirit's power to help you control your reactions (check out 2 Timothy 1:7).<br />If you do that, you'll avoid becoming a blamer. You won't turn relationships into war zones. Knowing that 'the fruit of the spirit is...self-control' means understanding that the spirit won't control you, or help you control others-but will empower you to control yourself. Being self-controlled helps you to leave behind the problem to become part of the solution that God is bringing about.<br /><br />SoulFood: Rev 5-9, Mark 13:24-37, Ps 121, Pr 12: 23-24]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Gotta get through this!<br />'...keep your mind on Jesus... then you won't get discouraged and give up.' Hebrews 12:3 CEV<br /><br />Tough times suck! Especially when you don't know why everything is so pear-shaped. It's easy to be left with questions or doubts when you don't get a quick-fix answer through prayer, reading your Bible, or asking your leaders. But don't worry; you're in good company! David constantly asked 'Why?' in the Psalms and God didn't give up on him. God knew he would stick at it and get through it (Acts 13:22). Endurance isn't just about coping in tough times, but also about growing through them, and using your experience for God's glory.<br />When you feel like you're not getting answers to 'why?', start thinking, 'I gotta get through this,' and ask how you can. Today's Bible verse says: 'keep your mind on Jesus'. Keep looking forwards. Jesus endured '...the shame of being nailed to a cross, because He knew...later on He would be glad...' (Hebrews 12:2 CEV) Why would He be glad later? Because He was looking ahead, to the result of His perseverance: pleasing His Father, building His church and saving a lost world. <br />Have the same end result in focus: to please God your Father, to build the church, and to play your part in saving a lost world! So get yourself a 'Gotta get through this' mentality. Keep your eyes fixed on Jesus and He'll give you the strength to last it out, and fight on through to victory.<br /><br />SoulFood: Rev 10-14, Mark 14:1-11, Ps 4, Pr 12:25]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[From dreams to reality...<br />'Those who sow in tears will reap with...joy.' Psalm 126:5 NIV<br /><br />Do you want the good news or bad news first? Well whatever, we're going to start with the not-so-good news. When God gives you a dream to fulfil, your mates might help you on the way and cheer you on, but to see it through to the end, you'll probably have to water that dream with some tears too. Friendship can't lower the price tag of personal sacrifice that comes with God-given dreams. Sorry, there's no mid-season sale there!<br />But, the better-than-great news is that God promises when you water with your tears, there will be an awesome harvest. Read on from today's verse and you'll see! <br />It's important to recognise which part of the dream you're at. Is it time to weep or to reap? If you're in the time for tears, that's not an excuse to listen to emo music all night, turn passive and complain that life's not fair. It's about getting passionate about the stuff God's put on your heart, and crying out to Him to sort it out.<br />To know when it's time to pick all that lovely juicy fruit, you need to understand that everything in life has a season. Fruit won't grow before its time, and there's no point picking it too early or out of season; it'll just be like a watery strawberry or a rock hard pear. So get crying, and grow yourself some fruit!<br /><br />SoulFood: Rev 15-18, Mark 14:12-26, Ps 124, Pr 12:26]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Triple A and you're on your way!<br />'...like newborn babies, long for the pure milk of the Word, so that...you may grow...' 1 Peter 2:2 NAS<br /><br />Authors Howard &amp;amp; William Hendricks point out three 'A's' we need get sorted when it comes to reading our Bibles: <br />(1) Attitude: a baby grabs a bottle with a smile and we should grab our Bibles with a smile too. Just like babies need milk to live physically, we need God's Word to live spiritually. <br />(2) Appetite: you know when you're really hungry, you just can't wait for dinner, and you'd do anything to eat right now? That's what we should be like with the Bible! Psalm 19:10 says that it's 'sweeter than honey' but looking at our enthusiasm (or lack of it) for Bible study, half the time you'd think it was more like grim medicine-it tastes like sour milk but good for you in some weird way. We should think of reading God's Word like tucking into our favourite food; can't wait to eat it and can't get enough of it! Get hungry for God's word!<br />(3) Aim: the aim of Bible study is to grow, to help us be more like Jesus, to live transformed lives. It wasn't written just to satisfy curiosity, make you smarter or so you could learn geeky facts! <br />So don't just read it-study it, and see how much you change in the process.<br /><br />SoulFood: Rev 19-22, Mark 14:27-42, Ps 129, Pr 12: 27-28]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[The best trip ever!<br />'...they were waiting for a better country-a heavenly country...' Hebrews 11:16 NCV<br /><br />Think about the best holiday you've been on. Or maybe you've not yet had the opportunity to go on the holiday of a lifetime, so where would it be? Somewhere full of action, like Disneyland? Maybe exploring a historic European city? Or would adventure be your thing? White-water rafting, surfing or skiing? The Bible tells us in Ecclesiastes 3:11 NLT that 'He [God] has planted eternity in the human heart', that is, each one of us hopes for a special kind of trip, the best trip ever! All of us, at some point, think about life after death and the opportunity of spending eternity in a better place-Heaven.<br />The Bible tells us that Heaven is the best destination ever! You don't have to save up for it, or worry about extra baggage charges; it's completely free! No struggling with your suitcase, coz everything you need and more will be provided there for you! It will never disappoint nor will it end. <br />How do you get to go? Listen: '...if you confess with your mouth, &quot;Jesus is Lord&quot;, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.' (Romans 10:9 NIV) Why is it so important to believe Jesus is risen? Because if He isn't, then you can't be either. That's right-when God makes all things new (see Revelation 21) you'll get a Jesus-style resurrected body to enjoy it! Now isn't that a sweet deal! <br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Kings 5:1- 14, John 5:1-15]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Alien invasion<br />'...they were waiting for a better country-a heavenly country...' Hebrews 11:16 NCV<br /><br />Have you ever wondered 'Is there anybody out there? Do aliens exist?' Well you're not on your own. Even the media captures our imaginations with films and TV programmes about alien life and space. Scientists experiment to 'boldly go where no man has gone before'! Did you know that the Bible talks about aliens? And get this; the aliens are us! Now before you go running to the mirror to check you've not just turned green and grown an extra head, check out what alien actually means: a foreigner, a stranger.<br />Today find time to read Hebrews 11. You'll hear about great men and women of faith like Noah, Abraham, Joseph, and Rahab:<br />* because of their faith in God they did incredible things; they were 'powerful in battle and routed foreign armies...received back their dead, raised to life again.'<br />* because of their faith in God they suffered, they 'faced jeers and flogging... others were... put in prison. They were... put to death... went about... destitute, persecuted and mistreated.'<br />They all had one thing in common: 'living by faith when they died... admitted that they were aliens and strangers on earth...' They knew that 'God had planned something better.' Each one of them was 'waiting for a better country-a heavenly one.' What about you? Do you know that God has got something better for you? Well, He does! <br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Kings 1:1-4:17, Mark 14:43-52, Ps 1, Pr 13:1<br />]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[OUCH!<br />'Careless words stab like a sword, but wise words bring healing.' Proverbs 12:18 NCV<br /><br />Have you heard the saying, 'sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me'? It's not true, is it? Words can really hurt! And God knows: 'Careless words stab like a sword!' Ouch! They can be extremely destructive; check out these two situations: <br />Scene 1: an altar boy in a small country church. One day he accidentally dropped the communion wine. The priest slapped him and shouted, 'Leave, and don't come back!' That boy grew up to be General Tito, the brutal communist dictator who ruled the people of Yugoslavia for years. <br />Scene 2: an altar boy in a big city cathedral. One day he accidentally dropped the communion wine. His bishop turned to him and whispered reassuringly, 'It's ok, some day you'll be a great priest.' That boy grew up to be Archbishop Fulton Sheen, whose sermons touched the hearts of millions on national television. <br />Words either build people up or tear them down. YOUR words either build people up or tear people down. When you speak, make sure no-one says, 'OUCH!' You must do these things to enjoy life and have many happy days. You must not say evil things (see 1 Peter 3:10). Feeling hurt by someone's words? Then let God's Word build you up: You are '...fearfully and wonderfully made...' (Psalm 139:14 NIV), '...My unfailing love for you will not be shaken...' (Isaiah 54:10 NIV)<br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Kings 4:18-6:33, Mark 14:53-65, Ps 48, Pr 13:2-3]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Sleeping habits <br />'...The Lord gives sleep to those He loves.' Psalm 127:2 NCV<br /><br />Catching Zeds. Land of nod. Catnap. Dreamland. Dozing. SLEEP: we all need it! And your sleeping habits are important to God!<br />SLEEP: do you try to avoid it by living off energy drinks? Miss out on two or three days because you do too much of it? Messed up or missed out because of lack of it? You know what? It's hard to think, feel and act like Jesus when you're tired and lacking sleep. That's why God is concerned about your sleeping habits. He wants to 'give sleep to those he loves'. That's you! Here's how to rest and get the best sleeping habits. <br />Stressed? : Jesus says, 'Come to Me...you who are tired and have heavy loads... learn from Me... and you will find rest for your lives.' (Matthew 11:28-29 NCV) <br />Lethargic? : 'He gives strength to those who are tired and more power to those who are weak.' (Isaiah 40:29 NCV)<br />Everything will be ok! : 'He lets me rest... He leads me on paths that are right... I will not be afraid.' (Psalm 23:2-4 NCV) <br />Every week! : 'Anyone who enters God's rest will rest from his work as God did.' (Hebrews 4:10 NCV)<br />Promise! : 'God has left us the promise that we may enter His rest, let us be very careful so none... fail to enter.' (Hebrews 4:1 NCV)<br />Stressed? Lethargic? Everything will be ok, Every week, Promise! SLEEP WELL :)<br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Kings 7-9, Mark 14:66-72, Ps 132:1-10, Pr 13:4-6]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Love letters (1)<br />'...You have left the love you had in the beginning.' Revelation 2:4 NCV<br /><br />Imagine getting a letter from Jesus! How amazing would that be? <br />There you are, sitting in Church. It's just like any other Sunday until there's an announcement; your Church has received a letter directly from the Name Above All Names Himself. Wow! It starts off great. Jesus obviously knows what's happening and He seems pretty chuffed with it all. Then the letter continues, 'But I have this against you: You have left the love you had in the beginning.' Your heart sinks! Your Church has been so busy doing stuff, forgetting who they're doing it for! They've stopped loving Jesus! <br />Your immediate reaction is: What? You look around the congregation to see who's responsible; after all it couldn't possibly be your fault, right? But the letter continues: Jesus is holding you all responsible! He's disappointed with you all. Gutted! You think it's all over. But then you realise that Jesus is telling you how to fix the problem and there is hope. <br />That's pretty much what happened to the Church in Ephesus (read all about it in Revelation 2!) but every day the same thing is happening in churches all over the world. We need to stop, listen and then ask Jesus to help us put right what we're doing wrong. We need to fix our eyes on Him once again and rediscover our first love for Him. After all, He promises: '...I will build My Church...' (Matthew 16:18 NCV)<br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Kings 10-12, Mark 15:1-20, Ps 132:11-18, Pr 13:7-8]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Love letters (2)<br />'...You have left the love you had in the beginning.' Revelation 2:4 NCV<br /><br />If you've ever fallen in love you'll recognise the symptoms: Your mind is consumed with thoughts of the other person, you can't stop talking to them, texting, emailing. You chat online, over the phone and can't wait for the moment when you are in each other's company for that special one-to-one time! You want to know everything about them-what they like, what they don't like-you laugh with them, you cry with them, you want to share everything about you with them. Being in love affects how you act, what you choose to do or not do. Being in love is wonderful... but then comes that awful moment when you realise that person isn't quite so interested in you anymore. They seem a bit distant, they don't talk to you as much, there's no more silly texts or loving gifts... until there's... no more... they have left you... and your heart breaks!<br />When Jesus said to the Church in Ephesus, 'You have left the love you had in the beginning,' He was talking about Himself. They had left Him! He was still there, but they had left Him, alone, heartbroken. They didn't love Him anymore!<br />When love is gone you miss out on all the benefits that person brought into your life. If you're like the Church in Ephesus and have walked away from Jesus and stopped loving Him, then you need to bring that love back, so you don't miss out.<br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Kings 13-15, Mark 15:21-32, Ps 143, Pr 13:9-10]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Love letters (3)<br />'...You have left the love you had in the beginning.' Revelation 2:4 NCV<br /><br />Your computer crashes so you ring the helpline to try to get it sorted out. Your mobile dies so take it to the shop, hoping they'll swap it for a new one. But how can you fix a relationship that's gone horribly wrong? <br />What if, just like the Church in Ephesus, you've stopped loving Jesus? How do you fix that? Can you fix it? Should you fix it? YES! All you need to do is remember! <br />Remember the best times you had with Jesus: Jesus said, '...I came to give life-life in all its fullness.' (John 10:10 NCV) Remember what Jesus has done: 'In Christ we are set free... we have forgiveness of sins.' (Ephesians 1:7 NCV) Remember what you did then, that you don't do now: '...give yourselves completely to God. Stand against the devil and he will run from you.' (James 4:7 NCV) Remember what you would be missing out on: 'When people's steps follow the Lord, God is pleased with their ways. If they stumble, they will not fall, because the Lord holds their hand.' (Psalm 37:23-24 NCV) Remember, whatever is troubling you, Jesus can help: Jesus said, 'Don't let your hearts be troubled...trust in Me.' (John 14:1 NCV) Remember that Jesus has never stopped loving you: 'Nothing...in the whole world will ever be able to separate us from the love of God that is in ...Jesus...' (Romans 8:39 NCV) <br />'Come near to God and God will come near to you...' (James 4:8 NCV)<br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Kings 16:1-18:16, Mark 15:33-47, Ps 80:1-11, Pr 13:11-12]]></introtext>

Practically everyone enjoys munching on a morsel of a tasty tantalising treat of chocoliciousness! Chocolate's everywhere, tantalising shoppers with their bright wrappers and foil linings... Ok this isn't a commercial break; you get the picture! <br />Anyway the point is, as soon as you're out of the shop with your chocolate bar, are you interested in the wrapper? Er, no; it's what's inside that matters. You're after the chocolate! That shiny wrapper is no longer of interest; it's just rubbish! So if you were to throw the chocolate away and eat the wrapper, everyone would think you'd gone crazy, right? After all, why throw away the best bit and leave yourself with the rubbish? Madness! The wrapper is only attractive when it's got the chocolate inside. <br />In a similar way, our lives become attractive to others when they are filled with Jesus. We only find our true purpose when we put Jesus at the centre of our lives. That's why Paul says, 'We have this treasure from God, but we are like clay jars that hold the treasure.' Treasure in clay pots; chocolate in plastic wrappers; same difference. Keep your ego in check. Paul says: 'We have this treasure,' he didn't say we are the treasure! <br /><br />SoulFood: Gen 11:1-9, Phil 2:1-11]]></introtext>

Trusting: Trusting Jesus will do what He's said (John 6:40). Only found in Jesus: Not another religion or well-meaning people (Acts 20:21). Confident in God: Being certain what God has said will happen, will happen! (Hebrews11:1). Grow: Helping you to be useful and productive (2 Peter 1:5-8). Used: If you don't use it, you lose it! (James 2:14). Powerful: A little can do much! (Luke17:5-6) Given by God: It's a free gift that saves us (Ephesians 2:8-9).<br />The Bible tells us in Ephesians 6, that true faith is often revealed in us when we're under attack from the enemy. And when you see what it does, you can understand why! But we need never worry, because God gives us all we need to protect ourselves. We have spiritual armour, but don't just read about it-use it! <br />A Roman soldier's shield protected him from head to toe. It was made of iron, upholstered in thick layers of fabric, and saturated in water when going to battle. Consequently the flaming arrows of the enemy fizzled on contact. Today '...put on the full armour of God...take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.' (Ephesians 6:13-16 NIV)<br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Kings 18:17-20:21, Mark 16:1-20, Ps 80:12-19, Pr 13:13-16]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Happy Days :)<br />'...when you have many... troubles, you should be full of joy.' James 1:2 NCV<br /><br />You stand in front of the mirror scrutinising every inch of your face. Agonising that your nose is too big and you're getting another spot; right on the end of it. That boiled egg you made isn't runny, your toast's gone soggy and the milk's run out! You're washing up your breakfast dishes and you drop your phone in the sink. You wipe it dry but the screen is blank. And now you can't find your keys and the dog's taken your wallet and gone off to bury it. It's only 8 am and already you're thinking (delete as appropriate): (a) could this day get any worse? (b) Aaaaagggggggggggghhhh! (c) I'm gonna kick that dog! (d) all these troubles are making me full of joy!<br />So are you thinking (a), (b), (c) or (d)? How many of us naturally think (d)? But that's what God wants us to do; '...when you have many kinds of troubles, you should be full of joy, because you know that these troubles test your faith, and this will give you patience. Let your patience show itself perfectly in what you do. Then you will be perfect and complete and have everything that you need.' (James 1:2 NCV) When God puts it like that, you can see what He's saying, can't you?<br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Kings 21-23, Luke 1:1-10, Ps 73:1-16, Pr 13:17-19]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Double standards.<br />'...You are like tombs that are painted white...' Matthew 23:27 NCV<br /><br />When you read about the life of Jesus in the first four books of the New Testament- Matthew, Mark, Luke and John- you often come across a group of people called the Pharisees. They were a powerful group of Jewish religious leaders. They didn't believe Jesus was the Son of God, instead they were convinced He was a devious impostor. They followed Jesus around everywhere, constantly trying to trick Him, so they could arrest Him. But their questioning of Jesus suddenly came to an end one day when Jesus asked them a question they were unable to answer. After that they were too scared to ask any more! Read about it in Matthew 22:41-46.<br />Jesus wasn't impressed with their behaviour at all. He said to them, 'Pharisees! You are hypocrites! You are like tombs that are painted white. Outside, those tombs look fine, but inside, they are full of the bones of dead people and all kinds of unclean things.' (Matthew 23:27 NCV)<br />How sad! The Bible tells us that, '...People look at the outside of a person, but the Lord looks at the heart...' (1 Samuel 16:7 NCV) Jesus knew that the Pharisees made themselves look great to people watching, but inside their thoughts and attitudes were all wrong. Jesus let the Pharisees know they were getting it wrong, big time, with their double standards! Don't you make the same mistake! <br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Kings 24-25, Luke 1:11-25, Ps 73:17-28, Pr 13:20]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[The meaning of life<br />'...I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received...' Ephesians 4:1 NIV<br /><br />Paul says, 'I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received.' What would that life look like? <br />Well, that life isn't about keeping score. It's not about how many friends you have on Facebook, and it's not about who you've dated, are dating or haven't dated but would like to! It isn't about what sport you play or how well you did or didn't play last week. It's not about your shoes or your hair or the colour of your skin, or where you live or go to school. In fact, it's not about grades, money, clothes or even about whether that university accepts you or not. Life isn't about if you have lots of friends, or if you are alone, and it's not about how accepted or unaccepted you are. Life just isn't about that.<br />But life is about choosing to love, not hate. It's about trust, contentment and compassion. It's about sticking up for your friends and praying for your enemies. Life is about avoiding jealousy, overcoming ignorance and encouraging others. It's about what you say and what you mean. It's about seeing people for who they are and not what they have. Most of all, it's about choosing to use your life to touch someone else's in a way that could never have been achieved otherwise. These choices are what life's about. <br /><br />SoulFood: Hosea 1-5, Luke 1:26-38, Ps 139:1-6, Pr 13:21-23]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[How Much?<br />'...you are precious...I love you...' Isaiah 43:4 NIV<br /><br />'How much are the puppies?' the boy asked the pet shop owner. 'Anything from $75 to $125,' he replied. 'Can I have a look at them?' One puppy was lagging behind the rest and straight away the boy asked, 'What's wrong with that one?' The pup didn't have a hip socket. It would always limp. <br />'That's the one I want to buy,' said the boy. 'You don't want to buy that little dog', said the shopkeeper. 'If you really want him, I'll just give him to you.' The boy looked sad. 'I don't want you to give him to me. That little dog is worth every bit as much as all the other dogs and I'll pay full price'. The shopkeeper insisted, 'You really don't want to buy this one. He's never going to be able to play like the other puppies.' The boy stood back from the counter and revealed his own badly twisted leg, supported by a metal brace, 'Well I don't run so well myself, and this little puppy will need someone who understands!'<br />We can sometimes think we are useless, not worth as much as everyone else. But Jesus knows differently: 'But God shows His great love for us in this way: Christ died for us while were still sinners.' (Romans 5:8 NCV) Psalm 139:2-3 NCV says 'You know my thoughts... You know where I go... You know everything I do...' We can sometimes think that no-one understands us, but God does!<br /><br />SoulFood: Hosea 6-10, Luke 1:39-56, Ps 139:7-12, Pr 13:24]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Just say No!<br />'...put all evil things out of your life...' Colossians 3:5 NCV<br /><br />Ever had one of those stuffed toys where you squeeze the paw and it barks, moos or whatever - depends on the animal I guess :) Anyway, one that says &quot;Jesus says no!&quot; might be a real asset with our daily decision making. The only way we are going to 'Put all evil things out of our lives' is by saying, 'Jesus says no!' and making good choices that let nothing evil into our lives. And if anything is in there already or sneaks in through a window, 'put these things out of your life.' (Colossians 3:8 NCV) <br />The best way to keep bad things out of your life is by filling your life up with good things. Here are four good things the Bible teaches us to do to start us off: (1) stop craving things you don't need. Instead enjoy what you've got (2) if you're not giving generously to God's work, start now! Make a habit of giving away a percentage of whatever comes your way. 'Give freely and become more wealthy; be stingy and lose everything.' (Proverbs 11:24-25 NLT) Yes, even give a bit of your pocket money-even 50c of that five bucks from your Nana! (3) trust God completely, with everything. God guarantees to 'supply all your needs.' (Philippians 4:19 NLT) <br />Go ahead, do it! Obey God, be patient, and watch what happens.<br /><br />SoulFood: Hosea 11-14, Luke 1:57-66, Ps 139:13-24, Pr 13:25]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[It's kickin' off in here!<br />'...fight hard for the faith...' Jude 3:3 NCV<br /><br />Is God really telling us to fight? And not just fight, but fight hard? Well, before you go punching someone's lights out, listen up! God isn't telling you to 'kick off' every time someone disagrees with what you believe. Nor is He telling you to 'beat the living daylights' out of any of your mates who try and talk you out of going to Church! And He's definitely not asking you to have a slanging match with the next person who calls you a 'Bible Basher'! <br />If someone is overweight, then they might be encouraged to 'fight the flab'. This doesn't mean they are being asked to beat themselves up literally, does it? What they're saying is use all your inner strength and willpower to keep those kilos from piling on. Eat all the right foods and take the right exercise to make this possible.<br />In a similar way, when God tells us, 'Fight hard for the faith,' He is asking us to do everything we can to keep our focus and attention on Jesus. Don't compromise what the Bible tells you. Believe it and live by it! Fighting involves: (1) Training: Don't get discouraged and give up. (2)Readiness: There's no time off being a Christian! (3) Action: Fight to win! 'I do not mean that I am already as God wants me to be... but I continue trying to reach it and make it mine...' (Philippians 3:12 NCV)<br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Kings 17:1-7, 1 Kings 18:41-46, Mark 4:35-41]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Don't be a Drifter<br />'...fight hard for the faith...' Jude 3:3 NCV<br /><br />There's nothing like the feeling of just lying back on an inflatable lilo as it bobs up and down on the gentle waves. Mmmm, the sun shining down, just close your eyes for a minute and reeeelax. Then AAAAH! You open your eyes and you've drifted out to sea on the tide! One minute you're catching the rays, bobbing around the waves, and now you're way out at sea fighting for your life! Maybe you think you'd never be stupid enough to do that but you could still be a drifter. If you've ever day-dreamed, drifted away in your thoughts when you should have been paying attention in class or in a meeting, or during the pastor's talk on a Sunday, then listen up today. <br />Drifting can be a dangerous habit, because it makes you think everything is ok until it's too late! Drift off in class and it's no problem until you're sitting with that exam paper in front of you and you don't know the answers! Hebrews 2:1 says, 'We must pay more careful attention, therefore, to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away.' God's telling us that it's important we pay attention to the truth about Him, otherwise we'll drift away and believe lies. Paying careful attention is hard work! Every day pray: 'Today God, help me live so close to You, that whoever comes into contact with me, comes into contact with You!'<br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 1-3, Luke 1:67-80, Ps 144:1-8, Pr 14:1-4]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Keep it real!<br />'I thank my God every time I remember you.' Philippians 1:3 NIV<br /><br />Revision! Uggh! Exams! Aargh! Trying to recall, names, dates, places, symbols, formulas, equations! Remembering things can be so difficult! But when life gets really difficult, it's important to remember good things. Paul was a prisoner in Rome when he wrote to the Church at Philippi. But he didn't write to have a moan or to ask for a cake with a file in! 'I thank my God every time I remember you.' Paul's letter was really cheerful! 'Be full of joy in the Lord always. I will say again, be full of joy.' (Philippians 4:4 NCV) How encouraging it must have been for the Philippians to receive a letter like that! Hearing how he was praying for them!<br />Paul got it right. When life's full of more downs than ups, it's good to stop and think about all the good people God has brought into your life, who have encouraged you and supported you and then, take some time to let them know you're thanking God for them! But don't just wait 'til life gets tough! Let those who have encouraged you always be a part of your life. P-ray for them and let them know you're thinking of them, A-ct on the good stuff they've taught you, R-emember them often, T-hank God for bringing them into your life and ask Him to help you become a great encouragement to someone too! <br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 4-6, Luke 2:1-7, Ps 144:9-15, Pr 14:5-8]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Just do it!<br />'...God made us to do good works, which God planned in advance for us to live our lives doing.' Ephesians 2:10 NCV<br /><br />Being a Christian is about having a living relationship with Jesus that affects the way we live life every day. As we listen to Him and follow in His footsteps our lives start to look radically different from the people around us. Mother Teresa's life is an example of that. This was written on a sign on the wall of her children's home in Calcutta:<br />'People are often unreasonable, illogical, and self-centred; forgive them anyway. If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfish, ulterior motives; be kind anyway. If you are successful, you will win some false friends and some true enemies; succeed anyway. If you are honest and frank, people may cheat you; be honest and frank anyway. What you spend years building, someone could destroy overnight; build anyway. If you find happiness, they may be jealous; be happy anyway. The good you do today, people will often forget tomorrow; do good anyway. Give the world the best you have, and it may never be enough; give the world the best you've got anyway. You see, in the final analysis, it is between you and God; it was never between you and them anyway.'<br />'God made you to do good works, which God planned in advance for you' to live your life doing. Don't worry about what everyone else is doing or not doing; you just go ahead and do the good works He's planned you to do. <br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 7-9, Luke 2:8-20, Ps 8, Pr 14:9-12]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Take up your cross (1)<br />'...Let him...take up his cross daily...' Luke 9:23 NKJ<br /><br />'Let him...take up his cross daily...' (Luke 9:23 NKJ) 'The load I give you to carry is light'. (Matthew 11:30 NCV) Both sentences passed through the mouth of Jesus. But isn't He contradicting Himself? I mean, 'cross-carrying' is back-breaking work, isn't it? Unless You're about to give us a polystyrene cross, surely the load You give us is one famed for dislocating your shoulder, right, Lord? <br />Well, no. It's a perspective thing. If you think of God as dishing out crosses like a needle-happy nurse dishes out pain so no-one wants their jab but everyone gets one, then you're in trouble. If we see 'difficult maths homework' or 'the mate who's always draining me' as 'the cross we have to bear', is it any wonder our load feels far from light? What if you saw that 'difficult maths homework', not as a headache, but an opportunity to develop your problem solving skills? What if that 'moaning mate' wasn't the person you hid from at break, but someone who you can see the face of Jesus in?<br />Taking up your cross doesn't mean taking the weight of the world on your shoulders. It simply means taking on Jesus' attitude to everything. So, rather than beg God to send a bolt of lightning up that 'pain in the neck' of a pal, ask God for a new perspective. Stop asking for a lighter cross and start praying for a stronger back.<br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 10-13, Luke 2:21-33, Ps 17, Pr 14:13-16]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Take up your cross (2)<br />'...Let him...take up his cross daily...' Luke 9:23 NKJ<br /><br />Monday morning, you're about to leave for work/school/uni. Checklist: Bus fare; Check. Lunch money; Check. Four-metre bloodied, splintered cross; Check.... 'er, say what?' Yeah, what did You mean, Lord, when You said we're to take up our cross daily? There's no room in my bag for a 2000 year old form of the death penalty. So, what will my cross look like?<br />Well, your cross is made to measure. It's custom built to your size. David was custom built to lead a nation, because he'd had years of practice leading sheep. What are you well practiced in? Your cross will fit your shoulders. What weight bears down on your shoulders? Do you feel the weight of someone's hurt? Perhaps, you're called to pray for that person. Do images of starving children bear down on your compassion? Perhaps, your cross is all about raising money for a related charity.<br />Your cross will look like you. The Bible says God '...has given each one of us a special gift...' (Ephesians 4:7 NLT) So, you thought you were just a blabbermouth, God sees you with the 'gift of the gab'. God will use your big mouth for big stuff. Or if you're the opposite, you think you're cursed with shyness. God sees you with the 'present of peace'. God uses your calming effect on His world to bring about His peace.<br />So, do you still think that cross is too heavy to carry?<br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 14-17, Luke 2:34-40, Ps 21, Pr 14:17-20]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Frequent encounters with God!<br />'...These are the Scriptures that testify about Me.' John 5:39 NIV<br /><br />Whether it's an overweight, out-of-touch grandad with a beard to rival Father Christmas' or a super-tolerant hippy waving peace signs with his fingers from the sky, chances are your picture of God is wrong. <br />The Bible isn't one of those kiss-'n-tell biographies where the middle of the book is peppered with glossy pics of God. No, better than that, it draws for us outlines of who God is. Genesis tells us God is an artist. He draws up a vast universe from His imagination. Exodus shows us God the deliverer. A people crushed by slavery are brought to freedom by following God. The point is: if you want a portrait of God, the brushstrokes are found throughout the Bible. Jesus is the perfect snapshot of God, He even says so Himself: 'Anyone who has seen Me has seen the Father.' (John 14:9 NIV) So what? God wears sandals and could do with a haircut, is that the point? Not exactly: Jesus was making the face of God known through what He did. He loved. So God has a face of love. He healed. So God has hands of healing. He died for us to show God's all-out, nothing-held-back-from-us love.<br />What does God look like? See for yourself. Check in with Him today.<br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 18-21, Luke 2:41-52, Ps 59:1-8, Pr 14:21-22]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[You're growing up spiritually when...<br />'...let us...go on to maturity...' Hebrews 6:1 NIV<br /><br />Ah, remember the good old days when if you wanted something from the supermarket all you had to do was scream annoyingly and painfully loudly until your Mum gave in. Or if that didn't work, you still had the old 'lying on the shop floor punching and kicking the air' trick up your sleeve. Or failing that, a simple 'I hate you!' bawled from the top of your lungs practiced as a regular routine. Yeah, funny how those little temper tantrum tactics don't go down so well when you're out of the pram for good. The point is: you're supposed to be growing up by now. Well, guess what?! It's the same with our faith!<br />It's no use throwing a hissy fit when your plans and God's plans don't match. It's time to grow up! It does us no good going all goggle-eyed over the latest shiny toys when we know those toys will pull us away from God. No, it's time to grow up! Screaming about this, whinging about that, kicking and punching our way through situations is not a sign of a mature Christian. It's a sign we're still in spiritual nappies. When Hebrews goes on about 'Let us...go on to maturity', it's telling us to put down the dummy, get out of the pram and start living with a mature faith. In other words, stop being a baby and start being a grown up. <br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Kings 17:17-24, Mark 5:21-43, John 11:1-45]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Tough love (1)<br />'I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go...' Psalm 32:8 NKJ<br /><br />Some things are harder to forgive than others. Some people are harder to forgive than others. Sometimes the things we go through are not what God wants for us. God knows the pain you feel and has seen the tears you've cried for yourself. God is for you, not against you. So does God want us to forgive the people who have caused us all the pain? When you're sore from your wounds, this is a tricky idea to get your head round. It may feel like to forgive them is almost like excusing what they've done to you. But that's not how forgiveness works at all. History's biggest statement of forgiveness was said by an innocent man hanging from a torture instrument: 'Father, forgive them...they do not know what they are doing.' (Luke 23:34 NIV) Jesus wasn't excusing what they'd done to Him but He was praying forgiveness over their actions. Pretty heavenly stuff, I'm sure you agree. Forgiveness doesn't require you to take the abuse. Forgiveness doesn't ask you to remain in a dangerous situation. Forgiveness doesn't mean pretending the stuff never happened. Forgiveness is about freeing yourself from the hurt. This isn't easy medicine to swallow. Perhaps, you feel you could never forgive this particular offence. Well don't be too hard on yourself, perhaps your first step isn't to forgive, perhaps your first move is all about crying on God's shoulder. <br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 22-24, Luke 3:1-10, Ps 59:9-17, Pr 14:23-24]]></introtext>

Luke 23:34 NIV<br /><br />Yesterday, we looked at the most incredible words of forgiveness: 'Forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.' But what if they did know what they were doing to you? What if they weren't even sorry? Are you still supposed to forgive even then? And if you do, does that mean you're a doormat? <br />True forgiveness isn't easy. It takes a lot of courage and a lot of time. In a way it's not about them, it's more about you. Forgiveness is about you freeing yourself from what has been done to you. Forgiveness is part of your healing. Forgiveness is your pathway to a future free of self-destruction. <br />Remember: by forgiving you're not excusing, you're releasing your pain. But where do you start? How can you forgive when all you feel is hatred? Firstly, acknowledge that 'hatred' is a feeling; you're entitled to your feelings. Forgiveness is a choice not a feeling. Secondly, seek God on what to do with these feelings. God's shoulder is infinitely big enough for you to cry on. Thirdly, ask God to help you with the impossible. Yes, by human standards forgiveness may be out of the question, but seek God on it and ask Him to bring you to a place where you can forgive. Finally, receive the goodness of God: 'Heal me, Lord, for my bones are in agony.' (Psalm 6:2 NLT)<br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 25-27, Luke 3:11-20, Ps 64, Pr 14:25-28]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[The right stuff <br />'...where your treasure is, there your heart will be...' Matthew 6:21 NIV<br /><br />Stuff. It comes in all shapes and sizes. Some stuff is nice and shiny and costs a bit of that papery stuff. Some stuff is small and compact and makes clever bleeping noises. Some stuff is old, very old, and that's what makes it collectable. Some stuff we might love. Some stuff other people might love, so they steal it. Some countries have better stuff. Some countries fight other countries for this better stuff. Some stuff lands people behind bars. Some stuff costs people their lives. But it's all just 'stuff'. Do you get it? Jesus said some pretty famous stuff on the subject of 'stuff', only He substituted the word 'treasure'. Listen: 'Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.' (Matthew 6:19-21 NIV) Thing is, whatever 'stuff' you're stacking your chips on, it had better be worth it. You're not so thick as to believe all the answers are found in bright, shiny, bleeping, collectable stuff, are you? You know the only stuff that really matters is the God stuff, the people stuff, the love stuff. Choose the right stuff!<br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 28-30, Luke 3:21-38, Ps 95, Pr 14:29-33]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[The roller-coaster ride of life (1)<br />'He has made everything appropriate in its time...' Ecclesiastes 3:11 NAS<br /><br />So, if you were God, what would you do? Snap your fingers and wham! Those pimples would be gone forever. Clap your hands, and hey presto! A six-pack stomach in place of that flabby mid-riff. Blink your eyes, and that miserable drizzly weather changes to perfect sunshine. Well, guess what? Check your birth certificate or passport; you're not God! And if you're not the perfect author of the universe, chances are that you're prone to the odd zit or two; you're likely to sweat in the summer and freeze in the winter. That's life. It's just the way it is. <br />On a more serious note, there might be some pretty nasty stuff you're going through at the moment and you just wish that God would snap His fingers and it would all vanish into thin air. But hey, you know life doesn't work like that. Thing is, God isn't a vending machine. You don't place your prayer into the slot and instantly get your wish out the bottom. Being a Christian doesn't exempt us from life's hassles. Actually, Jesus sort of promised the opposite: '...on earth you will have many trials...' (John 16:33 NLT) But here's the good news. If you're experiencing a bit of a cold season in your life at the moment, it won't always be so chilly. The sunny times are always just around the corner. Why? Because there's a season for everything.<br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 31-32, Luke 4:1-13, Ps 98, Pr 14:34]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[The roller-coaster ride of life (2)<br />'He has made everything appropriate in its time...' Ecclesiastes 3:11 NAS<br /><br />Life often seems to be up one minute, down the next. The Bible gives us some brilliant examples. Elijah rode life's rollercoaster: one minute he was scaling the heights of God's almighty victories, the next he was hurtling to an all time emotional low where he wanted his life to be over. Jesus felt the extremes of life's highs and lows too. At the start of one week the crowds were singing his praises, a few days later they were yelling for him to hang him from a cross. Paul had a similar rollercoaster experience. One minute people were hailing him as some kind of god come down from the heavens, the next they were picking up sharp, dangerous objects to throw in his direction. Every major figure in the Bible had their 'wind in the hair' high moment of victory, but also their moment of gut wrenching nose-dive towards the abyss. <br />Life isn't one endless upward climb or a dark pit that keeps on spiralling downwards: it's a rollercoaster! <br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 33:1-36:26, Luke 4:14-30, Ps 102:1-11, Pr 14:35-15:2]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[The roller-coaster ride of life (3)<br />'He has made everything appropriate in its time...' Ecclesiastes 3:11 NAS<br /><br />CS Lewis (the author of The Chronicles of Narnia) also wrote a book imagining what it's like to be a devil who wants to stop a Christian loving God. In The Screwtape Letters, he writes this: 'Do not be deceived, Wormwood. Our cause is never in greater danger than when a human, no longer desiring, but still intending to do our Enemy's will, looks around upon a universe from which every trace of Him seems to have vanished, asks why he has been forsaken, and still obeys!' The point CS Lewis is making is that the devil loses it when we choose to follow God no matter what. When nothing seems to make sense, when it feels like God hasn't said 'hello' in a while, when everything else screams at us to throw off this whole silly God-nonsense, but still we choose to go on trusting... that's the kind of faith, the devil can't chip away. That's the kind of faith proven gold in the eyes of God. <br />So, you mean, when it feels like everything has gone dark, I'm actually proving my faith is gold? EXACTLY. Textbook example: Jesus. Where does Jesus' ministry begin: in front of a huge cheering crowd? Far from it. It begins in the dark, dry place of the desert. Do you feel a bit stuck out in the desert? Perhaps, that's where you're supposed to be. <br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 36:27-40:16, Luke 4:31-44, Ps 102:12-17, Pr 15:3]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[The roller-coaster ride of life (4)<br />'He has made everything appropriate in its time...' Ecclesiastes 3:11 NAS<br /><br />Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. It sounds like a pretty expensive law firm at the top of a shiny office building, doesn't it? Well, these three weren't lawyers, but they were firm on God's law. You see, a foreign king had ideas above his station; he wanted people to bow down to him as if he were some sort of living God. This was clearly against God's law. So when our Jewish trio refuse to bend a knee in the king's direction, they had a problem. A problem punishable by death, and not just any death. Death in an oversize pizza oven! So, what should our guys do: (a) apologise quick-smart and get on with the business of grovelling? (b) make a run for it; go find a place to live where the ruler hasn't got such an inflated ego? or (c) stick to their principles and burn for the sake of it?<br />Our heroes chose the third option. Doh! Come on, what good are principles when your body's about to go up in flames. So what was going through their minds? Well... in Daniel 3:17 NKJ the guys say 'Our God...is able to deliver us'. They never doubted God's ability. '...And He will deliver us.' They never doubted God's intention. 'But if not...we will not...worship the golden image.' (Daniel 3:18 NKJ) They never considered an alternative to God. They had to go through to get through. And so do you. <br /><br />SoulFood: Is 53:2-12, Acts 8:26-40]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[The roller-coaster ride of life (5)<br />'He has made everything appropriate in its time...' Ecclesiastes 3:11 NAS<br /><br />You'd be a bit 'wisdom-challenged' to un-strap yourself from the safety rails of a rollercoaster whilst it was still 50m in the air. Sure, your digestive system may be telling you to get off the ride, but you can't bail out mid-ride, can you? Well, ditto to your faith life. Just because you're feeling a bit sick to the stomach of Church, or other Christians make you want to throw up, you'd be a little bit dumb to bail out on God now. You might want to give up God, but God won't give up on you. He promises, He'll '...never leave you nor forsake you [so]...do not be discouraged.' (Deuteronomy 31:8 NIV) You might not have faith in God, but God is still faithful to you. His Word says, 'If we are faithless, He will remain faithful, for He cannot disown Himself.' (2 Timothy 2:13 NIV) God will get you through it and out of it. He promises us an exit. '...when you are tempted, He will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it.' (1 Corinthians 10:13 NIV) You see bad; God makes good. He's producing good in all your circumstances. 'And we know that all things work together for good to them...who are the called...' (Romans 8:28 KJV) God puts pits and peaks together, and out comes your good. <br />So stay strapped in for the ride! <br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 41-44, Luke 5:1-11, Ps 102:18-28, Pr 15:4-7]]></introtext>

You're a spotty teenager, in need of a growth spurt, your only work experience is sheep-minding and you're expected to fight a mammoth of a man. A trained blood-thirsty military monster. Goliath: a man who'd turn superman's red knickers a darker shade of brown. He's armed head to toe in the best custom-built armour the military can buy, you're wearing the leftover nightie from last year's school nativity play. He's got a blade of steel larger than your entire body; you have a stone and a playground catapult. Just to add final insult to injury, the only small chink in his armour is the face of his helmet; hardly any kind of target. I mean, come on...as if!<br />Well, when it comes to giant-problems, take a stone out of David's bag. David knew Goliath was big, but as big as God?! You see, like everyone else David heard Goliath's fighting talk. 'When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were...greatly afraid.' (1 Samuel 17:11 NKJ) But, unlike the rest, he cottoned on they were just hot air... Everyone else's knees may have been knocking but he was standing firm in God. Yes, the odds were stacked; there was only a small space between the chin and the eyebrows to aim at, but God made sure David hit the target! <br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 45-48, Luke 5:12-26, Ps 110, Pr 15:8-9]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Don't keep your love in a box!    <br />'...She broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head.' Mark 14:3 NIV<br /><br />'A woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume...She broke the jar and poured the perfume on His head. Some of those present were saying indignantly to one another, &quot;Why this waste of perfume? It could have been sold...and the money given to the poor.&quot; And they rebuked her harshly. &quot;Leave her alone,&quot; said Jesus... &quot;She has done a beautiful thing...The poor you will always have with you... But you will not always have Me. She did what she could. She poured perfume on My body beforehand to prepare for My burial. I tell you... wherever the gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her.&quot;' (Mark 14:3-9 NIV)<br />She could've given the money to the poor. It would've been a 'Christian' thing to do, wouldn't it? I mean, a jar of perfume 'wasted' on a man. What did Jesus want to smell like an aromatherapy shop for, anyway? The party-poopers so miss the point in this. The woman gives the best she has to offer for Jesus. This is real sacrificial worship; giving your best to Jesus. What about you? What's your best? What can you sacrificially give to worship Jesus? The woman gave what she could, when she could. What love have you got to pour out of your jar today? <br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 49-50, Luke 5:27-39, Ps 122, Pr 15:10-14]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Always take the high road<br />'...pray for those who spitefully use you.' Luke 6:28 NKJ<br /><br />It's easy to get too familiar with Jesus' words and therefore lose the sheer impact of what He's saying. Take this one for starters: 'Pray for those who spitefully use you. To him who strikes you on the one cheek, offer the other also. And from him who takes away your cloak, do not withhold your tunic either... just as you want men to do to you, you also do to them likewise.' (Luke 6:28-31 NKJ) Whoaa! Let's backtrack a minute. What kind of planet is Jesus living on when He says this? Offer your other cheek to be punched! Yeah and why not draw a target on your pants so they won't miss when they kick you there? Giving away your cloak: what, are we supposed to mug ourselves as well? What is Jesus going on about?<br />It's not about mugging yourself or allowing yourself to be treated like dirt, Jesus is talking about setting yourself a standard here. And, oh boy, is it a high standard! If someone strikes you, you want to hurt them back, but the new standard won't allow it. In fact, the new standard isn't even saying you should walk away and forget it. We're now required to pray good things and give good things to our enemy. How radical is that!<br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 51-52, Luke 6:1-16, Ps 137, Pr 15:15-17]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[The call to love (1)<br />'...live a life of love...' Ephesians 5:2 NIV<br /><br />Hey, here's an idea... why not take your television out for a romantic walk down to the park. Yeah, then you could stroll down to the mall, just you and your 102cm widescreen walking hand in hand. You could treat her to some new batteries for her remote. Take her HD tuner out for something nice to eat. Cuddle up in the back row of the flicks, just you and your high definition, surround sound technological beauty. No, seriously, why not? Don't you have to make time for the people you love? Er... one problem, a television isn't a person. So why do you spend four hours a day staring lovingly into its eyes, and on the other hand, spend 15 minutes with your Mum? Why do you say you value your mates but then place more value on your iPod? Why do you say you love Jesus but never find time to talk to Him because you're too busy spending time, money and energy on other things? <br />This might seem harsh but maybe this is 'wake up' time for you. Are you wasting too much time on gadgets and gizmos at the expense of people? Here's an idea... unplug the Xbox, sign off Facebook, put down the ear phones and open your mouth. Go and see your Gran and have a good chat with her. Treat your mate to something unexpected. Go for a walk with a neighbour. Stop lazing and start loving. <br /><br />SoulFood: Joel 1-3, Luke 6:17-26, Ps 79, Pr 15:18-21]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[The call to love (2)<br />'...live a life of love...' Ephesians 5:2 NIV<br /><br />Right, so this is a bit of a morbid thought, but imagine Martians from the inter-planetary highways agency land on earth to announce our lovely planet is to be destroyed to make room for a new inter-galactic motorway. You've got one month to live before life as we know it ends. What do you do with your remaining 30 days here on this little spherical world? Do you put in a few extra hours in on cracking level 17 of Grand Theft Auto 12? Do you put in the extra shifts at work so you'll finally be able to afford those to-die-for boots or the deposit on the car of your dreams? Hopefully none of these things would be high on your to-do list in the face of immediate disaster. <br />So, here's the scary news. That day will one day arrive. Ok, it won't involve Martians with clipboards and hard hats, but one day your time on this little ball of land and sea will be up. Will you have spent your time wisely? Will you have made a difference to the world? Will people miss you? Will a part of this universe be a little less lovely because you are gone? Will people notice or will it be business as usual? You only get one life. Live it. Live a life of love. <br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 1:1-3:10, Luke 6:27-36, Ps 109:1-15, Pr 15:22]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[God-goggles<br />'Where there is no vision, the people perish...' Proverbs 29:18 KJV<br /><br />'Two men looked through prison bars; one saw mud, the other stars.' So which are you? A star-gazer or a mud-minder? Do you see life as a glass half empty or half full? Well, whatever you see, make sure you've got your God-goggles on. No, you won't find them at Specsavers; God-goggles are given through prayer-life, reading the Word and being in partnership with God's people. God-goggles give you a vision for your life, through them you begin to see things as God sees them. Moses had a pair when he 'saw' the Promised Land while trudging through the desert. The Israelites had 'me-goggles' on and so only saw a hot, deserted hell. Moses saw that every journey begins with a single step, and that every other step is a significant step to the Promised Land. The Israelites saw an impossible journey, a task too big for their tired and blistered feet. Moses and the Israelites were on the same journey; the difference was perspective; the difference was vision. One saw stars, the others mud. <br />What about you? Have you been given a promise by God but you can't work out what to do with it? Does the task seem too big for you? What a great opportunity to put on your God-goggles. Take your eyes up from the floor and set them to the stars. Remember every journey begins with that first step. <br /><br />SoulFood: Ruth 1:3-18, John 6:41-69]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[When you feel anxious (1)<br />'Do not be anxious about anything...' Philippians 4:6 NIV<br /><br />Are you obsessed with trying to figure out things that should be left in God's hands? When you've been working through some questions but have come to the point of deciding what you are going to do, stop fretting and just trust God. And don't get stressed again a week later because you don't like the way He's handling it! Are you expecting God to just wave a magic wand over your life so that everything suddenly becomes all neat and tidy? Maybe as He takes you through the process of sorting out the mess you'll discover valuable things hidden and forgotten. Paul says, 'Do not be anxious about anything...' (Philippians 4:6 NIV) That's hard to swallow if you're a bit insecure or you like to organise things; to find a place to put them so they make sense and feel 'taken care of'. But how do you file unanswered questions? They annoy you like a crackly earpiece in your headphones or a scratch on your favourite CD! But when you have a crackle or a scratch in your faith, you can't just go down the shops and get a replacement. Instead you have to talk to God about it and ask Him what He's gonna do about it. You might find out that the things you think are high priority may not be anywhere near the top of God's list for your life. So learn to live with loose ends and trust God! If you want growth, you've got to be at peace with the messiness and mistakes that accompany it. If you're one of those people who needs to put everything into a neat little box, this Scripture is especially for you: 'Trust in the Lord with all your heart; do not depend on your own understanding.' (Proverbs 3:5 NLT) <br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 3:11-5:42, Luke 6:37-49, Ps 109:16-31, Pr 15:23-26]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[When you feel anxious (2)<br />'Do not be anxious about anything...' Philippians 4:6 NIV<br /><br />It's so easy to get a dose of the 'worry' bug. Maybe, you've got it now; the symptoms are easy enough to spot: (a) your bowels seem to be employing more workers on the dayshift (b) your head seems to be inviting as many irrational thoughts as possible to the big crisis meeting it's holding (c) your self esteem seems to have plummeted to an all-time low. So what's the cure? Digging a hole in the patio and burying your head in the cement? This avoids the issue rather than tackles it. No, it's time to be brave and face up to your worries. Come on, you can do it; splash your face with some cold water, slap yourself and say, 'I can do it!' twenty times in the bathroom mirror (probably best wait 'til everyone is out of the house first). The Bible says: '...the righteous are bold as a lion.' (Proverbs 28:1 NIV) Each time you start to confront your worries, you take a step forward. Each time you choose not to stress over your 'worry bug' but look to what needs to change in order to overcome it, you take a step forward. Nobody enjoys confrontation but without confronting your worries you won't be able to move on. So be brave, kick the worry bug. <br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 6-7, Luke 7:1-10, Ps 118:1-9, Pr 15:27-30]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[When you feel anxious (3)<br />'Do not be anxious about anything...' Philippians 4:6 NIV<br /><br />Dr word4U2day is guessing you wimped out on taking yesterday's advice in trying to kick the 'worry bug'. As your unofficial, unqualified GP, Dr word4U2day would like to warn you once again that 'worry' can seriously damage your health. It's medically proven that worry suppresses your immune system; worry elevates blood pressure which in turn creates cholesterol that blocks your arteries. So, if you weren't worried before, you are now! John writes: '...I pray that... you may prosper and be in good health, just as your soul prospers.' (3 John 1:2 NAS) Why would he say that unless there's a connection between your body and your spirituality? Before you think 'this is getting a little too hug-a-tree-hippy for my liking', stop and think about it. When you worry, your mind is far too loud and busy to hear the still voice of God, so you're robbed of peace. When you worry your physical body is more prone to illness, so you're not fighting fit when it comes to spiritual opposition. Can you see where this is heading? Worry is a spiritual matter. Anxiety is a weapon the enemy is firing at you to stop you receiving all that God has for you. '...listen closely to My words. Do not let them out of your sight, keep them within your heart; for they are life to those who find them and health to a man's whole body.' (Proverbs 4:20-22 NIV)<br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 8-9, Luke 7:11-23, Ps 118:10-18, Pr 15:31-32]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[When you feel anxious (4)<br />'Do not be anxious about anything...' Philippians 4:6 NIV<br /><br />Ok, so worry is a spiritual matter. But how do you stop worrying? Lighting a scented candle and taking deep breaths is all very well, but it doesn't stop an overactive brain from running away with itself. Well, let's try an experiment in 'thought replacement therapy'. It's simpler than it sounds. Whatever nagging thought you have in your head at the moment we're going to replace it with a thought from the Bible. Example: If you're currently thinking, 'I could never tell my mates about my faith, I never know what to say', well replace that thought with this one: '...Be not afraid or dismayed...for the battle is not yours, but God's.' (2 Chronicles 20:15 AMP) Now let's break down our experiment: If all you're ever thinking is 'I can't tell my mates,' what happens is you don't tell your mates, you feel lousy about it, you worry about it and nothing changes. But if you're thinking, 'The battle is not yours, but God's,' all of a sudden the pressure is off, God is big enough to tell your mates, chances are He'll use your lingo, your mouth to do it, but you don't need to worry because it's not about you, it's about God. It's that simple. Try it with your own worries. Find a verse from the Bible and replace your anxiety with truth. <br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 10-11, Luke 7:24-35, Ps 118:19-29, Pr 15:33]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Are you striving for excellence?<br />'I press toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God...' Philippians 3:14 NKJ<br /><br />Are you a good Christian? How good? The best in your youth group? More radical than anyone in your church? Head and shoulders above everyone you meet at festivals? Ok, it's a daft question really, only God knows how sold-out you are; so, let's not start comparing ourselves to others. That's not a measure of how good a Christian we are. Sociology professor Jon Johnston points out the difference between being a success and being excellent: 'Success bases our worth on a comparison with others, excellence measures us against our own potential.' Are you striving for success or excellence?<br />There's an embarrassing moment for the disciples in John 18. 'The high priest then asked Jesus about His disciples and His doctrine.' (John 18:19 NKJ) Of His words Jesus could say, '...Ask those who have heard Me...' (John 18:21 NKJ), but of His disciples, He said nothing, because they'd all forsaken Him. What about us? If we're asked about what we believe, can we spout off, 'listen to those who've heard me'. What about our discipleship; what answers would you get if you asked those who knew you? Do your words match up to your living? Can you say like Paul, 'I press toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God?' <br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 12-13, Luke 7:36-50, Ps 123, Pr 16:1]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Having a cause greater than yourself<br />'...Is there not a cause?' 1 Samuel 17:29 NKJ<br /><br />What makes you get out of bed first thing? The sound of your alarm? Your Mum poking you in the ribs with a broom handle? The glorious aroma of your own morning breath? Or is it purpose? Does your day, and indeed, your life have a purpose to it that springs you into action? David sprung into action because he saw God's people cowering away from Goliath. He saw the need for action. He saw a cause greater than himself. He saw purpose.<br />Research among people who live to be over 100 shows that the secret to long life isn't healthy diets, miracle drugs or strenuous exercise, but purpose. People with a reason to get out of bed in the morning live longer. Paul writes: 'For to me to live is Christ...' (Philippians 1:21 NKJ) For Paul, that was his purpose. Should that be yours?<br />God made you for a mission. Have you discovered it yet? At age 12 Jesus said, '...I must be about my Father's business...' (Luke 2:49 NKJ) 21 years later, dying on the cross, He announced, '...It is finished...' (John 19:30 NKJ) The biggest mission in history was finished in two decades because Jesus never strayed from His purpose. So ask God to reveal to you His purpose for your life. Until you find it you haven't lived, and until you fulfil it, you're not ready to die.<br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 14-15, Luke 8:1-15, Ps 133, Pr 16:2]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[When your faith feels shaky (1)<br />'...if you...believe in your heart...you will be saved.' Romans 10:9 NIV<br /><br />The police, the army, even the Royal family ride them; horses that is. They march powerfully or move gracefully or trot with an air of royalty But have you ever seen a newborn horse learn to walk? Knees buckling, legs shaking; it's hardly a picture of power or grace. They just haven't worked out how to control their muscles yet, and it can be like that with our faith. As a baby Christian sometimes we need time to get used to our 'faith-legs'. New Christians might find themselves wondering 'why God doesn't seem to talk to them like He seems to talk to others', or they may feel intimidated that they could never live a life like a well-seasoned Christian. If this is you, if you're new to this faith stuff and you're feeling pretty shaky in it, don't worry. You're not alone; everybody takes time to find their faith legs. <br />A good place to start when you're not 'feeling it' is back to the basics. The Bible says: 'If you confess with your mouth, &quot;Jesus is Lord,&quot; and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.' (Romans 10:9 NIV) It's that simple. So, you've got your doubts about this or that, you're feeling unsure or unworthy, but the bottom line is you're saved. Actually, faith is the simplest, plainest thing in the world... it's simply believing God. <br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Sam 21:1-6, Hosea 6:4-6, Matt 12:1-14]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[When your faith feels shaky (2)<br />'...reach out...Stop doubting and believe.' John 20:27 NIV<br /><br />You're not the only Christian in the world who has their doubts; new believers, pastors and missionaries, even the disciples had their shaky moments. Thomas could be the patron saint of shakiness and he'd lived in and out of Jesus' pockets for three years. He said: 'Unless I... put my finger where the nails were...I will not believe...' (John 20:25 NIV) Jesus said...'Reach out your hand ...Stop doubting and believe.' (John 20:27 NIV) Thomas asks the question we all ask when we're struggling, 'If God is so good, why do I feel so bad? If His message is so clear, why am I confused?' Notice Jesus' reaction though. He doesn't slap Thomas on the wrist for his doubts, He allows him to poke around for the proof he wants. Jesus won't get an inferiority complex because you're having a few doubts, He's allowing you to poke around for the proof you want. Talk to someone you respect, read the Word, research, pray through it, do whatever it is that will help you reach out your hand and start believing. Perhaps, your doubts are part of the bigger picture. It is a dangerously sharp faith that will keep trusting when there are no answers. Isaiah says, 'My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways My ways...' (Isaiah 55:8 NKJ) The truth is, God doesn't think like us. He sees the big picture way beyond our doubts and unanswered questions.<br />SoulFood: Acts 16-17, Luke 8:16- 25, Ps 140, Pr 16:3<br /><br />]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Tell the truth<br />'...put off falsehood and speak truthfully...' Ephesians 4:25 NIV<br /><br />'Do you like my new hair cut?'; 'Where's your homework?'; 'You fancy him, don't you?' Can you always be trusted to give an honest answer? Or are you tempted to tell just a tiny 'white lie'? How many of those lies do you tell in a week? None? Are you sure? Ever started with a little white lie but then had to lie to cover up the first one and then lie again and before you know it the little white lie has become a big fat dark bundle of deceit? It starts off as a good idea but...'Bread gained by deceit is sweet to a man, but afterward his mouth will be filled with gravel.' (Proverbs 20:17 NKJ) If you have a problem telling the truth you must take these four steps: <br />(1) Repent. (that's just old school for 'change'!) 'If we confess our sins, He...will forgive us...' (1 John 1:9 NIV) And with God's forgiveness comes His help <br />(2) Become accountable. Find somebody who's not afraid to ask you tough questions. This is a good idea for any issues you face! <br />(3) Drop the attitude. It's not okay to lie because God will forgive you. That cheapens His grace. '...Shall we go on sinning...that grace may increase? By no means!..' (Romans 6:1-2 NIV) <br />(4) Keep short accounts with God. When you blow it, 'fess up' and make it right with God and the people you've misled.<br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 18-19, Luke 8:26-39, Ps 146, Pr 16:4-5]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Don't Give Up (1)<br />'We are hard pressed...' 2 Corinthians 4:8 NIV<br /><br />When a back injury paralysed Angela Madsen from the waist down, she vowed to do whatever it took to get back up. As a result she started training to be the first woman with a disability to row across the Atlantic. What a legend! Paul writes, 'We are hard pressed...but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed.' (2 Corinthians 4:8-9 NIV) In other words like Angela, he didn't give up! <br />People who keep going... <br />(1) Take control of their lives: It's easy to blame others for your problems and wait till they fix them. You might have a good reason, but instead of moaning, get moving... think about what you can DO; there is always something! <br />(2) Surround themselves with the right people: The Psalmist said, 'They...treated me badly all my life, but they have not defeated me.' (Psalm 129:2 NCV) Most of us have people who treat us badly. Some of us even have abusive and destructive relationships with the very people who are meant to protect and love us. Ned Hallowell, a famous author, grew up with a depressive dad, an abusive stepdad and an alcoholic mum. He says that he kept going because he attached himself to teachers who cared about him and took him under their wing. So in tough times, lean on God, take control of your life, and surround yourself with the right people.<br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 20-21, Luke 8:40-56, Ps 14, Pr 16:6-7]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Don't Give Up (2)<br />'We are hard pressed...' 2 Corinthians 4:8 NIV<br /><br />Two other things about people who keep going: <br />(1) They aren't afraid of failure: When we face failure, sometimes the biggest lesson we can learn is that we CAN keep going. You might fail, but if you don't keep trying you'll never succeed! Basketball legend Michael 'Air' Jordan says, 'I've missed over 9000 shots in my career... lost over 300 games... 26 times I've been trusted to make the game-winning shot, and missed. I've tried and failed over and over again. That's why I succeed.' Remember Paul says: 'We often suffer, but we are never crushed. Even when we don't know what to do, we never give up.' (2 Corinthians 4:8 CEV) <br />(2) They focus on changing WHAT they can: If you are facing stuff that is out of control, there is always one thing that you can control-YOU! Other people are out of your hands, events and circumstances can come crashing around you but YOU decide what your attitude or actions will be. In concentration camps, prisoners-of-war who routinely gave away their last bit of food proved that you can choose your attitude in any given set of circumstances. To choose to give, care, smile, forgive, or love is both good for others and us. Workers who chose to help by digging through the rubble to rescue survivors of the Oklahoma City bombing, though distressed, showed fewer symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder later. Paul says: '...whatever good anyone does, he will receive the same from the Lord...' (Ephesians 6:8 NKJ) <br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 22-23, Luke 9:1-17, Ps 65, Pr 16: 8-9]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[You're a W.I.P.<br />'...now we are children of God, and we have not yet been shown what we will be in the future...' 1 John 3:2 NCV<br /><br />Some things in life are unhelpful: the best looking kid walking into the party just as you start chatting to the person you've always fancied; forgetting your gear when Mr 'Go Find Something In The Lost Property' is taking PE. But the most unhelpful thing-the thing that will get you nowhere-is comparing yourself to others.<br />The Bible says, '...don't compare yourself...' (Galatians 6:4 CEV), because some people will look like they're doing better than you and you'll feel rubbish, while others won't be doing as well and your head will grow. 'Do your best...' (2 Timothy 2:15 NIV) That way, '...you will get the satisfaction of a job well done, and...won't need to compare yourself...' (Galatians 6:4 NLT) We can all find someone who is doing better than us. 'All the apples on a tree don't ripen at the same time' might sound like an old and obvious proverb, but it's still true. Paul says, '...knowledge and understanding...' take time. (Philippians 1:9-10 NLT) John writes: 'Now we are children of God, and we have not yet been shown what we will be in the future.' (1 John 3:2 NCV) Don't catch yourself saying 'I can't do that because they do it better...' Is it what God is asking you to do? God doesn't wait until we are sorted or successful before He uses us. So, push ahead, cut yourself some slack, and remember you're a WIP; a Work-In-Progress!<br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 24-26, Luke 9:18-27, Ps 1, Pr 16:10-15]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Winners never quit and quitters never win<br />'...this is the victory that has overcome the world-our faith.' 1 John 5:4 NKJ<br /><br />Today's title sounds like the kind of thing that personal trainers say in fancy gyms to their huffing-puffing clients. But it was true for Irwin Rosenberg. As a junior officer Irwin was told to leave his job in the Navy when he was diagnosed with cancer. That was standard military procedure at the time. But he was determined to get back both his health and his job. At one point he was given only two weeks to live. But through faith in His God and dogged determination his cancer was eventually brought under control. Irwin then focused his attention on becoming a naval officer again. But he discovered that navy regulations forbade reinstatement of a person discharged with cancer. Everyone around him said, 'Give up. It can't be done. It would take an Act of Congress to get you reinstated.' Their advice gave him an idea; he'd pursue the government and get them to change the law! After years of waiting, petitioning and cutting through red tape President Truman eventually signed into law a special bill that allowed Irwin Rosenberg to reenlist in the Navy. He went on to become a Rear Admiral!<br />A poet wrote: 'You can never tell how close you are, it may be near when it seems afar; so stick to the fight when you're hardest hit; it's when things seem worst that you mustn't quit!'<br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 27-28, Luke 9:28-36, Ps 42:1-5, Pr 16:16]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[What 'sells'<br />'...another Jesus...a different spirit...a different gospel....' 2 Corinthians 11:4 NKJ<br /><br />Evangelism would be easier if we could guarantee that God will make every Christian a millionaire or good looking, or even promise that He didn't mind if we never changed our actions or attitudes. The temptation to preach 'what sells' is always with us. One pastor recently acknowledged that his message was attracting big crowds but not turning people into disciples, so he changed direction. Paul warns the Corinthian church to be on guard against anyone who preaches 'another Jesus...a different spirit...or a different gospel.' <br />God told Jonah to tell people something he thought they wouldn't want to hear. So he legged it to try to avoid the issue. But running away didn't work for Jonah, and it won't work for us. God loves people too much to let people waste their lives on anything other than the life they were created for. And He loved the people of Nineveh too much to let Jonah off the hook. The first thing God told Jonah to say when he reached Nineveh was: 'Repent'. Repent means 'to change direction' and choose a better option. Problem is: not everyone likes to be told they haven't already chosen the best option. The word 'Gospel' literally means 'good news'. It's not good because we've changed it to make it sound better-it's good because when people get it they change for the better. <br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Sam 5:1-6:16, Rev 11:15-19]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Integrity (1)<br />'The integrity of the upright will guide them...' Proverbs 11:3 NKJ<br /><br />All-you-can-eat smorgasbord, you know the score! You pay up and from the moment you've got the plate, it's all about you and how much food you can pile onto it and then into your mouth. If only life was a free-for-all-buffet where you could forget about everybody else and reach your grubby little hands into everything you wanted, no questions asked. <br />The frightening thing is, for many of us, that's how we are. We don't listen to the quiet kid at school because we're too busy making ourselves heard. We don't care whose feelings we tread on so long as we're feeling on top. Or we don't volunteer to help clean up the church because we think someone else will do it. Putting yourself first is not God's way. Getting what you want and forgetting the rest of them maybe ok at a smorgasbord, but it's not a good way to live your life. The Bible says the opposite in fact: '...Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment...' (Romans 12:3 NIV) 'Humble yourselves, therefore, under God's mighty hand, that He may lift you up in due time.' (1 Peter 5:6 NIV) So, forget 'self-service' and start 'serving others'. <br /><br />SoulFood: Deut 1-2, Luke 9:37-45, Ps 42:6-11, Pr 16:17-19]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Integrity (2)<br />'The integrity of the upright will guide them...' Proverbs 11:3 NKJ<br /><br />Double standards; have you got them? You know what we're talking about: you're upset one minute because somebody has made an insensitive, cruel jibe at your expense. Sure you'll admit your nose is one of the more prominent features on your face, but to say what they said about it is just pure spite; why are some people so brutal, don't they realise you've got feelings? And the next minute, you're in the zone, bad joke after bad joke about your mate's new haircut, everybody is suffering from a serious case of 'sides well and truly split' because of your gags. So, what if the mate with the haircut is close enough to hear? Can't they take a joke? They need to lighten up, that's their problem! Double standards: one rule for you, another for others. Now it doesn't take an expert to point out that this isn't the 'holiest' way to live your life, so no prizes for guessing where this is going: REPENTANCE. Sometimes a snide remark is the funniest joke-but should we be laughing? Let's do a complete 'hypocrite U-turn'. Do we want to be the butt of someone's joke? No? Well, let's extend that respect to somebody else; let's not tear people down, let's build people up. Jesus had this one well and truly sussed when He said, 'Treat others as you want them to treat you.' (Matthew 7:12 CEV)<br /><br />SoulFood: Deut 3-4, Luke 9:46-56, Ps 46, Pr 16:20-22]]></introtext>

Proverbs 20:29 AMP<br /><br />The Bible says: 'The glory of old men is...wisdom and experience,' so listen up to these wise words: 'Time has a way of catching you unawares. It seems like yesterday I was young, just married and embarking on my new life. Where did the years go? I know I've lived them all, and I get 'glimpses' of how it was back then...my hopes and dreams. But here it is...the winter of my life...How did I get here so fast? I remember seeing older people and thinking winter was so far off I couldn't fathom or imagine it. But here it is... my friends are retired and getting grey... I remember when they were young and vibrant, now we're the 'old folks' we never thought we'd become. Each day I find that taking a shower is a real target...I'm unprepared for the aches, pains, and the loss of strength and ability to do the things I wish I'd done and didn't. If you're not there yet, let me remind you it'll be here faster than you think. Whatever you'd like to accomplish in your life...do it today. Don't put it off...There's no guarantee you'll see every season of life, so say all the things you want your loved ones to remember. Your life is a gift from God, how you live it is your gift to Him and ensuing generations.'<br /><br />SoulFood: Deut 5-7, Luke 9:57-62, Ps 78:1-8, Pr 16:23-24]]></introtext>

What feels good at the time, what your mates are doing, or what is wise? Part of being wise is about looking ahead and knowing what is the best thing to do with your time and talents. You will always do SOMETHING for every 24 hours in every day. It's not: 'Will my day be full?' but 'Who will fill it?' and 'What will it be filled with?' <br />The story's told of a lighthouse keeper on a rocky stretch of coastline who received a new supply of oil each month to keep the light burning. A woman from the village needed some oil to keep her family warm; a farmer requested some for his tractor; a mechanic wanted some to oil a wheel. All the requests seemed legitimate so the lighthouse keeper tried to please everybody. Before the month was over his oil was gone and the beacon went out. As a result several ships were wrecked and lives were lost. When the authorities investigated, the man was very sorry. But their reply was, 'You were given oil for one purpose-to keep the light burning.' God has given you your life, talents and time. What does He want you to do with them? <br /><br />SoulFood: Deut 8-10, Luke 10:1-12, Ps 78:9-16, Pr 16:25]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Be wise-prioritise (2)<br />'Oh, that they were wise...that they would consider their latter end!' Deuteronomy 32:29 NKJ<br /><br />In a survey, people over 90 were asked, 'If you had your life to live over what would you do differently?' Three answers constantly re-emerged: (a) I'd spend more time with my family and friends (b) I'd take more risks (c) I'd do things that would live on after I'm gone. Wisdom is the art of knowing what to ignore. Unimportant things steal too much of our time and we finish up living for the wrong reasons. When an Olympic gold medallist was asked the secret of his success he replied, 'Planned neglect; until my training period is completed, I deliberately neglect everything else.' If you react to every situation and say 'yes' to every request, you'll never succeed in what you're called to do. Paul had it figured out: '...The most important thing is that I complete my mission, the work that the Lord Jesus gave me...' (Acts 20:24 NCV) What's your 'most important thing'? One of the most interesting stories to come from the Titanic disaster was of a wealthy woman who had a place in one of the lifeboats. Asking if she could return to her room for something, she was given three minutes. Stepping over money and precious gems littering her cabin floor, she grabbed three oranges and returned to the lifeboat. She knew what to ignore and what to grab. Be wise-prioritise!<br /><br />SoulFood: Deut 11-13, Luke 10:13-24, Ps 78:17-31, Pr 16:26-30]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[M &amp;amp; M &amp;amp; M &amp;amp; M <br /><br />'The Lord gave him success in everything he did.' Genesis 39:3 NIV<br /><br />To succeed at anything, there are four things you must have:<br />(1) Morals: These days many people are prepared to do anything to get what they want. That's not living God's way. The Christian's life is sometimes described as the 'narrow way'; Jesus in particular used that kind of language. We know from the way Jesus spoke to the religious leaders that He wasn't big on rules but that doesn't mean He spoke an 'anything goes' message. Far from it. Jesus showed that God wants us to honour Him by using our freedom of choice to live right. <br />(2) Methods: Your methods are the way you handle all the different situations life throws at you. Are you like a mechanic with only a hammer in your toolbox? That's ok if all you do is knock nails but what if you come across a bolt? Especially when it comes to dealing with people. We need to learn that there are lots of different ways to handle a situation. What seemed helpful to that person yesterday may have the person you deal with today in floods of tears! <br />(3) Means: We use a special word to describe the means of God helping us: provision and it can always be found following a God-given vision. That just leaves the question, 'Where is your vision from?' <br />(4) Management: Jesus said, 'From the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked.' (Luke 12:48 NIV) Some people don't ever really use the gifts God gives them. That's totally tragic! Management is all about getting people working and guess who your biggest management challenge will be? Yourself! <br /><br />SoulFood: Deut 14-17, Luke 10:25-37, Ps 78:32-39, Pr 16:31]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>Under pressure (1)</p>
<p>‘Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me...’&amp;nbsp;Matthew 11:29 NKJ</p>
<p>Ever felt that life is like one big pressure cooker? Pressure from everywhere, building up until you feel suffocated by a massive heap of stress? Difficulty getting on with parents? Pressure! Brothers or sisters getting on your nerves? Pressure! Worrying about your grandparents’ health? Pressure! School too demanding? Pressure! Boy/girlfriend jealous and possessive? Pressure! Friends falling out? Pressure! It’s all too much!</p>
<p>Jesus says: ‘Take my yoke upon you and learn from me.’&amp;nbsp;By the way, Jesus isn’t talking about eggs here. A yoke is a wooden beam used between a pair of oxen to allow them to work together to do the same job, ploughing a field.</p>
<p>Jesus is saying: ‘Learn from me.’ Watch how I deal with people, see how I am in My relationships and learn to do the same. Let Me guide you through life, because My way is stress-free, My way takes off the pressure and piles on love.</p>
<p>Jesus knows how to handle everything - all that’s difficult, harmful, tough, hurtful, bewildering, overwhelming, awful and painful. So don’t collapse under a stress heap because of all the pressure. Hand your pressure over to Jesus and allow Him to take you through life stress-free. Learn a different way, an easier way to live, the best way to live - with Jesus.</p>

<p>‘Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me...’ Matthew 11:29 NKJ</p>
<p>Notice how some people on a rollercoaster close their eyes, clench their teeth and wait for the ride to end, while up front the wide-eyed thrill-seekers relish every peak and plunge? They’re all on the same trip, but their attitudes are entirely different.</p>
<p>God wants us to live life ‘to the max’, so He asks us to learn from Him. He only gives us good advice. The question is: are you going to use it?</p>
<p>(1) <em>Watch your eating and drinking</em>: ‘Don’t drink too much wine or eat too much food. Those who drink and eat too much become poor.’ (Proverbs 23:20–21 NCV)</p>
<p>(2) <em>Tell the truth - always</em>:<em> ‘</em>The Lord detests lying lips, but He delights in those who tell the truth.’ (Proverbs 12:22 NIV)</p>
<p>(3) <em>Do good</em>: ‘We are God’s workmanship, created…to do good works, which God prepared…for us to do.’ (Ephesians 2:10 NIV)</p>
<p>(4) <em>Don’t be a slacker</em>: ‘Do not…become lazy, but to imitate those who through faith and patience inherit what has been promised.’ (Hebrews 6:12 NIV)</p>
<p>(5) <em>Concentrate on the inside not the outside</em>: ‘Don’t be concerned about the outward beauty of fancy hairstyles, expensive jewellery, or beautiful clothes. You should clothe yourselves instead with the beauty that comes from within…which is so precious to God.’ (1 Peter 3:3-4 NLT)</p>
<p>(6) <em>Read your Bible</em>: ‘All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.’ (2 Timothy 3:16 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>How much?</p>
<p>‘Those…hired last…you paid…the same as…us.’&amp;nbsp;Matthew 20:12 NCV</p>
<p>Imagine! Your boss calls you in and gives you a brand new iPhone. ‘My way of saying thank you for being such a good worker for the last five years!’ Awesome or what? But then you realise your boss has given exactly the same gift to guys who’ve only worked 4, 3, 2 years and even the guys who started work this year!</p>
<p>All of a sudden you feel you deserve more, and you march right back up the corridor to your boss’ office: ‘After 5 years of service I get the same as guys who haven’t even worked a full year yet! That’s not fair!’ But your boss just replies, ‘You thought it was a good gift when I first gave it you and besides, it’s my money - I can do with it what I like. It’s up to you how you choose to accept what I’ve given you.’</p>
<p>Now you’re beginning to understand those guys in Jesus’ parable who said, ‘Hey! Those guys you hired last got paid the same as us!’ They didn’t think it was fair either.</p>
<p>But Jesus gives us this parable to remind us that He is generous to all - it’s not for us to tell God how to do His job. And if there’s a chip on your shoulder, thinking you deserve more than others, you need to knock it off. Be thankful for what God has given you - it’s amazing you receive the same amount of love, grace and forgiveness as everyone else.</p>

<p>‘Honesty guides good people...’ Proverbs 11:3 NLT</p>
<p>Ok then guys, be honest with yourself: how many of you would have handled this situation the same as Joseph?</p>
<p>In Genesis 39, we read how Joseph, after being left for dead by his brothers, now has a top job in Potiphar’s home. Potiphar was chief of the Egyptian king’s bodyguard, so it was a pretty swanky pad. His wife gets the hots for young Joe and one day, when her husband’s away, invites him upstairs: ‘Come and sleep with me.’</p>
<p>Be honest: what would you have done? Joseph says, ‘My master trusts me with everything in his entire household. No one here has more authority than I do. He has held back nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. How could I do such a wicked thing? It would be a great sin against God.’ And he walks away. Would you have done the same?</p>
<p>Joseph refused the advances of Potiphar’s wife, not because he thought he couldn’t get away with it, but because he knew he couldn’t live with himself if he accepted them. Joseph was a man of integrity. His relationship with God was more important to him than anything else. He lived his life by what he believed; his actions spoke the same as his words.</p>
<p>What about you? The Bible says, ‘Honesty guides good people.’&amp;nbsp;Can people tell by your actions that God comes first in your life?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>Get sporty</p>
<p>‘The fastest runner doesn’t always win the race…’&amp;nbsp;Ecclesiastes 9:11 NLT</p>
<p>Whatever the weather, whatever your fitness level, PE teachers seem determined to make each and every one of us an enthusiast for all things sporty. But if you haven’t caught the fitness bug yourself, any exercise - and especially that Friday afternoon cross country race - can leave you feeling like your legs are made of lead, your lungs have been punctured and at any moment your heart’s going to jump out of your chest in protest.</p>
<p>The Bible says that our life is like a race. But it’s not about being the fastest: ‘The fastest runner doesn’t always win the race’. It’s not about speed or finesse - it’s actually about staying power: ‘Let us run with endurance the race God has set before us…by keeping our eyes on Jesus… then you won’t become weary and give up.’ (Hebrews 12:1–3 NLT) The race of life is about sticking with Jesus every step of the way and hanging in there with Him in every situation.</p>
<p>When Jesus lived on earth, He never gave up. He kept His focus, always doing what God was asking Him to do. Even at the tender age of 12, He told His parents: ‘I must be about My Father’s business…’ (Luke 2:49 NKJ) So you’ve got no excuse putting this off until you’re older. The time to stick with Jesus and run the race of life is now.</p>

<p>‘Live joyfully with the wife whom you love...’ Ecclesiastes 9:9 NKJ</p>
<p>We all recognise that if we want to become healthier, fitter or stronger in the future, we have to put in the hard yards now.</p>
<p>We have to be disciplined and work hard, follow an eating plan and a training programme, and get the support and encouragement we need if we’re going to achieve those kinds of things. However much we might wish it, we won’t just wake up one morning and find we’ve lost twenty kilos after following a diet of junk food - neither will we wake up looking like Mariusz Pudzianowski, if we do no exercise whatsoever (he began workouts for strength sports at age 13 before winning his first World’s Strongest Man competition in 2002, aged 25).</p>
<p>So why is it that when it comes to relationships, we think we can do what we want? The world calls them ‘partners’ or ‘flings’ and tries to tell us we can date and shack up with whoever we like. ‘Later on you can settle down and have a family but experimenting while you’re young won’t harm you.’ <em>You think?</em></p>
<p>God says to practice being loyal, faithful and loving now. Not to be a killjoy, but to see we get maxjoy! What we do when we’re young sticks and we won’t suddenly change the day we decide to walk down the aisle. Start practicing today who you want to be in the future, so when the time comes you will be able to ‘Live joyfully with the wife whom you love...’</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>Today, encourage somebody (2)</p>
<p>'Worry is a heavy load, but a kind word cheers you up.' Proverbs 12:25 NCV</p>
<p>You might recall the name Isaac Newton as 'that bloke who is famous for having an apple fall on his head', but there's more to the story than that! Newton was the first person to be able to explain things we now take for granted, such as the way we are all subject to the Laws of Gravity and the Three Laws of Motion. But Newton might never have published his work had it not been for another scientist called Edmond Halley. A well-respected expert in his own right, Halley visited Newton at Cambridge to discuss a problem he was working on, only to discover that Newton had already solved it. Halley encouraged Newton to publish his work, and even offered to do it for him at his own expense. The result was the publication of the snazzily titled Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica in 1687, which laid the groundwork for the future study of mathematics and changed the way people see the world.</p>
<p>You may not have the brain of Isaac Newton but you do have the heart of Edmond Halley, a heart that wants to encourage your mates to do great things. Who has God put into your life for you to cheer on, raise up, or help on their journey? This much is true: when you help other people to do the things God created them to do, you have the satisfaction of sharing in their success.</p>

<p>'Worry is a heavy load, but a kind word cheers you up.' Proverbs 12:25 NCV</p>
<p>We all know that the Americans are pretty fond of making big speeches; but they've turned out a lot of great writers too. The nineteenth-century writer Walt Whitman struggled for years to get anyone interested in his poetry. At a time of real discouragement he received a life-changing note from someone who'd just read his latest book. The note read, 'Dear Sir, I am not blind to the worth of the wonderful gift of Leaves of Grass. I find it the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom... I greet you at the beginning of a great career.' It was signed by Ralph Waldo Emerson, at that time probably America's most respected writer!</p>
<p>Like Walt, we all face tough times and need encouragement to keep us going. When we're on the brink of giving up, a simple word can give us new strength and keep us in the game. Not surprising then that encouragement is a big theme in the Bible. Listen: 'Worry is a heavy load, but a kind word cheers you up' (Proverbs 12:25 NCV), and 'I am the Lord your God, who holds your right hand, and I tell you, &quot;Don't be afraid. I will help you.&quot;' (Isaiah 41:13 NCV) Encouragement doesn't deny the problem; it helps us overcome it. It doesn't leave us alone to carry the load; it reminds us that God will help us. So encourage somebody today!</p>

<p>'Any enterprise ... built by wise planning, becomes strong.' Proverbs 24:3 TLB</p>
<p>Aren't holidays great? Long lazy days doing just as you please and exams or work a distant memory! But in a few weeks it's back to the old routine, time to get back to work or get out those textbooks to prepare again to do the best in all those areas you love so much! :)</p>
<p>Asked how long it would take to bring his ship to a stop, the Queen Mary's captain replied, 'A little over a mile.' (Nearly 2 km!) Then he added, 'A good captain thinks at least a mile ahead.' So what will you be doing a month from now, on June 11? Do you need to start preparing for it? And what will you be doing six months from now, on November 11? It will be here before you know it. Your success in any venture is determined by how important it is to you, and your willingness to prepare for it. The Living Bible phrases Proverbs 24:3 this way: 'Any enterprise is built by wise planning, becomes strong through common sense, and profits wonderfully by keeping abreast of the facts.' So, if you want to succeed, then singing 'If you wish upon a star' won't help. The dividing line between winning and losing is preparation! To make your dreams come true you've got to prepare yourself. Ever wondered what Jesus was doing during those pre-dawn risings and nights of prayer? Preparing! Sorry, but there's no other way.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Are you a good listener?</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'...Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak...' James 1:19 NIV</p>
<p>It's often said, 'God gave us two ears and one mouth because we need to listen twice as much as we talk.' Learning that means being 'quick to listen, slow to speak'. Good listening builds relationships. But good listeners aren't born, they're made! So here are a few tips to help you get a bit more use out of those wobbly bits of flesh on either side of your head!<br />(1) Keep your lips closed! Resist the temptation to jump in and finish off other people's sentences for them; rein yourself in; just listen.<br />(2) Keep your mind open! Try not to jump to conclusions about what is coming next; just try to understand their point of view, their feelings, and their needs. Good listening is hearing what someone means, which can be different from what they actually say. Not everybody handles words well, especially if they're upset or under pressure in some way. If what they say doesn't quite add up, keep listening. 'It's stupid and embarrassing to give an answer before you listen.' (Proverbs 18:13 CEV) When you hear more, it may make sense.<br />(3) Don't throw hand-grenades! It's easy to try to correct somebody by tossing in phrases such as, 'That's not the way it was,' or 'What did you expect?' or 'You're just being too sensitive.' Yes, that might be true but it will probably stop the flow of real communication.<br />SoulFood: Num 32:25-33:56, Mark 8:1-13, Ps 44:17-26, Pr 11:12-13</p>]]></introtext>

<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'...when I am weak, then I am strong.' 2 Corinthians 12:10 NIV</p>
<p>Most of what Paul writes in the New Testament is really plain, clear and simple but there's a really weird line in his letter to the church in the city of Corinth. He says that God gave him a '...thorn in the flesh...' (2 Corinthians 12:7 NIV) Nobody really knows what he was referring to, but the point isn't what it was but what it was for and that's something Paul does tell us: 'to keep me from becoming proud'. (2 Corinthians 12:7 NLT) Success can be intoxicating (that is, you get drunk on it), and intoxicated people aren't known for making good decisions! <br />What happens when you get a splinter in your finger? It hurts, and you forget everything else while you focus on getting it out. Three times Paul prayed for God to remove the thorn, but God wouldn't. Why? Because God is at His strongest in us when we are at our weakest. Paul learned that God's power in his life was strangely tied to the painful thorn, so he could say, 'I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.' (2 Corinthians 12:10 NIV) Maybe you've been praying that God will remove a thorn in your life, whatever or whomever that may be. Well maybe God wants you to experience His grace and power today by learning how to turn your pain into praise.<br />SoulFood: Deut 9:13-29, Luke 4:1-13</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Brokenness (2)</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit...' Psalm 51:17 NIV</p>
<p>Sometimes God lets us hit the bottom in order to find out that He's the rock at the base of everything. Gideon was ready to face an army of 135 000 troops with just 32 000 men, then 22 000 of them left him before the battlefield was even in sight. Do the maths. Gideon's thinking, 'We're mincemeat!' Then God turns up the pressure another notch, saying: 'The people who are with you are too many for Me to give Midian into their hands, for Israel would become boastful, saying, &quot;...My own power has delivered me.&quot;'(Judges 7:2 NAS) He ends up winning the battle with just 300 men! Do you see what's going on there-the first battle to be fought was a battle of ego! Why do you think the Lord's Prayer ends with: '...Yours is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory...'? (Matthew 6:13 NAS) To remind us that any power we have comes only from God! And who should the glory for our success go to? Straight to God! How long does this arrangement last? Forever!<br />Brokenness doesn't mean being a wimp, suffering from an inferiority complex or having a case of low self-esteem. No, it's just that sometimes God has to take you down before He can raise you up. People who have been through God's breaking process don't find it hard to pray, 'Jesus, whatever will make You famous-I'm up for it!' Can you pray that prayer today?<br />SoulFood: Num 30:1-32:24, Mark 7:24-37, Ps 44: 9-16, Pr 11:10-11</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Brokenness (1)</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit...' Psalm 51:17 NIV</p>
<p>For a plant to rise from the soil the seed must be broken. For a baby chick to experience larger life, the shell must be broken. Even a thoroughbred horse must be broken; it must learn to respond to the tug of the reins and the sound of the trainer's voice. Get the idea? The world around us might not see value in broken things but so often with God brokenness is just one step away from beauty. <br />When we hear the word 'brokenness' we normally think it means 'no good anymore' or 'useless' but that's not it at all. And neither is it a reference to experiencing some sort of personal tragedy. Many people suffer tragedy without drawing closer to God or even acknowledging Him. No, spiritual brokenness is the process through which God strips away our self-centredness so that the character of Jesus can shine through us. At the end of the day the issue with brokenness is not so much our circumstances, but our response. When God blocks every exit we try to take and then eventually we come to see that He alone is our answer, we make a life changing discovery. 'And what's that?' you ask. Simple: when God is all you have; God is all you need! Bottom line: God's power is released through those who have given up trying to do it in their own strength!<br />SoulFood: Num 27-29, Mark 7:14-23, Ps 44:1-8, Pr 11:9</p>]]></introtext>

<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'May God Himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through...' 1 Thessalonians 5:23 NIV</p>
<p>Paul writes: 'May God Himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through. May your whole spirit, soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.' (1 Thessalonians 5:23 NIV) 'Through and through'; it's very clear that when God sorts out our lives He works from the inside out! Imagine you're a bit of a kleptomaniac; you can't stop stealing stuff. Handcuffing you and taking you off to jail might stop you stealing but you'd still be a thief inside. The problem with a thief isn't with your hands, it's with your mind and spirit, which says 'gimme' every time something takes your fancy.<br />Too many of us want to get victory over bodily sins without being transformed inside. Trying to change that way is like rewinding back to the days of the Old Testament when the Law was all people had to direct their steps. But Jesus has changed all that; He has fulfilled God's promise to '...put My law in their minds and write it on their hearts...' (Jeremiah 31.33 NIV) God starts with our spirit because that's the part of our being that makes us aware of Him, that 'connects' with Him. When God sets us free in our spirit, then our physical actions start to fall in line.<br />So if you really want to act differently today, ask the Holy Spirit to change you through and through!<br />SoulFood: Num 25-26, Mark 7:1-13, Ps 37: 32-40, Pr 11:7-8</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Believe God for great things!</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'...with God all things are possible.' Matthew 19:26 NIV</p>
<p>Jesus said, 'With God all things are possible.' Do you really believe that? Listen, even humans can do the 'impossible'. Here are three examples: (1) German scientists predicted that trains travelling at 40 km/hr would cause severe nose bleeds and the passengers would suffocate going through tunnels. Their American colleagues added that we'd need more mental institutions because people would go mad when they saw the first trains (2) When the YWCA first announced typing classes for women, there was a furious backlash on the grounds that the 'female constitution would deteriorate under such strain.' (3) Shipping experts insisted that iron boats would never float, and that even if they did all, that metal would wreak havoc with the compass readings so they'd get lost anyway! So if humans can do the 'impossible', how much more can the God of the universe achieve?!<br />Sadly, too many of us are conned into believing for too little rather than believing for too much. Faith in God isn't something we frame on the wall like a swimming certificate; it lives inside our life. So next time you're faced with an impossibility remember it's not about what you can do, but what God can do through you when you're fully trusting in Him. God wants to take you outside the realm of the predictable, the safe, and the expected. So make a promise today to refuse to let the word 'impossible' stop you.<br />SoulFood: Num 22-24, Mark 6:45-56, Ps 37: 25-3, Pr 11: 5-6</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Words need to be spoken</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'Anxiety in the heart of man causes depression, but a good word makes it glad.' Proverbs 12:25 NKJ</p>
<p>Words. They are everywhere. It's hard to imagine the world without them, isn't it? The world would just cease to function. Not many things in this life are as powerful as the right words spoken at the right time. But that works backwards too; words that should've been said but never were can be a heavy burden to live with. How many people are overcome with emotion at the funeral of a relative because they realise there are so many things they wished they'd said but no longer have the chance?<br />The great king Solomon was a master of words and his dad David wasn't too bad either! In one of his books (Ecclesiastes) Solomon really spends a lot of time wondering what life is really all about. He wrestles with all sorts of mind-boggling questions. He comes to this conclusion: 'There is...a time to speak.' (Ecclesiastes 3:1; 3:7) But as we all know, time waits for no man, and when it's over, it's over. So make sure you don't find yourself standing in the future carrying a sackful of unspoken words someone close to you desperately needed to hear. Again Solomon said, 'Pleasant words are a honeycomb, sweet to the soul and healing to the bones.' (Proverbs 16:24 NIV) He's dead right, you know. So ask God right now to help you find the courage, and the opportunity, to say what you have to say.<br />SoulFood: Num 19-21, Mark 6:30-44, Ps 37:16-24, Pr 11:4</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>How to defeat your giant</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;><br />'...the battle is the Lord's...' 1 Samuel 17:47 NKJ</p>
<p>It's amazing that we get to use the name 'Christian' to describe ourselves. You know what that means right? It means follower of Christ! So walk tall today and live a life worthy of the One whose name you carry. And don't be surprised when the giants of this world see you walking tall and try to knock you down. Maybe you'll find yourself facing fear, lust, pride, envy or anger, resentment or addiction. Whatever, you must realise: <br />(1) Giants start small. Goliath wasn't always a giant; he was fed every day until he became one. Our giants are usually little sins we feed until they grow so big and ugly we struggle to kick them out of our lives.<br />(2) Giants are bullies. Your giant will bully you for as long as you keep his existence a secret. But bullies hate people who have friends-especially powerful friends like Jesus! David told Goliath, '...this is the Lord's battle, and He will give you to us!' (1 Samuel 17:47 NLT)<br />(3) Giants need confronting head-on. The Bible says: 'As Goliath moved closer to attack, David quickly ran...to meet him.' (1 Samuel 17:48 NLT) Don't run away, don't try to negotiate or make excuses. Use the trusty weapon God has given you: His Word. And above all, don't look at God in the light of your giant, look at your giant in the light of God.<br />SoulFood: Num 16-18, Mark 6:14-29, Ps 37: 8-15, Pr 11:3</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>You'll get through this storm</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'Don't be afraid,' He said. 'Take courage! I am here!' Mark 6:50 NLT</p>
What's the weather like where you are today? No, don't look out of the window! What are the conditions in your heart? Listen: 'Late that night, the disciples were in their boat in the middle of the lake, and Jesus was alone on land. He saw that they were in serious trouble, rowing hard and struggling against the wind and waves. About three o'clock in the morning Jesus came toward them, walking on the water. He intended to go past them, but when they saw Him walking on the water, they cried out in terror, thinking He was a ghost... But Jesus spoke to them at once. &quot;Don't be afraid,&quot; He said. &quot;Take courage! I am here!&quot; Then He climbed into the boat, and the wind stopped. They were totally amazed...' (Mark 6:47-51 NLT) <br />Often it's when our life is at its most stormy that God teaches us the biggest lessons. Dave Dravecky was a top sportsman whose baseball career was ended by cancer 20 years ago. He lost his career but thankfully he kept his life! Here's what he has to say: 'Looking back... I have learned that the wilderness is part of the landscape of faith, and every bit as essential as the mountaintop. On the mountaintop we are overwhelmed by God's presence. In the wilderness we are overwhelmed by His absence. Both places should bring us to our knees; the one, in utter awe; the other, in utter dependence.' So fix your eyes on Jesus and don't worry about the weather. <br />SoulFood: 2 Kings 5:1-27, Matt 6:19-34, Acts 5:1-11]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>On guard!</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;><br />'It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man.' Psalm 118:8 KJV</p>
<p>Jesus said, 'Can all your worries add a single moment to your life?' (Matthew 6:27 NLT) Of course not! Worry changes nothing. When was the last time you solved a problem by worrying about it? Imagine somebody saying, '<em>I got behind on my bills so I decided to worry my way out of debt. And you know, it worked!</em>' You can't add one day to your life or one bit of life to your day by worrying; all worry will do is bring you wrinkles and grey hairs!<br />Listen to these two Scriptures: 'Those who trust in the Lord are like Mount Zion, which cannot be shaken but endures forever.' (Psalm 125:1 NIV); 'You will keep in perfect peace him whose mind is steadfast, because he trusts in You.' (Isaiah 26:3 NIV) We don't get up in the morning and decide, 'Today I'm going to doubt God', yet when we worry that's what we do.<br />Paul writes, '...His peace will guard your hearts and minds...' (Philippians 4:7 NLT) Paul uses a military word here-guard. The Philippians lived under Roman occupation and were used to seeing the centurions guarding their town. What security! Before an enemy could get to them they first had to get past the rock-hard Roman guards. And you know what? God gives you the same guarantee! His peace is not wishy washy-it is solid. Your heart and mind are completely safe if you'll let His peace stand guard. Why don't you ask Him for His peace right now?<br />SoulFood: Num 14-15, Mark 6:1-13, Ps 37:1-7, Pr 11:1-2</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>The right choice!</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'…I have come that they may have life…to the full.' John 10:10 NIV</p>
<p>When Jesus says, 'I have come that they may have life…to the full', He isn't talking about taking us on holiday to Disneyland or offering us a swanky pad, a faster car, the latest gadgets, fashion frenzy or a bank account that never runs dry. He isn't even offering a life free from pain or grief. He's inviting us into life as it was meant to be lived, with Him. Life with Jesus is like the difference between watching the latest movie on a black and white 10cm screen TV or on a cinema screen with surround sound. It's the difference between being robbed and being given a shed-load of the best presents ever! Jesus said, 'The thief comes to steal and kill and destroy. I have come that they may have life and have it to the full.' It's the difference between losing your life and gaining your life. John 3:16 says, 'For God so greatly loved and dearly prized the world that He [even] gave up His only begotten (unique) Son, so that whoever believes in (trusts in, clings to, relies on) Him shall not perish (come to destruction, be lost) but have eternal (everlasting) life.' (AMP) Because of Jesus we can live forever. We don't have to fear anything. We can go to Heaven and get the best out of life now. Have you made the right choice for your life?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Growing our faith</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'…faith is…the conviction of things not seen.' Hebrews 11:1 NAS</p>
<p>So what's the best way to grow in our faith? We can learn to trust God through the lives of other people. Reading the life stories of Christians can be a fantastic way to get to know God better. Chasing the Dragon by Jackie Pullinger or The Cross and the Switchblade by David Wilkerson are two powerful stories that reveal a lot about the life of faith in God. Ask your parents or older people in your church how they have learned to trust God over the years—you might be surprised by the stories they can tell you. But most of all, we learn to trust in God by simply doing it: by regularly stepping out in obedience and discovering that He's totally trustworthy. That happens when you take a risk with giving away your money, when you take a risk on sharing your faith with a friend or take a risk giving up your summer holiday for mission with people you don't know. Building faith is like building muscle. You strengthen and tone your muscles at the gym by repeatedly working and stretching them. In the same way, faith must be stretched. Sometimes that's uncomfortable. Obeying when God hasn't revealed the steps or the final destination can be challenging. But when we walk by faith He gets the glory, because we know we couldn't have done it without Him. So, take a leap of faith.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Take a leap of faith</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'…You give them something to eat.' Matthew 14:16 NKJ</p>
<p>Imagine this: you're in a popular band and the lead singer decides you're going to do a random freebie gig out in the sticks. You set off, stage and lighting arrives. Word spreads and people appear in masses. The show begins. It's amazing: the crowd are pumped, the beat goes on and you keep on playing. It's getting late, you're in a field in the middle of nowhere with a crowd of thousands but there's no burger vans, kebab heaven or fish &amp;amp; chip shop anywhere!  During the next musical interlude you say, 'Look guys, as good as this is, we're going to have to stop. Look at all these people, look where we are; we need to send them away so they can get some food. They'll be starving soon.' The lead singer says, 'Go on then, you feed them,' and you laugh: 'Good one, mate, very funny.' But He's serious. He's expecting you to feed them all! Now you've got some idea of what the disciples felt like. A crowd of over 5000 hungry people. Surely sending them home seemed like the best plan? But Jesus used the moment to teach them something. The disciples had a choice: put their faith in Jesus or pack it in! They choose to act on their faith and saw over 5000 people being fed from one tiny packed lunch. A miracle! Something they'd have never seen if they'd packed it in. Faith without action isn't much good at all!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>The Thomas effect</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'…Anyone who doubts is like a wave in the sea, blown up and down by the wind.' James 1:6 NCV</p>
<p>Doubts! We all have them! God says 'Anyone who doubts is like a wave in the sea, blown up and down by the wind.' Does this mean that God is dissing us if we doubt? No. Have you ever watched waves roll up the beach on a beach? They crash down and creep up the sand, then suck back out, then they're back in again, then they're back out again. They're restless, they never settle. That's what we're like when we doubt; we're unsettled, restless all the time. It's not a comfortable feeling and God doesn't want us to be suffering like this. He's doesn't diss us for doubting. He encourages us to get rid of them. Thomas, one of Jesus' disciples was one serious doubter; that's where we get the phrase 'Doubting Thomas' from. So what did Jesus do? Tell him to get lost, 'don't hang around me if you can't trust me, Tom'? No way. Jesus did everything needed to help Thomas get rid of all his restless doubt and replace it with guaranteed hope, positivity, certainty, security in God. 'Then He said to Thomas, put your finger here, see My hands reach out your hand and put it into My side. Stop doubting and believe.' Thomas answered, 'My Lord and my God.''(John 20:27-28 NIV) Let Jesus in on your doubts. What He did for Thomas He will do for you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Let God do the 'heavy lifting'</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'…it is God who works in you…' Philippians 2:13 NKJ</p>
<p>In our culture, the pressure to succeed can be huge. It hits us from every direction: from parents, teachers, friends and relatives, from the television and other media. But the life God wants us to live for Him is different from this. In fact, we can learn a lot from the humble straw! Imagine you've just got a freshly-poured thickshake. You grab a straw and stick it in. Now, how does this little piece of thin plastic move the thickest toughest drink known to man from the cup into your mouth? It doesn't. You do all the hard work. The straw is just the conduit. A conduit is a channel through which things (like the milkshake) move from one point to another, and you are God's conduit! You are designed to be a free-flowing channel for Jesus Christ Himself, bringing the influence and benefits of God's Kingdom wherever we go. It is God who does the hard work. You are just the conduit. The problems start when we forget this and allow ourselves to feel the pressure of making things happen in our own strength. We must be full of the Word of God, and most importantly, spend time in intimacy with the Lord in order to be God's conduit. So, today try and be more like the straw and let 'God work in you' more and more. Learn to let Him do the heavy lifting.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Liar, Liar</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'…those who deal truthfully are His delight.' Proverbs 12:22 NKJ</p>
<p>It's alright to tell a little white lie isn't it? 'The Lord detests lying lips.' (Proverbs 12:22 NIV) After all, it's not a real lie, is it? 'The Lord hates...a lying tongue.' (Proverbs 6:16-17 NLT) It's OK, everyone tells little white lies! 'You must...speak truthfully.' (Ephesians 4:25 NIV) It's impossible to be truthful all the time! 'Do not lie to each other.' (Colossians 3:9 NIV) In fact you need to lie sometimes, so you don't hurt people's feelings, right? 'Do not tell lies.' (Exodus 20:16 CEV) There's no excuse for lying, no reasons that make it acceptable. God doesn't mince His words about this. He tells us that lying is something the devil does: 'the devil...there is no truth in him...he is a liar and the father of all lies.' (John 8:44 NKJ) God lets us know that '...those who deal truthfully are His delight.' So be committed to telling the truth, it's an investment into the future: 'Truthful words stand the test of time, but lies are soon exposed.' (Proverbs 12:19 NLT) One more thing: when you avoid lying, you actually make your own life easier. Lying is hard work: you have to keep track of everything you say; otherwise you'll trip yourself up! People will know you're lying! Lying is destructive: it trashes trust, ruins relationships and creates conflict. Live truthfully and know that God delights over you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Gifted</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'Having then gifts…let us use them…' Romans 12:6 NKJ</p>
<p>God has given us all gifts and talents—yes, even you! He wants you to discover them and use them because He has given you them for a reason. 'Do what you're called to do,' He says. Trouble is we can spend more time trying to be like other people instead, ending up like this crazy bunch of animals in Dr Charles Swindoll's story: 'Once upon a time, the animals decided that they should do something 'to help'. So they organised a school. The curriculum: running, climbing, swimming, and flying. The duck was excellent at swimming…and very poor in running…so he dropped swimming to practice running. This hurt his webbed feet so badly that he couldn't even swim that well anymore! The rabbit stayed at the top of his class in running, but developed a nervous twitch in his leg muscles because he had so much 'catch-up' work to do in swimming. The squirrel was excellent in climbing, but he 'was frustrated' in flying class because his teacher made him start from the ground up instead of from the treetop down…so he only got a 'C' in climbing and a 'D' in running.'   Why didn't they just stick to what they were good at instead of trying to do everything? Stop concentrating on what you're not good at and start getting better at what you can do well. Enjoy being you—and excel at it!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Friends</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'…the Spirit…makes intercession for us…' Romans 8:26 NKJ</p>
<p>We don't have to learn or be taught how to talk to our friends. It just happens. A little 'hi' some time ago and a friendship was born. The more you chat, the more you learn each other's likes and dislikes, hopes and dreams. Your conversations become longer, more enjoyable, sometimes intense, even heartbreaking as you share disappointments and difficulties. You begin to trust and confide. You stop worrying when you disagree—it makes you, not breaks you. You mess up, it becomes easier to say 'sorry', to forgive. When friendships keep growing like this you make not just friends but best friends! You know, that's all that prayer is—a friendship with God. You begin by saying,'hi,' you keep on communicating and soon you discover that you have the bestest of best friends. Friends make conversation easy. You don't worry about what to say next. Sometimes friends know what you're going to say before you even say it! God is the greatest at doing that; listen: 'The Holy Spirit prays for us with groanings that cannot be expressed in words. And the Father who knows all hearts knows what the Spirit is saying, for the Spirit pleads for us believers in harmony with God's own will.' (Romans 8: 26-27 NLT) God's Spirit in us speaks to God for us, making chatting to Him the easiest thing in the world. Don't over complicate it or underestimate it. Discover your bestest best friend—pray!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Questions, Questions!</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'…don't worry about…what to say…' Matthew 10:19 NLT</p>
<p>When people know you are a Christian, they can bombard you with their thoughts and opinions. They lob really tough questions and crazy theories at you that totally wreck your head! Usually this brings about one of four reactions:  (1) you give up (you back off being a Christian altogether because you don't want the agro); (2) you shut up (you keep your head down and your faith to yourself); (3) you punch up (answering everyone in 'attack mode', verbally lashing out) or (4) you break up (fall apart under the pressure and end up feeling guilty for not knowing how to answer them). Jesus had questions thrown at Him all the time. The people asking the questions didn't really want an answer; they wanted to trick Him, trap Him, and make Him look like an idiot. He knew the same thing would happen to His disciples and gave them some advice: '…don't worry about …what to say.' Jesus never worried about how to answer His interrogators; He doesn't want you to worry either! Jesus didn't answer every question put to Him; sometimes He answered their question with a question back to them, or with a story which left people wondering what on earth He meant. Don't worry about people's questions or theories. Instead spend more time getting to know Jesus better so you never give up, shut up, punch up, or break up!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Family guy?</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'…for this purpose I have been sent.' Luke 4:43 NKJ</p>
<p>They say, 'You can pick your mates, but you can't pick your relatives!' Do you ever wish that wasn't true? Would you make any changes to your family if you could? Jesus knew how tough family can be—at times His family thought He was off His head! 'When His family heard this, they went to get Him because they thought He was out of His mind.' (Mark 3:21 NCV) It seems like Jesus' family just didn't get Him at times like this. So how did He handle His relatives? What's certain is that He kept loving His family despite the fact they didn't seem to understand Him. He didn't mouth off at them when they insulted Him or go into a major sulk and refuse to speak to them. But neither did He spend His whole life trying to please them or let their behaviour control Him. In fact, throughout His life He was single-minded in his obedience to his heavenly Father. The Bible is clear that we need to obey our parents (see for example, Ephesians 6:1-3) and this should be our starting point. But it's very likely that you will come into conflict at some point with people who are very close to you but who don't share your faith, or who are Christians but don't agree with where you feel God is leading you. At these times, we need to stick close to Jesus and take good advice from wise leaders in the church.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>SWEET!</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'The Lord is on my side; I will not fear…' Psalm 118:6 NKJ</p>
<p>Get this: 'The Lord is on your side!' God—the One who holds the universe in His hand, and then some—is on your side! How cool is that! Which means that just like David, who wrote Psalm 118, you can say, 'What have I to fear?' Sweet! Do you really believe that? It's so easy to think: 'God won't 'watch my back'…I'm too bad for God to even want to hang out with me.' Or 'I've messed up too much…I'm rubbish…no one wants me…I'm useless, no-one picks me—God wouldn't want me on His team.' We might get mixed up sometimes but God doesn't, so what He says goes! If He says 'He's on your side,' then it's true! He is! You don't have to be scared of anything or anyone because God is there with you, looking out for you, wanting to help you! Now hang on a minute! Before you get carried away—this doesn't mean that you can go through life doing what  you like, doing whatever, to whoever, wherever. You can't walk around singing, 'You can't touch me, God is on my side'. But when you follow God you can walk around knowing that whatever's happening, there's no need to be afraid, you can and you will get through it. So look up, walk tall, live confidently, knowing the Lord is on your side!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Training session</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'…a father corrects a child in whom he delights.' Proverbs 3:12 NLT</p>
<p>Ever feel like you're 'getting it in the neck' from everyone? Teachers: Blah! Blah! Blah! Parents: Nag! Nag! Nag! Police: Yada! Yada! Yada! And you're like, 'Whatever!' None of us enjoy getting 'disciplined'. It just does your head in! It can feel like people are against us wanting to bring us down. The word discipline doesn't mean to be unnecessarily mean, cruel and downright evil. It actually means to teach and to train. God knows that in order for us to become all we were created by Him to be, we need teaching and training. That's why 'the Lord disciplines those He loves.' (Hebrews 12:6 NLT) Discipline sounds negative to us because some people who have disciplined us in the past haven't always done in it in a good or a loving way. But Hebrews 12: 10-11 NLT says: 'God's discipline is always good for us…no discipline is enjoyable while it is happening—it is painful! But afterward there will be…right living for those who are trained in this way.' God is love. So when He disciplines you it's not because He enjoys inflicting pain but because He is hugely concerned about you. He completely 100% loves you! Be encouraged today, accept God's discipline, knowing He loves you so much that He wants to spend time teaching and training you to receive all His benefits.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Spot the deliberate mistake (3)</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'Words of the wise…should be heard…' Ecclesiastes 9:17 NKJ</p>
<p>Fear of making mistakes keep us from reaching our potential. Fear stops us from asking for help or owning up when we don't have all the answers. Fear stops us speaking out in case we get shot down. To be successful you need to be brave enough to listen. When you don't, it can be disastrous. In It's Your Ship, Michael Abrashoff writes: 'The moment I heard about it [the tragic sinking of a Japanese fishing boat off Honolulu by the submarine USS Greenville], I was reminded that, as is often the case with accidents, someone senses possible danger but doesn't actually speak up. As the Greenville investigation unfolded, I read in a New York Times article that the submarine's crew 'respected the Commanding Officer too much to question his judgement.' If that's respect, then I want none of it. You need to have people that can tap you on your shoulder and say, 'Is this the best way?' or 'Slow down', or 'Think about this' or 'Is what we are doing worth killing or injuring somebody?' 'History records countless incidents in which ship captains or organisation leaders permitted a climate of intimidation to pervade the workplace, silencing subordinates whose warnings could have prevented disaster. Even when the reluctance to speak up stems from admiration for the Commanding Officer's skill and experience, a climate to respectfully question decisions must be created in order to foster double-checking.'</p>

<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'Words of the wise…should be heard…' Ecclesiastes 9:17 NKJ</p>
<p>A story about a rich and powerful man made the headlines. Perhaps you read it? The man had a weakness for the opposite sex, and one day, after his afternoon nap, he strolled across the roof of his penthouse and stopped to perve at a chick having a bath. He made up his mind there and then to have her no matter what the cost. One affair, one murder, one dead baby later, the guy came to his senses. His reputation, his public standing, his character were just totalled. His name? King David of Israel (2 Samuel 11). Some mistakes have dire consequences. David allowed lust and passion to burn him up, completely disrespecting God's law, destroying Uriah (the husband of the woman David takes) and implicating Bathsheba (the woman having the bath) in the process. It's as if he turns off the part of his brain that thinks two steps ahead. Surely he knows it will all come back to bite him, and yet he goes ahead with his big seduction routine anyway. Aren't we a bit like that at times? OK, so maybe we're not committing a murder-adultery cocktail, but we can, in our own way, turn our brains off when it comes to thinking about the consequences of our actions. Gossiping, sleeping around, taking drugs, whatever—it all starts when we flick the switch marked 'consequences' in our brains to 'off'.</p>

<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'Words of the wise…should be heard…' Ecclesiastes 9:17 NKJ</p>
<p>Perhaps you got a shiny new guitar on your birthday. Perhaps you've perfected some of your better guitar hero poses in the mirror. Perhaps you've styled yourself somewhere between Skyhooks and Midnight Oil, for that retro feel. Who knows, maybe you've even rehearsed your acceptance speech for 'Sexiest Guitar Solo Ever on the Airwaves' for next year's ARIA awards. Now, all you have to do is get a sound out of it that doesn't seem like cat's intestines being plucked by a gorilla. Yep, that's right, no matter how promising we look, we're all still a 'work in progress'; whether it's learning guitar or learning to be humble, the principle is the same: we learn by our mistakes. Two top tips: First, recognise the bung notes. If you insist there's nothing wrong with your out-of-tune scales, you're only fooling your own ears. Everyone knows when you hit a bung note. Likewise everyone knows your weaknesses, so don't try and hide them. Learn from them! Second, remember that practice makes perfect. Paul McCartney didn't fall out of his mother's womb playing Hey Jude, he persevered through all his years of bung notes. Likewise, learn to see failure as part of the road to success. Those who are willing to learn from their mistakes don't have to keep repeating them. So there you are: happy plucking!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Heartache</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'…Let not your heart be troubled…' John 14:27 NKJ</p>
<p>Have you heard about that boat trip Jesus went on with His pals? The one where the sea got so rough, the waves weren't just rocking the boat, they were crashing over the sides and the boat was filling with water? (Check it out in Mark 4.) They weren't just worried about puking up with sea-sickness but petrified they were actually going to die. Well, everyone except Jesus that is. His pals; most of whom were used to life on the waves were reduced to quivering wrecks in one short trip. But Jesus was so chilled out He fell asleep. The disciples thought that Jesus didn't care about them: 'Teacher, don't you care that we're going to drown?' And you can't blame them for thinking that can you? They're in the middle of a massive crisis and Jesus is having a power nap! But the disciples were wrong. Jesus cared more about them than they realised, He sorted everything: 'He got up, rebuked the wind and said to the waves, 'Quiet! Be still!' Then the wind died down and it was completely calm.' (Mark 4:39-40 NIV) We don't have a clue what life will throw at us tomorrow, next week, next month, or next year. It could be calm and tranquil or it could be whipping up a storm. The thing is, Jesus does know what's going to happen and whatever it is, Jesus says, 'Don't let this throw you…Trust me.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Forgiveness</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'…forgive whatever grievances you may have…' Colossians 3:13 NIV</p>
<p>When someone messes us up the last thing we want to say to them is, 'I forgive you.' It feels like we're doing them a favour or we're 'letting them off the hook'. But this is just warped thinking. Forgiveness is a gift from God for you. Forgiveness isn't about doing someone else a favour; it's about setting you free! 'If you forgive others for their sins, your Father in Heaven will also forgive you for your sins. But if you don't…your Father in Heaven will not forgive your sins.' (Matthew 6:14-15 NCV) When we forgive, God is able to set us free from being trapped in our own sin. Forgiveness isn't about letting them off the hook; it's about you becoming more like Jesus. To the people who crucified Him, Jesus said, 'Father forgive them because they do not know what they are doing.' When we forgive, we act like Jesus, we become more like Jesus. 'When a person changes and follows the Lord...we all show the Lord's glory and we are being changed to be like Him.' (2 Corinthians 3:16-18 NCV) Are you carrying a grudge? Why? It doesn't make sense. Why would you pick up something each day that weighs you down and carry it around with you? When we're given a gift, we're given a choice—we can accept and make use of it, or we can stash it under our bed and forget about it. Open up God's gift of forgiveness and use it.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>What's the time?</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'...teach us to number our days.' Psalm 90:12 NKJ</p>
<p>When we're young it feels like the world is our oyster. We've got all the time in the world. Psalm 90 (the oldest Psalm) was written by Moses and He asks God to '...teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom.' Psalm 90:12 NKJ It's possible Moses wrote this psalm when all he could see was sand. For 40 years Moses was with the people of Israel, living in a desert. God promised them good things for their lives, but instead they ignored God and did their own thing. As a result the majority of them never left the desert; they never got to see God's better way for their lives. They lived and died in a desert, over six hundred thousand of them. They wasted their time doing their own thing, becoming right miserable losers! You may not be living in a desert, but how many times already have you wasted your time or been told by someone else that you're wasting theirs? How many times have you wished time away, wanting to throw off your teenage years because you're sick of people treating you like a little kid? Moses saw firsthand the horror of people wasting the time they have. Today ask God to teach you to make the most of your time, so that you can grow in wisdom. Let your life be a life of significance; not a waste!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>Do you know Him?</p>
<p>'…without Me you can do nothing.' John 15:5 NKJ</p>
<p>'Without Me you can do nothing,' said Jesus, letting us know that the only way to live life right, is through knowing Him. This can seem maddeningly confusing at worst and a little irritating at best! But when we get to know who Jesus is, it begins to make sense. Preacher SM Lockridge's once gave a six-and-a-half minute description of Jesus. Listen to some of the things he said (search on YouTube for the whole thing. It's worth it!): 'He's…the King of Kings…the Lord of Lords…the greatest phenomenon that has ever crossed the horizon of this world…He's the centrepiece of civilisation...He's the only one qualified to be an all-sufficient Saviour...He strengthens and sustains…He guards and He guides…He heals the sick…He forgives sinners…He blesses the young…He's the key to knowledge…His life is matchless…His goodness is limitless…His love never changes…His word is enough…His grace is sufficient…He's indescribable, He's incomprehensible, He's invincible, He's irresistible…You can't out live Him and you can't live without Him…Death couldn't handle Him and the grave couldn't hold Him…Do you know Him?' The more you get to know Jesus, the more incredible He becomes, the more you know you need Him and the more thankful you become in knowing that 'without Jesus you can do nothing.'</p>

<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'For the vision…will surely come…' Habakkuk 2:3 KJV</p>
<p>All this 'new beginning' talk is like a New Year's resolution—great for a few days but hard to keep going. Let's not be like your mum, who starts a new diet every other month and swears that no carbohydrate will pass her lips until she's lost 3 dress sizes. Or your Dad with his 'I'm quitting even if I have to set light to these nicotine patches to do it'. Let's start acting on the vision that God has given us. Let God's will be done on earth as it is in heaven today, courtesy of our fresh faith-like approach to life. Unlike Mum who in a few days will be having a chocolate withdrawal, we're going to have the will power of a saint. Why? Because, '…But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who believe and are saved.' (Hebrews 10:39 NIV) Yes, and when Dad is sniffing the inside of a used ash tray for the smell of tobacco, we will pray for strength: 'Let me live that I may praise you, and may your laws sustain me.' (Psalm 119: 175 NIV)   Whatever up and downs the rest of life has planned for you, 'Never be lazy, but work hard and serve the Lord enthusiastically…' (Romans 12:11 NLT)</p>

<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'For the vision…will surely come…' Habakkuk 2:3 KJV</p>
<p>Whether your dream is to kick-start a credible youth service in your church or to impress Marcia Hines with your bump 'n grind rendition of 'Millennium Prayer' (best seek advice from your minister on that one!) you're going to need plenty of iron in your soul. Every dream will face the pin-prick test sooner or later. But it's not the pain, it's the praise that will decide whether you survive. Early church hero Paul dreamed of spreading God's peace around the ancient world. After 16 months of being chained in a Roman dungeon, you'd expect him to be all 'woe is me', but this guy's grin is still going strong. Listen: 'Rejoice in the Lord always and again I say, rejoice.' (Philippians 4:4 NAS) How did he keep his smile when the world was telling him to frown? Extra brownie points if you answered: vision. Vision says: It's not over till God says it's over. Circumstances and people don't have the last word: God does! He is 'the author and finisher of our faith …' (Hebrews 12:2 NKJ). With God, quitting is not an option. When you quit without his permission you're 'AWOL'—absent without leave—you abandon His protection and provision. Vision also says: Nothing can defeat you without your permission. You can't control what happens to you, but you can control what you say and do. Take control; hold onto vision.</p>

<p>'For the vision…will surely come…' Habakkuk 2:3 KJV</p>
<p>What kind of aspirations has God planted in your heart? If you're not sure, then ask him: 'Make plans by seeking advice…' (Proverbs 20:18 NIV) If you want to know why you're here on this sphere, ask him. God has all your answers. God has all your purposes. God has all your dreams. Plus, here's the 'win-win' situation, not only will He give you wild dreams to chase, He'll give you all you need to fulfil them. Yes, there'll be set-backs and obstacles, it won't all be plain-sailing. (Hey, even Rocky has to do the hard yards of running up all those steps to his theme tune, before he gets his world title, so why should you get off lightly?) But if you stick it out, with God's help, you'll change history. Winston Churchill did it: when it looked like the war was lost, Britain's leader looked over the mountain, beyond the now and into the future, rallying his nation with these words, 'Never give up! Never give up! Never, never, never, give up!' Now there was a man of vision, a man of purpose, certain of his impending victory despite the overwhelming odds. Whatever righteous cause God entrusts to you, never, never, never give up!</p>

<p>'Arise and walk', Jesus said to a man who was paralysed. Can you imagine what must have been going through this guy's mind? There He was, being carried on a mat down the street by his mates who put him down right by this guy Jesus. By now everyone wanted to meet Jesus who was getting a reputation for doing miraculous stuff. The place was packed and Jesus looked at him, didn't mention his paralysis at all but said, 'Cheer up, mate. I forgive your sins.' This caused some religious people to have a go at Jesus, because they didn't like what He was saying. The paralysed guy was stuck in the middle of it all. Jesus turned to him and said, 'Get up. Take your bed and go home.' Talk about pressure! Everyone's now looking at him: what can he do? He knows he's paralysed and can't move! Where's the sympathy and understanding from Jesus, eh? Where's the love? How tough is Jesus on this poor guy? Even so, this guy chose to trust Jesus, and guess what? He stood up! He was healed. He didn't just walk out that room, he ran! Sometimes, what Jesus asks us to do can seem too hard, too tough. It can even seem like Jesus doesn't care about us, doesn't understand our situation. But if you trust Him the results will blow your mind.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Loving God, loving others</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'…which is the greatest commandment?...' Matthew 22:36 NIV</p>
<p>So how do you know when you've arrived as a top-notch premier league Christian?  Is it when you can raise your arms higher than anyone else during the worship time? Is it when you've mastered the art of pronouncing those long names in difficult Bible readings? Or is it when you have a variation of a 'WWJD' bracelet around your wrist? You get the vibe off Jesus that the things that require the least fuss and attention to us are the things that God smiles on the most. Someone once asked Jesus, 'Which is the greatest commandment?' He answered, 'Love the Lord…and…love your neighbour as yourself.' (Matthew 22:37-39) Don't you just love the simplicity of Jesus? We make 'religion' so hard and complicated, when really it's all about loving God and loving others. When it comes to singing, it's not about who's making the sweetest sound, it's about who you're singing to. When it comes to Bible study, it's not about who knows the most Greek words, it's about the words shaping your life. When it comes to 'WWJD' wristbands, it's not about who has the funkiest collection, it's about applying the 'What Would Jesus Do' principle to your everyday choices. How do you know when you're getting there? Simple: when you're loving God and loving others.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Learn by your mistakes</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'Words of wisdom spoken softly make much...sense…' Ecclesiastes 9:17 CEV</p>
<p>One day, King Zedekiah said to the prophet Jeremiah, 'I will ask you something. Hide nothing from me.' (Jeremiah 38:14 NKJ) Could you face that kind of honesty? Would you dare ask someone to go through your life and give them permission to ask some tough questions? Lots of Christians do this sort of thing all the time. It's called having an 'accountability partner'. This is when a strictly no-fun Christian ties you to a chair and beats confessions out of you with a sharp bamboo cane. Errr, actually, it's nothing scary at all: it's about meeting with someone more mature in the faith than you and being totally honest about your successes and failures. It takes a special somebody to be able to challenge you on your slip-ups and it's only a special few who can take the probing without wanting to worm their way out one way or another. Those who have accountability partners, however, find the support is the key to their proven track record. Too often, we only want to hear how great we are, but if we are just 'works in progress', it can only help to hear where we need to pull our socks up. It's all part of becoming beautiful: 'Do not let your adornment be merely outward…rather let it be the hidden person of the heart, with the incorruptible beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit.' (1 Peter 3:3-4 NKJ)</p>

<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'…Jonah arose to flee to Tarshish…' Jonah 1:3 NKJ</p>
<p>There's a guy in the Bible called Jonah. He could also be called Mr Stubborn or Mr Opinionated! Jonah despised the city of Nineveh. He took an instant dislike to anyone who came from there. But God had asked Him to go there, so he 'legged it!' He took a boat trip 4000 km in the opposite direction: 'Jonah ran away from the Lord and…found a ship bound for…Tarshish…' (Jonah 1:3 NIV) So God used a storm at sea, a bunch of burly sailors and a massive fish to bring him back. It's only when he got spewed up on a beach after spending 3 days in the belly of the Loch Ness monster's cousin that Jonah decided being 'Mr Stubborn' wasn't such a good idea! Before Jesus died, people asked Him for a miraculous sign that showed He truly came from God. (Matthew 12:39) He told them the only sign they would get would be that of Jonah. Are you running away from God? Or waiting for the miraculous sign? God's already given it—Jesus rose from the dead after 3 days in the tomb!  Instead of running away, Jonah eventually did what God asked. In Nineveh his life (and the lives of the Ninevehites) was transformed as he dropped the 'Mr Opinionated' act. Are you sometimes like Jonah? Stubborn: digging your toes in, running away from God, doing your own thing instead? Opinionated: judging people; being mean, nasty, disrespectful, racist or abusive, just because you think you're right? God loved Jonah so He never gave up on him. Because he was pig-headed, Jonah had to learn the hard way to accept God's love and trust Him. God loves you so He'll never give up on you but do you have to learn the way? Take on the Resurrection life and do it God's way!</p>

<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'…He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies…' Romans 8:11 NIV</p>
<p>Today you have to let go of what you've done to others. The things we've done to others can weigh us down like a ton of bricks—the guilt can really drag you down, even if they say it's fine now. It's a bit like living in A Christmas Carol, with the ghost of your past not letting you move on in life. How do you live with the things you've done? Take Saul (Paul) as an example, and you'll soon feel better about yourself! You can definitely learn from him, he was someone who had really messed up—he'd torn Christians from their families and dragged them away to be beaten and killed. Then he converted to Christianity himself, and went around preaching to and meeting the widows and kids of the guys he'd done over. How did he deal with that guilt? He had two choices, and so do we—either try to carry it around, and probably collapse in the process, or find someone with shoulders big enough to take it from us. What did Paul do? Enter Jesus, who has the biggest shoulders you could ever hope for. Paul handed it to Him, and thanked God for it. Check out Romans 7:24-25. God showed him mercy, and he let go of the hurts he'd caused, knowing God could heal them. Trust God to do the same for you, and let it go.</p>

<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'…I will build you up again, and you will be rebuilt…' Jeremiah 31:4 NCV</p>
<p>You check your jeans pockets before you shove 'em in the wash and discover two crumpled-up items. One a flyer, the other a $50 note. One you'll keep and one you'll throw away. Why? After all they're both just crumpled up rubbish, right? Wrong! One makes you think, 'Bin it!' because it's just a manky bit of paper that you don't need any more. The other makes you smile and think, 'Good one!' because you'd forgotten all about that money. One of them is valuable to you. When things go wrong, and they sometimes do, we can begin to feel like that flyer we found crushed in the corner of our jeans pocket. It started out ok; colourful, shiny, useful, but then it got pushed and pulled in every direction, the info on it wasn't as clear as it used to be and it looked dull and boring. It became a lost cause. When things go wrong, and they sometimes will; you need to think of yourself like that money you found crumpled up in the pocket of your jeans, not the tatty flyer. Even if it had gone through the whole wash cycle it would never lose its worth, never lose its value. You may feel battered, broken, bruised, useless! But you will always remain priceless to God and He promises, 'I'll start over with you and build you up again.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Rejected (3)</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'Jesus…asked, 'Are you also going to leave?'' John 6:67 NLT</p>
<p>Being abandoned, ditched, dropped, jilted, neglected, rejected can mess with our heads so much. When stuff like this happens, we tend to handle it by turning into one of three characters: The Boxer: We mouth off big time! Never throwing the towel in, we fight to the finish! The Actor: We pretend it doesn't matter, act like it makes no difference to us: 'I'm perfectly fine, thank you!' The Assassin: We plot revenge; 'I don't get mad, I get even!' Mouthing off, pretending we're fine, or plotting revenge will only leave us getting more hurt and probably hurt others in the process. So what should we do? Have you heard of the game Truth or Dare? You choose between Truth and Dare. Pick truth and you have to answer in total honesty any question that your friends ask you. Choose dare and you have to participate in a challenge set to you by your friends. But have you ever played Truth AND Dare? It's not so much a game but a way of life that God wants us to live; especially when we are feeling rejected. Jesus knows how that feels: He went to the Cross not only rejected by His friends but knowing that God Himself would turn away as He took on the sin of the world. TRUTH: Know God's truth about you. Jesus died for you. God says: '…you are precious to me. You are honoured, and I love you.' (Isaiah 43:4 NLT) DARE: to act on God's truth and not on your feelings! Live, knowing you're precious!</p>

<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'Jesus…asked, 'Are you also going to leave?'' John 6:67 NLT</p>
<p>Q: When negative experiences happen, what's your greatest enemy? A: Your own head! We worry and let our thoughts dictate the pace. Jesus was about to face His greatest trial, so He went out into the Garden of Gethsemane to pray. 'Not My will,' He said to His Father (and ours), 'but yours!' We need to let God in on our thoughts, let God control our thinking. If we don't, our thoughts run riot in our heads making us fearful, depressed, alone. Romans 12:2 NKJ says, '…be transformed by the renewing of your minds.'  Get God stuff in your head: When you say, 'I can't solve this!' God tells you, 'I will direct your path.' (Proverbs 3:6) When you say, 'It's impossible!', God tells you, 'Everything is possible.' (Luke 18:27) When you say, 'I feel all alone!', God tells you, 'Never will I leave you.' (Hebrews 13:5)  When you say, 'I can't do it!', God tells you, 'I can do everything through Him who gives me strength.'

(1 John 1:9, Romans 8:1) When you say, 'I'm afraid!', God tells you, 'Do not fear for I am with you, I will strengthen you and help you.' (Isaiah 41:10)  When you say, 'No-one really loves me!', God tells you 'I love you.' (John 3:16) When you say, 'I don't know how to go on!', God tells you 'I will show you.' (Psalm 32:8)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Rejected (1)</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'Jesus…asked, 'Are you also going to leave?'' John 6:67 NLT</p>
<p>Have you ever been dumped by a boyfriend or girlfriend? Rejected by your mates? Abandoned by your parents? If yes to any of these, you wouldn't be human if you didn't feel hurt. Sometimes the pain and sadness lasts for years. What's weird is that even if nothing like this has ever happened to us, we could still worry about it: fearful that one day someone will dump us, reject us or abandon us. No-one wants to be left alone. At some point we all experience the heartbreak of losing someone we love, or being disappointed in people. It's why God tells us over and over, 'Fear not for I am with you.' (Isaiah 43:5 NKJ) Jesus knows what it's like to be rejected by friends, and not just once! A whole bunch of his friends told Him to get lost. 'At this point many of His disciples turned away and deserted Him.' (John 6:66 NLT) So how did He cope? He didn't deny his emotions. He said: 'Are you also going to leave?' (John 6:67 NLT) It's all there: the pain of loss, wondering what's going to happen next. Remember the pain you feel is ok. Those who say, 'You shouldn't feel this way,' are well-meaning but wrong. Acknowledging pain initiates the feeling-dealing-healing process. You can't heal what you won't feel or deal with. So, embrace your feelings, draw on God's grace, and move through the healing process.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>New vision</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'I will give you My message in the form of a vision...' Habakkuk 2:2 CEV</p>
<p>You know when you put your Nan's coke-bottle specs on for a laugh? The world seems a stranger place. Everything seems not only blurred but out of proportion and your head gets that dull aching feeling. When you don't have perfect vision, the world takes on a shadowy edge. The Bible says the same about our lives: 'Where there is no vision, the people are unrestrained…' (Proverbs 29:18 NAS) Now we're not talking about getting your eyes checked here, we're talking about a vision for your life, a dream for your future, your God-destiny, if you like. Did you know that you are a VIP? One of God's special detached agents on a mission that only you can do? (Yes, that's right, you!) Even before you were a twinkle in your mum's eye, God had dreamed up things for you to do here on earth. The good news is you can avoid the dull aching feeling you get when you can't see where you're going. It's your mission (should you choose to accept it) to check in with Kingdom HQ for your next briefing. Here's a report from a God-agent: 'Trust in the Lord with all your heart…in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight. Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear the Lord and shun evil.' (Proverbs 3:5-7 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Getting fruity?</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'…the fruit of the Spirit…' Galatians 5:22 NIV</p>
<p>So, why does the Bible have a 'fruit' fetish? You can't turn a page in the New Testament without some green-fingered old beardy asking if you're bearing fruit. Is it because Mars bars and chips weren't invented then or is there a purpose in using 'fruit' as an analogy? Well, think about it, our nutrient-rich friends are bursting with goodness (something us God folk should be too). James was a bit fruity for God; that's why he writes, 'How can you show me your faith if you don't have good deeds? I will show you my faith by my good deeds.' (James 2:18 NLT) This verse sums up James' rant about not just talking a good game, but actually living out your faith or showing everyone your Vitamin C-hristianity. Now, where do apples come from? Do they just roll off a conveyor belt in a factory somewhere in the Goulburn Valley? No. They grow naturally, in the right season and from a healthy tree. Good fruit reflects a good tree. It's the same with us: when we're cutting it for God we're showing our ripe fruit, we're reflecting a good tree, we're shimmering for Jesus. Finally, what does this fruit taste like? Paul lists nine different kinds of spiritual fruit: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self control. Start going about showing that lot off and you'll soon make your mates spiritually hungry for something you've got but they haven't: Vitamin JC.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Acorns become oaks</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'Do not despise these small beginnings...' Zechariah 4:10 NLT</p>
<p>Don't be put off just because you haven't had the best start in life. All great things have to start somewhere. Something as large as an oak tree once started out as a tiny acorn. Take Jesus. He didn't exactly have a head start in life, did He? Think about it, He was conceived outside marriage, grew in the womb of a teenage mother (Mary was probably a year 9 at the time of her pregnancy), born in conditions of poverty (a donkey's drinking trough for his cot; that's the definition of 'hard up'). Before He even cut his first tooth, an entire army was on the hunt for his blood. Or what about David, the man known as Israel's greatest ever king? A scrawny little kid whose best friends were sheep. His family were considered insignificant; and he was the 'runt of the litter'. When he should have been given a break (after doing in Goliath for the king, for instance) he found himself instead the victim of King Saul's jealous rages. For a while he couldn't even tune his harp without Saul throwing a spear in his direction. Or Joseph: sold into slavery by his own nearest and dearest. Put into prison for refusing to sleep with the boss's missus. Who'd have thought they'd amount to anything? But they did and their lives counted for God. Many of us struggle with feelings of inadequacy or insignificance. But think of these guys and be encouraged.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>In good spirit</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'…be filled with the Spirit. Ephesians 5:18 NIV</p>
<p>Mortifying, isn't it? Seeing people intoxicated over the festive season, a grown man dancing around with his tie wrapped around his forehead, his wife drooling 'I love you' in his ear, and loudly telling everyone else what's wrong with the world. It's a stupid thing to be 'under the influence'; it makes you say and do things you wouldn't normally do. But being 'under the influence' of God, that's something else! When you're 'filled with the Spirit' you swagger about, you feel like dancing, you get loved-up for God and you want to put the world to rights. Ever noticed how some Christians can be loopy for Jesus? They seem to have their God stuff so much more sorted than you. Well, that's because they're intoxicated with God. Through planned Bible and prayer time, they're constantly filling themselves with the Spirit of God. Those tricky obstacles that come our way ready to throw us off-course can so easily be overcome when we're tuned into the Spirit. Paul knew this well. He wrote to the Galatians: 'Walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh.' (Galatians 5:16 NAS) Walking by the Spirit means continually refilling yourself with God. A car doesn't run on a tank of petrol forever, it needs refilling regularly. When life causes us to run dry, we need to go back to the fuel pump: the Holy Spirit.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>The road to God</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'...I am the way…' John 14:6 NKJ</p>
<p>Does every religion lead to God? Judaism sees salvation happening on Judgment Day after a life of morality. Hindus look forward to the end of a series of reincarnations of the soul. The Buddhist guide through life is the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eight-fold Path. Muslims earn their way to Allah through the Five Pillars of Faith. Many philosophers deem life after death as hidden and unknown: 'a great leap in the dark'. Some people clump Christ with Moses, Mohammad, Confucius, and other spiritual leaders. But what did Jesus say about Himself? 'I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.' (John 14:6 NKJ) No one? No one gets to God except through Jesus? Some would object, saying, 'All roads lead to heaven.' But how can they? Buddhists look toward Nirvana, achieved after no less than 547 reincarnations. Christians believe in one life, one death, and an eternity of enjoying God. Humanists don't acknowledge a creator of life. Jesus claims to be the source of life. Spiritualists read your palms. Christians consult the Bible. Hindus perceive a plural and impersonal God. Christ-followers believe '…there is only one God.' (1 Corinthians 8:4 NLT) Every non-Christian religion says, 'You can save yourself.' Jesus says: 'My death on the cross saves you.' All roads don't lead to Melbourne, all ships don't sail to Hobart and all flights don't land in Sydney. Every path does not lead to God; Jesus is the road to God.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Your money or your life</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'…You cannot serve both God and Money.' Matthew 6:24 NIV</p>
<p>The Bible is full of stories with unexpected twists. Case study: Exodus 32. All the Israelites have witnessed a serious case of God kicking Pharaoh's butt and yet here they are by Exodus 32 giving thanks and praise to a gold cow! If the Israelites had a brain between them at this point, it would probably fit comfortably into a salt shaker. C'mon, how does a chunk of metal with udders compare to the almighty Creator of the universe? Those old beardy Israelites sure had it all wrong…not like us wonderfully wise Christians today, eh? I wonder what those old Israelite dudes would make of the little rectangles of precious plastic we feed into holes in the wall. This is about money, of course. That's our main rival to God, isn't it? We make such a big deal about earning, spending and saving we may as well be giving it our full worship. We see money as the keys to comfort, the tickets to happiness and the vouchers to security. But happiness isn't found in the 'ker-ching' of a cash till. Listen: 'Don't be obsessed with getting more material things. Be relaxed with what you have. Since God assured us, 'Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.' (Hebrews 13:5 NIV) What's your big deal about: God or money?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>God's megaphone</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'...This is the way; walk in it.' Isaiah 30:21 NIV</p>
<p>Pain speaks volumes. Headaches tell us we need to lie down in a dark room; backaches tell us we need to lift safely; stomach-aches tell us to step away from the Doritos. Yes, pain tells us something's not right. Pain captures our attention. It can be the same with our lives, sometimes pain is necessary for change. The pain of depression can lead us to seek help. The pain of loss can help us re-evaluate what matters most in life. The pain of emptiness can bring us back to God. CS Lewis wrote, 'Pain is God's megaphone'. Maybe, this year has been tough for you, life seems a bit pointless and you've been left wondering, 'Where is God in all of this?' The Bible says, '...don't be surprised at the fiery trials you are going through… Instead, be very glad—for these trials make you partners with Christ in his suffering, so that you will have the wonderful joy of seeing his glory when it is revealed to all the world.' (1 Peter 4:12-13 NLT) Pain is never easy! Actually, life isn't easy, but one thing we can count on is God hasn't just left us to it. God is on the job: 'And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.' (Romans 8:28 NIV) Sometimes God has to use his megaphone to shout: 'This is the way; walk in it.' (Isaiah 30:21 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Going solo</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'And Elisha…saw him no more…' 2 Kings 2:12 NKJ</p>
<p>Some dynamic duos are just destined to be: Batman and Robin, Laurel and Hardy, Mickey and Minnie Mouse. The Bible also points out a perfect pairing in Elijah and Elisha. This couple were inseparable until one day '…a chariot of fire…separated the two…Elijah went…into heaven. And Elisha…saw him no more…' (2 Kings 2:11-12 NKJ) Elisha, the right-hand man, is suddenly without a boss to shadow. There are times in life when we must go on alone, and draw from God the strength to do it. Alone at the River Jordan, Elisha '…took up the mantle of Elijah…struck the water…the water…divided…and Elisha crossed over.' (2 Kings 2:13-14 NKJ) Crossing the Jordan was Elisha's first steps alone—except he wasn't really alone, God was with him. Those looking on were soon saying, 'The spirit of Elijah lives in Elisha!' Later, in 2 Kings 2:19-22 we see that 'spirit of Elijah' when God used Elisha to get rid of the pollution in a town's water supply. Any worries Elisha had about filling Elijah-sized shoes in the miracle stakes were quashed right then. Another time (2 Kings 2:23) near Bethel, Elisha is publicly dissed but God gets the last word in via a full-on bear attack! (Really, read it for yourself.) The point is, time and time again, Elisha didn't need Elijah, because he had God. Likewise, you're not alone either if you have God.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Lost</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'I will arise and go to my father…' Luke 15:18 NKJ</p>
<p>Look up the story of the lost son in Luke 15:11-32. Read it? Good. Now the father in the story would do anything to have his kid back with him, but he doesn't send a search party to kidnap him back. No, the choice has to be the son's. God doesn't force His agenda on us, as if we're His prisoners of war, or helpless subjects of a dictatorship. He empowers us to make our own choice. The son realised living in a pig-pen is no life at all. He came to his own realisation. What about you? You were born for a palace, not a pig-pen; have you realised that yet? Have you also realised the grass isn't always greener? The son should never have been in the pig-pen in the first place. His choices landed him there. Dad seemed too boring, home seemed like a bunch of rules, all work and no play. Surely, he thought, there's a better life on the outside, far away from dad's estate. That's what had driven our prodigal 1000 kilometres from being able to borrow dad's car or celebrating in style on his birthday. What about you? Does it feel like you're 1000 km away from where you should be right now? The reality is you're just a prayer away from God's outstretched arms.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Devilishly naughty</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'…submit to God. Resist the devil…' James 4:7 NKJ</p>
<p>The devil? He only exists in the minds of mullet-wearing metal-heads or crops up on the shoulders of cartoon figures complete with comedy pitch-fork, doesn't he?! It's time our mind gave the devil a complete make-over. Maybe it's easier to think in terms of 'temptation'; we've all been there, right? Those little moral dilemmas: 'I could download this track and pay the music company their $1.99…' or 'I could click on this illegal site and it's mine for nothing'? When it comes to temptation, nobody is so super-spiritual that they're immune. 1 Corinthians 10:12 NIV says, 'So, if you think you are standing firm, be careful that you don't fall!' Face facts: the very thing you're a sucker for wants to make a sucker out of you. The good news is that you can ask God for help. The Bible says '...God is faithful; He will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, He will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it.' (1 Corinthians 10:13 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>You could be Joseph</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'...God has made me forget…' Genesis 41:51 NKJ</p>
<p>So you find it hard to forgive your sister because she didn't return your CDs or you want to play soccer with your little brother's head because he lost your phone. But imagine if they sold you as a slave for the price of a double latté! You'd be well within your rights to throw yourself a pity-party. Unless, that is, you're like Joseph. He's the guy who refused to sit around and mope in his prison chains. Instead he stuck so close to God he could practically pinch him. That's the kind of attitude God loves to smile down on and that's why God elevated 'Mr Dreamcoat' from prisoner to Prime Minister in the space of 13 years. But how did Joseph get through his dark years? For starters, he didn't pretend it never happened. He must've spent many nights in God-led therapy, since he called one of his sons Manasseh (which means 'God has made me forget'). Every time Joseph called his son's name he was reminded how God had helped him move on from the hurt. His other son was named Ephraim (which means 'God made me fruitful in the land of my afflictions'). Every time he thought about Ephraim he was reminded how circumstances intended for his harm turned around for his good. Joseph teaches us that God-praise outweighs self-pity any day.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Room for improvement</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'I press on toward the goal…' Philippians 3:14 NIV</p>
<p>Paul writes: '…I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But…I press on toward the goal…' (Philippians 3:13-14 NIV) Paul must be in the top few influential Christians of all time. And yet here he is admitting that there's room for improvement in his life. What about you? You know when you get that annoying teacher's gem on your school report, 'Could try harder', well, in what ways could you try harder? Rate yourself in this 'room for improvement checklist' (a = always, b = sometimes, c = could try harder) (1) I'm patient (2) I'm self-controlled (3) I put others before myself (4) I'm a cheerful giver (5) I read my Bible (6) I pray by myself and with others (7) I'm happy with a lot or a little (8) I'm respectful (9) I choose forgiveness over hurt or revenge (10) I follow God no matter what. So how did you go? This isn't an exercise in bigging yourself up or battering yourself down, it's an opportunity to be like Paul by recognising how far you've come and then setting yourself some goals to become more Christ-like. Why don't you keep a copy of this checklist in your Bible, and keep coming back to it every few months? You might be pleasantly surprised at the results as Jesus paints His masterpiece within you.</p>

<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'Be dressed ready for service…' Luke 12:35 NIV</p>
<p>Whilst most of us would still be fiddling with the odour-eaters in our running shoes, Usain Bolt has already won the race, whistled his national anthem and cartwheeled all the way back to Jamaica. How? Because he's the fastest man on the planet; the guy has speed written into his DNA. The Bible often has Usain Bolt moments: again and again we read words like straightaway, immediately, and suddenly, giving us reminders that God often moves with speed written in His DNA. Maybe it feels like you're going through a 'God in slow-mo' patch right now. You've been praying for something again and again, but nothing seems to be happening. Well, perhaps you're just a prayer away from one of God's 'suddenly' moments. John 5 might be just what you need to hear. For absolutely yonks, a paralysed man was sitting next to a pool that bubbled from time to time with the right properties for healing, but nobody would help him at the right moments. How frustrating! Enter stage left Jesus, and we get a completely different scene. No longer is the man sitting a metre or so from his solution; he's face-to-face with it. A 38-year wait ends with a suddenly of God. What about you? Are you waiting for God's suddenly in your life? Take heart, sometimes God moves swifter than Usain Bolt. What counts is being ready.</p>

<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'…the inward man is being renewed day by day.' 2 Corinthians 4:16 NKJ</p>
<p>Remember that summer when you were desperate to cram yourself into your old togs? It was goodbye cheesy Doritos, hello celery, right? To get that beautiful beach bod, you knew you had to watch what you pushed into your mouth. Well, it's the same with inner beauty. To be sizzling on the inside you need to watch what goes into your mind. If you keep allowing your mind to pig-out on junk like gossip, back-biting, slanging and banging, it won't be long before you start to look spiritually flabby. So, how do you stay buff on the inside? First of all, we need to check out which areas we've let get a bit out of shape. This might mean spending some alone—time with God and asking him to pin-point some areas of 'bulge'. Confession is like a detox—good for clearing out those sin-toxins. Second, we need to change our habits. A healthy eating plan involves changing habits, not cutting out food full-stop. Nobody is asking you to be Mother Teresa, but changing some of your habits will help you. Could you cut out a few episodes of your favourite sit-com and pray instead? Probably. Finally, feed on something healthy. An orange has more vitamin C than a crème egg; the Bible has more nourishment than any magazine. You do the maths.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Don't judge a book by its cover</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'…man looks at the outward appearance...' 1 Samuel 16:7 NKJ</p>
<p>How often do you judge people by the way they look? They're carrying a big battered Bible, so they must be holy. They've got nice hair and the latest fashion, so they must be rich. They've got a sad face, so they must be no fun. You may not even know you're doing it—but we all do!  The prophet Samuel was just the same. One day God sent him to find Israel's next king. Samuel saw a guy who looked the part and thought, 'This must be the one.' Uh-uh. God measures differently to us: '…man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.' Short weedy, red-faced David was the one God had His eye on to do huge things. So if you're feeling a bit down because of the way you look, don't. God can do huge things with you. And in the same way, don't judge other people just by the way they look; give them a chance, and try to see the good things inside them that God sees. For all you know, they could be the next David: shepherd boy turned king. Or think about Paul; people of his day saw him as a person who was 'unimpressive…his speaking amounts to nothing.' (2 Corinthians 10:10 NIV) But God not only used his words in a massive chunk of the Bible but used the force of his tough life to change history.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Makeover time</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'…the Lord looks at the heart.' 1 Samuel 16:7 NKJ</p>
<p>Tweezers, waxes, creams, hair dye, scissors, 'brand name' clothes, whole new look—probably the things you think of when you hear the word 'makeover'. If you're a bloke, you're probably ducking for cover already! But that's not what we're talking about today. Every human being is actually two people in one: the outer person (the body, reputation, and personality) and the inner person (the character, spirit and soul). The outer you is visible to everyone, and although you may get a huge zit that not even the best concealer will cover, you can still pretty much 'makeover' the outer you so it looks good to everyone else around you. The inner you is invisible though, and you can hide it from everyone if you want—apart from God, that is! We may be able to hide what we're really feeling and thinking, how we're really doing from those around us, but we can't hide it from God. And here's the thing: the inner you won't ever cease to exist. So even though as you get older, your skin will get wrinkly, your hair will go grey, your bones will get brittle and you'll lose brain cells every day after you hit 30, your spirit will still be going strong. So make sure you exercise it, work it out and keep your spiritual insides trim.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Wonderful well or shonky sieve?</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'My peope...forsaken me, the spring of living water, and have dug...broken cisterns that cannot hold water.' Jeremiah 2:13 NIV</p>
<p>A cistern is like a well. What do wells need to do? Hold water. So when the people dug cisterns that were like sieves, that was a bit useless really! Sometimes, if we've not got God right in the middle of our lives, we can be running about doing so much other stuff that we become a bit like those wells - letting the water drain away when we need it to live. We all want to feel loved, and successful, and special, and sometimes we look for these things in the weirdest places, forgetting about God completely. You won't find happiness at the bottom of four cans of V, you won't find love having sex with your boyfriend or girlfriend, you won't find success sounding off about that new kid to all your mates, and you won't find fulfilment by nicking money from your mum's purse. All those things are like holes in your well. But when you put God in the centre of everything, you'll find He can give you whatever you need. You need to work at giving yourself strong, God-centred 'walls' to your well. '...blessed are those who trust in the Lord and have made the Lord their hope and confidence. They are like trees planted along a riverbank with roots that reach deep into the water... They never stop producing fruit.' (Jeremiah 17:7-8 NLT) Respect God, trust Him and honour Him in everything and you'll find those holes are soon blocked up, and you'll be a wonderful well, not a shonky sieve.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Get passionate</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'So we built the wall…' Nehemiah 4:6 NKJ</p>
<p>We're back with Nehemiah and his wall today. Remember how impressed the bullies were with the speed he rebuilt the walls of Jerusalem (and that's a lot of walls!) yesterday? Question: So how on earth did he do it? Answer: Passion! Nehemiah gave up a high-profile job, overcame relentless opposition, and worked passionately. What can we learn about passion today? (1) Passion is your first step to achievement. Your desire, not your high school results or your DNA, determines your destiny. The greater your desire, the greater your potential. (2) Passion will increase your willpower. Only when you want something badly enough are you willing to pay the price to achieve it. (3) Passion will change you. When your desires are in harmony with God's will and you follow them with a passion, you can't help but become a more productive person. (4) Passion will make possible the impossible. Sometimes, even the experts get it wrong—so watch out! In 1895 Lord Kelvin said, 'Heavier-than-air flying machines are not possible.' In 1905 the US President said, 'Sensible and responsible women do not want to vote.' In 1923 Robert Millikan, a Nobel Prize winner in Physics, said, 'There's no likelihood man can ever tap the power of the atom.' Hmmm, I think they all got it a bit wrong somehow! Jesus said, '…with God all things are possible.' (Mark 10:27 NKJ) When you become passionate about God's purposes, He'll show you what's possible.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Beat the bullies, crush the critics</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'I sent messengers…with this reply: 'I am carrying on a great project and cannot go down…' Nehemiah 6:2-3 NIV</p>
<p>Nehemiah teaches us three things to help prepare us for bullies and critics: (1) Expect it. When you're watching a race, where do you focus? On the front runners! 'Criticism is something you can avoid easily: by saying nothing, doing nothing, and being nothing.' But those three options don't work for God's kids. Don't stoop to the level of those having a go at you; rise above it. (2) Evaluate it. 'I knew they were scheming to hurt me,' Nehemiah said. When people say, 'I'm going to tell you something for your own good,' often they've nothing good to tell you whatsoever. When you're criticised, ask yourself who criticised you? 'Faithful are the wounds of a friend, but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.' (Proverbs 27:6 NKJ) Has that person earned the right to speak into your life? (3) Outlive it. Even Nehemiah's mates wanted him to give in and run away to hide but he wouldn't, and he carried on building his wall. When it was finished in super-speedy time, even the bad guys turned round and said that he must have had God's help! (Check out Nehemiah 6 for the whole story.) Sometimes you're in more danger from the advice of your friends than you are from the criticism of your enemies. That's when you must know who you are and what God's called you to do. It's the only way to outlive the criticism!</p>

<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'…They came and saw…and remained with Him…' John 1:39 NKJ</p>
<p>The country's most famous evangelist is in town and you've gone to hear him speak. But all he talks about is someone better who's coming soon. So what do you do? Stay where you are or go to try and find the guy he's talking about? Well, duh! Can you blame Andrew and his mates for going off to hunt out Jesus, and find out if He really was as incredible as John the Baptist was saying? They knew the only way to find out was to spend time with the man Himself, find out what floated His boat, what made Him tick—so they did. When they found Him, His response was to tell them to 'come and see'. So what exactly did He want them to see? (1) See how He handles power. Not once did Jesus use His power to impress others or enrich Himself in any way. (2) See how He handles people. He didn't see them as interruptions, irritations or obstacles on His path to personal fulfilment. No. '…when He saw the multitudes, He was moved with compassion…' (Matthew 9:36 NKJ) (3) See how He handles priorities. '…vast crowds came to hear him… But Jesus often withdrew to the wilderness for prayer.' (Luke 5:15-16 NLT) Did He know something we don't? No commitment is harder to keep, or more important, than spending time in prayer each day.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Don't be a clown-practice those circus skills!</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'But those who fail to develop…are shortsighted or blind…' 2 Peter 1:9 NLT</p>
<p>Brian Dyson once said this to a bunch of young students: 'Imagine life as a game in which you are juggling five balls in the air. You name them: work, family, health, friends and spirit. You will soon understand that work is a rubber ball. If you drop it, it will bounce back. But the other four balls are made of glass. If you drop any of these they will be irrevocably scuffed, marked damaged or even shattered. They will never be the same. You must understand that and strive for balance in your life.' You may feel like some of those things aren't relevant to you right now but it's really important to start to get the balance sorted now, even if some of them are still in the future. You need to focus on keeping your relationships with your family and friends healthy, making sure you're in good shape physically, and most importantly, keep your spiritual life fresh and on track. Work, although it can bounce, is still important (after all, God's first task for Adam at creation was to look after the land so He must see work as pretty important). Don't spend all your time with your mates, and forget about the rest! And don't spend all your time locked in the house listening to worship music. God says balance is good. Check out the rest of 2 Peter 1:5-9 for more balls that need to be kept in balance.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Face your fears (2) 'If-only-itis'?</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'Be not afraid of their faces...' Jeremiah 1:8 NKJ</p>
<p>Do you find yourself constantly comparing yourself to other people? Have you got a case of 'if-only-itis'? You always see where everyone else gets it right but not where you do? You only see where you get it wrong? You wish you were more like your best mate. Or maybe you always see the glass half empty, 'They'll never want to talk to me', or 'I could never do that' or 'Why would they go out with me when they could have someone better?' If that's you, stop! Rewind! Try to look at yourself with a God-mirror. Isaiah 43:4 NCV says 'Because you are precious to me, because I give you honour and love you, I will give…nations to save your life.' That's you He's talking about there. Say to yourself: 'They're what God made them and I'm what God made me. I'm unique—in a good way. Yes, I make mistakes, but I'm not a mistake. With God's grace, I can work on loving myself, on being the capable person He's made me to be'. Accept that it's a process. You don't have to get it right straight away—after all, you're only human! But if God says you can do it, you can, so face your fears. Do what you've been afraid to do. God's promise of '…I am with you…' (Jeremiah 1:19 NLT) was all Jeremiah needed, and it's all you need too.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Face your fears (1) 'What if …'?</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'Be not afraid of their faces...' Jeremiah 1:8 NKJ</p>
<p>Face your fears (1) 'what if …'? Your bus was late, so you got home late, so your dinner was late, so you got ready late, so you left the house late, so you've arrived late to your new youth group, choir practice, footie team, party… you get the picture. You're by yourself, and you look through a crack in the door and see that everyone is there already. You're about to walk in, but then fear kicks in. Are they talking about you? You start to sweat and panic; there's no way you can go in there and face them all. What if they all turn around to look at you, thinking goodness knows what? What if you get embarrassed and they all think you're stupid? What if they laugh at you? So many 'what ifs'. So you turn around and go home, missing out on what could have been a fantastic night. Stop! Rewind! Go back to when you got to the door, and stop saying 'What if …?' Instead, say 'So what if …?' Know that with God on your side, with His grace, you can handle anything. You may not especially like it, but you can do it and you'll survive to face another day. When Jeremiah wanted to get away from a whole bunch of people, God stepped in, and told Jerry not to be afraid, because He would be with him every step of the way. The same is true for you; so don't run away.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>'No strings attached' love</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'Can anything ever separate us from Christ's love?' Romans 8:35 NLT</p>
<p>Think back to the playground at primary school. You're there, happily playing, thinking everything is great. Then you see your best friend playing with someone else, so you go over to join in but they stick their tongues out at you, and say, 'I'm not playing with you, I'm not your friend anymore,' and you run off in tears. Ring any bells? Do you remember anything like that? Human beings can be a bit fickle; we fall out with other people for the stupidest reasons (not sharing toys, looking at a boyfriend the wrong way) or even for serious reasons, like betrayal or physical hurt. Because that's our experience in life, our minds can't quite cope with the 'no strings attached' kind of love that God offers us. We don't get that there's no small print. We're always waiting for the catch, for God to turn round and say, 'Sorry mate, I've had enough of you. I don't want to know you anymore.' But get this: '...I am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from God's love.' (Romans 8:38 NLT) How incredible is that? God will never stop loving you. No matter what. He knows exactly what you're like, and He loves you so much. There's nothing that God can't get over; so accept his no-strings-attached love today.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>The perfect package</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'…Having believed, you were marked…with a seal…' Ephesians 1:13 NIV</p>
<p>God has the perfect package lined up for you: When you believe, and become His child—that makes Him your Dad. You get His DNA, His seal on your life and the security of your future with Him. As a child of God, you get the seal of His Spirit on your life: 'Having believed, you were marked…with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit.' (Ephesians 1:13 NIV) Max Lucado writes: 'For a short time in college I worked in a vacuum-cleaner plant. We assembled the appliance from plug to hose. The last step on the assembly line was 'sealing and shipping'. By this point the company had invested hours and dollars in the machine. So they took extra care to protect it. They mummified it in bubble wrap, secured it with styrofoam, wrapped the box with tough-to-tear tape, stamped the destination on the box, and belted it inside the truck. That vacuum was secure.' But compared to God's care for His saints, the machine might as well have been dumped into the back of a rusty ute. God vacuum-seals us with His strongest force: His Spirit. He clothes His children in a suit of spiritual armour, encircles us with angels and lives within us. Not even the President of the United States is that well protected! But you are. That's how much God cares for you! How amazing is that?</p>

<p>'Dear child: I knew you before time began. I know how many hairs are on your head. You're created in my image and I'm just rapt by the family resemblance. I have plans for you. I've given you gifts to help you bring those plans to fulfilment and what I give, nobody can take away. But don't abandon my gifts, leaving them to spoil in a corner. Exercise them, and stir them up daily. I've started a good work in you and I'm going to finish it. I always complete what I begin. 'My commitment to you is unending. In this life you will have challenges, but cheer up, I've robbed Satan of his power to control you and I've smashed the power of this world to destroy you. When you're in trouble, remember I'm with you. Hand Me your burdens so I can help and keep you going. When you're stressed out and worn down by the pressures of life, lean on Me. I'll be your rock, your fortress, your deliverer and your strength. Even though you fail from time to time, you won't be discarded because I am upholding you. 'But a word of caution: don't take advice from those who are spiritually blind or hang out with sceptics. Dig deep and take delight in My Word and, like a big oak tree growing by a river, you'll prosper in all you do. Love, God. 'PS, I'd love to hear from you.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Be a baby again</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'…everyone who believes in Him will have eternal life.' John 3:15 NLT</p>
<p>It's easy to sometimes read the Bible and get a bit confused, isn't it? That's where stories like this one about Nicodemus are great; here was a teacher and even he didn't get it when Jesus told him he had to be 'born again'! It's ok not to get things straight away, but Jesus wants us (like Nic) to stick at it until it makes sense. So what exactly does it mean to be 'born again'? Well, if you've ever seen a newborn baby, you know they don't do much other than eat, sleep, cry and fill nappies! The baby is totally dependent on its parents, and that's what God wants for us. It's as simple as looking to the Father, and looking to His Son, and only then can we truly live.   We expect life to be way more complicated than that. I mean, you can't even join a video store without jumping through hoops! Surely, we think, we have to do more stuff to get eternal life? Well, according to Jesus, apparently not. All we have to do is believe. Trust. Just like you trust the air around you has enough oxygen for you to breathe, just like you trust a chair every time you sit down, just like a baby trusts their parents for food. Trust the power of God that you can't see to do what you can't imagine, and you, like Nic, may suddenly 'get it'.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Surviving an 'SOS'</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>…pour out your hearts before Him…' Psalm 62:8 NKJ</p>
<p>We all have bad times. And at some point, we'll all have someone close to us who will die, and leave a massive hole in our lives. So what advice does the Bible give us on how to cope? (1) Don't bottle it up. Did you ever close your eyes when you were a kid, and think, 'If I can't see them, they can't see me'. That doesn't work with emotions! They won't go away just because you close your eyes. They're normal, so don't try and hide them away, or pretend they don't exist. God created you to feel—so go with it. The Bible tells us, 'Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.' (Matthew 5:4 NIV) Be honest with God. 'Pour out your heart before Him,' Psalm 62:8 NKJ) and He will comfort you. (2) Let your mates help. Don't go and hide in a corner, like the kid who's been told off and isn't letting anyone near. When tragedy strikes, we all need the encouragement, support (and hugs!) of our friends. And your mates have been called to help—check out Galatians 6:2. (3) Think positively. Cheesy as it sounds and little as you may feel like it, focus on the good memories. Make a list of all the other good things you have in life, and thank God for them. When you focus on the good, it's hard not to start feeling better.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Stewardship (4)-Why bother?</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'...the lord of those servants...settled accounts...' Matthew 25:19 NKJ</p>
<p>So, to recap. God gives us all good things, and we are stewards of them for Him. He gives us what we can cope with, and He will only expect us to do what we can. He wants us to do the right thing, and make these gifts grow-but He won't force us. We get to make our own decisions. This is great, but at the end of the day, why should we bother?<br />One reason is before us: 'After a long time the lord of those stewards came and settled accounts with them.' (Matt 25:19 NKJ) It may seem like it's been a long time since Jesus was here, and it may feel like it could be forever before He comes back, but He will come back. He hasn't changed His mind or His plan. The first time, Jesus was here to save. The next time, He'll be here to reign; and when He does, He will reward His good stewards. Check this out: 'If the master returns and finds that the servant has done a good job, there will be a reward.' (Luke 12:43 NLT) He's coming back, and He'll be looking for those who have stewarded well. What more reason could you want than to please the King of kings Himself?</p>
<p>So don't get weary or bogged down, but keep your eyes on the prize! Imagine Jesus saying 'Well done!' to you when He returns. Awesome.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Stewardship (3)—Who's pulling the strings?</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'…Well done, good and faithful servant…' Matthew 25:21 NKJ</p>
The next thing to learn is that God isn't a puppeteer! We're not in some episode of Thunderbirds where God's written the script and is pulling the strings to make sure we do what He wants, when He wants and how He wants, with Him speaking for us. No way! When God gives us good things, whether that's money, gifts, or skills, He won't force us to use them well. It's entirely up to us. We have the freedom to run our own show, to mess it up or make what He's given us grow amazingly. Looking at the parable of the talents again, we see that the first two servants made their money grow, whereas the third wimped out and just buried what he had been given, not doing anything positive with it. He was scared he wouldn't be able to do enough, and the master would be mad; so instead he did diddly squat. Not good enough, the master says. It's easy to read the story and think he was an idiot, but sometimes we may find we're doing that with God too: we're scared to use what He's given us in case we don't get it right. But remember God won't ask you to do anything you can't. By His grace, you can do all things that He asks of you. So don't wait for Him to tap you on the shoulder, set to it yourself.

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Stewardship (2)—personal responsibility</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'…He gave…to each according to his own ability…' Matthew 25:15 NKJ</p>
Today, let's take a look at the parable of the talents in Matthew 25:14-30. A businessman going on a trip divides up his money among his managers and instructs them to take care of it for him. You'll notice Jesus points out a really key thing: the man distributes to each manager 'according to his own ability'. God knows what you can handle and He won't give you more, so don't ask Him to. The master didn't burden the one-talent guy with a five-talent responsibility, or vice versa. Now we're not saying that those who have lots of stuff are the best stewards, or that those who have less must be poor stewards but God knows each of us intimately, and He deals with us according to that knowledge. You won't have to answer for what God didn't give you or what He gave someone else. You're only responsible for yourself. Whatever God's entrusted to you to manage, He's done so knowing you're capable of handling it. So if you feel your mate's got it all and you're a bit jealous; just remember, they've got all the responsibility as to how they deal with it too, and they'll have to answer to God for what they do. And if it's you that's got it all, don't go bragging to your mates and showing off. Instead, remember your responsibility to do the right thing. Whatever you've got, ask God what He wants you to do with your lot to glorify Him.

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Stewardship (1)—it's mine!</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'…What do you have that you did not receive?…' 1 Corinthians 4:7 NIV</p>
So what does this word 'stewardship' mean? 'Hands off!' 'You can't have it!' 'It's mine!' These are all common things you hear kids saying when they're playing. But just have a think: have you said (or even thought) that recently? It's easy to fall into the trap of thinking we have the right to everything we have. Our time is ours, our stuff is ours, we can do what we want with it, right? Uh-uh—wrong! Look at today's verse. Every good thing you have is a gift from God. That's everything: your phone, your iPod, your Wii, your allowance… starting to get it? It's all from God. Yes, you may have saved for it or worked for it but ultimately it's God who has given it to you so you can be a 'steward' or caretaker. 'So what?' I hear you say. 'He's given it to me, so it's mine'. Yep, that's true; but a steward doesn't actually own the property he manages, so he needs to handle things with an eye to pleasing his boss, the owner—in our case, God. He wants us to be sensible and wise with what He's given us, not selfish and boastful like those little kids always screaming, 'Gerroff! It's mine!' But how do we know what God wants us to do with what He's given us? And how come some people get more than others? Don't panic—we've got three more days to make sense of that!

<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'…Let your 'Yes' be yes and your 'No,' no…' James 5:12 NIV</p>
Saying what you mean is just the beginning. Meaning what you say is the next step. Don't say one thing, then walk away and do the opposite. When you say 'that's the last time', make sure it is! Start with the small things (like how much time you'll spend on the games console or starting your assignment before the last minute), and you may well find it filters into some of the bigger decisions and actions too. If you're not planning on doing something, don't say you will. And stick to your guns too; if you tell your friend you're not going to let him borrow your bus pass anymore, don't let him. Saying 'Oh ok, just this once', makes him think it's ok to keep coming back and before you know it he'll be walking all over you again. Have you ever heard a mum screaming at a kid, 'If you don't stop that right now you'll have to go to your room'? The kid doesn't stop, so the mum says, 'This is your last warning'. Still the kid doesn't stop—but still the mum doesn't take action. The 'final warnings' just keep on coming. What does the kid do? Whatever they want to, of course. Why? Because empty words have no meaning. If you want people to listen to what you say, respect you, and value your words—then make sure you place value on them too, and follow through on what you say.

<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'…Let your 'Yes' be yes, and your 'No,' no…' James 5:12 NIV</p>
'Sick. Wicked. Mint. Cool. Sweet. Cheese. Gross.' What do you think when you hear those words? And what do your parents think? I'm guessing completely different things. You think: 'amazing, awesome, fantastic, nice, great, naff, disgusting'. Your parents think: 'ill, evil, a herb that flavours toothpaste, cold, sugar, cheddar, large'. Words can be so easy to misunderstand, and I'm guessing there's plenty of times when your mum has a go at you because she can't understand what you're saying or your dad tries to drop a 'cool' into everyday conversation. Sometimes what we say can be easily confused, especially if we're not in the habit of saying what we mean. The Bible says '…Let your 'Yes' be yes, and your 'No,' no…' Does that mean you have to eat a dictionary before you speak to anyone to make sure you use all the correct grammar? Not at all. But it's really important to actually think about what you're saying to people. Only say 'yes' if you really mean it, not because you've felt pressured into it. Stop and think for a moment before your instant reply to your parents is 'no'. Is there a chance you could you actually do what they're asking? By thinking first, you'll build strong relationships and people will know they can trust your 'Yes' to be yes, and your 'No' to be no.

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Barneys are bad!</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'…Let's not have any quarrelling…' Genesis 13:8 NIV</p>
We're not talking about huge purple dinosaurs, but about the kind of barney when it's your face that turns purple from shouting! Abram and Lot could have fallen out badly when it came to parting ways and deciding who'd get what bit of land. But Abram realised that an argument wasn't the way forward so he bit the bullet and did something about it. We can learn a couple of things from old Abe here that help us handle conflict and confrontations in our own relationships. (1) Don't wait for someone else to make the first move. Abe realised that, left unchecked, a problem could arise so he took the initiative and nipped it in the bud. Growth and blessing call for wisdom. So be wise: if you sense a problem between you and someone else, try to make the first move in putting things right. (2) Don't worry about missing out on something; God will make it up to you. Lot chose the best fields when Abe gave him the choice and it might have looked to Abram that he was left with the dud end of the deal. But read on to the end of the story, and you'll see that it all went pear-shaped for Lot, but Abram's decisions blessed all mankind. God's plans for you are bigger than who wins the argument. Try to be a peacemaker and leave the barneys behind you.

<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'Whenever you are able, do good to people who need help.…' Proverbs 3:27 NCV</p>
Dan Clark tells the story of a time when he and his dad were queuing for the circus, behind a really poor family who were so excited it was obvious they had never been to the circus before. You could tell just by looking at them. The attendant asked how many tickets, and the man proudly replied, 'I'd like to buy eight children's tickets and two adults'.' But when the attendant said the price, the man's wife dropped his hand, and her head drooped. The man leaned in and whispered, 'How much…?' The attendant repeated the price. The man obviously didn't have the money—he looked crushed. Behind them, Dan's dad pulled $20 out of his pocket and dropped it on the floor. Then he tapped the man on the shoulder, pointed to the money and said, 'Excuse me, I think this must be yours.' The man knew exactly what was going on. He looked straight into Dan's father's eyes, took his hand, shook it, and with a tear streaming down his face replied, 'Thank you, thank you, sir. This really means a lot to me and my family.' There wasn't enough money for Dan and his dad to go to the circus as well, so they got in the car and drove home. But it didn't matter to them. They'd blessed a whole family, and none of them would ever forget that. That's called doing good. Can you see any good you could do today?

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Faith life</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'All these great people died in faith...' Hebrews 11:13 NCV</p>
What does it mean to die in faith? Or even to live in faith? It means trusting in God, believing His promises; even if everything around you is pointing in the opposite direction. It means knowing that God is in charge and living like it, even when everyone around you is telling you not to. It means holding on to God's promises, His love for you, and His perfect plan for your life, even when everything feels like it's falling apart. Take a look at Abraham; in faith, he and his very old wife became parents when it really looked like they couldn't! Or Noah; how crazy did it seem to build a mahoosive boat in the middle of dry land? I bet everyone around him was thinking what a nutter he was, but his faith proved right and his family were the only ones still with dry feet when the flood came. But the people of faith didn't always see God's promises fulfilled. Abe didn't see the complete ultimate fulfilment of God's promises for his life but still died believing in God's promises. Follow old Abe's example today: trust God, live your life in a way that shows you have faith in Him, no matter what your circumstances are. Trust that God will do everything in His way, in His time, and for His glory; and then you'll have a faith life.

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Turn aside and listen to God</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'I must turn aside to see this great sight...' Exodus 3:3 ESV</p>
Moses was just doing his job minding sheep out in the desert when he saw a bush on fire. No big deal at first, until he noticed the bushfire wasn't burning up the bush. Moses said, 'I must turn aside to see this great sight.' In that moment, everything depended on his willingness to interrupt his daily routine and make time for God. Moses could have said, 'I'm busy,' and kept on going. But he didn't; he 'turned aside' and his life changed! God wanted to begin a new nation with Moses leading it. The timing seemed strange. With God, it often does. Forty years previously Moses had been young, the product of the finest education system in the world. He had powerful connections and high hopes. But now he was a nobody, a lowly shepherd in a forgotten desert, rejected by his people and a fugitive on the run. He asked God: 'Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh?' (Exodus 3:11 ESV) Moses was thinking: Nobody knows me. I don't speak too well. And my track record isn't too good. But God said, I know about your past, and it doesn't matter. Your failure and inadequacies are no longer the ultimate truth about you. You are what you are, but you're not yet what you will be; because I will be with you. Do you need direction for your life? Slow down, turn aside, and listen to God. What He has to say is more important than anything else you'll hear.

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>You can't save yourself!</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'…Not of yourselves; it is the gift of God.' Ephesians 2:8 NKJ</p>
Lifeguards know more than how to stand next to the pool chatting people up, or spin their whistle around really fast, or how to give dirty looks to anyone who does a dive bomb. They know how to save people from drowning! If a lifeguard is trying to save you, you need to stop kicking around trying to save yourself. When you're struggling in deep water you tire easily and sink faster. You also drag others down with you. That's why a lifeguard will tell you to stop struggling and trust him. It's true with God too: He doesn't need your help to save you! The Bible says, '...God's mercy is great, and He loved us very much. Though we were spiritually dead because of the things we did against God, he gave us new life with Christ… And he raised us up with Christ and gave us a seat with Him in the heavens…I mean that you have been saved by grace through believing. You did not save yourselves; it was a gift from God. It was not the result of your own efforts, so you cannot brag about it. (Ephesians 2:4-9 NCV) When Nicodemus came to talk to Jesus about salvation he thought Jesus would give him a list of religious do's and don'ts to follow. What this top-dog religious leader failed to grasp is that God is not impressed with our good works; He loves us but in His eyes '…each of our good deeds is merely a filthy rag…' (Isaiah 64:6 CEV) There's a humbling thought! Paul writes: '…His grace…is a free gift…' (Romans 3:24 NCV), and He's offering it to you today. Will you accept it?

Heard of Handel? These days his music is what your gran rocks out to on Classic FM but in his day he was like a rock legend! Handel was a musical genius. At 21, he was a musician at the very top of his game. When he turned to composing, he gained immediate fame and soon was appointed Kapellmeister (that's German for the dude in charge of the tunes) to the guy who later became King George I. By the time he was 40, he was world-famous. (This might not seem like much now but in the days before tv or the internet, it was a mega-achievement.) But despite his talent and fame he faced huge difficulties. Rivalry with other composers was fierce. Audiences were fickle; sometimes they didn't turn out for his performances. Several times he found himself on the verge of bankruptcy. He suffered a stroke which left his right arm limp and damaged the use of four fingers on his right hand. Although he recovered, it left him battling depression. Finally, at 56, Handel decided to retire. Discouraged, miserable and consumed with debt, he gave what he considered would be his last concert. Filled with self-pity, he quit. But later that year, something incredible happened. A friend gave Handel a play to read based on the life of Christ. Immediately the floodgates of inspiration opened. For three weeks Handel wrote almost non-stop. In 24 days he had completed the 260-page manuscript of his most famous work: The Messiah. Don't give up!

<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'…God has come to help his people…' Luke 7:16 NCV</p>
Jesus walks into a village and sees a woman as she wails and staggers alongside the body of her son being carried for burial. Luke says: 'When the Lord saw her, he felt very sorry for her and said, 'Don't cry.' He went up and touched the coffin, and…said, 'Young man, I tell you, get up!' And the son sat up and began to talk. Then Jesus gave him back to his mother. All the people were amazed and began praising God, saying, '…God has come to help his people.'' (Luke 7:13-16 NCV) Many of the Jews believed that God had forgotten about them. The Romans were in charge and life was a nightmare; there was no hope. Then the stories start: 'Have you heard about the man preaching that God loves us? You know he's healing people and giving out free food?' 'Have you heard He makes friends with losers and sinners or about that kid he raised from the dead?' For the religious leaders these stories were full of heresy but for the lost, sick, broken and abused, the stories were bursting with hope. If you're looking to get life sorted, this is the good news: God isn't up above the world, He's in it, getting His hands dirty and looking to the needs of His people!

<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'When Jesus heard this, He was amazed at him…' Luke 7:9 NIV</p>
<p>We know the routine by now. An awkward-looking hopeful stands fidgeting before three judges. The nice judge says nicely, 'So what are you going to sing?' and then smiles. The nervous hopeful whispers the name of a multi-award-winning superstar's most famous and difficult song, opens their mouth and begins to sing. The nice judge listens smiling, the honest and important judge rolls his eyes and the last judge attempts to hide his sniggering. The hopeful leaves rejected and in tears. Another unlikely-looking person wanders in and the judges expect more of the same. But then the new contestant begins to sing with a voice that is beautiful, harmonious, staggeringly good. The judges sit with mouths wide open. They are blown away, impressed and most of all amazed! In today's reading, we discover someone who impressed Jesus so much that Luke says Jesus was amazed. Imagine, Jesus open-mouthed with astonishment! And who pulled this off; who was able to wow God? Not one of the disciples, not a super-religious Bible boffin, but a Roman soldier. Luke puts it this way: 'When Jesus heard this, he was so surprised that he turned and said to the crowd following him, 'In all of Israel I've never found anyone with this much faith!'' (Luke 7:9 CEV) Want to impress Jesus? Simple. Just trust Him.</p>

<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'…I have seen a son of Jesse…who is skilful…' 1 Samuel 16:18 NKJ</p>
David didn't suddenly become an expert with a slingshot when Goliath rocked up, or suddenly know how to play power chords on the harp when King Saul called for a private gig at the palace. He had already taken the long, slow, disciplined route of learning those skills. David had no idea what his future held; he simply got stuck into discovering and developing his gifts. If you think you have learnt all that you need to know, you'll never grow. At the risk of sounding like a 'life coach', which zone do you live in? The 'challenge zone': 'I attempt to do what I haven't done before'? The 'comfort zone': 'I only do what I already know I can do'? Or the 'coasting zone': 'I don't even do what I've done before'? Take up that challenge and you might end up using those skills! David's brothers knew his skills, yet none of them told King Saul about him. When Saul needed a musician: 'A man named Jesse who lives in Bethlehem has a son who can play the harp,' one official said. 'He's a brave warrior, he's good-looking, he can speak well, and the Lord is with him.' (1 Samuel 16:18, CEV) David didn't compete with his brothers or complain about his status as a shepherd. He just kept working on his relationship with God and sharpening his skills. When the time was right, God promoted him. So keep at it; prepare yourself. Ecc 9-12, Matt 15:1-14, Ps 5, Pr 5:1-2]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Five don'ts that make a difference</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'…Get understanding.' Proverbs 4:7 NKJ</p>
Today, five lessons about life that make all the difference: (1) Don't worry, just do your best. God accepts no less, but He demands no more. 'Trust in the Lord, and do good…and He shall give you the desires of your heart.' (Psalm 37:3-4 NKJ) (2) Don't rush it, do it right. 'Good planning and hard work lead to prosperity, but hasty shortcuts lead to poverty.' (Proverbs 21:5 NLT) (3) Don't believe something is impossible without trying it. When you are in God's will, doing things God's way, sensitive to His timing and willing to stick at it, your problems are just a platform for Him to work on your behalf '…we must wait patiently and confidently.' (Romans 8:25 NLT) (4) Don't waste your time. Put first things first and ask yourself, 'What is it that only I can do, or do best?' Only when you've answered that question will you know what you should do. Despite what you're thinking right now, it's probably not got a whole lot to do with Guitar Hero! (5) Don't just talk about it…do it. Lots of people have good intentions but those intentions have to become actions. Get specific about your diet and your devotions, your finances and your family. 'If it's to be, it's up to me.' Write those words on a card and read them regularly. James writes: '…faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.' (James 2:17 NKJ)

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Loving people</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'…Love one another…' John 15:12 NKJ</p>
Hearts, cherubs firing arrows, Valentine's Day, diamond rings, soppy text messages, wedding bells… Maybe these are the sort of things that come to mind when you hear the word 'love'. So what on earth does this verse mean when it tells us to 'love one another'? Does that mean we all have to go around gooey-eyed, hugging and kissing, with a permanent grin on our faces, telling everyone how awesome they are whether we know them or not? Errrrrr, no thank you! But this is a command we've been given from God, and loving others is something we have to do proactively (meaning it has to start with us). Here are 3 hints to help you really love someone: (1) Give them some confidence. You're not the only one who has bad days. Under the 'it's fine' mask that your mates and family wear, you might find they're actually struggling today. So remind them what God says: '…I will never leave you nor forsake you.' (Hebrews 13:5 NKJ) (2) Pump them up. Compliment someone when they least expect it, without expecting them to say something nice in return! Look through your Bible and see how often God tells us how special we are—pass some of that on! (3) Use your ears. Often people just need to be listened to, to feel they're valued. So put those lug-holes on the side of your head to good use!

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Get to know God better</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'Can you discover the depths of God?...' Job 11:7 NAS</p>
It's not what you know but who you know. If you know the band, you get backstage passes. Or if your sister has a job at a pizza store, you know when to come in for a special. The Bible also says there are things we can have just because we know God. (1) Blessing. The more you know God and obey His will, the more you'll experience His blessings. 'If you obey all the decrees and commands I am giving you today, all will be well with you and your children…' (Deuteronomy 4:40 NLT)  (2) Peace. 'Grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God…' (2 Peter 1:2 NAS) The more you know God, the more you'll be at peace. Sure, tough stuff happens, but facing that stuff with God makes a massive difference. (3) Wisdom. Paul prayed that God would give the Ephesians '…a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of Him.' (Ephesians 1:17 NAS) Wisdom is seeing things the right way. Revelation is when God opens your mind and shows you things you otherwise wouldn't know. (4) Freedom. '…when you did not know God, you were slaves...' (Galatians 4:8 NAS) Without the confidence that comes from knowing God, you become a slave to circumstances, emotions, or other people's opinions. Refuse to live that way. Instead, get to know God better.

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>We don't get what we deserve (2)</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'…I go to prepare a place for you.' John 14:2 NKJV</p>
Remember yesterday's reading? Go on then read it again, we're not going anywhere… Now you're back, we want to talk a bit more about the story in Matthew 20. So it's the end of a hot day and all the workers have been paid the same, including the ones who haven't been sweating in the sun all day. The workers who have been slogging away all day complain to the boss because they think the whole deal is just not fair. Here is what the Bible says: 'The owner answered one of them, 'Friend, I didn't cheat you. I paid you exactly what we agreed on. Take your money now and go! What business is it of yours if I want to pay them the same that I paid you? Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Why should you be jealous, if I want to be generous?'' (CEV) It's so easy for us to look at other people and focus on what they've got instead of what God has given us. There is always someone who seems to have got a better deal in life. Like the guy who looks like a film star, plays every instrument in the worship band and invented time travel for his high school Science project. People like that make it easy to not like and be disappointed with yourself! Know what will make your life easier and happier? Stop comparing and complaining. Focus on what you have got, like forgiveness, God's amazing plan for your life, a place in heaven. And that's just the beginning.

<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'…want to give the man who was hired last the same as I gave you...' Matthew 20:14 NIV</p>
Ever had casual employment? You probably didn't score the greatest job in the world, but while you were plucking dead chickens, stuffing envelopes or picking strawberries, you were undoubtedly looking forward to the end of the week when you will get your hard-earned cash! After all, it was just what you deserve. Jesus told the story of a bloke who hired some workers: some at 6am, some at 9am, some at midday, some at 3pm and some just an hour before quitting time. Amazingly, he paid them all the same wage! Nobody pays a day's wage for one hour's work. Except God. A last-minute convert receives the same grace as a lifetime servant. Have a quick look at Luke 23:40-42 and read about the thief on the cross next to Jesus. Did he deserve to be saved and promised heaven right at the end of his life? Well no. But if God gave us what we deserved, none of us would be saved. Grace means getting the life we don't deserve! The Prodigal Son wasted his possessions. But he returned. And when he did '...his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and...kissed him.' (Luke 15:20 NKJ) The Father loves to bless us, even when we don't deserve it.

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>The 'M' word</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'…a man shall…be joined to his wife…' Genesis 2:24 NKJ</p>
So it might still be a long way off, but don't pretend you don't spend time thinking about it! Getting hitched, finding 'The One', the 'M' word; marriage! A long time ago God said this about marriage: '…a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.' (Genesis 2:24 NKJ) This verse is read at almost every church wedding. The problem is, a lot of people standing up there at the front and taking those vows haven't really realised what they're promising. Marriage means that all your other relationships (except your relationship with God), now come after your relationship with your wife or husband. Marriage isn't about making space for someone else in your life; it's about re-building your life around them. Here's another thought. When you read the story of Adam and Eve in the book of Genesis, the point is that Eve was specially created because Adam really needed her; he couldn't do it on his own, he was incomplete. Think about this: unless you've found someone to whom you can say, 'I'm incomplete without you', you're probably not ready for marriage. Marriage is a huuuge decision, so don't rush into it through a fog of passion. Allow God to transform your heart into the kind of heart that can offer the sort of love that will help to make your partner whole.

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Chain reaction</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'Then it happened…' 2 Samuel 11:2 NKJ</p>
He was the Jack Bauer of the ancient world. David rocks Goliath, David goes on the run when the king decides he's a threat. It's a right royal thriller—after all, David gets to be king. But then things began to unravel when he let down his guard. The Bible says, 'Then it happened.' What a teaser! David was coasting into middle-age, getting soft, letting other people fight his battles while he stayed home. Maybe, as he was standing on the palace rooftop that night, he wondered, 'Do I still have it?' Then his eyes caught sight of a total babe: Bathsheba. But it's what he didn't see that ruined him. He didn't see that sleeping with her would eventually make him into a murderer. He didn't see that in the years ahead four of his children would die as a result. He didn't see that his action would eventually split his kingdom in half. That's the problem with sin: it always sets off a chain reaction. If you're doing things you shouldn't be doing, watch out! You're not seeing the whole picture. David tried all sorts of things to cover his tracks. They just made things worse and he still got caught! Sin always stirs up a whole load of future trouble that's impossible to see at the time. Seriously, sin is not worth it! Think again before you trigger a chain reaction like David did.

<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'Seek the Kingdom of God above all else...' Matt 6:33 NLT</p>
<p>Some people seem to have just one ambition in life: to get their own way all the time. And if anyone or anything gets in the way there's trouble. If there's any of that desire in you today, then here's a hard fact for you: get ready to self-destruct. It probably won't happen today or even tomorrow, but some time down the track, meltdown day will arrive. You see, it's impossible to gain true satisfaction in life outside of trusting, long-term relationships. And trusting long-term relationships are never one-sided: there are two people in every friendship, every partnership and every marriage. How can these relationships survive if one side always takes and never gives? How can they last if one side always expects to be satisfied but doesn't offer anything back? There's one sure-fire way to make certain that you don't fall into this trap: give your life to a cause bigger than yourself. Jesus especially loved talking about one subject—the Kingdom of Heaven, also called the Kingdom of God. It's not a kingdom like Britain with Queen Elizabeth or Jordan with King Abdullah. This isn't about geography; the Kingdom is breaking out all over the world! The Kingdom is anywhere that people lay down their own plans and give themselves to God's perfect plans. The Kingdom is life as God always meant it to be. How about putting the Kingdom first today?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>To be with you</p>
<p>'God with us' Matt 1:23 NKJ</p>
<p>We often think we're supposed to offer God our acts of service, which is true, but the gift God wants most is simply to be with us. Think about the disciple, Peter; he's such a great example; so totally human! Peter followed Jesus, learned from Him, praised Him and served Him; but he also doubted Him, misunderstood Him and denied Him. Luke records Jesus' last conversation with Peter. Jesus asked him a deeply personal question: 'Do you love Me?' (John 21:15 CEV) Three times He asked Peter. Three times! Peter didn't quite know what to make of it; he was sooo embarrassed. God created us so that He could be with us. Genesis describes to us how, before sin entered the world, God loved to come and walk with the man and woman He had made, just to be with them. Jesus Himself was also known by the name Immanuel, which means 'God with us'. (Isaiah 7:14, Matt 1:23) The Bible ends with a picture of the new heavens and new earth where God once again is right in the middle of His creation, close enough to '...wipe every tear from their eyes...' (Revelation 21:4 NIV) St Augustine summed it all up like this: 'Love God, and do what you will,' because when you truly love God you'll only want to do the things God loves. Today can you hear Him whispering, 'I'd like to spend some time with you.'?</p>

<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'…Your word is settled in heaven.' Psalm 119:89 NKJ</p>
<p>Ok, lots of Bible today as we look at our word vs God's Word! You say, 'It's impossible.' God says, 'What is impossible with men is possible with God.' (Luke 18:27 NIV) You say, 'I've had it.' He says, 'But those who wait on the Lord, shall renew their strength…' (Isaiah 40:31 NKJ) You say, 'Nobody loves me.' He says, 'I have loved you with an everlasting love…' (Jeremiah 31:3 NIV) You say, 'I've had enough.' He says, 'My grace is sufficient for you…' (2 Corinthians 12:9 NIV) You say, 'I don't know what to do.' He says, 'He shall direct your paths.' (Proverbs 3:6 NKJ) You say, 'I can't do it.' He says, 'I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.' (Philippians 4:13 NKJ) You say, 'It's not worth it.' He says, '…we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.' (Galatians 6:9 NIV) You say, 'I can't forgive myself.' He says, '…in Christ God forgave you.' (Ephesians 4:32 NIV) You say, 'I'm broke.' He says, '...God shall supply all your need…' (Philippians 4:19 NKJ) You say, 'I'm scared.' He says, '…God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power…' (2 Timothy 1:7 NKJ) You say, 'I can't handle this.' He says, 'Cast your cares on the Lord and He will sustain you…' (Psalms 55:22 NIV) You say, 'I'm stupid.' He says, '…if any of you needs wisdom, you should ask God for it…' (James 1:5 NCV) You say, 'I'm all alone.' He says, '…I will never leave you nor forsake you.' (Hebrews 13:5 NKJ)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>The great exchange</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'God made him…to be sin for us…' 2 Corinthians 5:21 NIV</p>
<p>Have you ever tried to keep the Ten Commandments? Really tried? Ok, so you probably haven't murdered anyone; but that still leaves nine more to go. What about the 'less serious' ones? 'You must not steal.' (Exodus 20:15 NLT) Have you ever stolen anything? No? Not even a paper clip? How many of your music downloads are legal? All of them? Then there's 'You must not tell lies.' (Exodus 20:16 CEV) You say you haven't? Yeah, right! The bad news is that on your very best day, you still fall far short of God's perfect standards. But there's good news too: '…He was pierced for our rebellion, crushed for our sins. He was beaten so we could be whole…' (Isaiah 53:5 NLT) A Chinese convert to Christianity understood this. Before her baptism the pastor questioned her to ensure she understood the meaning of the cross: 'Did Jesus have any sin?' 'Yes,' she replied. Troubled, he repeated the question. 'Yes, He had sin,' she answered again. The pastor set out to correct her, but she insisted, 'Yes! He had mine.' And she was right! This is the great exchange. At the cross, Jesus was taking your place. What was wrong, He made right. He made beauty out of mess. Aren't you glad?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>Look Out!</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'…God will help her at break of day.' Psalm 46:5 NIV</p>
<p>Life can be pretty unstable…you know those days when your world suddenly gets turned upside down? And then rolls over, only to go SPLAT? When it does, here are five things from Psalm 46 to look out for: (1) Look out for His supply. 'There is a river whose streams make glad…' (Psalm 46:4 NIV) In Old Testament symbolism, rivers represent the way God meets every need you have. When other sources of supply are drying up, don't fear, look for the river! (2) Look out for His presence. The Bible describes the '…city of God, the holy place where the Most High dwells.' (Psalm 46:4 NIV) God's city is a symbol of His presence, and where He is, then there's peace and order! (3) Look out for His newness. 'God will help [you] at break of day.' (Psalm 46:5 NIV) Daybreak is a symbol of new beginnings; this is to reassure you that problems don't last forever—beyond every time of trouble and testing is a new day. (4) Look out for His works. 'Come…see the works of the Lord…' (Psalm 46:8 NIV) Noticing afresh the amazing things God does every day, the small things as well as the big things, will build your faith muscles back up again. (5) Look out for His peace. Your life is built on the rock solid foundation of His faithfulness, so you can live by the Scripture, 'Be still, and know that I am God…' (Psalm 46:10 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>God planted a garden...there He put the man whom He had formed.</h2>
<span class=&quot;reference&quot;>Genesis 2:8 NKJV</span><br />It's pretty likely that gardening programmes aren't filling up your sky+ hard-drive so lets deal with the basics: what does it mean to plant? Technically it is 'To bury seeds beyond human view so that they germinate and eventually produce fruit.' (you did know that, right?) Now think of the Creator of the universe, as He stoops down and plants blessings and opportunities to grow in your life. Can't see the blessings or opportunities? If you walk out into a field (ok, you might not do that often but use your imagination) and don't see a crop, it doesn't mean the seeds aren't there; God has planted things in your life that will spring out of the mud at different times. Everything God has for you hasn't come up yet, so don't give up, or walk away and say, 'That's all there is'. There are talents in you that haven't been discovered and dreams that haven't been fulfilled. That's what the battle is about! The Devil is fighting you over your destiny. He knows good stuff is planted in you and he's trying to kill the seed. Don't let him. You're not the person you'll be six months or six years from now, because there's a time factor; everything doesn't come to harvest at the same time. You have to have faith and patience; otherwise you'll miss what God has for you.]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>The power of encouragement (2)</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'Pleasant words are…health to the bones.' Proverbs 16:24 NKJ</p>
<p>One day a principal called in three teachers and said, 'You three are the finest in the system, so we're giving you 90 high-IQ students to see what you can do with them.' At the end of the year the students achieved an amazing 30% more than the other students in the school. The principal called the three teachers in and said, 'I've a confession to make. You didn't have the most promising students: they were run-of-the-mill. We picked them at random.' The teachers naturally decided that their exceptional teaching skills must have been the reason for the students' fantastic results. 'I've another confession,' said the principal. 'You're not the finest teachers in the system; your names were the first three drawn out of the hat.' So why did those students and teachers perform at such a level? Because they were encouraged to believe they could! This idea of believing is right at the heart of what it means to be a Christian. See, your relationship with Jesus is a two-way street. It doesn't mean that you sing songs and say prayers to Him so that He doesn't get insecure about how great He is! He doesn't need to know it—you do! Nobody knows you like Jesus: He sees the amazing potential you have. He put it there before you were even born! He's constantly cheering you on with shouts of 'YES, YOU CAN!' So listen for His voice and believe it!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>The power of encouragement (1)</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>Pleasant words are…health to the bones.’ Proverbs 16:24 NKJ</p>
<p>Two huge box–office smash hits in the last few years have been the film versions of The Chronicles of Narnia and The Lord of the Rings. Did you know that the authors of the original books—CS Lewis and JRR Tolkien—were both professors at Oxford University and were really good friends? Every week they’d meet for lunch to chat about their writing projects. It was Tolkien who encouraged Lewis, a full–on atheist, to explore Christianity. The result? Lewis gave his life to Jesus! Later, he encouraged Tolkien to continue writing fiction and seek publication. If they hadn’t have kept cheering each other on through thick and thin, the world wouldn’t have some of the greatest stories ever written. Everybody needs to hear words of encouragement. The Bible says, ‘Pleasant words are like a honeycomb, sweetness to the soul and health to the bones.’ (Proverbs 16:24 NKJ) Everyone who receives encouragement, young or old, success or dropout, famous or unknown, is changed by it. Another famous author—Mark Twain—once said, ‘One compliment can keep me going for a whole month.’ A word of encouragement from a teacher can turn the course of a student’s life; a word of encouragement from a boss can inspire a worker to reach their potential; a word of encouragement from a friend can swing a decision from ‘giving in’ to ‘going for it’. So help someone go for it by being an encourager today! SoulFood: Is 49–52, Matt 12:1–14, Ps 107:33–43, Pr 3:27–28</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>The ‘D' Word</p>
<p class=&quot;reference&quot;>'...those whom the Lord loves He disciplines...' Hebrews 12:6 NAS</p>
<p>If there's a word that's seriously hard to swallow it's discipline. Sure, your great-granddad who fought in World War 2 probably takes three pills of discipline a day with his afternoon cup of tea, but didn't discipline pass its use-by date centuries ago? Well, maybe discipline is getting out of fashion but we're seriously mistaken if we think we can live without it. The Bible is full of examples of what happens to people when discipline is chucked out the window. Check out old Eli, Israel's High Priest: he had two sons who would've been right at home on some dodgy TV show. We simply read, ‘...He knew that his sons refused to respect Me, and he let them get away with it.' (1 Samuel 3:13 CEV) Perhaps Eli heard about the terrible things his sons were doing and said, ‘Now, boys, you know you shouldn't do that.' And the boys said, ‘Yes, Dad,' then went right back to ripping off the temple worshippers and playing around with the servant girls. They didn't have a bit of self-discipline between them and their dad was worse than useless at pulling them into line. Self-discipline-making the right choices minute by minute, hour by hour, takes time to develop fully. That's why we need people to remind us what self-control means. Seriously, if today you find a bit of tough love coming your way you need to welcome it, not reject it. <br />SoulFood: Is 45-48, Matt 11:20-30, Ps 107:23-32, Pr 3:25-26 <br /><br />{sharethis}</p>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<h2 class=&quot;subtitle&quot;>…MAKE THE KINGDOM OF GOD YOUR PRIMARY CONCERN.</h2>
<span class=&quot;reference&quot;>MATTHEW 6.33 NLT</span><br />Here’s some key personal qualities – a checklist for anyone who wants to do great things for God: a) gracious ‘“God blesses those who are merciful…” “Stop judging others, and you will not be judged”’ (Matthew 5:7; Matthew 7:1 NLT) b) restorer ‘When…your brother or sister has something against you…go and make peace with that person…’ (Matthew 5:23-24 NCV) c) teachable ‘Anyone who listens to my teaching and obeys me is wise…’ (Matthew 7:24 NLT) d) creative ‘…overflowing in many expressions of thanks to God’ (2 Corinthians 9:12 NIV) e) courageous ‘Look, I am sending you out as sheep among wolves…don’t be afraid…’ (Matthew 10:16&amp;amp;26 NLT) f) willing ‘Anyone who does the will of my Father in heaven is My brother and sister...’ (Matthew 12:50 NLT) g) surrendered ‘If any of you wants to be My follower, you must put aside your selfish ambition, shoulder your cross, and follow Me’ (Matthew 16:24 NLT) h) repentant ‘…unless you turn from your sins and become as little children, you will never get into the Kingdom of Heaven’ (Matthew 18:3 NLT) i) humble ‘But those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted’ (Matthew 23:12 NLT) j) servant ‘But among you it should be quite different. Whoever wants to be a leader among you must be your servant’ (Matthew 20:26 NLT). If you’re willing to make Jesus Lord of your life, make His Word the last word on all issues, and seek the fullness of His Spirit – you can live this lifestyle too!]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Your Word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.' Psalm 119:105 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Anyone who's been camping knows the feeling: you wake up in the middle of the night desperate for the loo. You lie in your tent and try to ignore the feeling but as time ticks by, you have to get up. Grumbling, you rummage for your trusty torch and start to trek across the site. It's pitch black, but as you flick the switch on your torch, a beam lights up the ground in front of you. Listen: 'Your Word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.' The Bible is the Word of God in printed form. When you open it up and read it, like that torch, you flick the light on in your life. It can answer a problem, give direction for your life and help you get to know God better. It's your trusty God-torch! He gives you His Word and Spirit to help you stick to the right path and go in the right direction. </p>
<p>The Bible uses the example of darkness and light over and over again to describe the difference between people who have found God (or been found by Him-depending on how you look at it) and those who haven't. The Apostle Paul said to his mates in Corinth: '...God, who said, &quot;Let light shine out of darkness,&quot; made His light shine in our hearts...' (2 Corinthians 4:6 NIV) Maybe today you could pray for your friends who have not yet had their lives brightened by God, that they would suddenly see what it's all about.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death...' Psalm 23:4 NKJ<br /><br /><p>A bit of a morbid thought, but imagine the doc tells you that you've just 24 hours to live. What do you do?</p>
<p>Do you pick a playlist of tracks to accompany your coffin down the aisle? Do you get a second opinion from another doc? Do you update Facebook telling everyone you love them and you'll miss them? </p>
<p>The last thing you'd want to do is look forward to the day of death, right? But bizarrely enough, a Christian can look forward to death. We don't have to be scared even though we will all 'walk through the valley of the shadow of death'. Why? Because death is not the end; it's only the beginning. </p>
<p>What we believe is this: '...since we died with Christ, we know we will also share His new life. We are sure of this because Christ rose from the dead, and He will never die again. Death no longer has any power over Him.' (Romans 6:8-9 NLT)</p>
<p>If the shadow of death seems ghostly dark, please know that you won't be alone for the journey. Jesus will take your hand and lead you home.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies...' Psalm 23:5 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Although we tend to forget it, there's more to dinner than grub. It's about sharing hearts and lives.</p>
<p>John 21 sees Jesus and Peter having a celestial perfect-party moment. Our Pete should be the last person at Jesus' dinner soire; after all, he has just let Jesus down three times in public. However, Jesus has some serious mending to do. Rather than snubbing His mate, our Saviour sets up a beach barbecue, gets a fire burning, and starts grilling some fish. </p>
<p>There's more going on here than a disciple getting a fish-finger to stop his tummy rumbling. This is about Jesus giving Peter what he most needs-to be fed, to be healed, to be restored and reinstated. Have you slipped up badly? Jesus invites you to come dine with Him; to be fed by His Word; to be healed by His touch; to be restored by His forgiveness. </p>
<p>Now, what about those of us who think we're safe from falling? Peter had said the same, right up until a rooster crowed. The devil is a rabid dog chained up. He can't sink his teeth in unless we enter his circle: 'Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.' (James 4:7 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['You anoint my head with oil...' Psalm 23:5 NKJ<br /><br /><p>In David's day, good shepherds used a little oil on their sheep. What the?, I hear you ask.</p>
<p>First, the oil would repel creepy crawlies-necessary because if bugs threw a party in a sheep's nose, the poor animal would be driven insane; the ewes would be too troubled to give baby lambs their milk; and before long the whole flock would be in a mess. The good shepherd anoints the sheep to keep the enemy at bay and the flock at peace. </p>
<p>Second, the oil works wonders on wounds. In the hustle and bustle of living with sheep, nicks and nips are common, resulting in cuts that can turn infectious unless treated. These lessons in ancient farming can teach us why we need to go to the Good Shepherd for His anointing. </p>
<p>Life's little bugs can get us in a mess, stopping us from growing. Jesus is the oil of peace for such times. Living with the flock (other Christians) can sometimes result in wounds. The oil of healing is found in Jesus. So, before you try anything or anybody else, always go to the Good Shepherd: 'He heals the broken-hearted and binds up their wounds.' (Psalm 147:3 NIV) </p>
<p>Remember, the sheep must bow their heads in order to let the shepherd apply the oil. So must you. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...My cup runs over.' Psalm 23:5 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Do you know a Mr or Mrs Outstay-Your-Welcome? You try dropping hints like yawning or looking at your watch or propping your eyes open with toothpicks but they just don't pick up the hint that it's time to go. </p>
<p>In Old Testament times they had a special signal: if you kept filling up your guest's glass it meant they were welcome. But if you let the glass sit empty it meant 'go and drink at home'. When David wrote 'my cup overflows' he was saying that God had all the time in the world for His guest-and all the blessings in Heaven for him. If your host is filling your cup until it's pouring over the side and spilling out onto the table, your friend is seriously enjoying your company. </p>
<p>Ok, on your worst days you may feel like your cup has nothing but the dregs of life in it. But if you stop and think about it, your cup is brimming over with goodness. Take grace, for example: 'The more we see our sinfulness, the more we see God's abounding grace forgiving us.' (Romans 5:20 TLB) God doesn't let our sin swallow us whole; He covers it with the blood of Jesus and daily gives us a clean slate. Our cup of mercy overflows. Whether you see yourself as 'glass half-full' or 'glass half-empty' today, the reality is your glass is overflowing. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life.' Psalm 23:6 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Let's cut today's verse into bite-size chunks: </p>
<p>'<i>Surely goodness and mercy</i>.' Life is an unsure thing. Just when you think everything is perfect, it has a funny habit of falling apart on you. Not so with God. Characterised by His goodness and mercy, God is life's only sure thing. 'He satisfies me with good things and makes me young again...' (Psalm 103:5 NCV) We may run hot and cold with God. He, however, is always hot on us: 'If we are unfaithful, He remains faithful...' (2 Timothy 2:13 NLT) Note: David doesn't say, 'Sometimes God has goodness and mercy... after all He is only human.' Nope. This verse says 'surely'-it's a dead cert; we can bank on God's goodness. </p>
<p>'<i>Shall follow me</i>.' That word 'follow' gives a picture of God's goodness tagging along wherever we go. If only folks knew-they'd be queuing up to add you as a friend; after all if you're leaving a trail of goodness, that means they get to enjoy it too.</p>
<p>'All the days of my life.' Think of the days ahead and what do you see? Hooking up with a beautiful and godly babe? Jet-setting career? Getting alongside the helpless and hopeless? Whatever you're chasing, know that: '...because of Christ, we have received an inheritance from God, for He chose us from the beginning, and all things happen just as He decided long ago.' (Ephesians 1:11 NLT) Live all your days in thankfulness to God's goodness and mercy. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.' Psalm 23:6 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Normally when someone describes you 'not of this planet' they either mean you're 'away with the fairies' or facially you resemble 'life on Mars'. </p>
<p>As a Christian, though, it's a compliment. The Bible gives us an impression that earth is not home-it's like we're aliens on another planet. David wrote, 'I am but a foreigner here on earth...' (Psalm 119:19 NLT) Peter writes, 'If you call God your Father, live your time as temporary residents on earth...' (1 Peter. 1:17 GWT) He goes on to say, 'Dear friends, since you are foreigners and temporary residents [in the world], I'm encouraging you to keep away from the desires of your corrupt nature.' (1 Peter 2:11 GWT) </p>
<p>Are we really green-faced, three-eyed beings with antennae for ears, or is Peter getting at something else? Look at today's verse: 'I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever', or in other words, Heaven is your home. So make Heaven your destination. Don't make life an amusement park for your own benefit-you're living and breathing for more than just being entertained, amused and catered to. </p>
<p>Forget the pursuit of happiness; get the pursuit of godliness. 'Lord, remind me how brief my time on earth will be. Remind me that my days are numbered-how fleeting my life is.' (Psalm 39:4 NLT) Live like a citizen of Heaven, an alien to this world. For: 'We are Christ's ambassadors.' (2 Corinthians 5:20 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...you should follow His steps.' 1 Peter 2:21 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Whether you're tottering about in high heels or springing off the pavement in cushioned running shoes, one thing's for sureyou're not walking alone. God is striding with you. Maybe you're not ready to acknowledge that yet; maybe you still believe you're in charge; maybe this is why you can't see Himbecause you prefer it that way. But the reality is a 'Higher Power' is right alongside you. Are you going to ignore Him, fight against Him or walk with Him?</p>
<p>Peter suggests ditching our sneakers in favour of an old pair of Jesus sandals. When you wear Jesus sandals your feet will be carried through dark and dingy places; your steps will run through the halls of fame but stop at the feet of the needy and poor. Keeping in step with Jesus means keeping your eye open for opportunities to be a blessing; it means cupping your ear to hear what God is saying; it means giving up <i>your</i> agenda in order to get God's agenda.</p>
<p>Putting on Jesus sandals also means knowing when to stride and when to stop. In the storm on the Sea of Galilee the disciples sweated but Jesus slept. In the garden of Gethsemane the disciples slept but Jesus sweated. That's because He knew when to work and when to rest. Walking with God shows you when to act and when to wait in trust.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...you should follow His steps.' 1 Peter 2:21 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Footy crowds spilling out of a stadium are classic for thissweeping you up in one direction, so it's almost impossible to go against the flow. But walking against the tide of the crowd is often where our Jesus sandals take us.</p>
<p>While crowds of people are busy treating life like an X Factor auditionshowing off, elbowing their way to the top, desperately trying to get the approval of othersJesus' way is opposed to that kind of stageschool living.</p>
<p>When the motormouths of Good Friday shouted, '...If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross' (Matthew 27:40 NKJ), Jesus didn't throw down His heavenly birth certificate in some desperate attempt to prove Himself. He remained nailed to the cross, refusing to let their comments alter His plan. He didn't need their approvalHe already had His Father's: 'This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.' (Matthew 3:17 KJV)</p>
<p>Jesus responded to hunger, to need, to Godseekers, but He never responded to critics. So when your motormouths start piling on the pressure to walk their way, walk the Jesus way instead. You've already got the only approval you'll ever needGod's. 'God decided in advance to adopt us into His own family by bringing us to Himself through Jesus Christ. This is what He wanted to do, and it gave Him great pleasure.' (Ephesians 1:5 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Honour your father and mother.' Exodus 20:12 NLT<br /><br /><p>Yes, yes, yesparents can be oldfashioned, outdated, prehistoric dinosaurs and all of that. Dad might have been born wearing sandals with socks. Mum, possibly, stepped out of the womb with a dishcloth in hand, complaining about the state of the kitchen. But here's the thing: we're told to respect them.</p>
<p>The Bible doesn't  say you have a right to demand a weekly allowance, nor does the book of Exodus say, 'Honour thy father as a free taxi service.' But Scripture does take respecting them pretty seriously (even if you disagree with them). Sure, there'll be times when you want to tell them: 'You're fired!' But do you have any idea what a tough job they're doing? </p>
<p>Think about it: Mums know all about dental appointments and football matches after school; they make the meals that barely touch the sides of your mouth; they remove the gravy stains from your school uniform, they deodour your underwear (and let's face it, guysthat alone deserves some sort of medal for bravery).</p>
<p>And then there's Dads...most of them do an awesome job too! Today, how about taking the initiative for a change? Respect your folks by doing something for them without expecting anything back.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['You will keep him in perfect peace...' Isaiah 26:3 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Selwyn Hughes once opened a prayer with this: 'O God, what a fool I am to live with a grudge when I can live with grace. If there are any grudges in my heart then I ask you to uproot them now.' He's right. It's foolish to get all tied up in knots when we could live in perfect peace.</p>
<p>Sometimes we can hold a grudge against people. Certain people have an amazing talent for rubbing others up the wrong way. What they say, what they do, how they do itmakes you want to tear your hair out! Well, the choice is yours: either hold on to that bitter feeling and get all twisted up in knots or allow God to deal with them and be released into peace.</p>
<p>Sometimes we can even hold a grudge against God. Maybe we've waited years for God to move on something in our lives but here we arestill emptyhanded. Having a galaxysized chip on your shoulder won't force God's hand. The Almighty sees past our emotional blackmail techniques.</p>
<p>Ecclesiastes 3:1 NIV says, 'There is a time for everything.' God will come good on His promiseat the right time. Meanwhile, you can sulk with a turneddown bottom lip, or wait, trust and praise in perfect peace. Bottom line: fix your thoughts on God and peace will follow.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...the Lord has kept me alive...' Joshua 14:10 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Ah, living the dream: guessing six random numbers on a jackpot week, and trading that winning lottery ticket for a surfboard in Bali forever. Reality check: this side of eternity, we can forget kicking backwe're supposed to push forwards. There are no early retirement plans where God's concerned. Our time on earth is shortevery second counts. Our top priority now must be seeing God's justice rule.</p>
<p>How can we even dream of the high life when millions are still trapped in the low life? Caleb had the right idea. When he was 85, instead of booking his place in the old folks home, he said, 'The Lord has kept me alive...just as my strength was then, so now is my strength for war... give me this mountain of which the Lord spoke in that day... And Joshua blessed him, and gave Hebron to Caleb...because he wholly followed the Lord...' (Joshua 14:10-14 NKJ)</p>
<p>There was no spending all day every day at the bowls or golf club for Caleb. He was full of fighting talk till his last breath. When God shows you something worth fighting for, it'll rattle your bones and boil your blood till the day you step into Heaven.</p>
<p>Do you want to hear God's pension plan for you? 'Learn to do good. Seek justice. Help the oppressed. Defend the cause of the orphans. Fight for the rights of widows.' (Isaiah 1:17 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['My servant Caleb...has a different spirit in him...' Numbers 14:24 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Faith is like taking risks without the risk involved. Sound a bit backwards? Not in Numbers 13. The story goes that God has promised the Jews a home of their own. The only problem is they had to evict the current tenants. So Moses sends 12 spies to assess the situation. Ten come back, tails between their legs, with a report to abort the mission. Two come back, well up for the riskCaleb and Joshua.</p>
<p>Haven't all 12 seen the same thing? Apparently not. The ten party poopers only see risk. They see the odds stacked against them. They see a hopeless situation. The two see riskbut without the risk. They're full of faith that God has promised them this home. Sure, they know in human terms their chances are slim but, on God's terms, the risk is eliminated. God hasn't brought them through 40 years in the desert to show them 'what they could've won'. He's presenting them with the Promised Land, if they're willing to go for it.</p>
<p>Notice how this story spells out that the majority are not always in the right. If you're up for a Calebstyle riskriding life, don't expect others to back you up. In all probability you'll be in the minority. Fortunately, God has a special relationship with the minority. He obliterates the risk from their risktaking. Just ask Caleb.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...earnest prayer...produces wonderful results.' James 5:16 NLT<br /><br /><p>Alright, so we may have enough faith to believe that if we pray for healing from a headache, God might dull the pain. Or that if we pray for sunshine at a friend's wedding, God might hold off the grey clouds for an hour. But what about the big stuff? Could praying for our Prime Minister actually change the way the country is run? Could praying for a terrorist on the news see him lay down his weapons? Has anyone got that kind of faith?</p>
<p>God never patronises His children. He'll never tell you to grow up and stop believing for the impossible. Proverbs 21:1 NIV says, 'The king's heart is in the hand of the Lord; He directs it...wherever He pleases.' In other words, there's nobody too high and mighty for the Lord to straighten out.</p>
<p>Genesis 20 tells how Abraham's missus was taken off to the palace by the king. Can you imagine Sarah's prayers as she desperately tried to pray her way out of that one? She would've prayed that God would interfere in the life of the most powerful man in the landher captor, the king. Does God answer, 'Behave, woman, I couldn't possibly mess about with a king?' No, He visits the king in a dream hinting, 'Hands off Sarahor you're gone, mate.'</p>
<p>Moral of the story: <i>Your prayer carries weight with God</i>.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be kindly affectionate to one another...' Romans 12:10 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Loving people would be a whole lot easier if they weren't so unlovable, right? Like you buy a chocolate bar from the guy at work fundraising to send his kids to camp and he looks at you like dog droppings as you wait for your change. Or you give your kid sister a pair of earrings and she asks if you've kept the receipt. Or you invite your mates to church and they can't even be bothered to let you know they aren't coming. Why can't people just be thankful, grateful and courteous?</p>
<p>Actually, love tells the guy at work he can keep the change. Love doesn't get easily angered if your kid sister is being a bit selfcentred. And love doesn't force people to believe in things they're not ready for. Love gives without asking anything in return.</p>
<p>Mother Teresa said: 'A day lived without doing something good for others is a day not worth living.' Loving people must be a way of life, a fixed attitude, a commitment we make every day, without expecting anything in return. People flocked to Jesus, not because of His theological essays or clever arguments, but because of His genuine love. He didn't heal the sick because of His job description, He did it out of love. He didn't die on a cross to give you something to hang on a necklace; He died out of love. Are you getting it yet? Loving God means loving, fullstop.</p>

<p>Mon May 9</p>
<p><b>Judge not</b></p>
<p>'Who dares accuse us whom God has chosen?' Romans 8:33 NLT</p>
<p>When you tear someone down, you're on thin ice with God. The Bible says: 'Who dares accuse us whom God has chosen for His own? Will God? No! He is the one who has given us right standing with Himself... Will Christ Jesus? No, for He is the one who died for us and was raised to life for us and is sitting...next to God, pleading for us.' (Romans 8:3334 NLT)</p>
<p>Christians are not perfect, but God says they 'belong to His dear Son.' (Ephesians 1:6 NLT) There's nothing you can slag them for that God doesn't already know. So don't go treading the rumour mill because, when you do, you're insulting the God who made them. You're implying that God has cut off more than He can chew when it comes to changing this person. It's not your job to judge where others are at. Jesus tells us plainly, that if we judge others, God will boomerang it back on us.</p>
<p>So what happens when somebody oversteps the mark? Are we to keep it zipped? Well, we're not to post it on Facebook, nor are we to rub their faces in it. Out of love and concern for the person we can try and get alongside them to support and help. Human nature enjoys seeing someone fall flat on their face; 'God nature' enjoys helping them back up.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...death, where is your sting?  ...where is your victory?' 1 Corinthians 15:55 NIV<br /><br /><p>There are at least 100 people banking on life after death. They're all members of the Alcor Life Extension Foundation and their bodies are frozen in liquid nitrogen. They're waiting for science to solve the problem of death. One Alcor member said he plans to try it because, 'I like living and I don't want to die.' Unfortunately for him, even the company president says, 'We don't even know if it will work.' </p>
<p>Good news!  It doesn't matter! Jesus has already overcome death! He rose from the grave with a glorious new body-and all who put their trust in Him will do the same!  Christ, and Christ alone, is the only sure thing when it comes to eternal life. Listen: 'Christians who have died will be raised with transformed bodies... then we who are living will be transformed so that we will never die. For our perishable earthly bodies must be transformed into heavenly bodies... O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting?' (1 Corinthians 15:52-55 NLT)</p>
<p>There's no record of Jesus ever preaching a funeral sermon. Know why? Because He's 'the resurrection and the life.' (John 11:25 NKJ) He broke up every funeral He ever attended! Death couldn't exist where He was. When the dead heard His voice they sprang to life! And they will again! </p>
<p>So happy Easter!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I could ask my Father for thousands of angels...and He would send them.' Matthew 26:53 TLB<br /><br /><p>It's bizarre how the <i>cross</i> has become a fashion accessory! After all, nobody would wear an electric chair ring, or a hangman's noose earrings! But even though a lot of people have forgotten what the cross means that doesn't mean it's lost its power. There will always be something uniquely special about the cross. And what better way to remember how much Jesus loves us. Beyond all the blood and the nails there is a simple shape, a horizontal beam showing how wide His love is, and a vertical beam showing how high and how deep His love is. John's gospel says, 'God loved the world so much that He gave His one and only Son so that whoever believes in Him may not be lost, but have eternal life.' (John 3:16 NCV) It doesn't say God loved only the famous or the fabulous or then we'd all be in trouble.  No, you live in 'the world' so you're included by God!</p>
<p>Jesus didn't have to die, He chose to! He told His captors, 'I could ask My Father for thousands of angels...and He would send them instantly...' As Max Lucado says, 'The force behind the hammer wasn't an angry mob...the hand squeezing the handle wasn't a Roman infantryman...the verdict...wasn't decided by jealous Jews. Jesus Himself chose the nails...' That's how much He loves you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Live joyfully with the wife whom you love...' Ecclesiastes 9:9 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Ok, so you may not be married quite yet-may not even be thinking about it-but one day you might. But before we get there, God can still teach us something for today from this verse: 'Live joyfully with the wife whom you love...' Wow, get that! God doesn't just want us to enjoy good relationships, He wants us to have relationships we can relish-where we're totally loving every minute. God really does want you to have great friends and build great relationships, the kind that make you smile and make your life easier to handle! </p>
<p>So if your life is a little low on the friendship front today, pray. Ask God for some great Godly relationships, knowing that's exactly what He wants for you too. Ask Him for help in finding the right friends and choosing the ones that will build you up, not drag you down. God promises: 'I will guide you along the best pathway for your life. I will advise you and watch over you.' (Psalm 32:8 NLT)</p>
<p>And while you're at it, if you're hoping one day to be married, why not start praying now for the your future husband or wife. Talk to God about it, knowing He cares about this too. Ask Him to help you now to grow into the best wife or husband you can be so you will be ready to 'Live joyfully with the [one] you love...' </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Live joyfully with the wife whom you love...' Ecclesiastes 9:9 NKJ<br /><br /><p>After God put the first man, Adam, in the Garden of Eden, He said; 'It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a companion who will help him.' (Genesis 2:18 NLT) God chose to give Adam someone who would be compatible with his needs-we know her as Eve. This was a brilliant relationship-the way God intended them to be. They got on great with God, they walked with Him and chatted to Him every day; they had a great place to live, things to do and enjoy, scrumptious food; and they loved each other. There was no arguing-it was mint!</p>
<p>But things went horribly wrong after they disobeyed God. Instead of doing what God said, 'You are free to eat from any tree in the garden, but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil...' (Genesis 2:16 NIV), they chose to believe the snake, 'You will not...die... You will be like God...' (Genesis 3:4 NIV) As a result of leaving God out of their relationship-everything went to pot. 'So the Lord God banished them from the Garden of Eden to work the ground...' (Genesis 3:23 NIV)</p>
<p>The same is true for us today. When we leave God out of our relationships, they become difficult and confusing and we end up hurting each other. Don't make the same mistake as Adam and Eve; remember God wants you to include Him in everything.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Shamgar...killed six hundred...Philistines with an ox goad.' Judges 3:31 NKJ<br /><br /><p>Sometimes we can feel small and insignificant, like our life doesn't matter or we're not important. We can think that what we have and what we can do is never good enough. But get this: God is in the business of taking small things and turning them into something amazing. He created the earth out of nothing: 'In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth... the earth was formless and empty.' (Genesis 1:1-2 NIV) Empty-now it doesn't get much smaller than that!</p>
<p>Think about what Jesus did with that boy's packed lunch in John 6: all that kid had was a few fish and bread rolls but he gave them to Jesus and Jesus turned it into a massive feast for over 5000 people-with doggy bags to take away! </p>
<p>In Judges 3 you'll discover that 'Shamgar...killed six hundred...Philistines with an ox goad'. Shamgar was a guy armed with an ox goad -just a long wooden stick with a metal tip used to prod oxen. It wasn't much. His odds weren't good: 600 to 1 at best. But thanks to God, he beat the odds, saved his field, and helped the people of Israel start trusting God again.</p>
<p>God is in the business of using little things. So never think you are small and insignificant. Give all you are and all you have to God and know He will do something massively good. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He will purify...and refine them like gold...' Malachi 3:3 NIV<br /><br /><p>If we're not careful and prayerful it's all too easy to wander off to Dead-end Street. King David was described as a man 'after God's own heart'-his dare-devil faith saw him do immense things with God. Yet even someone as clued up in God's ways as David wasn't safe from mooching off the path. </p>
<p>David wrote, 'Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me,' (Psalm 51:10 NKJ) as he reflected how far he'd meandered off-track. He'd committed adultery, tried to gloss over it, and had an innocent man's blood on his hands. All this because David thought he could have what he wanted no strings attached. So he prayed for a clean heart because he was clogged with sin; the dross had congested his hotline to God. </p>
<p>In order to purify David's heart, God took him through the refining process. When gold is about to be refined over extreme heat, copper and silver must be separated first. These are less precious metals that blend with the raw gold ore. There's an important lesson here. Most of us are unable to separate the good from the best, so Malachi writes, 'He will purify...and refine them like gold.' Do you need purifying? Get away with God and allow Him to filter out all your wrong thoughts, actions and attitudes.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Honour the Lord...with the best part of everything...' Proverbs 3:9 NLT<br /><br /><p>True, money is a passport to your life, as it can get you into pleasure island; but equally, money is a passport to other people's lives, as your cash can be the difference between life and death (seriously, your spare cents can be a lifeline to children living in poverty around the world). So, isn't it about time we started to manage the money? With God's help and some common-sense suggestions you can start making your cents work for good. </p>
<p>First, compare the market. If you spend $29.95 on a CD from a record shop that you could've bought for $19.95 at a supermarket, that's ten bucks in the record shop's pocket, that could've gone to the Salvos or an aid organisation to help rescue a child from a desperate situation. Second, you have the spending power. Top brands use clever marketing to suggest to you that your life would be so much better with their shoes or their jeans. The bottom line is they're not interested in how good you look; they just want your cash. Take back the power: ask yourself, 'Do I really need this...or could I put my money to better use elsewhere?' </p>
<p>Third, tomorrow never comes. Don't think: 'I'll start giving money once I've got a good job or once I can afford it'. Get into the habit now. If you're generous with a little; God will trust you to be generous with a lot. Give God your first and best. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Honour the Lord...with the best part of everything...' Proverbs 3:9 NLT<br /><br /><p>Following on from yesterday's look at managing money for good, today we're going to look at how to make money. Ok, so you're somewhere between selling the 'perfume' you attempted to make from rose petals aged five, and getting a full-time job-the point is you're never too young to be entrepreneurial for God. </p>
<p>Remember how Jesus praised the poor old widow for giving all she had, even though it was only spare change? Well guess what? Even though you might not own a flash department store, any bit of spare change is welcome in God's economy. Some ideas:</p>
<p>(1) A carwash service: There may be people you know whose lives are too hectic and busy to take care of their car. Explain that you want to raise money for a disaster relief fund and offer a car shampoo and wax service. (2) A dog walking service: If you're not scared of the four-legged gnashers, how about giving some tired mongrel owner a break by offering to take their pet walkies? Any hard cash could be sent straight to your church's mission pot. Or (3) A painting service: Don the overalls and busy your brushstrokes over the church fence. All for a worthwhile fee, of course. </p>
<p>Be creative with your ideas and remember don't place yourself in situations of unnecessary risk and always tell your parent or guardian what you're doing first. But forget about your personal gain-make money for mission your main motive.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['God...is the...controller of all things.' 1 Timothy 6:15 PHPS<br /><br /><p>We all get that fluttery feeling in our stomachs-it might be confirmation that last night's turkey twizzlers did actually need a further ten minutes in the oven or it might mean you're suffering with a bad case of worry. So how do you stop that seasick sensation? First, always ensure your food is piping hot. Second, get a grip on your anxiety. </p>
<p>Scribble down your problem on paper. What exactly are you worrying about? Be specific. Then put your brain in gear. Write down alternative solutions to your problem. Weigh each solution up-ask yourself 'What've I got to lose?' and 'What've I got to gain?' Face up to your fear. Now you have it on paper, face each possible outcome and prepare yourself what it would mean if the worst did happen. </p>
<p>Commit yourself to improving the situation. Is there something you could do, practically, that would help ensure the best possible outcome? Most importantly give it over to God. Pray for wisdom. Bend your ear to what He's saying through the Word. After all, He is 'the...controller of all things'. Shape your problems into praises and watch your problem perspective-shift. '...if any of you needs wisdom, you should ask God for it. He is generous and enjoys giving to all people, so He will give you wisdom. But...you must...not doubt.' (James 1:5-6 NCV)</p>
