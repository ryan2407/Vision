<introtext><![CDATA['When I heard these words I sat down and wept...' Nehemiah 1:4 NRS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;{mp3remote}http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150812.mp3{/mp3remote}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t feel like you’ve ever heard God’s clear–cut call for you? When you get an unshakeable sense of ‘I want to see change’ deep inside, you’re on to something. You might not feel like that about a particular issue right now but keep praying and you will. Let’s see what Nehemiah did when he heard God call him. The call to Nehemiah began with terrible news. God’s people were suffering and His holy city was destroyed. Nehemiah’s response was to sit down and weep. Bawl his eyes out. This is instinctive, natural and right. We talk a lot about being joyful in Church, but the Bible is also full of people weeping in response to the suffering they see. Their tears reflect God’s pain. When we see suffering, it *should* hurt us when we know it goes against the grain of God’s will for the world. And, before Nehemiah could even respond in sorrow, he had to hear the news. In the same way, we have to hear before we can respond. And to hear, we have to listen. We have to open our ears and hearts to news of places and people in need. We have to allow ourselves to be stirred, to feel discomfort. But, crucially, we’ve then got to follow it with action. Compassion is not just a feeling, it’s a response. Pick a situation around you or a story in the news you think needs to change, and take it to God and ask Him how and when you should get involved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Chr 16-18, Mark 5:21-30, Ps 119:49-56, Prov 21:4-6 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=67728&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['If it pleases the King... I ask...' Nehemiah 2:5 NRS &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;{mp3remote}http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150813.mp3{/mp3remote}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bring back to mind the situation or person you spent time thinking about yesterday. Time to work out how to respond. Nehemiah’s got this next step down. He asked for help, and not just from anyone. He went to the highest human authority available—the king. He felt no shame about appealing on behalf of his people to someone with some downright intimidating cred. Got a person or place on your heart? Don’t be ashamed to ask for help—or be too proud to ask those with power to help you. Some (in fact, most) tasks in God’s Kingdom will need more than a one–man band approach. Nehemiah knew he was doing the work of God, but he also knew that there were power structures in place that he had to work with to bring about Godly change. What’s more, the king he approached wasn’t a follower of God. The connections God will give you when you say ‘yes’ to His plan might not be ones you expect. Be open to His surprises. When God makes a way, He makes a way. So then, back to that situation or person you thought of yesterday. Who could you go to for help as you let God work in you? Is there someone in authority—a boss, a relative, a politician—you could ask? What support could they offer you? Are you brave enough to get on it? Share your concern for this place or person with at least one authority figure this week, and ask them for advice and support. You might be surprised by what they can do, and what support they offer you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Chr 19:1-23:20, Mark 5:31-43, Ps 119:57-64, Prov 21:7-9 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=67729&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...They replied, &quot;Let us start rebuilding.&quot; So they began this good work.' Nehemiah 2:18 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;{mp3remote}http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150814.mp3{/mp3remote}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, we looked at sharing our call with others. After that, the best advice any of us will hear is simply: ‘make a start’. Taking the plunge is what stops your call from just being a dead–end. So why don’t we? We tell ourselves we don’t have the right things in place. Like: (1) ‘I’m not qualified’? Well, Kingdom work usually involves called (*not* qualified) people doing things they never dreamt of. (2) ‘People aren’t agreeing with me’? We’ll get into this tomorrow, but for now, know this: God’s people always get flak. David’s own brother took pot–shots at him before the Goliath fight, even calling him ‘evil’ (1 Samuel 17:28). (3) And what about ‘the timing isn’t right just yet’? Ecclesiastes 11:4 NIV says: ‘&lt;em&gt;Whoever watches the wind will not plant; whoever looks at the clouds will not reap&lt;/em&gt;.’ If you’re looking for a sign that the time is right, you might end up missing it. Whatever you need, don’t be afraid to ask. Nehemiah went for it—he shared his plan with some friends, got them to commit, and then they began. In fact, the whole of chapter 3 is just a list of the different people who helped Nehemiah in different ways. He was humble enough to ask for help, and bold enough to confidently share his plan, knowing that it was worthwhile. Can you support a Christian group who are facing seriously difficult opposition and spreading the Gospel anyway? Prayer is a significant need. Consider an organisation like opendoors.org.au &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Chr 23:21-26:19, Mark 6:1-13, Ps 119:65-72, Prov 21:10-13 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=67730&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Lord, let Your ear be attentive to the prayer of this Your servant...' Nehemiah 1:11 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;{mp3remote}http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150815.mp3{/mp3remote}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you have a clear–cut plan for the future or not, it’s always best to bring whatever we have to God in prayer. Often we’ve got a–million–and–one possible ideas for the future: excitement, back–up plans, ‘when I’ve got enough money’ plans... If that’s the boat you’re in, God will help you to narrow down the options, if you reciprocate that attentive ear thing (check out today’s verse), and listen right back to Him. Or perhaps, like a lot of us, you’re the opposite. The ‘what are you doing next year?’ question is one that haunts a lot of us, mostly because we’re pretty bad at getting hold of ideas for the futures. Wherever we find ourselves, it’s likely we’ll all benefit from a reminder: ‘…&lt;em&gt;along unfamiliar paths I will guide them; I will turn the darkness into light be-fore them and make the rough places smooth. These are the things I will do; I will not forsake them&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Isaiah 42:16 NIV) Whether the ‘darkness’ is the sea of choices you feel you have to wade through, or a sense of blankness about the future, God will be there. We’ll be taking a last look at Nehemiah’s wall–building capers tomorrow, but for now, remember how much prayer he put in before he went along with God’s plan. Be encouraged: it’s not an overnight process. Just bring what you have before Him, and leave the ball in His court. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Chr 26:20-29:30, Mark 6:14-29, Ps 119:73-80, Prov 21:14-16 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=67731&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Those who carried materials did their work with one hand and held a weapon in the other.' Nehemiah 4:17 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;{mp3remote}http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150816.mp3{/mp3remote}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, Nehemiah took on God’s mission to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem. Good on him. Couldn’t be much better and easier, right? Hmmm. Actually, he faced pretty tough opposition: heavy criticism and even threats to his life. The reality is, when we follow out a call God has for our lives (no matter how big or small), there may be opposition. You could find that you’ll be struggling to carry out that call. Opposition is exactly what Nehemiah’s workers were ready for; they were building with a sword in one hand and a trowel in the other. When you’ve got a deep sense of God’s approval and conviction for a call, it’s important to get yourself grounded in it. Keeping a journal of the times you’ve prayed, and the ways you’ve found God responds, is a good way of doing this (hey, if you haven’t got a journal, maybe it’s time to splash out on one?), as well as listing some helpful Bible verses. Then, when you find yourself facing opposition, maybe even from your own doubts, those words will become your Ephesians 6:17 style defence. Let’s take the whole ‘following God’s call’ thing seriously. We humans come alive when God gives us a mission. It’s so worth catching hold of God’s short and long term plans for our lives. Write a Bible verse about God’s protection down (let’s call it your sword–verse). Write one about how to build your life around Him on another piece of paper (your trowel–verse). Hold one in each hand, and pray for Him to direct you in His plan. Carry the verses with you today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Jer 31:31-37, Heb 8:1-13 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=67732&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Amaziah did what was pleasing in the Lord's sight, but not wholeheartedly.' 2 Chronicles 25:2 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;{mp3remote}http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150817.mp3{/mp3remote}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Question: can we do things that God wants in a way which doesn’t put Him first? Yes, we can. This is exactly what 2 Chronicles tells us King Amaziah did. On the outside, he was doing all the right things, but his heart wasn’t in it. His heart was on his own agenda, his own desires. Hmmm. What’s that mean, then? First, a heart turned towards God, and towards serving others, is one that is wide open to God’s blessings. Our motives for doing things are, so often, mixed. The challenge for us, then, is this: ‘&lt;em&gt;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Matthew 5:8 NIV) In our service, if we strip back the bits that point to us rather than Him, we’re clearing up the airwaves to see Him more clearly and let His blessings in. It’s always good to consider where our heart is when we give. How often have we thought: ‘This will make me look good. I wonder how many people saw me do that?’ The beauty of it is that we don’t need to give so God will mark off a few more brownie points for us on a ticklist. ‘&lt;em&gt;God loves a cheerful giver&lt;/em&gt;.’ (2 Corinthians 9:7 NIV) He really does. The giving of our money, time and energy can be from gratitude to His love for us. That’s a win–win for everyone involved—we don’t need to impress anyone, and our lives become bigger. So, let’s make sure our motives for giving are right. Assess your giving, assess your motives, and pray them all through. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Chr 1-4, Mark 6:30-44, Ps 119:81-88, Prov 21:17-19 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=67733&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

Proverbs 14:24 GNT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;{mp3remote}http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150818.mp3{/mp3remote}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A (very) brief summary of Proverbs 14: wisdom is the best. Without it, you’re like someone who tears their house down (verse 1), will ‘believe anything’ (verse 15), and have no qualms about making rash decisions that don’t honour God (verse 16). Sounds like it might be useful, then. As well as the big–scale school/university/work decisions we make, we are faced with hundreds of different everyday courses of action to take ourselves. Whether it’s that link you shouldn’t click, that impulse buy you didn’t need, that drinking game your flatmates are playing, it’s wisdom that gives us an insight into what will help us to build our lives best. Essentially, being wise will help us to keep putting God (and others) first, creating a solid foundation in life. Is it something we’re left alone to teach ourselves, then? Do we have to make a few terrible decisions first before eventually narrowing down what we should really be up to? Thankfully, this doesn’t have to be the case. For Solomon, a pretty wise bloke, wisdom was about admitting that handling life’s situations is best done with God at the reigns (yes, that’s wordplay), not us (1 Kings 3:9). When we humble ourselves and admit that we don’t always know what’s best, God will strengthen our conscience to start knowing which way to go. Now get that journal (didn’t grab one the day before yesterday? Go grab one now... Good work.) Now, open it up and make two lists: one of what you want to learn and improve in yourself this month, and one of people or places you want to help practically and generously this month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Chr 5-7, Mark 6:45-56, Ps 119:89-96, Prov 21:20-23&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=67734&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Share in the troubles we have like a good soldier of Christ Jesus.' 2 Timothy 2:3 NCV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;{mp3remote}http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150819.mp3{/mp3remote}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are certain tactics the enemy will try use to get under our skin. Perhaps you’re feeling pressure from friends and family, or your own heart and head fill you with doubts, anxieties and temptations. It’s a serious matter, but sticking close to God gives us real strength when it comes to resisting Satan. The next few days are committed to helping us triumph when the carrot of giving up is dangling in front of us. Sometimes the world’s moving goalposts when it comes to morality are a constant temptation. Jesus spent a lot of time teaching us not to be anxious about getting by, but to influence the world as ‘&lt;em&gt;salt&lt;/em&gt;’ and ‘&lt;em&gt;light&lt;/em&gt;’ (Matthew 5:13–14). As hard as it is, ‘&lt;em&gt;Religion that is pure and undefiled before God, the Father, is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained from the world&lt;/em&gt;.’ (James 1:27 ESV) Corruption leads to distancing from God. Wince. Good news: none of us can survive on our own. In this letter to Timothy—a young Christian preparing to face the difficulties of leading a church and staying faithful to God’s call—Paul reminds him that, just as good soldiers will share the burdens and struggles of their mates, we should do the same. It is an encouragement to know that we can call on other Christians to step up and support us, to have our backs, and to feel our pain with us. It’s our duty too to do the same for others. So, encourage someone who needs it today. Share in their troubles, like a good soldier of Christ Jesus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Chr 8-11, Mark 7:1-13, Ps 119:97-104, Prov 21:24-27 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=67735&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

Romans 13:14 NAS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;{mp3remote}http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150820.mp3{/mp3remote}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Paul’s letter to the Church in Rome, he brings up a hugely important factor in the battle against Satan. Something that can, but really shouldn’t, be an elephant in the room—letting ourselves indulge in things (often secretly) that don’t honour God. Each day, we’re faced with a choice to ‘&lt;em&gt;cast off the works of darkness&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Romans 13:12 ESV) We’ll be blunt here: if you’ve got a niggle that something might be a hindrance to you, it probably is. We can all think of things that we don’t want to (or don’t know how to) let go of. That website? That ego–boosting slice of gossip? Those thoughts? Behind the temptation to keep hold of those things and use them, there’s a much better life that God has called us to as a ‘&lt;em&gt;new creation&lt;/em&gt;’ (2 Corinthians 5:17 NIV) in Him. To back that up with some serious God–protection, it’s vital to build our relationship with God, regardless of how well or badly we feel we’re doing—He invites us to &lt;em&gt;‘pray in the Spirit at all times and on every occasion.&lt;/em&gt;’ (Ephesians 6:18 NLT) This makes it harder for just–this–one–time things to slip under the radar. God doesn’t need us to be perfect (which is good, since we aren’t), but cutting back the things that hinder you will change your life. Is it time for you to find an accountability partner? Choose someone who you can be honest with. Commit to regularly keep each other in check about the thing–(or things)–to–stop–doing that came to mind today. If you can, pray for each other too. Let’s get each others’ backs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Chr 12-15, Mark 7:14-23, Ps 119:105-112, Prov 21:28-31 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=67736&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Blessed is he who considers the poor...' Psalm 41:1 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three richest people on the planet have more collective wealth than the combined gross national product of the world’s 48 poorest countries. You’re probably not in that league when it comes to earnings, but that’s no excuse for not giving. General Booth, the founder of the Salvation Army, said: ‘How can you convince a man of the love of God if his feet are perishing with the cold?’ Meeting people at their point of need is something Jesus did. For Him, healing and helping people went hand–in–hand with telling them about God. Giving our money, time and energy is a great thing to be doing for God. First, it’s a huge pointer to Him because, when people see our generosity, then it directs them to praise God (2 Corinthians 9:13). Secondly, giving changes our lives, too. When we open up our hearts and piggybanks to God’s way of looking at life, including His perspective on giving, we see massive blessing. In fact (and thirdly), Isaiah tells us that, sometimes, the reason our prayers aren’t answered is because we’ve been selfish when we saw others in need. ‘&lt;em&gt;Remove the... yoke of injustice and let the oppressed go free. Share your food with the hungry and open your homes to the homeless poor. Give clothes to those who have nothing to wear… Then My favour will shine on you…and your wounds will be quickly healed. I will always be with you to save you; My presence will protect you on every side. When you pray, I will answer you.&lt;/em&gt;’ (Isaiah 58:6–9 GNT) What’s something practical you can do for a needy person today?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God designed us to be a window to Him (see Genesis 1:26 for details). When we take a deep look at God’s character and His actions, we get a good indicator of what people should see when we’re showcasing Him well. Mostly, however, they get a pretty murky view. Thankfully, we don’t have to clean ourselves all in our own strength! We can ask God to show us how to be a window. What we’re talking about here is a process called ‘sanctification’, where God turns you round in a more–and–more Christlike direction. Want to know the most amazing bit? That started behind the scenes before we ever knew Him. Wow. Then, it fires up all the more when we commit to join Him in His work. We begin to look more like Him—the way we were made to be. So… can you now say: ‘Thanks for the theology lesson &lt;em&gt;word4U&lt;/em&gt;, I’ll guess I’ll sit around and be sanctified all day now, no effort needed’? Hmmm… you guessed it: no. We’re asked to follow Jesus—an action. Colossians 1:15 says we’re made in the likeness of God, and Jesus is the only ready–made Likeness of the Father. In Him, we’re given a living blueprint for taking hold of our cleaned–up lives. That’s why we’re called to live like Jesus and why He’s our example. Think of one area of your life that needs to look more like that Godly–blueprint. Pray about it, and come back to it whenever it crosses your mind. God will work in you when you ask Him to.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'...now is the day of salvation.' 2 Corinthians 6:2 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next few days we’re going to be thinking about when God works, where God works, and how God works—and where we fit into all of those things. Today’s verse answers the question: ‘When is God working?’ with an emphatic, triumphant, urgent ‘Now! What are you waiting for?’ Now, it’s really good to ‘&lt;em&gt;wait on the Lord&lt;/em&gt;’, and take time to pause and ask God where He wants us to be. Excellent stuff. Do that. But it’s also good to be wary of putting things off—waiting for a sign from Heaven or waiting for the ‘perfect time’ to chat to someone about Jesus can be procrastination. God can work through us, whether there’s a ‘green light’ showing or not about that ‘perfect time’. (In fact, funny thing about ‘perfect times’ for things: they don’t tend to ever show up). Paul reminds the Corinthian church that salvation is happening now—that now is the time to accept it, to start living in it, and to share it. In the next couple of days we’ll be taking a look at the encounter of two disciples with a man ‘&lt;em&gt;who was lame from birth&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Acts 3:2 NIV) They shared the ‘salvation’ they’d found in God. Not only the eternal salvation available through belief in Jesus and His death and resurrection, but the right–now ‘salvation’ from a disability that had kept the man from experiencing ‘&lt;em&gt;life in all its fullness&lt;/em&gt;.’ (John 10:10 NCV) Been putting something (maybe especially a Jesus–related thing) off? Decide to do it, or at least start it, today. Ask God about it first, then give it a start, and see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Acts chapter 3 there’s some really good news—God’s work isn’t limited to a certain time or place. It tells the story of Peter and John’s encounter with a man who couldn’t walk, at a city gate. It all started out as a normal day for this bloke. It’s likely the disciples would have passed this man many times before. Perhaps he was simply part of the background of the streets where they walked. And yet—on this particular afternoon, something different happened. This opportunity for the work of God suddenly arrived, right in a gateway the disciples passed through almost every day. Lesson time: first, don’t draw a line as to where you think God can work (check out 1 Chronicles 29:11). Prayer meetings? Bible study? Those spiritual parts of life are great but, if you feel as though you’re limping through your day–in–day–out life, know that God’s healing hand stretches to the gate (or wherever you find yourself), too. Just like the man who was healed, when we call out, God will provide. Secondly, God’s provision will get you back on your feet, no matter how slowly. Like the man, we often look for short term help, but God wants to do more than just provide a crutch for the issues that hold us down. Be bold today. Cry out to Him. Ask for healing. And ask for the opportunity to bring healing into the lives of others, just as Peter and John did.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Taking him by the right hand, he helped him up...' Acts 3:7 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Peter and John got the picture. God is working through you and me (His disciples). That’s the role they took on as they extended their hands to people on the street. Disclaimer: God’s way of working might not match ours. The two disciples were on their way to a pretty important prayer meeting: ‘…&lt;em&gt;Peter and John were going up to the temple at the time of prayer—at three in the afternoon&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Acts 3:1 NIV) That prayer meeting took a back seat, though, when God showed how He wanted to work that day. Wherever we’re heading, God will point us to those hurting, needy, aren’t–saying–much individuals who weren’t on today’s list of notifications. Peter dropped what he was doing and let God redirect him towards helping a man who couldn’t walk: ‘&lt;em&gt;Taking him by the right hand, he helped him up.&lt;/em&gt;’ (Acts 3:7 NIV) Those disciples were blessed, too, not just the man at the gate. The moment when their hands met—that’s the moment the Church, the body of Christ, became the arm of God at work. Jesus calls us to be His hands and feet in today’s world. And here’s a beautiful thing—He tells us that ‘&lt;em&gt;whatever you do for the least of these... you did for Me&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Matthew 25:40 NIV) It’s as if, to Peter and John, the man lying at the gate is Jesus. And Peter and John, ex-tending their hands to him, are being Jesus to the man. THAT is God at work, transforming both those in need, and the ones who seek to help. Ready for a prophetic action? Write ‘Jesus’ on your hand. Use that hand to help as many people up as you can today.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'...I require...the first-fruits and the choicest of your contributions....' Ezekiel 20:40 AMP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God gave the prophet Ezekiel a picture of what it will look like when God’s relationship with His people is fixed: He’ll call them to His holy mountain, gather His people to Him—and they will offer Him the best of what they have (‘first fruits’ of the harvest). At this time in Bible history, God’s people were the Jewish people. They took this picture to heart—their law required that they offer the first fruits of harvest to God, to worship Him and remind themselves that everything came from Him. As it rolled out, they weren’t always that great at putting Him first. All they needed to do was make Him their priority (not their own selfish ambition), and they could enjoy being close to Him, but they cut corners left and right. Most of us can think of situations where we’ve done the same, forgetting that ‘my gifts are not my gifts; they belong to God.’ God’s love doesn’t depend on how well we live this out. So, because His love is so freely given, let’s try to do this well. A good way to do this? Kick it off by giving back to God the first bit of His most basic gift—the day you get to be alive in. So set your alarm 10 minutes earlier to start tomorrow with a prayer of commitment. (Hate mornings? Do it anyway… you’ve got to get up sometime.) Start your morning with words like the Psalmist: ‘&lt;em&gt;You are my God. My times are in Your hands&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Psalm 31:14–15 AMP) That’s one way to focus the rest of your day on Him.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'He...saw...evidence of the grace of God.' Acts 11:23 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Grace’. You don’t often hear it used outside of church but, boy, do you hear it a lot there. What does it even mean? As a noun, the dictionary describes grace as ‘courteous good will’. Sounds quite Christian. But in the Bible, ‘grace’ is about more than just good manners. So, what does the Bible say? Peter wrote we should be growing in ‘grace and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour.’ (2 Peter 3:18 NIV) Grace is simply God giving us what we don’t deserve. Growing in grace refers to our transformation from what we used to be into what He is making us to because of His goodness that He has undeservingly lavished on us. When we say that a person is ‘full of grace’ we don’t mean full like a tankard of coffee (though, come to think of it, tankard of coffee… mmm). The grace given to us doesn’t just stay inside. We can make the choice to let it overflow into the world around us. Jesus has already given us more than enough in His forgiveness and acceptance of us (throwback to yesterday, anyone?) That fuels our everyday lives—it’s why 2 Peter encourages us to know more about it. The more we know of it, the more we change the way we see things and respond to the world around us—places and people where there could be more of God’s presence and work. To remind yourself of what it means to be full of grace: get a mug and a stick it under the tap. Fill the mug, and keep on filling until it’s pouring over the sides into the sink. Here’s a visual of ‘full of grace’—lavishly sharing out and out and out to others.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Don't excuse yourself by saying, &quot;Look, we didn't know.&quot;' Proverbs 24:12 NLT &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘I’m washing my hair,’ ‘I’m doing my homework,’ ‘I’m vacuuming my cat.’ All excuses we’ve used before to get out of a variety of things. (Maybe not the cat one; we tried it once and nobody believed us). But what about when we’re trying to get out of taking responsibility for something? Ouch. That stuff can sting quite badly. When we’ve hurt a friend, left someone out or made a really bad choice. It can be so hard to hold up our hands and say, ‘You know what? My bad.’ But sometimes, it’s the only way to move on. Proverbs 12:22 ESV says: ‘Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord, but those who act faithfully are His delight.’ God actually delights in seeing us do the right thing. That doesn’t mean that doing the right thing will be an easy ride, but it does mean that when we’ve messed up and we are willing to take responsibility we are bringing honour to God. On the flipside, when we use today’s verse as our script for sticky situations, no matter how many people believe you, God sees our motivation for excuses. When we’re willing to swallow our pride and own up, we are pointing our lives in a God–ward direction—everyone’s a winner. Ephesians 4:26 NIV says: ‘Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry.’ Use that as a challenge today; seek to put things right with your family and friends before you go to bed tonight. It might be tough, and it might be a long time before a relationship is repaired, but take the first step towards it today.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Though it cost you all you have, get understanding.' Proverbs 4:7 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahh, Proverbs. Many pearls of wisdom. But, here’s the thing—it’s only full of wisdom when you read it, use it and do something about it. God’s Word was never meant to be a bunch of letters on a page shoved in a bookcase somewhere. It was always intended to be truth, wisdom and promise. And that means that we need to bring those things into the world by living them out. Wisdom can seem like a theoretical thing, but it’s totally not. It’s a basis of real, solid understanding—an understanding that equips us to live out God’s plans and commands. You wouldn’t expect a vacuum cleaner to keep your house clean when it’s left in the cupboard under the stairs; it’s the same with your Bible (not sure why we’ve mentioned vacuums two days in a row, clearly some of us have a guilty conscience…and a very dusty floor). If you want to get the most out of your Bible and start living out your faith, you’ve got to get it out daily. In Proverbs 1:5 NIV it says: ‘Let the wise listen and add to their learning, and let the discerning get guidance.’ The original word used here for learning is ‘leqach’, which is connected with the idea of taking something. Basically, what Proverbs is getting at is that we have to take wisdom from God. He’s the Almighty source of wisdom, He embodies wisdom itself, so anytime we’re struggling with something, He’s the One to go to. Remember memory verses? It’s old school, but it’s a good way of allowing Scripture to permeate your life and impact the way you see things. Learn a (useful for you) verse from Proverbs by heart this week.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant.' Mark 10:43 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see so much of people serving in church (in welcome teams, in coffee rosters, handing out hymn books on the way in and so on) that we can sometimes lose touch with the word ‘servant’. We become desensitised to the whole idea and just end up assuming that it’s all about how often we stack the chairs. But being a servant in God’s eyes is less about the actual acts we do (though they are important), and more about the attitude we bring. You see, if we stack the chairs at church but get home and whinge about it, we’ve completely missed the point. Cue a great verse in Paul’s letter to the people of Philippi: ‘Do everything without complaining or arguing.’ (Philippians 2:14 GWT) Everything? Yep. Look at it this way, can you imagine Jesus saying ‘I really don’t feel like doing that today, God.’ He was willing to be a servant, willing to do as the Father asked Him, even if that meant a rough deal. It’s tough, but it’s who God calls us to be. Galatians 5:13 NIV says: ‘You, my brothers and sisters, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh; rather, serve one another humbly in love.’ God made you free so that you could serve. Use that freedom. Grab someone who looks like they might be need a hand, even the old man next door who can’t push his mower around, and ask what you can do to lend a hand. Even the smallest of odd–jobs is an opportunity to exercise your God–given freedom and be a servant.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Be very careful, then, how you live.' Ephesians 5:15 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘You only live once.’ It’s easy to be cynical about this and other nice t–shirt slogans like: ‘Live for today’, ‘When life gives you lemons, make lemonade’, ‘carpe diem’ and all that other stuff. But, hold up, maybe there’s something in this whole ‘seize the day’ business that we shouldn’t so casually dismiss it. Ecclesiastes 9:9 NIV says: ‘Enjoy life with your wife.’ Now THAT we can see on a t–shirt (mainly because it rhymes). But it goes on to say: ‘For this is your lot in life and in your toilsome labour under the sun.’ Wow. Not so t–shirt friendly after all? There’s some meaty stuff behind the message. In Luke 9:62 NIV, a man says, ‘I will follow You, Lord, but first let me go back and say goodbye to my family.’ Jesus replies, ‘No one who puts his hand to the plough and looks back is fit for service in the Kingdom of God.’ There’s a ‘seize the day’ message if ever there was one. Maybe you’ve noticed: any Instagram–filtered–poster–pic type slogans that we can grab from the Bible tend to be paired with some real kickers. They’re not just nice platitudes or motivational quips. Yes, God is all for the ‘seize the day’ mentality, but look again at the reason. Because we can’t put God’s Kingdom off until later. We have to be prepared to step up today. To make today (and the direction of our lives) more about God than ourselves, to serve in whatever immediate way we can. Don’t put it off. Simple. Choose one little thing you can do today that will grow God’s Kingdom. Go for it.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'He will empower you with inner strength.' Ephesians 3:16 NLT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever watched a superhero film and been convinced you must have superpowers you haven’t discovered yet? No? Oh c’mon, you know you have. As much as we can close our eyes and convince ourselves we can teleport from our desk to New York, sometimes we can feel pretty weak. In fact, the latter’s the more common, right? We’ve all had moments of sheer helplessness, where it’s almost impossible to get out of bed because we’re physi-cally/emotionally exhausted. As hard as it is, you can trust Him. If you’re willing to step out, His power goes with you. Isaiah 40:29 NIV says: ‘He gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak.’ That’s pretty incredible encouragement, right? We may not have teleportation powers (though don’t count the possibility out… check Acts 8:39–40, God did it once), but that verse from Isaiah tells us that, even in our weakest moments, we have power that God will build on. It means that we don’t have to live in exhaustion and weakness. God has the amazing power to take everything that wears us down, and free us from it. He’s ready and willing to help you, if you’ll bring it all before Him. That also goes for when you’re not allowing yourself to feel weak. When you’re convincing yourself that you can do it alone, you’re denying God the right to carry you and strengthen you. Allow Him in, He knows what He’s doing. And every time you see a picture of a superhero, remember the Super-Power (God) that goes before you and the strength that God provides.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Not a problem. Buying a few new t–shirts, when we already have a full ward-robe, isn’t ‘serving money’, is it? Possibly not. There’s nothing wrong in buying stuff. But we would ask you this… Did you ask God what He wanted you to do with that cash before splashing it? Now, this is NOT a guilt trip. Promise. It’s a reality check. Some inspiration to move forwards with. And it’s inspiration that we all need. We’ve all got to get our priorities straight. Everything we’ve got is a gift from God anyway. Our very lives, and everything in them, are given by Him, so we have a definite duty to invite Him to shine through them. That means offering everything back to Him, as soon as it lands in our lap (or, even, once we’ve worked our snowflake–patterned Christmas–in–July socks off for it). Whether it’s the $100 birthday money from granny, or the $2 you just found on the floor, God loves it when you give it back to Him. He won’t necessarily tell you to give $102 to charity/church/the homeless guy in town. He may just ask you to give a portion to one of them. But, if you take all your money to Him, you accept the risk that He may tell you to give away what’s left over, after you’ve paid your bills. In fact, scratch that, you don’t just ‘accept’ that risk. You’ll learn to delight in the God–given hazard of generosity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Ezra 6-8, Mark 1:35-45, Ps 78:17-31, Prov 19:27-29 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=67253&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'What do you have in your house?' 2 Kings 4:2 NIV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be brilliant when you get a direct answer to prayer through another person. But, have you ever considered the fact that you could actually be the answer to someone else’s prayers? Seriously, think about what you have to offer. God equips each one of us with gifts to bless other people. Find yourself on your knees in prayer fairly often? Great! Sometimes, when we get up and walk back into ‘the world’, we’re a walking answer to prayer (see Isaiah 52:7 for further details). Maybe you’re pretty good at just listening, or perhaps you’re great at cheering people up. In Luke 6:38 KJV Jesus said: ‘Give, and it shall be given unto you.’ Now, that doesn’t mean that you’ll always get a good deal. There will be people who let you down and take more than they give. But, God promises that when we commit to serving one another, He will honour us. John 12:26 NIV says: ‘My Father will honour the one who serves Me.’ And as long as we’re seeking God’s honour (rather than the self–gratification of being praised for being an amazing friend), we’re on the right track. Sit down with a Christian friend and chat about what you think they bring into people’s lives (even if it’s just that they can make you laugh till you cry… wait, that shouldn’t be ‘just’—that’s an awesome gift). Then ask them to tell you what you bring into people’s lives. You might be surprised by how much of a blessing you truly are.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'As newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the Word...' 1 Peter 2:2 NKJ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many times have you crashed with a friend and, instead of eating dinner, you’ve gorged on chocolate and crisps? At the time it feels good, but after a few hours, you start to wonder if ‘fibre’ or ‘vitamins’ might be a good shout. The headaches start. The stomach lurches. You start to feel both too full and strangely empty at the same time. Peter’s getting at something similar in these verses. Our soul is crying out for nourishment. The temptation to go looking for that soul–nourishment in places other than God’s Word can be really strong. We don’t always notice ourselves doing it. Malice, deceit, hypocrisy, envy, evil speaking (1 Peter 2:1); they’re quick fixes, and can give the short–lived illusion that they’re just what we need to feel full. (In that moment when we give in to nastiness, we can feel satisfied in a guilty kind of way... until we spiritually sober up and catch what we’re doing.) But, they don’t provide us with the proper fruit and veg spiritual nourishment we really long for. God gives a full list of His culinary recommendations in Galatians 5:22–23. Yep, the fruit of the Spirit: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, gentleness, faithfulness and self–control. Truth is, it’s not always easy to choose to eat healthily. But the nifty thing is: we can pray for the right kind of healthy hunger. So go for it! Ask: ‘Lord, give me a hunger for Your nourishment through Your Word in Scripture.’ Then decide: which fruit of the Spirit is going to be part of your diet today?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘For I am yours… and you are mine.’ Yeah, ok, it might seem like a bit of a greetings–card cliché. But what about when we sing it in worship? We might know in our heads that we belong to Jesus. But really knowing that we belong to Jesus, in our hearts, can be a different matter. What does it mean? What difference does it make to how our lives look? The real sense of value that comes from knowing you’re a child of God doesn’t come from all the nice things He gives you. In fact, any material ‘thing’ can disappear at any time. God’s declaration that you are His, that you are significant because of that, isn’t a promise that He’s going to give you a free pass when it comes to troubles. His is a more lasting significance and a promise to be with you in those troubles: ‘&lt;em&gt;I have called you by your name; you are Mine. When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they shall not overwhelm you. When you walk through fire, you shall not be burned…For I am the Lord your God…you are precious in My eyes&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Isaiah 43:1–4 ESV) You are precious. Not what you’ve got, or what you have done—you. When your sense of significance is an inside job, rather than based on external things, nothing can touch it.&lt;/p&gt;

<fulltext><![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you realise someone likes you as you are, it’s pretty great. Even when someone sheepishly says, ‘I maybe sorta kinda like you,’ it’s a massive confidence boost, right? It doesn’t even have to be romantic. It can be as straightforward as that person, the one you respect more than anyone, complimenting what you’ve done. It sticks with us when we know we’re appreciated. And that’s just when fellow humans value us! What about God? Yes, the God of creation, the same God who named the stars (Psalm 147:4) thinks more highly of you than He does the stars. Jesus says: ‘...&lt;em&gt;the very hairs on your head are all numbered&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Matthew 10:30 NKJ) Your adoring fans might know your eye colour, what flavour you like your latté, or your favourite film. But the amount of hair on your head? Nah. God knows every detail about you, and loved you even before you knew Him (Ephesians 1:4). What does all this mean? God appreciates you. A lot. He values you more than you can imagine. The things that make you ‘you’ are given huge weight because of that. It’s good to remember that the best compliment, or the most alluring romance, can’t touch the significance you’ve already been given. And it’s good to remember that ‘re–member’ literally means to put back together again. Like Humpty Dumpty. So when you recollect and remember that God has made you, you’re doing something really wonderful. Particularly if you’re feeling fractured or broken today, find somewhere to be quiet and remember, and let Him put you back together again.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'...The Lord raises those who are bowed down...' Psalm 146:8 NKJ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That significance in God that we’ve been focusing on these last two days—yes, it can be shaken, especially when we do things that make us think we’re suddenly unclean again. But only in our heads. Even when we know we’ve messed up, God looks past what we’ve done and into our future. Open your Bible (app?) to John 4, where Jesus met the woman at the well. While the rest of the town slandered her because of her shady past, Jesus offered her a new life. God knows it’s sometimes hard to see beyond what we’ve done, so He meets us right where we are. At the well, or the workplace, or school or your worried mind, He’s there. He told the woman this: &lt;em&gt;‘Whoever drinks of this water will thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst&lt;/em&gt;.’ (John 4:13–14) Your significance? You might feel like it has taken a knock, but your self–worth is fulfilled in Jesus—you don’t need to keep ‘thirsting’ after other people’s approval of you. In fact, God loves to show us that even in our lowest moments, He is there. Psalm 146:8 NKJ says: ‘&lt;em&gt;The Lord raises those who are bowed down&lt;/em&gt;.’ When you’re humble to accept that His way (and He Himself) is the best way forward, He’ll pick you up and show you your significance, wherever you’ve fallen down. So, whenever cruel words come at you, especially come from your own mind, remember what God really says about you. (Reread yesterday’s message, if your memory’s as bad as ours is...)&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'...God will bring every work into judgment, including every secret thing, whether good or evil.' Ecclesiastes 12:14 NKJ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God’s omniscience (that’d be His all–knowingness) gets a lot of bad press from time to time. Ever heard someone advise: ‘Don’t do that. God’s watching’? As if He’s nothing more than a security guard with seven billion screens trying to catch us out every other second. But if we understand that God is love—which He is—we can really understand His all–knowingness. So often when we sin, we’re hesitant to go back to God. But the reality is that He knows everything already—He knows the worst and the best about us; He sees our innermost thoughts. We can bury our motivations and thinking so deeply, they’re hidden even from ourselves. But we can’t hide them from God. Ultimately that’s good news. We don’t have to live in fear of Him coming back to discover our mess and, in shocked horror, send us to bed without dinner. He already sees the mess, and He’s ready to deal with it lovingly. We just have to take it to Him. And while we need to go back to Him to sort out that sin, we can approach Him with confidence, knowing that Jesus has already done everything necessary to restore us to God in the first place. So—right now and in a properly Christ–like way—go clean up a mess that you didn’t make. And, if whoever did make it is around, show them real grace about it. No grumbling or fuss–making.&lt;/p&gt;

He created something as delicately precise as atoms, neurons and quarks. He created something as grand and supersized as the IC1101 galaxy, which is estimated as 100 thousand light years across. God created Shakespeare and Picasso and your next door neighbour. The Piano Key butterfly gets a name from a stunning keyboard tattooed to its wings—again the work of Creator God. The shark, the wombat, jelly trifles, soap bubbles—they were all modelled at the hand of God. You get the idea: God is creative. Well, the Bible teaches we are made in the image of God—so if God is creative… yep, good guess, so are we. Ok, maybe you tend to colour outside the lines, sing like a strangled bullfrog or run like a demented crab—but in other unique ways you will reflect God’s creativity. Styling hair could be your thing. Or unravelling an equation. Or curling a free–kick. Or dissecting an aneurysm. Or turning over a sentence. Creativity doesn’t just happen in the art room. To some, God reveals beauty in mathematical sequences and scientific formulae; to others, He shows up in drama or paintings. However we’ve been wired; we’ve all received ‘creativity’. Not sure about that? You don’t have to class yourself as a ‘creative type’ to be able to bring ideas up that will bless people—we all have ways to reflect God’s creativity. When you tap into God’s creativity, He helps you see things not as they are, but as they can be. Today, do three creative things, in your own God–given way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Eph 1:1-4:16, Matt 25:31-46, Ps 79, Prov 17:24-26 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=67232&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

Romans 12:2 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;{mp3remote}http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150710.mp3{/mp3remote}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Romans 12 tells us to let the Holy Spirit transform us by ‘renewing...your mind.’ We can sometimes cringe at the notion of doing something that ‘isn’t me’. We tend to carve out a comfortable little possie for ourselves and that’s how the world comes to see us. And we buy into the world’s view! So when God comes along and tells the person who could never speak in class to preach to a large congregation, it’s hard to think anyone will take that seriously. Sometimes, though, we’re asked to challenge those expectations. God made us with purpose, value, dignity and worth, but along the way He’s still going to need to step in and grow us. As that emerges, of course we’re going to change. It’s practically a necessity if He’s fulfilling His purposes in us. When we don’t have the power or energy to change our own self–image, God does. In fact, whenever He calls us to do things we don’t see ourselves being capable of, He transforms us so that we can do whatever is needed. Like Op-timus Prime, we can be renewed and restored, and will come back kicking, with new Energon–like energy and power (perhaps minus the painted–on flames, though?) It’s not always easy to change others’ first impressions of us. We can don glasses but people won’t think we’re smarter. And, it can be even harder to change our own impression of ourselves. With God, though, real change happens. And those changes will eventually shine through. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Eph 4:17-6:24, Matt 26:1-13, Ps 109:1-15, Prov 17:27-28 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=67233&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

John 17:23 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;{mp3remote}http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150711.mp3{/mp3remote}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Truth time. We may not like to admit it, but sometimes we can subconsciously believe that we’re ‘better’ than someone else because we got this grade or that job. Our Church denomination is better or our social class is higher. John 17:23 tells us that God wants His children to be unified, and unity doesn’t allow for judgment. We can ignore lecturers and tolerate seemingly–silly ideas, with a forced smile, but our opinion of that other person has gone down. When this happens, immediately we’ve separated ourselves in spirit because of a difference of opinion. But we’re supposed to be different. God wants His children to be unified—but not by all being clones of each other. That said, ‘complete unity’ seems a tall order, doesn’t it? It is. Let’s be honest, it isn’t so easy to be unified with that guy who’s always one–upping you. We’ve all heard a bunch of talks or sermons about accepting people’s differences. We (probably) all agree with that rationally, and even in practice. What we’re likely to neglect is making accommodation in our mind for those who have a different way of thinking to us (ever got frustrated with someone who doesn’t do things your way?) That’s harder. But unity demands we learn to make room for others and respect their convictions. ‘Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind.’ (Romans 14:5 NIV) When you hear someone air an idea that opposes one of yours today, consider whether you’re actually listening, or if you’re just planning a lecture (even a silent–mental–lecture) entitled: ‘This is why you’re wrong.’ Really listen to what they say, and turn it into a fair conversation. You might learn something. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Sam 1:1-3:21, Matt 26:14-25, Ps 109:16-31, Prov 18:1-3 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=67234&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Have fervent love for one another.' 1 Peter 4:8 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;{mp3remote}http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150712.mp3{/mp3remote}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Do nothing out of selfish ambition…value others above yourselves.’ (Philippians 2:3 NIV) You’ve heard it a hundred times: the golden rule, love your neighbour, etc. So why do people still talk about valuing others above yourself when everyone’s heard it a million times? Well, your Mum told you that sprouts were good for you a million times but did you eat them? Yeah. See what we mean? Christians talk about loving each other all the time because it’s important. It’s one thing to know you should be unified, it’s another to put aside pettiness and actually work for it. What we do affects other people whether we think about it or not, and quite often, when we inadvertently hurt someone, we feel awful. Or we can try to justify it: We were ‘only following the rules’. But when somebody else’s action affects us, we don’t tend to offer the same courtesy we offer ourselves. We attribute blame and assume that we know that their intention was to hurt us. For some reason, we don’t expect from others the same human weaknesses that we have. Jesus told us that love trumps everything. Paul said, ‘Everything is permissible—but not everything is beneficial.’ (1 Corinthians 10:23 NIV) He was talking about doing things that are ok but that other people might find offensive. And he basically says: think twice... then think again. Holding onto the view ‘but I did nothing wrong’ for the sake of offended pride is not on. Holding onto the spirit of Scripture that Jesus taught (again, love) is on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Gen 14:18-20, Ps 110, Heb 5:5-11 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=67235&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['You cannot be fruitful unless you remain in Me.' John 15:4 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;{mp3remote}http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150713.mp3{/mp3remote}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus tells us straight up that our successes lie in Him. End of story. Unless we’re doing things in His name and with His backing, it’s not going to work out. We have a problem when we try to emulate Jesus, without Jesus. A lot goes into the running of a Church and, when you get to a certain point in your Church life, you might think about helping out. That’s brilliant. It’s a great thing to want to use your talent with technology to set up the sound equipment, or to use your awesome coffee–making–and–smiling–at–the–same–time skills in joining the refreshment team. Sometimes, though, we can get caught up in wanting to help. Suddenly, we’re on twelve different rotas and we never actually get to sit and listen to a sermon. We’re doing all these things for God, but if we’re not building our relationship with Him, then we lose track of why we’re doing those things in the first place. James 2:26 famously says that ‘faith without works is dead’. But works without faith aren’t alive, either. They become a façade, sometimes even an at-tempt to buy favour with God! It doesn’t matter if you look like a Super Christian outwardly, if you’re not right with God inwardly. When we stop doing things in Him, we can’t succeed, and our efforts become meaningless. Spend an hour today not doing anything but waiting on God. No matter how much work you have to do, clear your schedule just for one hour. Sit with your Bible and a pen, and maybe some Spirit–focussed music. But just *be* in that hour, don’t worry about *doing* anything. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Sam 3:22-7:17, Matt 26:26-35, Ps 118:1-9, Prov 18:4-6 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=67236&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

When people all around are talking about their callings and all’s quiet on the Heaven–front for you, it can be disheartening. But remember that story about the colt Jesus rode into Jerusalem? That colt had never been ridden and was tied to a tree, overlooked and underestimated by the people around him. But Jesus had ‘need of him’ and knew the right time to call for him. Now, you’re not a baby horse (or a baby goat. Neigh, we kid you not), but the same applies in your life. You’ve heard that God has a plan for you and you may be wondering what that is (or not; if you already know, then that’s prettyyyy cool). However we have to remember that plans run on a schedule and, unlike ours, God’s plans tend to stay on schedule. He’s going to call you when He knows the time is right. That can be difficult to accept, but let’s face it, God’s plan is better than anything we could come up with. Jesus was never influenced by other people’s opinions. It didn’t matter that the colt was overlooked or the prostitute was looked down upon or that everyone hated the taxman, Jesus still loved them and had a purpose for them. He knows your value better than others do, and better than you do. So, try this reminder: when you’re making tea tonight, stop cooking halfway through and see if you’d want to eat it. Bet you’d rather wait until it’s cooked and ready. Some things you just have to wait for. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Sam 7:18-11:27, Matt 26:36-46, Ps 118:10-18, Prov 18:7-9 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=67237&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Whatever you ask for in prayer, believe...and it will be yours.' Mark 11:24 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;{mp3remote}http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150715.mp3{/mp3remote}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s pray. Hands together. Sound like a familiar instinct? If you were taught to pray as a kid, it’s probably muscle memory. You likely also felt that rush of rebellion as you sneakily took a peek around the assembly hall to see if anyone ‘wasn’t praying right.’ But you’ve probably realised that God doesn’t care if your hands are together, at your sides, or raised in the air. Prayer isn’t about hand placement. There’s a cool thought from William Ward: ‘We stamp and address an envelope and send it on its way with complete confidence that it will reach its destination. Yet we wonder and even doubt if our prayers will be heard by an ever–present, ever–loving God.’ When Peter told a man who couldn’t walk to get up and go, it didn’t happen because he thought, half–heartedly, ‘Meh, might as well give it a go.’ It happened because he knew that God has real power, and would answer his prayer. God rewarded Peter’s sincere faith. We can get caught up in the words of a prayer or the length of it. It can be hard to remember that prayer is just a way of telling God that we’re ready and believing. Peter simply said, ‘In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk’ (Acts 3:6 ESV), and it happened. God knows already what we want to say. So pray in a way you’re comfortable with, and keep an eye out for answers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Sam 12:1-14:20, Matt 26:47-56, Ps 118:19-29, Prov 18:10-12 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=67238&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'When you pray, go into your room, close the door.' Matthew 6:6 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve all been in that situation: in church (or youth group or life group...) and somebody’s been praying when suddenly you’re saying ‘Amen’ with no idea what the prayer was about. Your mind wandered. Again. Oops. Today we’re not usually very good at putting all of our attention on one thing. We listen to music while we work, we watch sitcoms while we clean. We’re not always great with staying focused on God when there’s a billion other things going on around us. Sometimes, we fall asleep before we reach Amen. If you relate, don’t worry, you’re not a bad Christian, and you’re definitely not the only one who does that sort of thing. Turns out God knows us pretty well, He foresaw all of that, and gave us some handy tips via the Bible. Through them, we can re–learn how to be delighted with prayer, and in the real, living relationship we have with God. Matthew 6 tells us to be real in our prayers, no posturing or showing off or the like. ‘...go into your room, close the door.’ (Matthew 6:6 NIV) By closing the door you’re putting yourself in the mindset of being closed off from distractions to focus all of your attention on God. It may feel like there are so many other things you should be doing that you can’t afford to close the door, but what better way to deal with those worries than to bring them to God? Try physically closing the door when you pray to shut out distractions, and, for the next week, try writing your prayers down in a notebook and putting them away to be remembered later.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'...ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.' John 15:7 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John 15:7 doesn’t give us licence to treat God like a magic genie. We don’t just tell Him what we want and watch it appear in a puff of smoke. (Even if we did expect that as kids—praying for whatever we wanted, off the top of our heads. Chocolate. A pony. A barrel of spider monkeys wearing tophats.) But there’s a first part to that verse. And it rolls out like this: ‘Abide vitally united to Me…’ (John 15:7 AMP) Our life comes from God. We’re vitally con-nected to Him. And He’s connected to us—it goes on to say: ‘...and [if] My words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.’ Get your teeth into your Bible and you’ll naturally be praying that bit more in line with the things that God wants to do anyway. When you’re obedient to Him, your desires will start to look more like His will. James 4:3 NIV says: ‘...when you ask, you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives…’ So let’s check our motives; be willing to let God change your desires, too. This might have to be re–learned from old habits of praying selfishly (no more barrels of spider monkeys, sigh.) Once you’re living and moving in–tune with God and His will, ‘...ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.’ Been writing down your prayers like we suggested yesterday? Good. Now, go back through them, and for each one that requests something, think about why you’re asking it: what are your desires, are they in line with God’s will?&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'...Seek His face always...' 1 Chronicles 16:11 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, in the days before the paparazzi trailed celebs and royals everywhere, it was quite common for the average person to have no idea what a famous person looked like. No magazines, no photographs, no paintings. In the ancient world, even people working in the palace all their lives might never get close enough to know what the king actually looked like. Seeking God’s face always means desiring to have continual access to God’s presence. To be with Him. To feel His reassuring closeness. All the time. But how can we do that continually when life can be so busy? Sometimes finding time in the middle of things is hard. It’s great to take time outside of our busy activity to pray. Sometimes we need that close presence in the ‘always’ ongoing bit of our lives. Psalm 16:11 AMP says that in God’s presence ‘is fullness of joy’. Here’s a fact: when you’re *in* your day, all wrapped up in the minute–by–minute stuff, God is still with you. You are still able to know that. Making God the focus of your day, your life, each second is easier said than done, but in each decision you make and in each word you speak, make that conscious effort to look up to God. It’s worth it. So: for today, here’s a task. On the hour, every hour, say hi to God, and bring one thing from the past hour to Him. Ask Him to be in the next 60 minutes, too. Just quickly make the effort to check in with Him. Set reminders on your phone, if necessary.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'...He fell with His face to the ground and prayed...' Matthew 26:39 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Matthew 26 we see Jesus in a very human light. He knows what’s about to happen—Judas will betray Him—so He takes His disciples to a garden called Gethsemane. He chose to walk a bit further than they did, to pray alone. You might ask why Jesus separated Himself to pray. There is no straight–cut answer but it’s possible that, by being alone, He had greater room to express His emotions. He tells the closest three disciples: ‘My soul is exceedingly sorrowful…’ (Matthew 26:38 NIV) Sometimes, it’s good to be alone before God and pour your heart out to Him without holding back (maybe more than we already do). Three times Jesus prays, ‘Let this cup be taken from Me,’ (Matthew 26:39 NIV) but He follows it up with: ‘Your will be done.’ (Matthew 26:42 NIV) Three times. When you’re battling your human emotions, it’s a good call to keep going back to God and recommitting yourself to Him. This is a crucial moment in Jesus’ life, and we gain insight into how He poured this out to God. Right. That’s a fairly privileged position. If Jesus (God Himself) let loose and literally cried out to His heavenly Father, despite who He is, what does that teach us? Don’t be afraid to open up the very, very weakest parts of yourself to God. Don’t forget that Jesus knows already; He told His disciples: ‘The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.’ (Matthew 26:41 NIV) We can take encouragement in that, because God knows how much we need Him; we don’t need to be perfect to approach Him in prayer. Whatever you’ve been praying about recently, whatever is really on your heart, pray for it three times, at three different points today. SoulFood: Gen 5:22–24, Heb 11:5, 2 Kings 2:1–12&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Cast your bread upon the waters...' Ecclesiastes 11:1 ESV &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You didn’t read that wrong, that’s an actual verse in the Bible… What’s it going on about? Should we be feeding more ducks or something? Here’s a basic outline of what’s going on. The same as now, bread back in long, long ago times was used for food; the more bread or grain farmers sent out in trade, the more places it reached, the more they would get back. It’s really simple. Jesus liked to use ‘everyday’ examples to get across the point. Stick with us here: our ‘grain’ can be taken to mean our gifts and talents. Like a labourer trying to get a good return, we can share what we have with others (no matter who they are) to bless them. Why? Well, when we use our gifts in lots of diverse ways and reach out to as many people as we can with them, there’s a principle at work: ‘...after many days you may receive a return’ (that’s the other half of verse 11). Chip away at the things you do, day by day. Watch as God grows you and the situation you’re in. You reap what you sow. (An agricultural way of saying that you get back what you give out.) God wants to use you in the ways He has gifted you, but you need to put yourself out there for that to happen. What has God been calling you in to? If you can feel God nudging you in a particular direction, note it down. Then pray about it to discern if it’s His will for your life.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'...He rescued me because He delighted in me.' Psalm 18:19 ESV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cast your eye over Psalm 18. Yup, all 50 verses. Might seem a large ask, but consider: you’d spend more minutes in a session scrolling through your social media feed. Think about exactly what sort of image Psalm 18 paints of God. Fairly impressive, right? Let’s take verse 7, for example: ‘The foundations of the mountains shook; they trembled because He was angry.’ So, it’s a fair bet to assume that God is great and mighty. And yet, it goes on to say in verse 16: ‘He reached down from on high and took hold of me.’ God, in all His splendour and glory reached down to be with us. To save us and bring us close to Himself. Why would God do something like that? It’s written in black and white in verse 19: ‘He rescued me because He delighted in me.’ Despite all that He is responsible for (founder of the universe, ’n all), God takes pleasure in you. That’s why He chose to reach all the way down to us. That’s why Jesus gave His life for us. 1 John 4:10 NIV says: ‘This is love: not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.’ His love means He’ll protect you fiercely when you ask and strengthen you to stand with Him. ‘You make Your saving help my shield’ (Psalm 18:35 NIV), ‘You armed me with strength for battle.’ (Psalm 18:39 NIV) Take time to remember God’s love for you today and let it really sink in.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Daniel resolved not to defile himself...' Daniel 1:8 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible is crammed full of examples of God’s people standing up for things they know to be right. Other people often disagreed with their convictions, and sometimes made life hard for them because of it. The religious authorities weren’t too chuffed about Jesus’ convictions either. Daniel, in his decision ‘not to defile himself with the royal food and wine’ (Daniel 1:8 NIV) was making a stand. Choosing to stand for something we know is right by God can be tough, especially when we know it might not go down so well with those around us. By making his decision, Daniel probably risked his position. But, he stood for what he knew to be the right thing. The great part? ‘God had caused the official to show favour…to Daniel.’ (Daniel 1:9 NIV) Oh, and then: ‘…they looked healthier and better nourished than any of the young men who ate the royal food.’ (Daniel 1:15 NIV) Culinary win. God honoured Daniel’s willingness to submit to and glorify Him. God will always be faithful when He tells you to step out in faith. Proverbs 3:5 NIV says: ‘Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding.’ Really, though, God always goes ahead of you, even when you can’t see the path. The old 2 Corinthians 5:7 gem still stands as completely true: ‘…we live by faith, not by sight.’ Have you got a prayer buddy? If so, then agree to pray with them for wisdom and encouragement about any stand God’s calling you to make that scares you. If not, then pray to find one so you can pray about that stand together.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Give your servant a discerning heart to... distinguish between right and wrong.' 1 Kings 3:9 NIV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this verse, Solomon is doing two main things. First, he’s admitting He’s not capable of governing ‘a great people’. He’s saying to God, ‘Ok, Lord, I can’t do this without you. You know best.’ Sometimes even that aspect can be difficult, can’t it? Does pride stand in your way of admitting to God that you’re a bit out of your depth? Proverbs 3:5 NKJ says: ‘…lean not on your own understanding.’ And we’re reminded in Philippians 4:13 NKJ that we can ‘do all things through Christ’. So, when you’re making a decision, firstly you need to recognise that God always knows best. Sounds kinda obvious. But He does. He knows best. Always. The second thing that Solomon does here is ask God for the help he needs. After admitting his inability to do something alone, Solomon asks God to ‘give your servant a discerning heart…’ Ask God for whatever–it–is you need (and to know what you definitely don’t need) to do His will. Asking for discernment to see how God wants you to behave/approach a situation will mean you’re wise in the decisions you make. James 1:5 NIV says, ‘If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God.’ So, turn to God and trust in His provision and wisdom when you’re making decisions today. And tomorrow, too. Why not. Every time you have to make a choice today (we mean every time, starting with your cereal options), pray ‘not my will, but Yours’ beforehand. Just try it. Maybe Jesus doesn’t mind whether you go for cornflakes or muesli, but it’ll build a vital habit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognise any of these symptoms? You get irritated and edgy with people you normally like. You desperately need sleep yet you can’t stop your mind from keeping you awake. You know you need God but you don’t seem to have the time. Ever. Maybe you’re prioritising the wrong things. You’re saying ‘yes’ out of guilt or obligation, and the knock–on effect is saying ‘no’ to something or somebody important. Throughout the Gospels, Jesus didn’t seem to utter a single guilt–ridden ‘yes’. When word got out Jesus had healed Peter’s mother–in–law, a crowd gathered and He ministered to them late into the night. Early the next morning when He slipped away to a quiet place to pray, the disciples went looking for Him. ‘When they found Him, they exclaimed: “Everyone is looking for You!”’ But note Jesus’ response: ‘Let us go somewhere else.’ (Mark 1:38 NIV) He chose to be Spirit–led, not guilt–driven. It’s not up to you to meet every single need out there. Sometimes, it’s right to say ‘no’. If you have difficulty saying ‘no,’ it’s ok to say, ‘Let me pray about it and get back to you.’ Then pray, listen carefully, and make your decision. God wants us to keep a focus on Him, and occasionally we’ll have to leave some things for others, in order to keep following His plan. For the third day running we are advising you spend time with God (we think it’s a good idea, in case you hadn’t got the message just yet). Why not wrap up warm and take a walk outside in silence, without any headphones? Whatever you do, the important thing is intentionally to make the effort to meet with God.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Don't cherish exaggerated ideas of yourself.' Romans 12:3 PHPS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be hard to come by sometimes. You can scroll, flick and click your way through a load of stuff that clogs up your ability to say ‘yes’ to things that are uplifting. Or even world–changing. When we start with God, and get grounded in Him, we have to prepare ourselves to say ‘no’ to what-ever doesn’t match up to Him. Which, in today’s world can be a difficult one. But we’re optimistic. And we like it that way, even when it seems naïve. See, the ‘renewing’ process that we talked about in yesterday’s reading is a process that replaces self–booing thoughts with self–affirming thoughts. Things like being ‘God’s children.’ (Galatians 3:26 NIV) He’s given us the freedom to be free from hypercriticism about ourselves. Here’s a thing: you’re worth dying for. Not because you’ve much worth in yourself but because God loves you. In His eyes, we really, really matter. God wants to use us to make a real difference. The best thing we can do is to head back to June 15 and recall how to ‘take captive’ (2 Corinthians 10:5 NIV) those thoughts that would say otherwise. Which, by the way, shouldn’t end up with us being full of ourselves. No. Knowing who we are in God will mean we’re full of Him; not full of ourselves. We should be ready to point others His way. Ask God to show you how positively He sees you, then make a list of your ten best qualities. (Awkward… but good for you). Keep the list safe as you learn how to use them for Him.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'...Let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth.' 1 John 3:18 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s kick today’s reading off with a bit of a disclaimer: actions aren’t a replacement for words. ‘Cheers W4U, I wondered why nobody was responding to my pointed glaring at the coffee machine; turns out I have to use words too?’ Yeah, pretty much. What we’re getting at is this; today’s verse isn’t sug-gesting we shouldn’t speak love, it’s suggesting that our love should also crank out some actual acts, along with speech. Expressing your love for peo-ple through words is still really important. But if all you ever do is say, ‘I love you,’ and that’s the end of it, then your love hasn’t covered the distance from your mouth to your heart. Let alone got further. Ok then, what stuff can we do that will really make a difference in our world? Jesus gives us some pretty good ideas in Matthew 25:35–36. There, He lists a couple of needs (hunger, thirst, visiting the sick and prisoners) and then tells us how to meet them. In true Jesus–style, it’s stuff we already know but often fail to do. He’s pointing out the obvious and prompting us to do it. Now, your calling might not be to visit people in prison, maybe your calling is to be a friend to that person at school/college/uni/work who doesn’t seem to be included very much. Whatever it is, you can be sure that, if God’s prompting you, He’s giving you the opportunity to act like Jesus, to act in love. Not the wordy type? Your acts can speak as true as any words could—if not more. So, while it may seem a bit of a cliché, perhaps it’s time to ask yourself: WWJD? And to start doing whatever Jesus would do.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'God faithfully keeps His promises.' 1 Corinthians 1:9 GWT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think being a Christian is boring? Check out these headlines. Man in desert discovers burning bush that can’t be extinguished. Sea opens and thousands walk through on dry land. Killer giant downed by teen with slingshot. Jewish girl saves her people from destruction. Three young rebels survive blazing furnace. Man brought back from the dead after four days. City walls mysteriously fall. Preacher swallowed by giant fish and lives to tell the tale. Prophet caught up to Heaven in a fiery chariot. These aren’t from the tabloids; they’re from Scripture. Adventure means ‘exciting and dangerous undertakings’. When you embark on the spiritual adventure Paul mentions, you can expect God to test your faith in ways you never imagined. The Bible talks about those ‘who through faith conquered kingdoms… shut the mouths of lions, quenched the fury of the flames, and escaped the edge of the sword; whose weakness was turned to strength.’ (Hebrews 11:33–34 NIV) Wait, what about when we’re feeling less than adventurous? What about when we just don’t feel like trying to share the Gospel again? Have a read of Hebrews 11, it’s packed full of tales of God’s servants who managed to see past their inadequacies to the promise–filled adventures God had for them. Yes, ‘Adventure is Out There!’— we’ve just got to trust that God is in control and keeps His promises. Have a think of some situations where you’ve waited for the perfect opportunity to share your faith. Ask God to help you to push past your waiting and take steps into the adventure of sharing the Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'We do not wage war as the world does.' 2 Corinthians 10:3 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we feel under attack or threatened, God wants us to call on Him. He doesn’t want us to call our assailant names or switch over to human manipulation. In the surrounding context of today’s verse, Paul is responding to other preachers’ criticism of him: they’ve been saying he’s a dodgy speaker, only brave on paper. Worse, they seem to have been muddying and distorting the Gospel message Paul’s been so painstakingly preaching. Paul’s response? He doesn’t defend himself, or call the competition names, but points to the power of God to fight for His own Gospel, and defend His faithful speakers whilst He’s at it. What if we told you that the weapons we usually use in arguments did more harm than good? That reflex we have on sniping back, or resorting to a personal jibe when someone criticises us, don’t achieve much but wounded souls on both sides (and unfixed problems). So, what about us? Romans 8:9 NIV says we are ‘…not in the realm of the flesh but are in the realm of the Spirit…’ God wants us close enough to reach for Him as our default, not for human weaponry. ‘...pray in the Spirit on all occasions.’ (Ephesians 6:18 NIV) If our response under threat is to ask God to sort things out, He’ll move behind the scenes, and He’ll equip you when you’re challenged. Today, when anyone talks to you, send up a silent, instant prayer: ‘JESUS!’ in your head. In that moment, ask Him to be with you in that, and every conversation. See what difference it makes.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Not My will, but Yours be done.' Luke 22:42 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve all been there; you’re waiting on an answer to prayer, longing for God to step into that tricky situation or relationship. It can get difficult. And we don’t mean ‘can’t get past that level on Candy Crush’ difficult. We mean ‘feeling entirely lost, hurt and broken’ difficult. Real, end–of–the–road broken-ness, the kind of difficult that leaves us with huge questions. Surely God can see you’re not having the best time? Why would He let that happen? Isn’t it about time for a bit of a dramatic movie–style solution, like, giant eagles swooping in to whisk you out of your situation or something? Well, the truth is He can see it, and He is working towards the best possible resolution (it may not include eagles, though, sorry). Psalm 56:8 NLT says, ‘You keep track of all my sorrows. You have collected all my tears in your bottle. You have recorded each one in your book.’ God knows the pain you’re going through. He knows better than anyone how much it hurts to have the people you love turn away from you, He knows the true meaning of sacrifice and He’s massively aware of what it means to suffer loss. But then, why let us go through it all? He’s not oblivious, but He’s also not going to let our pain be pointless. He uses ordinary, broken people all the time in the Bible; just look at the likes of Paul and Peter. So, how’s He going to use your brokenness? We don’t know. Maybe you should ask Him…&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'...I want my share...now...' Luke 15:12 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever eaten your cake before your birthday or sneakily opened a Christmas present the day before? Well, how about having a funeral for someone be-fore they’ve died...? In Jesus’ story of the ‘Prodigal Son’, the antihero of the story asked for his dad’s inheritance while his dad was still fully alive and functional. The inheritance was the father’s identity. So, we’re not talking about a bit of cheek here. We’re actually not even talking about something that was downright rude. By saying, ‘I want my share now,’ the son was making a move on his father’s identity, and really saying, ‘I’m prepared to act as if you’re dead.’ The Prodigal Son’s story starts as the son wipes the father from his mind and heart. The world around us has declared God is dead quite a few times and held more than a few ‘funerals’ for Him. Declaring that we don’t need His morality, that science has removed a need for Him as a reason for the universe, that frankly, ‘He was getting in the way’ of our fun… And here’s the kicker, Christian: we reckon you have too. In fact, in every sin—in every moment of ‘just this once…’—we effectively say to Him: ‘I’m prepared to act as if you’re dead.’ Heavy message today? If Christianity is a relationship with Jesus, then sin is more hurtful than rule–breaking. Have some one–to–one time in that relationship today, a Jesus–coffee–catch-up, a walk, whatever, and talk with Him about those moments you acted as if He wasn’t there. Can you decide to put turning your whole life to Him above them?&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'...he wasted everything he had...' Luke 15:13 GWT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course the father accepted him back. Really the Prodigal Son story is about Him (the character of God we see through the character of the father) and His forgiveness, even when we treat Him like dirt. It’s a story that continues to be played out today by us all. We try to go it alone for whatever reason and reap the consequence. And God accepts us back. You’d think He’d get tired, but this story is one He’s still happy to write in each of our lives. And then, as Christians, we play it out again. We might be saved, but in our still–sinfilled life, the story of the prodigal son haunts us, echoes through our decisions. We damage others. We still get tangled up in hurtful situations and wound others. We waste friendships, we waste the wealth of our new lives in Christ. You might feel like you’ve put wasted hours into friendships, relationships… even into Church... only to see them burned up, even by your own decisions. But. He. Doesn’t. Waste. Anything. Even though the loss is real, God can make beauty from ashes. He makes good use of all that happens. Not only will He welcome you back, hold you in your self–inflicted hurt, but He will also turn the situation around for good. Are there times that have ended in calamity, or times you’ve left others in pain? These things are hard and people aren’t always around to say sorry. Ask God for the calm and stillness that will help you to trust in Him, and to trust that He will make all things turn out for good (Philippians 4:7 and Isaiah 26:3 style).&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'He made us accepted in the Beloved.' Ephesians 1:6 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever sent a friend request on Facebook and regretted it for fear that they’ll hit ignore? ‘It’ll be awkward next time they see me, so they’ll have to accept, right?’ Acceptance can be a tough one. Much of our world today is more about how popular we are and less about who we are. The social media world often measures our worth based on how many Twitter followers we have, how many times our cat meme gets reblogged, or how many likes on our ‘Thanks for the bazillion birthday wishes’ Facebook post. Seeing as Jesus wants you as you are now, not just who you might become some day, you’d think we might want to draw our self–esteem from there. He actually lived out the ‘you’re worth dying for’ concept. Ephesians 1:6 NKJ says, ‘He made us accepted in the Beloved.’ Amazing, so we’re good, yeah? Not quite. God loves us enough to accept us, just as we are. But He loves us too much to leave us just as we are. Titus 2:11–12 NIV says God’s grace ‘teaches us to say “no” to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self–controlled, upright and godly lives.’ We can’t ‘earn’ God’s love, but we can let that love impact the way we do life. We can use that amazing acceptance as a motivation, a life–long well of joy that helps us make God–filled choices. So: text Ephesians 1:6 to a Christian friend today. It might be just what they need to hear.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son.' Romans 8:29 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Elizabethan England, the hot trend in cosmetics was to mix white lead and vinegar together and apply to your face. The problem with this was that it led to lead poisoning. Hygiene wasn’t a big priority either—Queen Elizabeth I reportedly said she had a bath once a month, whether she needed it or not. We’ve luckily moved a long way in cosmetics and sanitation since the 16th century. Every cosmetics brand has its own science lab, and hopefully none of them will be slipping deadly chemicals into your bath or shower gel. Yet despite the sheer volume of stuff out there that promises to make us look good, we all tend to be more insecure than we’d actually like to admit. It’s heart–breaking. Especially when our value just doesn’t change because of what’s on the outside. There’s nothing wrong in (healthily) trying to look good, but not as the be–all and end–all for our self–worth. ‘...because of Christ, we have received an inheritance from God, for He chose us from the beginning, and all things happen just as He decided long ago.’ (Ephesians 1:11 NLT) Jesus loves you, and if you’re a Christian then today’s scripture should remind you of His purpose for you—something He destined you to become before you were even born. That’s really important. And, if you ask, He’ll slowly start to help you see it. When you learn to see yourself as God sees you, confidence soars and purpose roars. It’s what God says that makes the difference. So—if you’re someone who really struggles with how you see yourself, talk to someone. Seriously. Today. Get some support from a trusted member of your church, or family.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'He will lift you up.' James 4:10 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rodney Smith was born in a tent, raised in a travelling community, and never attended a school—not even for one day. Yet, despite the fact his begin-nings weren’t stable or glamorous, God used him to influence the lives of millions around the globe. In 1876, General William Booth (the founder of the Salvation Army) saw potential in this humble man and put him to work as an evangelist. By the time of his death in 1947, he had preached in the United States and Britain for over seventy years. He once said, ‘I didn’t go through your colleges and seminaries. They wouldn’t have me… but I have been to the feet of Jesus where the only true scholarship is learned.’ God loves to lift the humble, the hidden, the obscure: David went from shepherd boy to king; Joseph went from prisoner to prime minister; Abraham went from childless to father of nations. You may feel like a ‘nobody’ right now, but God sees a ‘somebody.’ When the voice within whispers, ‘Who are you? What can you do? You’ll never amount to anything,’ that’s not God. It’s the deceiver, trying to throw you off course. That’s why it’s so important to spend time in prayer, renewing yourself in what God says about you. Mull over these words tonight, before you go to sleep: ‘So humble yourselves under the mighty power of God, and at the right time He will lift you up in honour. Give all your worries and cares to God, for He cares about you.’ (1 Peter 5:6–7 NLT)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

We can get caught by a similar pothole with our minds, actually. Maybe we prioritise Netflix or gaming to a point where we’ve stayed up late, and ‘don’t have time’ to read the Bible. You were designed to check in with God first—everything else is mere add–ons. While day–to–day stuff on your phone may be a proper part of life, it’s really just a secondary bolt–on to the soul–stuff we get from God. It’s a risky business running your phone on 10% charge, hoping your battery doesn’t die before you make it home. But it’s far riskier running your spirit on 10%—time with God re–awakens our lives, enabling us to inhabit the fullness He promises. When we run on low we’re susceptible to damage. Our thoughts can darken, temptation can brighten. We may turn in on ourselves or on others, nit–picking and fault–finding. Tiredness has a way of bringing out the worst in us, whether it’s physical tiredness or spiritual tiredness. When you feel so drained you can’t lift yourself up, tap into prayer–power; let God lift you up. Repair, restoration and re–commissioning all happen in the quiet place. Instead of seeing prayer as an obligation, see it as a vital power–up. Choose a time to turn your phone off and charge it. While it’s charging, spend time in prayer and worship.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Accept one another, then, just as Christ accepted you.' Romans 15:7 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sum of Jesus’ teachings adds up to this: love God, love others. Everything else is a working out of that. Loving God is hard enough—we pick up all kinds of mess and shame along the way, which can warp our picture of Him, if we leave it unattended. But loving others, with their bad attitudes and selfishness and inconsistencies—oh puh–lease! How can you love someone who stabs you in the back and doesn’t seem to think they’ve done anything wrong? How can you like someone who believes stuff you know is wrong? How can you love someone who won’t forgive you but expects you to forgive them? How can you accept someone who lives like they do? We’re all sinners. So maybe the question should be turned around: ‘How can they love someone who lives like you do?’ We are all fallen. We all fail. Our struggles may be different to others, but none of us is perfect. Only Jesus lived a life without sin—and yet He accepts you, despite yours (yes, even your worst and most recent sins). Isn’t the best response to accept others, despite theirs? Jesus said, ‘I give you... freely, so help other people freely.’ (Matthew 10:8 NCV) Live generously with your material stuff, yes, and live generously in spirit with one another. You know that person who you wouldn’t spit on, even if they were on fire? (Be honest.) Ask God to show you how God sees them. Ask God to help you love and accept them. Then, do one encouraging thing for them in the next week.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'The Lord will withhold no good thing from those who do what is right.' Psalm 84:11 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soooo… here we are halfway through 2015. Time to take stock. Feel as though you’ve taken some good steps forward so far? Maybe some of it’s been hard. Know what? Every day is perfect for a fresh start. ‘...His compassions never fail. They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness.’ (Lamentations 3:22–23 NIV) Messed up? God knows. His arms are still wide open. Been hurt? God heals. Every morning He’s waiting with new refreshment, new strength for the day, new compassion. Yet it’s frustrating when you feel like you’ve done your bit, and... nothing. You’ve sent up prayers but nothing’s changed. Still you can be sure of this: God has heard every prayer. Psalm 56:8 NLT goes as far to say, ‘You keep track of all my sorrows. You have collected all my tears in your bottle. You have recorded each one in your book.’ God feels your pain. He meets you in your pain. But He knows why sometimes He gives a ‘yes’, sometimes a ‘wait’, and other times a ‘no’. ‘The Lord will withhold no good thing from those who do what is right.’ (Psalm 84:11 NLT) God hasn’t overlooked you or preferred someone else. ‘And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love Him, who have been called according to His purpose.’ (Romans 8:28 NIV) Leave the hurts of the first half of the year to past history. And now look forward to the rest of 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Let him...boast...that he understands and knows Me.' Jeremiah 9:24 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know what God wants most from you? Not a tally of names you’ve helped convert. Not a list of good deeds you’ve ticked off. Not an in–depth knowl-edge of the Old Testament minor prophets. Nor does He want your songs most, nor your church attendance, nor your good intentions. All of those things are great, but most of all, He wants your friendship. God wants the deepest part of you; the part that defines you: your heart. When everyone is busy doing something for Him, few want to know Him. They’ll talk about Him, write about Him, sing about Him; and yet ignore Him. He wants more than to just be an item on your to–do list or a Sunday obligation or guilty ‘must–pray–more’ feeling in your conscience; He wants you. ‘…pray without ceasing’ (1 Thessalonians 5:17 ESV) means an ongoing dialogue. Friends don’t chat out of obligation; they want to share life together. God wants to share your life; to be right in the centre of involvement, and to share Himself with you: ‘The Lord confides in those who fear Him; He makes His covenant known to them.’ (Psalm 25:14 NIV) Will you get to know Him better by the end of this year? What can you do to help yourself speak and listen to God? Will a journal help? A regular prayer time? A Bible commentary? Make a commitment today, to something of that sort, and write your commitment on paper to remind you.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'God and... the word of His grace... can build you up and give you an inheritance.' Acts 20:32 NIV &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right. Story time: ‘There are these two young fish swimming along and they meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says, “Morning, boys. How’s the water?” And one young fish looks over at the other and goes: “What in the seven seas is water?”’ A similar story was told in a graduation speech by a guy called DF Wallace, who then went on to make his point: that the normal, the everyday, the cli-ché bits of our lives (even clichéd story about fish) can have colossal value that we skip over because we know them so well. Sometimes we have to defend the value of the totally obvious to ourselves. How much more so with God’s grace—the everyday truth of our lives that we can’t always see? God’s grace simply means God giving us more of Him-self than we have any right to. For our day’s work. For the work of talking to other people about Jesus. For our hearts and their emotional well–being. For the people around us. For our healing. For their healing. God will always give us more of Himself than we hope or deserve. He wants to ‘build you up and give you an inheritance.’ We forget this. The worship songs get over–learned and the sermons get stale unless we remind ourselves, even daily. You are not just a spring of God’s grace that pops up in a desert—you’re part of God’s great river of grace, rushing through history, carrying every believer. He’s our water. And He wants to flow through us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alrighty, then. Inheritance, me hearties. Rolling in gold dubloons as diamonds tinkle down the marble steps of our multi–floored mansions. Sorry! Let that idea be marooned on a desert island while we look at what Jesus had to say about our inheritance. ‘In My Father’s house are many rooms. If it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you? And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to Myself, that where I am you may be also.’ (John 14:1–3 ESV) In Jesus’ time, guests would be ‘received’ in a room by their host. But if there were too many guests, and not enough rooms, the guests would be turned away and the host would never get around to welcoming them. Jesus’ words in the verses above are a great comfort—they are often spoken at funerals and deathbeds, and not without reason. They’re our inheri-tance as Christians. Simply: ‘where I (God) am, you will be.’ You won’t be turned away and He won’t have too little time to get round to you. It should build you up today, too. God’s warm welcome is part of the everyday that you can’t always see. This is the gift passed down to you from our Father—you are never alone, never abandoned even in a seeming absence. Your hospitality is part of how other people see God’s welcome. Welcome someone into your home and make them a meal—preferably someone you don’t know greatly (but trust to invite over!) If you don’t live by yourself, spend some time planning how you might make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'He couldn't do any miracles among them...And He was amazed at their unbelief.' Mark 6:5-6 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, God does what’s best for us, despite our lack of faith (and praise Him for intervening, regardless!) But, most times He also wants to involve us. He wants to work in and through us to bring His kingdom to earth. Great stuff and a MASSIVE privilege. Except for the flipside… This means there are times when He seems to answer prayer in a manner directly related to our level of faith. Our almighty God, our universe–creating King–of–Heaven sometimes limits Himself, deliberately. When we’re living out of little faith, or even unbelief, God may re-strict Himself from doing everything He could do. Jesus has no trouble healing crowds, multiplying packed lunches, and raising the dead in front of masses who were open to letting Him do His thing. Yet to a group who knew Him from when He was growing up—‘Isn’t this the carpenter? Isn’t this Mary’s son and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas and Simon?’—who ‘took offence at Him’ (Mark 6:3 NIV), Jesus ‘could not do any miracles there, except lay His hands on a few sick people and heal them.’ (Mark 6:5 NIV) What? Jesus couldn’t do something? Huh? Doesn’t sound like the Jesus we know, does it? But it shows the importance of the part God wants us to play—being open to Him, to working with Him to bring healing, and bring His Kingdom. It matters to God that we’re part of His Kingdom–bringing plan. Today, make a hole in your plans to read Mark 1–6 in your Bible. As you read, challenge yourself: am I open to God moving like this in my life?&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'You will forget your trouble...as water gone by.' Job 11:16 NCV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the times God works on our character and faith. There’s nothing like a long wait to work on our patience. Or overwhelming odds to stretch our faith. Even when it feels never–ending, ‘You will forget your misery; it will be like water flowing away.’ (Job 11:16 ESV) Forgetting doesn’t mean losing a block of memory. It means reaching the point where the memory is free of pain, just as poison is pulled from a snake bite. As healing begins, the mind’s continual replay of the event reduces and the memory becomes like ‘water gone by’. And so the King James Version has a phrase, often used, which is loaded with meaning: ‘And it came to pass.’ It speaks of a profound truth: life doesn’t stand still. There will always be challenges, but no matter how bad things look, the phrase is, ‘It came to pass’, not ‘It came to stay’. There will be times when your life feels like a rollercoaster car reeling off the tracks. But there’s good news: we can submit our troubles under God’s authority, and they will pass. Kristin Armstrong says: ‘When someone died in Old Testament times, those...in mourning marked their faces with ashes. They allotted a specified sea-son, after which they scrubbed up and moved on... [But] we’re so busy hiding, we’re buried under ashes on the inside. God will call us to arise and shine when our light has come (Isaiah 60:1). Ask Him to set your time limit, and be ready to wash your face.’ Then, whatever your grief is—over the death of a person or a relationship—move on.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'God...told His people...&quot;Let the weary rest.&quot;' Isaiah 28:12 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not like Elijah’s prayer life has died, nor has he committed some terrible sin. Far from it—he’s been on the frontline of God’s purpose. His faith is bold and exemplary. It’s just that he’s tired. Exhausted, in fact. He’s been running from one spiritual battle to another and now his body is fatigued. His mind is drained, his spirit worn out. When you’ve been running on adrenalin your body and mind eventually have to play ‘catch up’. For Elijah, there’s no exclusive spa to recuperate in. And so, after defeating hundreds of prophets of the bloodthirsty god Baal, he runs away, crawls under a tree in the hot sun and asks to die. (1 Kings 19:4) A bit dramatic? When we’re bone weary, our minds can lose perspective completely. At times like this, we need to stop. Completely. Elijah crawls to a quiet place and bares his soul. In the quiet place he finds God. And you can too. ‘Jesus said... “Come to Me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. ...I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls... My yoke is easy and My burden is light.”’ (Matthew 11:25–30 NIV) What’s all that about, then? If you’re feeling burned out, your ability to appreciate life and make the most of opportunities will seem to fade. Does that resonate? Come to God before you get worn down completely. Take yourself to a quiet place and read about Elijah’s fatigue in 1 Kings 19. Follow it up with a time of soul–baring prayer.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Be still, and know that I am God.' Psalm 46:10 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Athletes train to excel—pushing the limits of what their bodies can usually handle. Yet one twinge of a hamstring and they’re on red alert. Not stopping to heal means that they’ll face greater damage down the line. Psalm 46:10 is our warning for spiritual hamstring tweaks: ‘Be still, and know that I am God.’ The temptation is to do more or do it faster; this is the ‘distraction’ deceit—it keeps us going for the time being, but somewhere down the track we are going to pull up in pain. Jesus never said, ‘Keep going, it’s like a stitch, eventually you’ll run it off.’ No, He said, ‘Come to Me, all of you who are weary and carry heavy burdens, and I will give you rest.’ (Matthew 11:28 NLT) If you think you can take it into your own hands and recharge yourself, think again. ‘Jesus said, “I am the Vine; you are the branches. Those who remain in Me, and I in them, will produce much fruit. For apart from Me you can do nothing.”’ (John 15:5 NLT) If we want to do anything well, we need to prioritise time with the Father, Son and Spirit. Why? It’ll not only help you to be more effective as a well–rested worker, but also help you to step outside of the thick of life to get a better perspective and appreciate all you have. Matthew 6:33 NIV says: ‘...seek first His Kingdom.’ When you ‘come near to God…He will come near to you.’ (James 4:8 NIV) Fit in a rest period today to recoup your strength. Even if it’s just five minutes. Say: ‘God, I am seeking You and Your Kingdom first,’ then sit for a while in quiet and stillness.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Above all else, guard your heart.' Proverbs 4:23 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s hit the ground running from yesterday’s reading: some thoughts are easier to keep out than others. We all need help in different areas. But here’s something we can all agree on: doubt can feel like a killer, right? Just as we’re starting to keep our minds close to God, we feel the carpet sliding out from under our feet. Did. You. Know. That God’s hold on us isn’t loosened every time we have a back–and–forth with ourselves over His love for us? Or even His existence. Clearly it’s good to have a sense of security but, during those times/nights/philosophy lessons where we’re not so sure, He’s right there. How does this link to today’s verse? Like this: God can and does guard us even when we don’t feel safe ourselves. Best way to deplete the enemy’s chance of shoulder–barging us off course? Don’t rely on yourself to keep your faith; being saved by faith is a ‘gift of God.’ (Ephesians 2:8 NIV) When we’re going through times of doubt, it’s probably best not to wholly rely on ourselves (or even other well–meaning folk) reassuring us that God is with us. Simply ask God for faith in Him. And, just as brilliantly, God has ‘bought at a price’ (1 Corinthians 6:20 NKJ) the rights to every part of us: including our minds. Present it back to Him, and He’ll take the lead. Be honest with God—what do you struggle to believe? Pray about it, ask Him to settle your mind, then find a wiser–older Christian to discuss those things with at some point this week.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'For we are God's handiwork.' Ephesians 2:10 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recap: your mind matters. In case you hadn’t picked up on it by now, it’s a serious business, this whole does–God–have–the–keys–to–my–mind chat. And, truth be told, we need to be aware there’s a spiritual war going on around (and within) us. Sometimes, it can feel like we’re torn in two directions: to stay faithful to God’s thoughts on us, or to leave room for doubts. Know what we mean? We’ve all been there at some points, whether it’s gos-sip/lust/anger/whatever. To add to the list, there’s an especially damaging item: self–negativity. Making mistakes can result in pointing a steady blame–finger at ourselves. And in lots of cases, it stays there. Most of us have experienced it in some way; if you’ve been on the receiving end of your internal blame–voice, rational or not, it’s not a good idea. Why? Jesus is all about peace. We have to let God clear the path for us to know we’ve been forgiven. Jesus is keen for us to know peace, and not ‘as the world gives.’ (John 14:27 NIV) How do we let that forgiven–and–free peace in (especially when we’ve settled into a negative pattern of thought toward ourselves)? It’s a process of turning back. Most likely not an overnight one, but a process that takes long enough to learn how God sees us as ‘handiwork’, completely covered by Him. The ‘renewing of your mind’ (Romans 12:2 NIV) is a process that only God can work in us. Have a time of prayer right now, asking God not only to renew your internal voice but to settle only the peace Christ can bring in you.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Hard work brings a profit.' Proverbs 14:23 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the Proverbs seem like they state the obvious. To paraphrase a few: laziness is bad, wisdom is good, lust isn’t a great idea. Today’s verse seems to be no exception: working hard does have its rewards. But are we missing something if we gloss over it? First off, why are we encouraged to work? Didn’t God’s original plan include us idling about in Eden all day, before the Fall happened? Genesis 2:15 tells us that God put Adam to work pretty much straight away, taking care of the whole Garden—hardly a minor responsibility. But then we jump back even further and we see that God Himself sets the pace for a hard–working attitude in the first chapter of the Bible: six days of work, one day of rest. If we’re made in His image, it follows that we’re also designed with a strong work ethic in mind. So what’s our work for? And why should we care about a profit? Colossians 3:23 says, ‘Work willingly at whatever you do, as though you were working for the Lord and not for people.’ Why? Because, the next verse says, your reward will come from Him. The profit might not look like a whopping annual bonus or a holiday home on a Barrier Reef island. More than likely it’ll last a little longer, satisfy a lot deeper, and benefit not only you but those around you. What task today are you not looking forward to? (Either because it’s hard, or boring… both can be daunting). Decide that you’ll ‘Pray Continually’ through it today, that God would give you new vision and passion to work for Him.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'I have finished the work You gave Me.' John 17:4 GNT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever feel like your life is a constant attempt to suppress a growing to–do list? No specific task, but a hazy mixture of work/study/church/you–name–it commitments swim around your head (especially when you’re trying to sleep?) Without wanting to sound too much like a self–help thing: sometimes, less is more. Yup. Jesus sets the best example of this: ‘He departed again to the mountain by Himself alone.’ (John 6:15 NKJ) Hmmm: ‘Again’. Flicking through the Gospels, it becomes apparent that Jesus is busier than any of us. But ‘again’, He’s trekking back up the mountainside to simply hit pause. Why, then? Well, rather than panicking about the sheer number of people desperate for His attention, Jesus left every detail of His life open to His Father’s will. He left the book of His life open for His Father to write. In John 17, Jesus was coming toward the end of His time with the disciples. He says this: ‘I have brought You glory on earth by finishing the work You gave Me to do.’ (John 17:4 NIV) That’s all that matters. When we feel like there are a thousand different voices pulling us in different directions, we need to take a leaf out of Jesus’ book and make sure God’s voice is the loudest. To keep a focus on what really matters, some voices/responsibilities might need to quieten down. And others will need to go. Jot down all of your responsibilities, whether they’re weekly/monthly/daily. Bring them to God in prayer. What might He want you to get stuck into more, and which ones might need to step aside?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'I must be about My Father's business.' Luke 2:49 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s really, really easy to slip into claiming the fame/honour/glory that’s meant for God for ourselves. It’s not always a conscious effort. In fact, the most dangerous can be the little thoughts that find their way into our actions: ‘Saying these wise words will make me seem like more mature than you’ or ‘Giving this time will make me look like a good Christian in (insert boss or friend’s name) eyes’… Instead of showing God off, we’re throwing fertiliser on our own pride. So, what to do? As Christians, Jesus has paid the price for our freedom, so we’re His. In Galatians 2:20 NIV, Paul goes as far to say that ‘I no longer live, but Christ lives in me.’ As God’s representatives (or ‘ambassadors’, 2 Corinthians 5:20) on earth, that’s far more motivation to reflect praise back at Him (or, where applicable, avoid creating situations that weren’t meant for His praise.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s make sure people are getting a glimpse of God in us, not just… us. Jesus had this nailed down from an early age. At twelve years old, He said, ‘I must be about My Father’s business.’ (Luke 2:49 KJV) Sounds fairly posh, but essentially He didn’t come to this world to do anything but make God known. And likewise, our work, play, study, you–name–it, is all His. Even our ‘work’–times can be used for God. No excuses. Wherever you are, what can you make a habit of doing that will help others see God in you?&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'All of you together are the temple.' 1 Corinthians 3:16 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the vintage days, the Romans had some sweet battle tactics. Each soldier’s shield had a hook to attach it to the next guy’s. You move, they move. Like it or not, everyone fought with, and for, their entire line. Church? That’s a similar deal. Paul made a point of getting us to share our lives with our ‘fellow workers’ (Romans 16:3 NKJ). Why should we look out for people that we might have only met in the Sunday coffee area once or twice, then? Look back to today’s verse. The Church, is where God dwells. We reckon engaging with a couple of things will strengthen our relationships with/ increase our engagement with the Church. Tell people what things you like about them. Simple stuff. God–honouring things. Just tell them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Thessalonians 5:11 ESV says ‘Therefore encourage one another and build one another up…’ We think it’s worth doing. Asking God to bless people. Ever had a spontaneous prayer session? The ones where you’re so keen to see God–breathed change that you didn’t need an organised meeting or conference to seek God together? Brilliant. Now do it again. And, here’s some extra news: God is always ‘near to all who call on Him.’ (Psalm 145:18 ESV) He listens. Do you struggle to think of a way to un–awkwardly approach all of those people and have a simple interaction? Pick one positive thing out about someone you know. Go tell ’em.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'...take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.' 2 Corinthians 10:5 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your mind’s a pretty big door into your life. How you think about God/parents/friends/anyone, and what you do about them, is rooted in what you let in and out of your mind. What else? Well, it’s a conscious battle to keep ourselves in check; to let God always have the first and last words (and everything in between) in our internal conversations. Paul writes this: ‘take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.’ (2 Corinthians 10:5 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So… this means that when you’re tempted by negativity, it’s not wise to let it run its course (back–chat a little, or let that not–quite–appropriate lustful thought stick about) and then put it behind you before it affects your Christian life. You might think, ‘What’s the harm?’ Well, actually, the harm is all over it. In Matthew 5:27–30, Jesus explains that even teeny–tiny lustful thoughts are no different to adultery. Just before that in Matthew 5:21–26, He mentions that hating someone is effectively murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving small thoughts free to linger is dangerous because of where they are heading... far away from God. Soooo. Stop thinking altogether? …Not that either. When you’re spending time with God, you’ll get to know what He does and doesn’t enjoy. And so, when we find ourselves slipping into thoughts that don’t match His will, we have to ask ‘is this what God wants for me?’ By doing that, we’re taking it captive. Thoughts might find their way in, but when they’re met with Jesus, they have to bow to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, bow every time you catch yourself thinking something Jesus wouldn’t and hand the thought to Him.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'They will be won over by observing your...lives.' 1 Peter 3:1-2 NLT &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not without controversy. Is it ok to get into a relationship with someone who doesn’t know Jesus? The Bible’s a good place to start, but unfortunately, different people read the relevant verses differently. ‘A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to be mar-ried to whom she wishes, only in the Lord.’ (1 Corinthians 7:39 ESV) Does the new husband have to be a Christian? Or does ‘in the Lord’ mean that the marriage itself is to be a God–honouring one? But: how can you possibly honour God with a marriage that doesn’t put Him at the centre of it? Other verses, about being ‘unequally yoked together’ (2 Corinthians 6:14 KJV) are also brought up to help work it out... but also questioned. Confusing. Practically speaking, it’s not easy. An old preacher put it bluntly: ‘Any time a child of God marries a child of the devil, they’re going to have trouble with their father–in–law.’ Any relationship without the foundation of both people trusting in God will run into tension whenever ‘trusting God for money/the future/guidance’ comes up. But that in itself doesn’t mean that God forbids them. It probably comes down to a question: ‘Is this relationship leading me towards God, and His things (going to church, reading your Bible, prayer)?’ Relationship review. Are your relationships leading you towards, or away from God? Sidenote time: If you’re already married to someone who doesn’t share your beliefs, this is NOT a call to divorce (see 1 Corinthians 7:12–14). If however your relationships are leading you away from God, what can you change today, to sort that out?&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Many waters cannot quench love.' Song of Solomon 8:7 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tricky part of any romantic relationship (and some awkward friendships...) is the confusion between love and desire. Love is the act of will to make space for the other person, to give out, to help. Desire is the wish to consume, to take in, to look out for the next meal. Sure, they can overlap—it’s fine, for example, to want a marriageable partner for yourself if you’re unmarried—but they often feel like a pull in opposite directions. It’s hard because desire can come as a rush of feeling. But without love, desire turns into sheer animal want—it increases while the pleasure it seeks out decreases. And as it grows, so CS Lewis said in The Screwtape Letters, ‘the sooner it must eat up all the innocent sources of pleasure and pass on to those God forbids.’ Love—that willpower to be responsive to each other’s needs, to put aside our own selfishness in order to serve the other, that quick forgiveness and slow remembrance of wrongs—sets things straight. It gives desire the right scaffolding to hang from: seeking the other person’s best before your own. When it’s the backbone, nothing can break that relationship. It outlives desire, carrying on wanting and working for the other person’s best when romantic love passes. (And, y’know, other loves too—friendships live and die on these same principles.) Ok, so this might be a touch English Lit, but Shakespeare’s sonnet number 116 expresses today’s ideas well. Reflect on this: ‘Love is not love which alters when it alteration finds.’ Which is just a different way of saying what Paul said in 1 Corinthians 13:6–8 NIV, ‘Love... always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.’&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'...Nor are your ways My ways.' Isaiah 55:8 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘The Lord works in mysterious ways’ is not just a cop–out used when Christians are confronted with difficult questions. Sure it has been used like that when people don’t know what else to say, but there’s still truth in it. We don’t have all the answers or know God’s thoughts. Moses didn’t either. He was told by God he’d lead the Israelites out of slavery. Great; he’d be a hero then. He’d be God’s mouthpiece and convince Pharaoh to free the slaves and life would be grand. Is this what happens? Nope. He speaks to Pharaoh and lands the Israelites in worse trouble. But then he frees them… and, well, the Red Sea episode was definitely not how he expected his prayers to be answered. God doesn’t give up on His plans for us when they seem to hit a roadblock. Most of the time you’ll find His plans aren’t off track. Our expectations are. Sometimes we think our lives are so mundane or so off–course that it can’t be what God had planned. Feel like that? You’re not the only one. Seriously, scan the Bible, there are loads of people who’ve felt it. But God doesn’t miss things. When Joseph was sold and imprisoned and his life seemed out of control, God was at work. When Daniel was taken as a captive to Babylon and his life seemed out of control, God was at work. When Mary was told she’d have a baby who would be born to save the world and her life seemed out of control, God was at work. So we’d say trust Him, whether that’s through boredom, or even through pain.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Go in the strength you have...Am I not sending you?' Judges 6:14 NIV &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gideon is the ultimate reluctant hero; timid, indecisive, full of doubts. Whereas the modern Hollywood action hero shoots first and then thinks later, Gideon puts out a woollen fleece and goes to sleep. Getting the exact answer he asked God for (dew on the fleece with dry ground around about it), he hesitates and asks for the reverse. (Judges 6:36–40) Although Gideon was plagued with self–doubt and hesitancy, his story is one of a massive win. Gideon teaches us that God’s idea of wimps and warriors is anti–Hollywood. Unlike the movie action hero, Gideon had no previous secret service training. He had no training at all, in fact. He wasn’t a seasoned fighter—the only thing he had going for him was God. And what more do you need? Don’t let the odds scare you. Don’t even let reason and logic shout you down. Don’t be intimidated by the size of the job—you have God. ‘With God’s power working in us, God can do much, much more than anything we can ask or imagine.’ (Ephesians 3:20 NCV) Only one opinion matters—God’s. And He told Gideon, ‘Go in the strength you have and save Israel…Am I not sending you?’ (Judges 6:14 NIV) The strength of the Sender, not the weaknesses of the sent, is what saves the day. Read more about the adventures of Gideon in the book of Judges. See what tips you can pick up from how Gideon learned to deal with his uncertainties.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Where your treasure is... there your heart will be also.' Matthew 6:21 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would Jesus think about the absolute retail madness that ensues leading up to Christmas and at the Boxing Day sales or as the end of the financial year approaches? Well, there’s nothing in the Gospels about maxing your credit card on ‘buy 1, get 1 free’ department store deals, but there’s plenty in there on the state of our hearts. Luke 18 tells the tale of Jesus and the rich young ruler. This guy has the lot—but the lot isn’t enough. And so he asks Jesus for the secret of eternal life. Jesus tells him: ‘Sell all you have and give the money to the poor, and you will have riches in Heaven; then come and follow Me.’ (Luke 18:22 GNT) This story reminds us that wealth, power, reputation, and even human desire cannot bring us spiritual salvation (Luke 18:27), it’s only possible by God’s free gift of grace through Christ. Jesus does care about our needs, but he’s primarily interested in the condition of our hearts. So, we need to assess those hearts. Would we give Him all? Would we be prepared to sell everything? Will we give Him our ambitions? Instead of fo-cussing our tunnel–vision on building a career, will we seek to (without glory, without salary) to build His Kingdom? Will we give Him all of our lives, not just our Sunday mornings? Jesus said, ‘Where your treasure is…there your heart will be also.’ Your ‘treasure’ can be material stuff, relationships, a career, an identity, or even comfort. Where’s Jesus in your list of priorities? Re–shuffle this list in order of priority: career, relationship, free–time, church, education, money, recognition, friends, prayer time, food, hobbies, holiday, Bible reading, family, ambition, Jesus. Be honest: what needs to change?&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ.' Philippians 3:8 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul was the super–rigorous, righteously religious poster–boy of the Jewish world. He ticked all of the traditional holiness achievements, and had an impeccable Jewish family bloodline to boot. Then he met Jesus. And he realised that his achievements, his acclaim, his heritage all meant diddly squat compared to the worth that Jesus gave to Him for free. It’s the same for you. None of your world–approved achievements, your church–elder father and grandfather, or your killer Bible knowledge, count to-wards any of your worth once you have God. And, on the beautifully providential flipside, none of your failures, your actually–not–so–together family, or the fact that you don’t know where the book of Zephaniah is, mean that you’re worth any less. Because you have been given the gift of Jesus, you share in His worth, His beauty, and His power. You are precious, and are now able to be made righteous, simply by believing in Christ alone. And that’s flipping huge. Attitude–flipping, perspective–flipping, behaviour–flipping huge! Whatever the world (and even, sometimes, the Church) would consider a massive achievement, or a massive failure, doesn’t make any difference to your God–given ability or value. The only One who does that is Jesus. And, regardless of your worldly situation, He makes you capable of shaking the globe, of changing lives, and of being a part of love–filled revolutions in His name. So go get ’em. Change the world. We’re serious. Believe what you’ve just read above, and live it out. Start today by taking one step, no matter how small, towards changing something that hurts your heart about this world. Trust the power, and responsibility, that Jesus has given to you.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Unless the Lord builds the house...' Psalm 127:1 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you’ll marry, maybe you won’t. Maybe the idea fills you with joy and sepia–filter dreams of dresses and confetti, maybe it fills you with deep un-ease at sharing everything (and everything you are) with another person, for the rest of your life. Maybe you’ve no idea what we’re on about, and would rather go and run around outside. But most of us have experienced glancing over at someone attractive and wanting to spend a bit of ‘quality time’ with them… So what about this ‘Marriage’ thing then? Shall we have a chat? Get comfy. The first and, by now pretty obvious, bit of wisdom we have for you is the same as we have for every other thing in life: start with Jesus. Put God in charge of your relationships, even (especially) if that’s marriage or marriage–plans, and you won’t go far wrong. (Keeping Him there can be hard work, but is essential). With closeness to God, grace, peace, and selfless love begin to adorn our lives. The Bible’s got some real smarts on how to love and live for other people, which are pretty useful for this whole relating business, whether that’s in looking for/maintaining relationships with life–partners, friends or, well, anyone (y’know, those billions of neighbours Jesus reckons we’ve got). We’ll be looking at some of these over the next few days, and getting wise to some of the threats and solutions might make for stronger love–lives all round. Love–ly.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'The wise have wealth and luxury...' Proverbs 21:20 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any emotional baggage we’re carrying about friendships and relationships gets more intense as we get closer to someone. Wherever you’re at, with mates or marriages, there’s wisdom here we reckon applies to you. Money strains relationships. Whether it was your best friend at kindy or your bestie now, things can be going great until one of you points at a pile of sweet stuff and declares ‘it’s all mine’. A signpost as to how far the world’s idea of marriage has strayed from God’s view is the existence of prenuptial agreements. There’s a step you take when you get married, where everything you have becomes each other’s. But even if we didn’t look at dividing stuff within a relationship, all the money-worries you can face in life (‘Can I afford this?’ ‘How will I pay that bill?’ ‘What will happen if I don’t get that job?’) get shared, and risk getting magnified. You’ll have seen it, we’re sure: two people, both stressed, winding each other right up, until a tough situation feels crushingly impossible. So what to do? Again, keep Jesus at the centre of your life. Money isn’t a safe place for your trust. If it’s getting the most attention in your relationship and not God, it’s time for your priorities to change. It’s tough, but striking that balance between being a ‘good steward’ of what God gives you, and not putting your trust in it above your trust in Him, is well worth striving for. And it’s worth remembering that He doesn’t bless you so you can have ‘wealth and luxury’ (Proverbs 21:20 NLT) for yourself: He blesses you so you can bless others.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Marriage should be honoured...for God will judge the adulterer and...the...immoral.' Hebrews 13:4 NIV &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tend to think of love as a feeling. But love is really an act of our will. Sometimes, we’re not in that happy–place of ‘feeling’ loving toward our family members or friends or spouses. That happens, it’s normal. In those moments, you can ‘love’ someone through a decision to put them first. It’s true, even if you’re not quite ‘feeling’ you even like them at that exact moment. Great. But it works another way too. Sometimes, even after you’ve committed to someone, a bright–sparkly new someone walks past with a cute smile, and your heart begins to wonder (and wander) after them instead. Unfortunately this is not unusual, but normal. In that moment, your commitment should be a decision to not smile back, to not entertain the thought–train that pops into your mind... a strong, self–imposed NO. STOP. In a culture that doesn’t seem to value commitment, we’ve been told that ‘how I feel’ in that moment is what’s important. That’s a recipe for a life of not–really–ever trusting anyone, or knowing the intimacy that God designed relationships to contain. Bad news: our feelings aren’t always trustworthy. Sometimes our feelings of love need to be topped up with will–power. (Some more advice. Not every relationship is right. Also normal. Use that same will–power to assess if a relationship is right and healthy for you both, rather than feeling trapped by expectations.) Read 2 Corinthians 10:5. Take a few minutes to consider what ‘taking captive a thought’ might look like for you. How could you present such a captive thought to God so He can deal with it for you?&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Friend, do what you came to do.' Matthew 26:50 NCV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whip out the placards. Strike up the marching bands. Get some rubber tyres burning. Today, we’re looking at Matthew 18, where Jesus says that if people don’t repent, then they should be treated ‘like a pagan or a tax collector’. That’s Matthew 18:15–17. Read that, then get crafting those hateful signs and flags. Back? Good. Before we start the pagan purge, it’s worth looking up what Jesus meant by treating someone ‘like a pagan or a tax collector’. Ok, they were the lowest life-form as far as the Jews were concerned. But funnily enough, whenever we see Jesus interacting with any sinners, pagans or tax collectors, it doesn’t look anything like today’s public protests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus shows each sinner He meets a soft heart and honest care. When He came across someone who He disagreed with, ‘&lt;em&gt;Jesus, looking at him, loved him&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Mark 10:21 ESV) When He met an outcast tax collector, He told him: ‘&lt;em&gt;I must stay at your house today&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Luke 19:5 NIV) When Judas, His betrayer, sold Him out, He called him ‘&lt;em&gt;friend&lt;/em&gt;’ (Matthew 26:50). He wasn’t pretending they weren’t sinners. But He loved them to the point of spending so much time with them that others thought He was just as drunk and sinful as them. He didn’t care that others saw Him as naïve or mistaken—everything He did was to show sinners a way to a restored connection with the Father. What would Jesus have you do and say regarding the unrepentant, ‘least–worthy’ person you know? Make a mini placard that bears His message of love to them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Friends sharpen the minds of each other.' Proverbs 27:17 CEV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Samuel 18 has two strong friends performing an ancient covenant ritual. This was a bit like playground ‘blood brothers’, but much more serious—a promise to cover the other person’s back until death. ‘&lt;em&gt;After David had finished talking with Saul, he met Jonathan, the king’s son. There was an immediate bond between them…Jonathan made a solemn pact with David, because he loved him as he loved himself. Jonathan sealed the pact by taking off his robe and giving it to David, together with his tunic, sword, bow and belt&lt;/em&gt;.’ (1 Samuel 18:1–4 NLT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a peculiar bit of Bible passage, isn’t it? Why would Jonathan go to those (probably fairly chilly) extremes to prove his friendship—what’s wrong with a coffee and a chat? Jonathan does something humble and costly by making a covenant with David. He’s the king’s son and heir to the throne. By handing over his tunic, sword and belt, he symbolises giving up his inheritance to David. Jonathan is dressing David to be the next king. &lt;em&gt;Wow&lt;/em&gt;. The highest form of friendship puts others before ourselves. Do you want the best for your mate or do you secretly, even mentally, one–up them, so you have the higher status? Do you give up the things that you’ve been privileged with for your friends’ sakes? 1 Corinthians 13:4–5 NLT tells us, ‘…&lt;em&gt;Love is patient and kind... not jealous or boastful or proud or rude. It does not demand its own way. It is not irritable, and it keeps no record of being wronged.&lt;/em&gt;’ Every time you ‘covet’ something today, do a good deed for the person whose stuff you’ve wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Two people are better off than one.' Ecclesiastes 4:9 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, maybe we’re risking getting a little primary school here, but we reckon it’s worth it. We don’t care how old you are, the whole making friends thing is always relevant. It doesn’t really get any easier, does it? Whenever we hit a new stage in our life, we can find ourselves feeling that familiar ‘how do I make friends?’ feeling. So here’s some practical tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, try talking. Practice really does make perfect. Don’t worry about being witty and original—just try speaking. This will build your confidence as well as allowing others an opportunity to get to know you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, learn to listen. You don’t have to have a life–or–death story of ‘How I scaled Everest without an inhaler’ for people to want to talk to you. Actually people generally love talking about themselves so, by listening, you give them a chance to be centre stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, have the courage to be you. Don’t apologise for the lame bands you like or pretend to be the ‘life and soul’ if you’re more happy with a quiet coffee and a chat. You’re a masterpiece in God’s eyes (even if there’s a bit of spiritual renovation still to go). And finally, choose your friends. There will always be cliques and tribes who think everyone should know their place (yawn). But there will also be those not bothered about ‘who’s in’ and ‘who’s out’. People who won’t judge you are going to make better friends anyway. So, thank God for the people around you. If you feel like there’s something missing for you, people–wise, ask God to fill that gap somehow. He put you together and He not only knows you need friendships, but what sort as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Best Friends For Life&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'He will give you the mighty inner strengthening of His Holy Spirit.' Ephesians 3:16 TLB&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author Edith Schaeffer came up with the idea that Heaven’s museum has two exhibits. In the first one there’s a display of Satan’s weapons, his trials and torments thrown against God’s people. They’re in pieces—broken when God miraculously stepped in. The second shows Satan’s weapons broken when believers couldn’t see God in their situation but trusted He was good anyway, and so they overcame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collapsing beneath the weight of everything around you? Just about done with your secrets, failures and weaknesses? And, worst of all, does it feel like God isn’t going to show up to help? If you’re the sort of person who seems to see God miraculously moving in everyone else’s life, but gets frustrated at the silence in your own, there absolutely is something for you, too. There is no worse–off Christian ‘class’ that gets less than others. God promises strength for you, a mighty inner strength that comes from above and girds your heart with iron. You’ve got the Holy Spirit in there already, so it’s a case of praying to Someone closer than close. Meditating on God’s Word can be a useful prayer–tool for that. Meditating isn’t a spooky other–world–y thing—it’s simply slowly down and actively looking at what God said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good way to meditate is to go through these five steps: &lt;em&gt;Pause&lt;/em&gt; (slow down and think deeply about what Scripture you’re reading), &lt;em&gt;Presence&lt;/em&gt; (acknowledge God is present, speaking to you through His Word), &lt;em&gt;Perspective&lt;/em&gt; (what did it mean to those it was originally written to), &lt;em&gt;Ponder&lt;/em&gt; (how does it apply to your life?) and &lt;em&gt;Promise&lt;/em&gt; (take away a promise from God for your life.)

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'We share in His sufferings...that we may also share in His glory.' Romans 8:17 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who wouldn’t want to follow Christ? He is the Way, the Truth and Life. He is the bridge between you and eternity. He has your healing in His hand and forgiveness for your wrong. He has your purpose, meaning and direction. He is light in your darkness. He is love hanging on a cross. He knows you and loves you with a perfect love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True. And some of us have got the idea that all He expects in return is for us to relax in His grace and wait until our number is called for Heaven. Right? Wrong. If you’re thinking God owes you, you’d best read your Bible. God’s goal for you isn’t comfort; it’s Christ–like–ness. And to head in that direction, you’ll have to experience some of the stuff Jesus did—like being misunderstood or betrayed or facing rejection. Basically, it isn’t an easy ride. Jesus said, ‘&lt;em&gt;If anyone would come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross&lt;/em&gt;…’ (Matthew 16:24 ESV) God’s goal isn’t comfort. Still want to follow Him? To be Christ–like in this broken world will take some serious, deep, re–moulding of us. If you want the good stuff you’ve got to take the tough stuff. Remember: ‘&lt;em&gt;We share in His suffering…that we may also share in His glory&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Romans 8:17 NIV) God wants to get you out of your comfort zone so the only place you’ll be comfortable is in Him.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'The Lord has hidden Himself...but I trust Him.' Isaiah 8:17 GNT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time being part of God’s family all seemed so simple. Heart ascending a ladder to Heaven during worship. Bible verses leaping from the pages. Prayer was a spine–tingling soul–stirring experience. But then... one day the songs all sounded the same, the Bible was tougher than trigonometry, and prayers seemed to bounce off the ceiling. What happened? Did you sin once too often? Did God have a huff? Are you not singing loud enough? God isn’t a tease. He doesn’t ditch you when a better offer comes His way. Nor does He drop the whole ‘would have died for you if you were the only human on earth’ thing because your Bible reading has gone skewiff. Sometimes it may feel like God has hidden Himself for a while. No, He isn’t playing at cosmic peek-a-boo; He’s working on your maturity. He’s not even playing a ‘long game’ of chess, with you as a piece. This is about Him being yours, and you being His, in the very best way. God wants to grow us into people who are more interested in being with Him than in receiving the gifts He delights in giving us. If a relationship with Him consisted only of fuzzy feelings during our favourite songs, we’d never grow up. God is still with us even when we don’t ‘feel’ Him. Sometimes He prioritises trust over emotions. Faith, not feelings, is what pleases Him (Hebrews 11:6). There’s something to be said about prayer and worship and Bible time, when you’re not ‘feeling’ the benefit. Although it’s difficult, stick with it; the discipline will mature you. Also remember, God says, ‘Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.’ (Hebrews 13:5 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'God has not given us a spirit of fear.' 2 Timothy 1:7 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus doesn’t want us to spend our lives worrying. During His ‘Sermon on the Mount’, He essentially writes it off it as useless: ‘&lt;em&gt;Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life?&lt;/em&gt;’ (Matthew 6:27 NIV) He’s right (shocker). It is useless and we should be able to cast it aside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we can’t always do that so easily. Paul’s advice to worriers in his letter to the Philippians is pretty standard Christian advice, but it’s still mega–useful: &lt;em&gt;pray&lt;/em&gt;. Replace bad habit with good habit. Don’t hold back the things you’re stressing about from God. He’s big enough, and wise enough, to handle anything you’ve got swirling around your head. In fact, one of the names for the Holy Spirit is ‘Counsellor’, so helping us when we feel overwhelmed is one of His specialties. Praying about worry can sometimes feel like ‘just the Christian task to do’, but it’s actually how we put ourselves in the hands of the Father who comforts us. It’s no trite task. The next time you feel particularly worried about something, take Paul’s advice and just hammer out a prayer. You don’t have to feel guilty about not having had your eyes fixed on Him. Obviously the ideal is for us to ask God into everything from the get–go, but even if we turn to Him at the last min&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ute, He will still smile, reach down and pick us up. Every time you worry about something today, even the smallest thing, write it down. Then, write a prayer about it. Cross the worries out once they’re dealt with.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger.' Ephesians 4:31 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty much everyone gets angry, including people we think are ‘super holy’ Christians. There are thousands of reasons we get angry and a lot of them come from having to deal with other people. Ever since there’s been a Church, there have been problems with members of Christ’s Body getting angry with one another. That’s why Paul wrote about how God wants His people to respond to their anger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anger itself isn’t bad, but it’s what we decide to do with it that can be seriously destructive. That’s why Paul says in Ephesians 4:26 NIV, &lt;em&gt;‘In your anger, do not sin&lt;/em&gt;’ (quoting the Greek translation of Psalm 4:4). He meant: ‘Sure, you’ll get angry sometimes but, when you do, make sure you don’t do anything stupid.’ Anger makes a great mixer for sin. It has all the right flavours: the turning inwards, the impulse to only think about yourself, the rashness. Instead of letting our anger control us, Paul advises us to just dump the whole lot down the drain: ‘&lt;em&gt;Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger.&lt;/em&gt;’ (Ephesians 4:31 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really easy to say, way harder to do. Choosing to let go of our anger when we’ve been hurt by someone doesn’t always feel like the natural thing to do. It’s difficult, but not only is it better for us in the long run, it’s what God has done for us. God doesn’t hold His anger against us because He chose to let go of it and forgive. Next time you get explosively angry at someone or something, it’s a good idea to leave the room. Pray about the anger and hand the situation over to God.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'See to it that no bitter root grows up to cause trouble.' Hebrews 12:15 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obsessing over how you’ve been wronged and how you are so in the right can make you feel better. A bit. It does, however, make you a seriously sad person to be around, for everyone else. God doesn’t like it either. Choosing to let go of your bitterness when someone’s ‘wronged you’ is hard but it’s what He asks us to do: ‘&lt;em&gt;Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Ephesians 4:32 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, forgiveness isn’t impossible. Because it’s been made possible. As Jesus was being crucified, some of His last words were: ‘&lt;em&gt;Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Luke 23:34 NIV) That’s THE example of forgiveness we’re given, which you might think is pretty insane. You may think that Jesus was well within His rights not to forgive the people who were in the process of murdering Him. Instead of holding onto His anger and bitterness, He let it go and forgave them. Incredible, right? It’s made even more impressive when you remember that the people responsible for torturing Him didn’t rush up at the last moment to say, ‘Oh Jesus, I’ve seen the error of my ways! I’m so sorry that I’ve done this. What can I do to make amends?’ No, that’s not what happened. They continued to kill Him. And He continued to forgive them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think back to when you were a little kid. Make a list of the things from back then that still make you angry. God made all those ‘impossible forgive-nesses’ possible. Why wait to ask Him to work His power of forgiveness in your mind and heart?&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Oh, that I knew where I might find Him.' Job 23:3 NKJ &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Job is a gritty book that doesn’t avoid the difficult questions. A lot of what happens to Job seems unfair—he loses his family, security and health in the opening chapters. The rest is dedicated to people trying to wrap their minds around what he did to deserve it all. We hear Job’s pain, we feel his grief, and we come across three of his well–meaning friends with some suspect theology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet through it all, Job keeps his eyes looking up to God, despite his clouds of doubt. He had massive struggles at times but he refused to accept the blame his friends were trying to make him shoulder. He also refused, despite the painful circumstances, to blame God; instead he tried to make sense of them. He tried desperately to find God, and work out what He was up to, rather than assume He wasn’t there for him. In his struggle, his desire is: ‘&lt;em&gt;Oh, that I knew where I might find Him&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Job 23:3 NKJ) Are you going through a rough ride? Maybe you’re feeling broken, at a loss, hurting, with or without an explanation. If so, take a note from Job, whose quiet times weren’t so quiet—groans, moans, tears, shouts are all in there. Cries and sighs are just as legit as words (Romans 8:26)—God knows what you mean. And if Job tells us anything about how to go through those tough times, it’s this: take your pain to God. So when you need to have some unquiet quiet–time with God, go somewhere private. Whatever is going on inside you, good or bad, talk to Him as honestly (and loudly) as you need to.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'A thorn in the flesh was given to me...' 2 Corinthians 12:7 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A jab from a rosebush isn’t the end of the world. You may bleed a little, but that’s about it. Thorns of the New Testament were a different beast altogether. Nature’s brutal weapon of choice in the desert more accurately describes them. These things really made their point (pardon the pun).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul’s statement from 2 Corinthians 12:7 becomes all the stranger: he accepted the fact that God had sent to messenger of Satan with an agonising ‘thorn’ to help him! &lt;em&gt;Help&lt;/em&gt;? Say, what?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s true that wasn’t his first conclusion. Something had to change in Paul; at first he begged God to remove it. Three times he begged. But over time, he learned to not only accept it, but to celebrate it. The weakness it brought had a way of drawing God’s strength out. Accepting his limitations allowed God to work through him. The gift of a thorn takes Paul to the cross: ‘&lt;em&gt;I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Galatians 2:20 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So think about this: if you’ve been complaining about your own thorny issue, perhaps God is using it to highlight your limitations. Spend a moment thanking Him for the work He’s doing, or planning, through that issue. Ask God to use your weakness to draw out His strength.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'I will not let you go unless you bless me.' Genesis 32:26 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacob was a sinner. He took what wasn’t his: first he cheated his older brother, Esau, to get his father’s blessing. Then he cheated his father–in–law, Laban, so he could get wealthy. Even his name meant &lt;em&gt;deceiver&lt;/em&gt;—this guy knew he didn’t deserve goodness. So, he ran off in fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then one night the ‘Angel of the Lord’ showed up as Jacob was left alone and was trying to figure out how to deal with his furious brother. Jacob wrestled with the Angel all through the night until daybreak. As you do, right? Actually, it’s one of the weirder stories in the Bible. It’s found in Genesis 32:22–32 and tells us Jacob had the gall to fight and refuse to give up, despite injury, until God blessed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacob was a sinner. Like you, and us. But he wasn’t going to let go of God. So God gave him a new name: &lt;em&gt;Israel&lt;/em&gt;. (Yep, this is where the name comes from!) Israel meant &lt;em&gt;prince with God&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;wrestles with God&lt;/em&gt;. His identity was totally changed. No longer driven by fear, he turned to healing his wounded family relationships. This kind of transformation isn’t only on offer to special guys from the Bible thousands of years ago—it’s for us too! The Bible says, ‘&lt;em&gt;Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!&lt;/em&gt;’ (2 Corinthians 5:17 NIV) Have you ever asked God what unimaginable things He might have for your life? Or what family relationships He might want you to have a part in healing? Talk to Him tonight about them before you go to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'&quot;For I know the plans I have for you,&quot; declares the Lord, &quot;plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.&quot;' Jeremiah 29:11 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever had someone at church try to cheer you up with Jeremiah 29:11? People often use that verse in a ‘God has plans, so no sads, ever’ sort of way. But, God’s plan won’t always be what we want for our lives...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Israelites (the people God was speaking to in this verse) had put their hopes and plans above God’s, and were unpleasantly surprised when they ended up in a place they didn’t expect to be. They were taken captive by their enemies, the Babylonians. The verse before Jeremiah 29:11 (imaginatively called Jeremiah 29:10) says: ‘&lt;em&gt;When seventy years are completed for Babylon, I will come to you and fulfil my good promise to bring you back…&lt;/em&gt;’ So the thing which the Israelites really wanted, to be freed and go back home, wouldn’t happen for 70 years. 70 years! That’s 280 more issues of &lt;em&gt;word4U2day&lt;/em&gt;! It’s a pretty long time to wait for something you want. They must have been gutted when they heard Jeremiah 29:10 (although they probably called it differently back then…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God promises them that it isn’t hopeless and that they can do well in their lives, even though they’re not where they expected to be. If we trust God with what’s in front of us, good things can come even out of our most unexpected disappointments. So spend some time thinking about what you’ve had in mind for your life that hasn’t lined up in the way your expected. Talk to God about any disappointment you’ve experienced because your ideas don’t align with His. Then pray about changing your plans to line up with His.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'He came seeking fruit on it and found none.' Luke 13:6 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said: ‘&lt;em&gt;A man had a fig tree growing in his vineyard, and he went to look for fruit on it but did not find any. So he said to the man who took care of the vineyard, “For three years now I’ve been coming to look for fruit on this fig tree and haven’t found any. Cut it down! Why should it use up the soil?” “Sir,” the man replied, “leave it alone for one more year, and I’ll dig around it and fertilise it. If it bears fruit next year, fine! If not, then cut it down.”&lt;/em&gt;’ (Luke 13:6–9 NIV) How long have you been a Christian? Figured out yet that it’s more than being ‘good’?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like we said in yesterday’s reading, God really does have a plan for us, which is definitely exciting. And, it tends to mean engaging with the world around us and doing stuff, rather than hiding away. God made you with a specific set of skills and there will be heaps of ways you can use those skills to worship Him. This parable warns us about being lazy and not doing what God made us to do. It’s the fig tree’s job to make figs. That’s its ‘thing’. But also notice: the man looking after the tree believed that it would flourish. God wants to help you grow in Him (John 15:5) and He’ll look after you as you do. So, spend some time thinking and praying about what you’re good at (maybe ask someone who knows you well what that is?) then see if you can use it worship God.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Keep your life free from love of money, and be content with what you have, for he has said, &quot;I will never leave you nor forsake you.&quot;' Hebrews 13:5 ESV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who put their trust in money often learn about the risk in the worst crash. History, anyone? In 1923 German money became practically worthless due to a series of catastrophes. The cost of a loaf of bread shot to 200,000,000,000 marks: that’s about 10 billion per slice! People lost everything. Looking back over the last 100 years you can see plenty of financial crises which left lives devastated—some closer to home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money isn’t the answer to life’s problems; it doesn’t love you or free you and it isn’t reliable. It can be tempting to trust in providing for yourself but we are called to completely trust in God, in all things, no matter how uncomfortable that can make us. It can feel incredibly awkward stepping out into places or careers that God’s called us to, not knowing where the support will come from. But He says: ‘&lt;em&gt;I will never leave you nor forsake you&lt;/em&gt;.’ That certainly doesn’t mean ‘lie back and do nothing because God will make money rain from the sky’—generally we are called to work in some way. It does mean however, that you can completely trust God with your whole financial future, no matter what crises hits. It also means that everything we’re given is His in the first place; it’s never really ours to hold onto, which is a pretty good springboard thought to help us get our hearts around living generously. If giving to others isn’t something you can sustain right now, ask God that you would have the means to live contentedly and joyfully, provided for by Him. He will make a way.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'...that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith.' Romans 1:12 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Icons are what you click on when you want to open a program on a computer—a little picture of a disc, a sheet of paper, a fox snuggling the earth (yeah, we know, other internet browsers are available). You go through icons to get to the program you want. You and I are icons. We’re shortcuts to God. Of all the wonderful things in this universe—fiery stars in the sky, giant sea beasts that churn up waters, the booming and rumble of mighty storms—we are what looks most like God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look through the New Testament for clues. It says that you and I are made to be like God’s Son (Romans 8:29). Yep, us. Not the stars, not the sky, not the earth. We are the ones called to be like God’s Son. So—if we look closely at you, or you look closely at us (failing–saved–by–grace real people)—we all get to see beyond ourselves, to a bit of God. If you hear our stories, or we hear yours, He’s bursting through them; more so than He does through the mightiest waterfall or biggest cosmic storm. Even your favourite Christian author or legend is not perfect. He or she is a normal human being and therefore flawed round the edges. However, think about all the Godly things they did (or are doing) with their lives. So, even though you’re also flawed around the edges, that doesn’t mean you’ve blown it so badly in God’s eyes He can’t use you to help others big time. God is an expert at doing a perfect work through an imperfect vessel—like you.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Use wisdom and understanding to establish your home.' Proverbs 24:3 CEV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paintbrushes exist because our hands alone can’t do more than fingerpaint. Hammers do a better job with nails than our elbows or foreheads. Tools are for tasks we can’t do with our bodies. And if you don’t have a paintbrush but you want to paint, you simply go out and get one—you don’t wallow in despair about how difficult it is to use your hair as a paintbrush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, James says, ‘&lt;em&gt;If any of you is lacking in wisdom, ask God&lt;/em&gt;.’ (James 1:5 NRS) Wisdom’s a tool, there for the getting. Wisdom’s not a magic wand, or some grey–haired expert that you’ll morph into at the end of your Christian walk. It’s there to help you build your life together, today. Tools are for tasks we can’t do with what we’ve got within ourselves, and wisdom is for those times when real life situations—temptations, hard choices, troubled friends—get the better of our normal ability to cope. You use wisdom in your everyday life, in the middle of temptations and hard choices. You get it, just as James says, by asking God plainly and directly for it. So pick it up and practise. If the ability to make wise choices seems impossibly distant, start small and start with the choices in front of you today. If you really want the ability to say, ‘I’m a wise person,’ then ask God for the opportunity to make one small, wise choice today. Take it in steps, so that by the end of the month you can look back and count the wise choices you’ve made.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Be fruitful...multiply...and govern.' Genesis 1:28 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God created Adam to work creation before mankind ‘&lt;em&gt;fell&lt;/em&gt;’ (Genesis 2:15). Work wasn’t punishment—it was a good thing, a job to do, as part of tending Creation… Adam and Eve were intended to represent God to Creation—to ‘&lt;em&gt;reign over&lt;/em&gt;’ it (Genesis 1:26 NLT), in the same sort of way that God does, through looking after it and growing it well. He gave them a share in some of His work in that, because He delights in involving His children in upbuilding the world in love. They were also intended to represent Creation to Him. The joy they were to find in growing that world for Him was meant to inspire them to make a conscious choice to thank Him. They were to be like excited kids, asked to plant cress seeds by a parent who anticipates them running back, yelling, ‘Come and see! It’s sooo cooool!’ when the seeds sprouted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God’s children were created as His partners: unequal, sure, but deeply adored joint–owners of a beautiful project. Adam and Eve’s ‘priesthood’ over Creation doesn’t mean there were modernish church–style rituals. Their priesthood was part of their God–given purpose and identity. Today, our earth isn’t the same, but our calling is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) &lt;em&gt;represent God to our world&lt;/em&gt;. Bring Him into it and ‘be Jesus’ to those who need Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) &lt;em&gt;represent it back to Him&lt;/em&gt;. Make the choice to constantly bring it to Him in prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit of a Sunday School activity to remind us of the importance of this: (1) Chop the big end off a carrot or parsnip. (2) Put the end in a saucer of water. (3) Replace the water every day, and pray as you do. (4) Watch the shoots come.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'You are a... priesthood.' 1 Peter 2:9 NIV &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know anyone with ‘asbestos fingers’? Those guys who casually toss coals around when setting up a fire, or play with candles at dinner tables? In the Old Testament, priests had to be a bit like that. They were chosen to get close to God (read Hebrews 9:1–10. &lt;em&gt;Wow!&lt;/em&gt;) and the things of God—closer than the rest of the people, enough to feel the searing heat, the ‘holiness that hurts the eyes’, and they were allowed to withstand it. God’s temple priests got involved with the altar, its vessels and the offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘High priests’ got the closest to God. They made sacrifices for sins and invited the presence of God back into the community. They were people who wore the Name of the Lord on their foreheads (Exodus 28:38). That, and what they did in that yearly ‘Day of Atonement’ service, made a way for God’s people to be close to Him again, even in their sin–filled history. And today? Peter says ‘&lt;em&gt;you are a priesthood&lt;/em&gt;.’ You are a priesthood. &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt;. Church tradition used to say that cherubs (the ones who somehow on our postcards got misrepresented as cute winged babies instead of sword–wielding gatekeepers) had rosy cheeks because they were the angels that flew closest to God’s throne. It was understood that the heat was close to burning their faces off. This was where the high priest could go safely—right into God’s presence, in with the angels—and this is where we’re allowed, today. How? And why? Stay tuned: more on that tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'His God instructs him and teaches him the right way.' Isaiah 28:26 NIV &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we’ve looked at Adam and Eve as priests, we’ve looked at the Old Testament Temple priests… but can anyone think of someone who totally fulfilled this Priesthood idea, and then some? (No prizes, Sunday School veterans). Jesus. Ultimate Prophet—He revealed God to humanity. Ultimate King, He is chief–ruler–and–boss over all Creation. Ultimate Priest—in His life and even more so in His death and resurrection, Jesus enabled mankind to go back into God, and God into mankind. (That last bit there, is mind-bending. John 1:14 is a universe–shattering truth.) So that’s good. That’s really good. People could do with knowing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wherever you are, study/work, a shopping centre, out with mates, the people around you could do with seeing God shine through you, and hearing the news that God died because He loved them so much. How? Get close to Him yourself, get close to God like in the Holy of Holies (pssst, read 1 Corinthians 6:19 for an update to the Old Testament set–up), choose to bring Him into Creation around you, and bring Creation to Him, constantly, in prayer. And bring Him into your conversations—bring that Good News into a world that needs it. You are a priest. And the more you go to Him for guidance on how to live that out, day to day, the more He’ll build you up in it, ‘instructing and teaching you’ to do it better and better. Write “P” – “R” – “I” – “E” – “S” – “T” down a page. Spend ten minutes researching the word ‘priest’ (in dictionaries, Bible concordances, whatever). From that research, note down a single–word challenge for yourself, beginning with each letter, then live it out today.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'The Word of the Lord came to Jonah a second time.' Jonah 3:1 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonah said a quick ‘no’ to God. And days later, he allowed several incensed sailors to chuck him over the side of their boat and into a raging sea. That... &lt;em&gt;hmmm&lt;/em&gt;... escalated quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing about running from your mistakes is that the consequences have a nasty habit of blowing way out of proportion. When Jonah turned his back on God’s command, do you reckon he saw the whole ragingstorm–overboard–bellyofawhale chain of events coming? When you say ‘no’ to God, it might seem like a simple act in the moment. You might hope that’s the end of it. But hiding from God takes you to places (even if they’re only in your mind) that you wouldn’t have gone before, and you lose the path into God’s best for you. Jonah saw all this happen to him—pity it had to happen from the belly of a great fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then Jonah 3:1 happens. In his regret, Jonah dares to glance back at God, and the whale vomits him up on the shore. There, God simply speaks again. What can we learn from this? No matter how far gone you feel you are, God will speak again and again to you. If you’re burying your head with shame, dare a glance back at Him. He won’t have gone purple with rage. Chances are He’ll love that you’ve turned to Him. Try to run from Him once, He’s willing to take your shame away. Try it twice, He’s willing to take your shame away. Three times, and it goes on... If you think God may have said something to you that you’ve rejected, ask Him to ask you again today.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Seek His will... and He will show you which path to take.' Proverbs 3:6 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever felt a bit inferior compared to Christians in full–time ministry? It’s possible to get the idea that ‘overseas missionary’ or at least ‘full–time Christian worker’ is God’s ideal for every Christian. But what about everyone else? Is it possible to be a garbage collector and still be in the bulls–eye of God’s will for you? Well, yes. Definitely. God’s will is not a hierarchy. Even though it can be tempting to think that overseas missionaries are at the top of the tree (with Africa before Europe, and Latin America ahead of North America, obviously…) with pastors second, then youth workers, and somewhere long down the line of importance we get plumbers, mechanics, insurance sales and interns. Because, y’know, how is doing the tea run glorifying the Lord? Of course that’s ridiculous. God’s will is God’s will and, whether it involves changing nappies or changing the world, that makes it the best possible thing. Being God’s will, and all, He’s also using it to grow something in you. You might even say, He’s preparing you for Heaven, through the (even invisible) work He’s had you doing. It’s all valued to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colossians 3:23 NIV says, ‘&lt;em&gt;Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord&lt;/em&gt;…’ Notice: ‘&lt;em&gt;Whatever you do&lt;/em&gt;…’ Making a cuppa, fixing a leaky tap, unblocking a loo—they can all be glorifying, if we’re giving our heart to Jesus, and serving Him through serving others.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'The mind controlled by the Spirit is life and peace.' Romans 8:6 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GK Chesterton once said: ‘Jesus promised His disciples three things—that they would be completely fearless, absurdly happy, and in constant trouble.’ Life, then, as a Christian, will be turned up to the max on all fronts. We’re all called to this. You’re called to this active life of pointing others to Jesus and showing God’s goodness to those around you. To help you, well, there’s the fearlessness, the happiness, and the trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You live to do justice, love, kindness and walk humbly with your God (Micah 6:8). As you go about being God’s hands and feet to bring about that justice, kindness and humility, His perfect love will override your ‘natural’ fear of how dangerous it can all be (1 John 4:18). You’ll get pushed on by your absurd happiness (Nehemiah 8:10) in the middle of an unpredictable life. ‘&lt;em&gt;In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.&lt;/em&gt;’ (John 16:33 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How it happens in your life will be different than the next person and partly up to you. You might get paid out for it. Praying for the sick and sharing the Gospel might sting. But in the centre of it all you’re promised that God will be there, for you. You might feel like your world is a spinning wheel. The outside might be constantly moving, but remember if you’re in the centre with God, then all is like the ‘eye’ of a storm—stillness and peace.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'This is God's will for you.' 1 Thessalonians 5:18 NIV &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Old married couples often have a seemingly perfect knack for finishing each other’s sentences. They’ve spent so much time together, they can practically read each other’s minds. There’s something in that talent that reminds us of the possibilities of a relationship with God... Well, ok so we’re obviously never going to finish the Creator’s sentences—‘&lt;em&gt;For who can know the Lord’s thoughts&lt;/em&gt;,’ right? (Romans 11:34 NLT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But spending time regularly practising the art of looking and listening for God helps us begin to know His heart. Praise and saying ‘thanks’ opens you up to God’s purposes. ‘&lt;em&gt;Be joyful always; pray continually; give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God’s will&lt;/em&gt;.’ (1 Thessalonians 5:16–18 NIV) If you only pray when you’re desperate for answers, your receptors become rusty; praying regularly with God sharpens your senses and fine–tunes your ability to understand His Word and stay in His Will amidst the noise: ‘&lt;em&gt;Teach me to do Your will…my God; may Your good Spirit lead me on level ground&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Psalm 143:10 NIV) Seek God, and He will smooth the path for you. It’s good to chat with wise Christians for their take on life–stuff, and it’s even more important to chat with God for His. Ultimately, it’s Him who works things out. Often God leads, and then uses others to confirm what He was saying. So, tell God all about that–thing–you–need–His–direction–with. Ask Him to draw your mind to His will. Now just sit with Him for a few minutes—praying and reading the Bible. Don’t worry too much if your thoughts start to wander, just pray through everything that comes to mind.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts.' Colossians 3:15 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the doors that we’ve been pushing, and thinking of as the next step in God’s plan, turn out to be locked. No matter how much we use our head as a battering ram, that–thing–we–were–chasing (chasing even with God–centred intentions) can seem a dead end. So what do we do when things don’t seem to go to plan? Well, actually, we should probably redefine that whole plan thing. Here’s the truth: sometimes our view of the plan isn’t from the best position. So what we were expecting may not happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But God is sovereign. (That means: &lt;em&gt;He rules&lt;/em&gt;.) He has you safely in His hands. That doesn’t mean heartbreaking things don’t happen sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But know this: He’s holding you within His plan, and He’ll eventually bring you to the right door. And it’ll be unlocked. While you’re standing in the corridor–of–life (did we take the metaphor too far...? Just run with it), have peace. Know that He is the Sovereign Door. ‘&lt;em&gt;Jesus again said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.”&lt;/em&gt;’ (John 10:7 ESV) He’s in control. In today’s verse, the term ‘&lt;em&gt;rule&lt;/em&gt;’ in Greek, is the kind of direction that a referee gives, it’s about directing decisions that allow a game to continue, not about ruling like a king with an iron fist. Peace isn’t just peace; it’s a compass that God uses to direct our hearts to new doors. So take a moment to think of all the wrong doors you might have gone through in life and thank Him for the times He’s sent you back to look for Him, the true Door.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'I seek not to please Myself but Him who sent Me.' John 5:30 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s chat about doors again. As we discussed yesterday, God WILL bring you to the right door, in the right timing. Look at Paul, He met closed doors to Asia and Bithynia, and instead God opened the door to Macedonia for him (Acts 16:6–10). Our role, then? We push. He unlocks the doors, but He wants us to push on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no use standing staring at an unlocked door, when you could have been through it five minutes ago just by trying it. God is that Sovereign Door and He’ll make sure that you only ever make it through to the right path, as long as you’re constantly asking Him to keep you within His will. (Or, being sure to ‘seek ye first the Kingdom of God’, as the old song goes…) So if life’s presenting you with options, be wise. But also rest in knowing that you can trust God’s plans and His kindness. And just, simply, give some doors a try. You may not see a big blue neon sign telling you what to do, but you will at least begin to get an inkling if God is calling you to do something, or not. When you try doors and are listening for God’s voice, the wrong ones will shut when you push. Opportunities will arise to lead you to the right ones, and decisions will be waiting upon you. Chase that Colossians 3:15 peace by seeking what pleases God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ready for a prophetic action? Go open your front door, and stand just inside it. Say aloud, ‘God, I step into your plans. I trust they’ll be the best version of my future. I’ll pursue them to please You.’ Then take that step out.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares.' Hebrews 12:1 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What sort of attitudes weigh you down? There are nine C’s the Lord wants us to put aside: &lt;em&gt;Carelessness&lt;/em&gt;, a &lt;em&gt;Critical&lt;/em&gt; spirit, &lt;em&gt;Compromise&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Conformity&lt;/em&gt; to worldly values, &lt;em&gt;Coldness&lt;/em&gt; of heart, &lt;em&gt;Cruelty&lt;/em&gt;, lack of &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;, lack of &lt;em&gt;Commitment&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Confidence&lt;/em&gt; in Him. God’s tolerance when it comes to sin is zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our good, and for His kingly glory, He isn’t gentle with our darker sides. He wants us to be able to come face to face with Him—with Love Himself—and in order to do that, He’ll go straight for the things that have us ensnared, ripping them out at the roots. Our wrong actions turn us away from God. If we keep going past repeated warnings from Him that our sinful thoughts and behaviour isn’t good for us, we might have to learn these lessons the hardest possible way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet God can still use the mess we end up in to lead us out of the snare of sin. But, that’ll hurt. That’ll be uncomfortable. Unpleasant. Ugly. So, how about we avoid that place of regrets and make a move first? When we choose to ask God for help to lay aside every deadweight, every old attitude problem, every sinful thought and action, He’ll be there! He’s just waiting to be asked. So let’s get serious about the nine things God’s serious with: &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;joy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;peace&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;patience&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;kindness&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;goodness&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;faithfulness&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;gentleness&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;self-control&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'You shall not give false testimony.' Exodus 20:16 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fibs. Tales. Whoppers. There are loads of different names for lies. Often it’s because people view the name as relative to the size of the lie. You’ll hear things like: ‘It’s only a little white lie.’ But, wait a minute. Two days ago we were chatting about God seeing the heart, so, to God, dishonesty is dishonesty—there’s no in–between. So, what about half truths, lying to ourselves or staying silent and withholding info that could bring truth into a situation? Brace yourself. Here’s the harsh reality: ‘&lt;em&gt;The Lord detests lying lips, but He delights in people who are trustworthy.&lt;/em&gt;’ (Proverbs 12:22 NIV) Why? Because God is truth (John 14:6). There’s no part of God that dwells in dishonesty or lies, so when we participate in that stuff we’re allowing something other than God to be a part of our lives. Oops. So, how do we guard against it? Firstly, we need to recognise the impact of lies. James 3:5 NIV compares lies to a spark: ‘&lt;em&gt;Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark&lt;/em&gt;.’ Ok, so it’s fairly major. Secondly, we need to pray. Psalm 141:3 NIV says: ‘&lt;em&gt;Set a guard over my mouth, Lord; keep watch over the door of my lips.&lt;/em&gt;’ The more in tune we are with God, the more truth we’ll speak. And if we’re only speaking truth, there’s no room for lies. Do you watch any soapies or TV dramas? Consider how many of the storylines are made more dramatic by characters telling lies. And do you stretch the truth sometimes too? Think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'You shall not covet.' Exodus 20:17 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On its own, the word for ‘covet’ (&lt;em&gt;chamad&lt;/em&gt;) here just means &lt;em&gt;desire&lt;/em&gt;, and isn’t a bad thing. What makes the coveting an evil thing is the fact that it’s someone else’s thing. Translation: it doesn’t belong to you, and you want it anyway. So why is it bad to see your friend with the newest PhonePadTechylookingthing and fall over yourself to get one too? Well, it’s not particularly honouring to them. It’s a missed opportunity to ‘&lt;em&gt;rejoice with those who rejoice&lt;/em&gt;’ (Romans 12:15 NIV), and it’s really quite self–centred. And in the ‘&lt;em&gt;you shall not covet your neighbour’s wife&lt;/em&gt;’ (Exodus 20:17 NIV) part of the verse, dishonouring becomes dehumanising. Sometimes we treat people as bodies to lust after or wish we had instead of our own. Or how about that one person who seems to have it all perfect? And you just wish you could be them? Same: not good for anyone. Coveting people or their things (and yes, if it is a shop’s thing, it is still coveting…) becomes a worship–full experience and then we’re ‘worship–empty’ when we go before God. We have no space left for Him, because we tried to feed this hunger within ourselves with the wrong stuff or people. If we get what we wanted so desperately we still wouldn’t be satisfied. We’d want more. That desire to be filled is a Jesus–shaped space only He can actually, truly fill. The next (affordable—chocolate, a CD, lipstick, whatever) thing that you find yourself ‘chamad’–ing in a shop… buy it. Then give it away to someone who you know’d like it.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work and preserve me for His heavenly Kingdom... Amen!' 2 Timothy 4:18 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul lived most of his Christian walk in the thick of it. At the start of Acts 20, we read all the places he’s been taking the Gospel message to thousands who hadn’t yet heard about Jesus. Big task, that. Consider it a bit like a &lt;em&gt;Die Hard&lt;/em&gt; mission week. His mission week involved this: ‘&lt;em&gt;Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was pelted with stones, three times I was shipwrecked&lt;/em&gt;...’ (2 Corinthians 11:25 NIV) Those kinds of things defined Paul’s others–focussed life. If you go to Paul’s list of struggles in 2 Corinthians 11:24–28, you’ll probably find something you can relate to. Paul was lonely, tired and in danger almost permanently. Where’s the room for ‘joy’ there, then? Here’s what he had to say: ‘&lt;em&gt;None of these things move me; nor do I count my life dear to myself, so that I may finish my race with joy&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Acts 20:24 NKJ) Bit of a plot twist, that. So, what did Paul have on his side? In his last letter, only months before he died, Paul wrote this to Timothy: ‘&lt;em&gt;But the Lord stood at my side and gave me strength...The Lord will rescue me.&lt;/em&gt;’ (2 Timothy 4:17–18 NIV) For him to get through all the trials of his past, and confidently face the hazy future, he needed to believe that God was greater than anything he would be faced with. He needed faith. Simple as. Guess what! God still pulls out all the stops for us today. Give your struggles to Him today and run your race with joy.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Ezra...stood on a platform...which they had made for the purpose.' Nehemiah 8:4 NKJ &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerusalem had been rubble until Nehemiah rebuilt the ruined city into a liveable place. The architect even threw in a custom–built preaching platform as part of the deal. As Ezra stood on the platform speaking for the sixth hour about what God had done (and you thought your church service went on a bit!), the people wept and sang and cheered. A ‘platform’ is anything that makes you noticeable and allows you to be heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who needs a specially–built stand when your phone’s a stage? The internet’s given you Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest—you now have the chance to be in the lives of your friends and family every day. So what are you going to do with those platforms? Be a beacon. Be an internet encourager. Don’t let low confidence or a jaded feeling send a bullet through your hope. It might be something as simple as posting a quote or a link to &lt;em&gt;word4U2day&lt;/em&gt; on Facebook, so that people see how God is mixed in with the flavour of your everyday food snaps. Or better, speak to those friends that you know could do with a word–lift or send an encouraging web–link you know will make them smile deep–deep–down in the place that needs to know Jesus is Lord, and that He loves them. ...Who knows what your feed could accomplish today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By bringing God’s word to people, Ezra saw a huge response. Open that social media app and bring God’s word to someone today.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Lord, how can I save Israel?... I am the least in my father's house.' Judges 6:15 NLT &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poor old Gideon; possibly shut up tight inside himself, a shy child, troubled with doubt and boxed in by anxiety. Hiding in a silo, out of the way… when suddenly, in bursts adventure—God calls nervous Gideon to take on the Midianites. Talk about an uneven match. It’s like dropping the kid picked last in PE into mortal combat with an elite battle squadron. You can hear Gideon’s brain ticking, ‘Me Lord? You’ve got the wrong guy... I don’t have the strength or the brains. I *can’t* do it.’ And he was right! Gideon had more chance of downing a bear with a sneeze than defeating an entire army. He wasn’t up to the job. God, however, was (and is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faith is trusting God with the impossible. It is placing confidence in the One who can ‘…&lt;em&gt;present you...before the presence of His glory with great joy&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Jude 1:24 ESV) Gideon was a mighty warrior, he just didn’t know it. God orchestrated a series of events designed to open up, and unfold his warrior within. Perhaps you can relate? You sense God is asking something too big of you. You feel tied up in knots. Fear is a dark shadow bearing down on you. On your own you can’t face the challenge, let alone overcome. God, however, can. And He promises, ‘&lt;em&gt;Don’t be afraid…I am with you&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Isaiah 41:10 NLT) If you feel boxed into any kind of silo today, ask God to help you step out of your ‘impossible’ and into His ‘possible’.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Not in human wisdom but in the power of God.' 1 Corinthians 2:5 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*WHY* are Christians considered ‘weird’? Is it because we hang around in churches, and believe there’s more to life than meets the eye? Are we ‘Jesus freaks’ because we live radically, spiritually, God–trusting lives? Because we make decisions the world doesn’t understand, knowing that Jesus will carry us through what He asks of us? Does that last one excite you? It excites us… The Bible is full of people who risk looking ‘weird’ by taking God at His word, straight up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book of Exodus would’ve been far shorter if Moses had just dipped a toe in the Red Sea, yelped at the cold and hopped around a bit. David wouldn’t have reached the palace if he’d chosen to leave his slingshot in his pocket. The world would look a lot different had Noah chosen to build a patio to soak up the sun. The common bond between these three, and so many more, is faith. (Oh, wait. And another thing: their fearsome Old Testament beards). It’s a risky business stepping into the waves expecting them to part, or going toe–to–toe with the world’s most colossal soldier, or building a boat in the desert. But these people are famous throughout history because they trusted in God. The power of God is above our reasoning, and beyond our com-fort. If living with faith is a risky business, have a practice today. Pray for one of your friends, (or someone who isn’t yet your friend, if you’re feeling really brave), asking God how you can encourage them. Then pray for help to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'With long life I will satisfy them.' Psalm 91:16 NRS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, Heaven will be nice. The Bible describes it in this way: ‘&lt;em&gt;He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Revelation 21:4 ESV) But what about today? Can’t life be painless now?’ In the mystery of what we know about Heaven, we know that God will take complete care of us, for good. But what about when we step out of our front doors into the world of illness, doubt, and unsure walks through dodgy alleys? God says He has our backs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a read of Psalm 91. Those words aren’t sweet nothings from on high—they’re grounded on an God’s promise to take care of those who remain in Him. For example, in Genesis 15 God essentially says to Abram, ‘I’ll tear myself apart before I’ll go back on my promise.’ He means it when He says that His&lt;em&gt; 'faithfulness is a shield&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Psalm 91:4 ESV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s for today, in the worst fear, in our illnesses and when we’re in danger. He promised it. But it’s not a pledge of ‘cotton wool’ protection. Remember, the Bible has Jesus’ terrible death, not to mention a pretty beaten–up early Church. God works good from all our bad, including the pain. The world *is* dangerous. It won’t always make sense. But He gives us His Word. We can cry for His help to shield us when we’re up against pain or confusion that’s overwhelming. The one who hears is a Father who’d tear Himself apart before losing any of His kids. In your church it’s almost certain there’s someone who’s been through real pain and come through with God. Seek them out and listen to what they’ve learned.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Master...because you say so, I will.' Luke 5:5 NIV &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There the disciples were, gathering in their nets. They’d sweated through the nightshift without a bite. Then Jesus showed up, saying: ‘&lt;em&gt;Push out into deep water&lt;/em&gt;…’ Like a carpenter would know more than a professional fisherman? ‘&lt;em&gt;Let your nets out for a catch&lt;/em&gt;,’ He went on. Peter decided to humour him. ‘&lt;em&gt;Master…because you say so, I will&lt;/em&gt;.’ Soon the net was so full it was about to break. Peter yelled to his partners for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two thousand years later Jesus still shows up just as we’re about to pack up and go home. So often, He waits until we’ve reached the end of our rope, then steps in. Why? Because He likes to see us squirm in doubt and failure? Never. Too often we rely on our own abilities and only bring God in when we really need Him. But everything we do matters to Him. He cares that we have a deadline on Friday or that we’ve lost our keys. He wants to help, even in those small things. It’s a massive waste of time and a lot more stress trying to solve things on our own. Jesus doesn’t wait until we’re at the pulling–hair–out–stage of a problem before He steps in. It’s actually up to us to invite Him into the situation before it escalates. He’s there, ready to help, waiting for us to ask. Wherever you go today, when you’ve finished what you’re there to do, take ten minutes out before heading home. Spend those minutes in quiet prayer, or worshipping God. Talk to Him before you reach the end of your net.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Honour your father and your mother.' Exodus 20:12 NIV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first four of the TCs—Ten Commandments—are about our relationship with God. Now He turns our attention to our relationships and attitudes towards other people. Honour. It’s not a word you hear bandied about that often. (Except maybe in Disney’s &lt;em&gt;Mulan&lt;/em&gt;. Does that count?...No?...) So, what exactly is ‘honour’? It means to regard something or someone with great respect. This fifth commandment is calling us to respect our family, and specifically our parents. (Or it might be more about your grandparents, your guardians or maybe even church elders.) No matter what your family situation, God is keen to see you respect and love your family in the same way He respects and loves you. He unfalteringly wants your best, and works sacrificially for it. Powerful model. This commandment is a toughie, because it can be pretty difficult to respect someone if they don’t respect you. Yet this honour should be an overflow of our love for Christ. It’s in those ‘I’m finding it difficult to love you right now, but I am anyway’ moments that we learn how Christ–like we can be. And it’s by our determination to respect our parents, guardians and families in the midst of difficulties that we show the world what it is to know God. Jesus said ‘…&lt;em&gt;As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this, everyone will know that you are My disciples&lt;/em&gt;…’ (John 13:34–35 NIV) Write a thank you card to someone you look up to, whether it’s a parent/guardian/youth worker/pastor—and try to get the word honour in.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'You shall not murder.' Exodus 20:13 NIV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a wild stab in the dark and assume that most of us haven’t killed anything bigger than a bug. Or maybe a nasty looking spider. But maybe there’s more to this commandment than the simple instruction of not physically killing another human being. We reckon there’s something in the concept of killing that still exists in our everyday life, and like yesterday’s commandment it’s to do with our attitude towards others. In Matthew 5:21–22 NLT Jesus expands on the idea of killing: ‘&lt;em&gt;You have heard that our ancestors were told, “You must not murder. If you commit murder, you are subject to judgment.” But I say if you are even angry with someone, you are subject to judgment. If you call someone an idiot you are in danger of being brought before the court. And if you curse someone, you are in danger of the fires of hell.&lt;/em&gt;’ Wow. Serious stuff. Not only is life sacred to God (since He created it), but He’s also telling us not to destroy someone with our words either. When we gossip about people, cruelly label or make fun of them, God hears. When we destroy a person with our mouths we’re violating this commandment, because to God, it’s a form of killing. Yes, serious stuff. James 3:8–10 NAS says: ‘...&lt;em&gt;the tongue...is...full of deadly poison. With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in the likeness of God... these things ought not to be&lt;/em&gt;...’ So watch your words today. Which of your words bring ‘life’, and which do you need to stop before they bring ‘death’?&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'You shall not commit adultery.' Exodus 20:14 NIV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adultery. We know it’s wrong. And some of us aren’t even married, so what’s the point in looking at this? Well, we reckon there’s more to this commandment than just the instruction to not cheat on your significant other. In Matthew 5:28 NIV, Jesus said ‘…&lt;em&gt;I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.&lt;/em&gt;’ It reminds us that God sees the heart behind the stuff we do. It’s important we understand the sanctity (isn’t that a lovely word?) of marriage. But, more than that, it’s important we realise God is just as concerned with our spiritual condition as our physical mistakes. Don’t get us wrong; God definitely still cares when we mistreat the bodies that He’s given to us, and when we do stuff the Bible warns against. But He’s aware of the deeper stuff going on that’s causing the actions. Jeremiah 17:10 NAS says: ‘&lt;em&gt;I, the Lord, search the heart, I test the mind&lt;/em&gt;…’ If we think we’re doing just fine because we haven’t actually cheated on hypothetical–spouse but inside we’re full of vulture–like thoughts, we’ve missed the point. Not only that, but those vulture–like thoughts always end up coming out (Luke 6:45). Giving ourselves to Jesus means giving Him access to clean it all up. And that changing of your attitude is what will change your actions. A great starting point when you’re offering your heart to God is Philippians 4:8 NAS: ‘&lt;em&gt;Whatever is true, whatever is honourable... right... pure... lovely... of good repute, if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise, dwell on these things.&lt;/em&gt;’&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'You shall not steal.' Exodus 20:15 NIV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this is just getting silly, isn’t it? Surely most of us know not to steal? Well… this is another one of those commandments that takes a little bit more study to fully grasp. We live in a ‘what can I get out of it?’ culture. It’s the sort of environment where we can easily bend the rules and twist dishonesty and theft to get what we want. (‘Of course I never *steal*. But don’t open my iTunes library…’) Think about it. How often do we take the credit from other people? Or not give back any extra change given to us by the shop assistant? Or take stationery from work home? And when you think about it, isn’t withholding something that’s not yours the same as taking something that’s not yours? It’s all about denying the owner whatever is rightfully theirs. It gets a whole lot more serious when we think about this in the context of our relationship with God. If withholding things is a form of robbery, how often do we rob God? Are we sometimes guilty of denying Him our time, efforts or talents? Think about it this way, if ‘&lt;em&gt;every good and perfect gift is from above&lt;/em&gt;…’ (James 1:17 NIV), then God is the rightful owner of all we have and all we are. So it’s probably a good idea for us to give those gifts back in some way… So is it time for a clean out? Think through things you’re holding on to that you shouldn’t be (yes, digital too). What should you do about it? Make a decision, today, and carry it out.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'And God spoke all these words...' Exodus 20:1 NIV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone says you can’t do something, that’s often what we want to do. Instantly. Aren’t the TCs—Ten Commandments—like that? A set of rules humanity is almost destined to break? We reckon there’s more to them than just a set of old rules. In fact, there’s freedom in obedience, because our relationship with Jesus comes from His grace rather than the law. The commandments aren’t just about wagging the finger and warning us against sin; they teach us about how we should be living. So, (1) ‘&lt;em&gt;You shall have no other gods before Me&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Exodus 20:3 NIV) God is clear on this; it’s all about allegiance. You’ve got to be committed, and that means making Him your priority. It’s no mistake that the first commandment is about the most important relationship—you and God. (2) ‘&lt;em&gt;You shall not make for yourself an idol&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Exodus 20:4 NLT) Not many of us have a whopping great golden cow statue, but idols can take all sorts of forms. Anything that comes before God in your priorities is an idol. Think about it… (3) ‘&lt;em&gt;You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Exodus 20:7 NIV) This isn’t just about profanity, it’s about what we assign God’s name to, it’s about wearing the name ‘Christian’ honourably and prioritising the glory and reputation of the one true God (hence the first two commandments). Clever stuff. Challenge time: before checking Exodus 20, try to write down all of the TCs. How did you do? Sneaky hint: they’re all about relationships. More tomorrow…&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.' Exodus 20:8 NIV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever walked a curious toddler through the porcelain section of an expensive shop? And spent the entire time saying, ‘Don’t touch that,’ ‘Mind the lady,’ ‘How about we save that lovely windmill impression for outside?’ That’s kinda like what the Sabbath had become by the time Jesus was around. People had become completely hung up on a huge list of do’s and don’ts. That’s why Jesus said: ‘&lt;em&gt;The Sabbath was made to meet the needs of the people, and not people to meet the requirements of the Sabbath.&lt;/em&gt;’ (Mark 2:27 NLT) The idea of keeping the Sabbath holy was to allow people to rest and allow God to refresh them. But hang on; sometimes we, in this age, can be guilty of not keeping the Sabbath. We find ourselves running about all week, nipping to church on the weekend and hitting the next week faster than you can say: ‘expensive shops are no place for children.’ So, how do we keep it holy? We make time to rest. We slow down and listen out for God. That rest comes by reading His Word, praying, listening to people preach and chatting with other Christians. Only through this stuff will we feel physically and spiritually refreshed. Have a read through this verse again: ‘&lt;em&gt;The Sabbath was made to meet the needs of the people, and not people to meet the requirements of the Sabbath.&lt;/em&gt;’ (Mark 2:27 NLT) Give it a rest and be refreshed.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Jesus Himself came up and walked along with them.' Luke 24:15 NIV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Jesus’ crucifixion, Cleopas and his friend were on the road that led home to Emmaus. That’s when ‘&lt;em&gt;Jesus Himself came up and walked along with them&lt;/em&gt;.’ Their hopes lay buried in a tomb; their belief had turned to doubt. So what did Jesus do? ‘&lt;em&gt;Jesus took them through the writings of Moses and all the prophets, explaining from all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.&lt;/em&gt;’ (Luke 24:27 NLT) Jesus knows that when you’re walking the road of doubt, you need to get His Word into you. When you do, three things happen: (1) &lt;em&gt;Your eyes will be opened&lt;/em&gt;. ‘&lt;em&gt;Then their eyes were opened and they recognised Him&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Luke 24:31 NLT) There are things you will only see when God shows them to you through His Word. That’s why Bible reading needs to be a priority. (2) &lt;em&gt;Your heart will burn&lt;/em&gt;. ‘&lt;em&gt;They said to one another, “Didn’t our heart burn within us as He talked with us?”&lt;/em&gt;’ (Luke 24:32 NLT) You’re not always going to feel that raging fire for God. Committing to being in God’s Word means opening it up even when your heart feels, well, cold. But know for sure that when you seek God, you always find Him (Deuteronomy 4:29). (3) &lt;em&gt;Your mouth will open&lt;/em&gt;. ‘&lt;em&gt;Then the two told what had happened on the way…&lt;/em&gt;’ (Luke 24:35 NIV) Getting to know Jesus will make you want everyone around you to know Him, too. Love–fuelled conversations? Yes please. Pray that God will open your eyes as you go through your day—to see Him and Him at work in your life and in the lives of others.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Come to Me, all who labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.' Matthew 11:28 ESV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re going to do the overprotective helicopter–parent on you for a moment. Right: &lt;em&gt;Are you eating well? Are you getting enough sleep? Have you exercised recently?&lt;/em&gt; Seriously! Taking care of ourselves is really important. When life gets less than wonderful, we can get so caught up in dealing with whatever it is (or burying whatever it is and not dealing with it) that we lose sight of what’s going on around us, or inside us. But how we take care of ourselves affects every other part of our lives. When we let things slip, it makes it harder to deal with other things in life. When Elijah was struggling with depression (check out 1 Kings 19:1–18), an angel appears with food way out in the desert (now that’s some delivery service…) and tells him to ‘&lt;em&gt;get up and eat, for the journey is too much for you&lt;/em&gt;.’ (1 Kings 19:7 NIV) That doesn’t just apply to us literally but also figuratively. We have the Word of God, which we can open to find comfort and hope for anything we’re dealing with. It’s been provided for us, but it’s up to us to ‘get up and eat’. The journey of life is just too much for us to not take the time to breathe, be in God’s presence, eat, sleep, get out of the house and go for a walk, etc. If we don’t stop, we’ll busy ourselves into flat–out exhaustion. Is it time for an early night? Spiritual and physical rest are related, you know. Take a ‘sabbath’ evening, with Bible, hot chocolate and duvet. You’ll thank us tomorrow. ‘Goodnight.’&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'...always struggling on your behalf in his prayers.' Colossians 4:12 ESV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a normal part of human nature to struggle in prayer. But sometimes, instead of struggling through it, we let the struggles keep us from praying at all. Unfortunately, that’s Satan’s main plan for us: to keep us from God. Our prayers, however much we stumble and struggle through them, can have serious power. Jesus says that if we ‘&lt;em&gt;remain in Him and His words remain in us&lt;/em&gt;’ we can ‘&lt;em&gt;ask whatever we wish, and it will be done for us.&lt;/em&gt;’ (John 15:7 NIV) But, God is not a cosmic ATM. And prayer is not a punch–in–your–number and hold–out–your–hand kind of deal. We have to let His Spirit fill us with Jesus–desires. And as we read in the Gospels, Jesus’ main desire was to bring honour and glory to His Father (John 15:8, for example). When we pray for God’s awesomeness to be revealed through us/through our situation, He will always honour that (oh, and that does bring good things for us too, btw.) Not only do our prayers have power to change circumstances, they have power to change how we see God. The more time you spend with someone, the easier it is to know their feelings or how they’d respond to certain situations. Our relationship with God works the same. The more time we spend with Him, the easier it is to hear the Holy Spirit when we’re about to mess up, or to notice Him in daily routine. Set aside ‘listen to God’ time today. And, during it, ask Him to help you make a regular time with Him.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Come near to God and He will come near to you.' James 4:8 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prayer isn’t necessarily natural to us, because it’s about putting aside our self–sufficiency and our fleshly appetites, and seeking what God wants instead. We can’t wait around until we feel like praying, we’ve just got to do it. Prayer takes discipline. Think of paired ice skating. If the couple only practise when they feel like it, they aren’t going to be particularly in sync. She’ll jump into his arms before he’s there to catch her, and their Olympic careers will be less ‘first–place’ and more ‘face–plant’. Instead, they practise over and over, until they’re so synchronised it’s natural. Our prayer life with God works in the same way. If our goal is to synchronise His desires with ours, we have to struggle through the hard parts of prayer. No matter how busy our schedules are, or how bored we can get, we need to take the time every day to stumble back to it. The good thing is, it won’t always be a struggle. James 4:8 says if we ‘come near to God’, if we practise prayer and really seek Him, He will always come near to us and find us. Of course, even after it’s a regular discipline, there will be days (sometimes even weeks) when it feels lonely, boring or useless. But we have James 4:8 as a promise—when we look for Him, we will find Him. Set an email calendar appointment—pray the Lord’s Prayer (Matthew 6:9–13) every day at the same time for the next week. Use it to springboard into some extra prayer time with God.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Lord, where do I put my hope?' Psalm 39:7 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one’s life is a bed–of–roses/free–coffee–vouchers/whatever–your–idea–of–perfect–is. So, when we pretend that we’re ok when we’re not, we help to form a mirage of an ideal life. It doesn’t do anything but, well, if we’re honest, inflate our pride a bit. But, despite what our pride–nature wants us to think, we actually can’t get through life and all its discouragements on our own. Proverbs 28:26 NCV says: ‘&lt;em&gt;Those who trust in themselves are foolish&lt;/em&gt;.’ We need God, and we need each other. Psalm 48:14 NIV declares: ‘For this God is our God for ever and ever; He will be our guide even to the end.’ This whole Psalm has a lot to teach us about how to deal with discouraging times. The psalmist looks back on how God has already protected the Israelites, and they’re to use that to fuel their faith to believe He will bring them through whatever else will come their way. Wherever we are, God has brought us this far, and He’ll guide us forward if we depend on Him. If you’re dealing with something, talking about it with someone you trust is really important. Yes, God is your number one, always, but He made you to live in community with others. We are meant to support each other— Paul tells us to ‘&lt;em&gt;carry each other’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfil the law of Christ.&lt;/em&gt;’ (Galatians 6:2 NIV) Pick a coffee shop (or other delicious hangout place). Make a date for the week ahead to talk with someone you can discuss tough stuff with.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord.' Psalm 37:23 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever been snowboarding or skiing? It’s all about knee–flexibility—the key to dealing with all the unexpected turns on the way. Too rigid, and you lose balance and fall over. Analogy–time… We all have ideas about how we’d like our lives to turn out: go to this uni, or get that job. And it’s perfectly fine (wise, even) to make plans for where we’d like to go or things we’d like to do. But we have to be careful. Head on over to James 4:13–16. (Ouch. James knows how to pack a punch.) James 4:16 NIV says that we ‘&lt;em&gt;boast in our arrogant schemes&lt;/em&gt;.’ That’s where the problem lies, when it’s all about me me me, and we hold on so tightly to these plans. A good way to tell if our plans are problematic is if we honestly can’t imagine our lives without them. And of course, a good job or a loving spouse is awesome, but we shouldn’t need them to have a John 10:10 (‘&lt;em&gt;life to the full&lt;/em&gt;’) kind of life. And because nothing (but God) is certain, we never know where we’ll end up. We reckon the help for our daily plans is knee–flexibility. We’ve got to be kneeling and praying constantly, to make sure our plans are God’s plans, and that our attitudes and actions are ones He wants us to have. Basically, praying James 4:15 NIV all the time—‘&lt;em&gt;If it is the Lord’s will, we will live and do this or that&lt;/em&gt;.’ Check in with Jesus. Make ‘Jesus, what do you think of my plans?’ time today.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'He took bread, blessed and broke it.' Luke 24:30 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Communion&lt;/em&gt;. 1 Corinthians 11:27–29 NIV tells us: ‘&lt;em&gt;whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord... anyone who eats and drinks without recognising the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself.&lt;/em&gt;’ As potentially terrifying as these verses are, they also teach us a lot about Communion. It has power. Real, huge, power. So: think about what you’re doing. How many times have we taken Communion in a casual manner? The act of ‘breaking bread’ has waaaaay more history and significance than we can put into a half page reading here. So, let’s just focus on one important part: Communion is a time to remember Jesus’ sacrifice—His very real, physically painful sacrifice on the cross. That’s the sacrifice that provides the only way for us to have a relationship with God. Communion is the time when we’re asked to come before the One who offered Himself up, allowed His body to be ripped and broken by human weapons, in order for this hurtful humanity to be saved. It’s the time that Jesus Himself set aside for us to remember (Luke 22:14–20). And let’s not forget what He did, and still does, for us is absolutely world–changing. Literally. When He tore that veil, He tore up all separation between us and God. Because of His sacrifice, God can be with us always. It really is a big deal. Have a little poke around some concordances or Bible commentaries, and learn more about what Communion means.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Make everything according to the pattern I have shown you...' Exodus 25:40 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More often than not, the best way to make something good is to follow a good pattern. In the Bible, God gives the pattern for living life well. Sometimes these rules can seem ridiculous, considering the culture we currently live in, but God doesn’t give us these patterns to trap us. Actually, they are to free us. We might not see the benefits now (like when we forgive someone who doesn’t even care that they hurt us...) and we might not even see the benefits in this life. But making the decision to follow God’s pattern for our lives is always the right decision. Let’s be honest, ‘you only live once’ isn’t applicable to us as followers of Christ—and what we do in this life matters in the next (Matthew 16:27). Serious (and really difficult and actually impossible to do on our own) stuff. But, breathe a sigh of relief, because the Holy Spirit helps us to follow the pattern in order to produce the fruit of the Spirit: &lt;em&gt;‘love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, humility, and self–control&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Galatians 5:22–23 GNT) How do we do this? We have to surrender our life–patterns over to Him, choose to obey His Word over what we’re tempted to do and be sensitive to His voice. In return, the Spirit will work in us to follow God’s pattern and reveals Jesus through us. Brilliant. What patterns of anti–God’s–way do you need to let Him burn off to make room for new, Jesus–glorifying fruit? Talk to Him about removing them now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve probably heard people say that ‘there’s no such thing as a good deed, because everything we do is selfish.’ So, because it feels good to give, even giving things away is just something you do to make ourselves happy? Hmm. Sounds like they have humanity about cornered. Or maybe it’s just a tactical accusation to make us doubt our motives. It’s true that most choices (including giving) have a selfish component. But if we were totally selfish, we’d never give to anyone. Ever. It’s ok to want to be more satisfied than we are right now. That’s good. Christianity isn’t just about uninterested giving. God knows you want to be happy. But what matters is &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; we try to get that happiness from. God calls us to give our lives up for Him, for others, and, ultimately, for ourselves (Matthew 10:39). Walter Brueggemann pointed out there are three different types of Psalms: ones about orientation (‘I’m happy, everything’s great!’), disorientation (‘Ugh, everything’s suddenly terrible’), and new orientation (‘Woah. I’ve been picked up and put in a new place. God’s... surprised me!’). Flick through the Psalms and find one that suits where you’re at right now. Allow God to change your heart from the inside and be free to act in the way that God wants us to live, and He wants us to be happy. Including when we’re giving. Instead of feeling guilty, enjoy it! And, just like finding the solution to a tricky puzzle, discover that there’s a right, God–built–in way to live that’s deeply satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'How long must Your servant endure? When will You judge those who persecute me?' Psalm 119:84 NRS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the songs in the book of Psalms are songs of lament. Songs of being terrified and scrabbling for a way out. Psalm 22:6 NIV says: ‘&lt;em&gt;But I am a worm, and not a man, scorned by men and despised by the people&lt;/em&gt;.’ Psalm 79:2 GNT says: ‘&lt;em&gt;They left the bodies of your people for the vultures&lt;/em&gt;.’ Dark, huh? These Psalms, and the fact that there are so many, are actually a bit of a gift. When you think about it, how often do we try to gloss over our sad faces? With others, with our leaders, with our family—never mind with God. The Psalms face up to the brutality life can throw at us. In hard times, leaders can often tell us to ‘have more faith’. The Psalms don’t. They give us words to speak to God, and they’re not always nice words. ‘God, how could You let this happen? I trusted You, and You failed me.’ Strange to read, especially if we’re used to ‘always be happy’ talk. But you can be bold with God. Cry out, even. Trust that He gets your harsh words, where you’re coming from and that you’re in safe hands. God is still Love, He’s still ‘Almighty God’, and He’s still worthy of your respect (there’s a real difference between ‘be raw with God’ and ‘abuse God’). But He can handle your raw, real feelings. Like yesterday, flick through the Psalms and find one that fits an angry, rage–filled time. Equip yourself with it, for a time when you may need it. Remember, God can handle your disorientation.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'We wait for the blessed hope--the glorious appearing of our...Saviour, Jesus Christ.' Titus 2:13 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last two days we’ve seen that Christianity is supposed to give you real happiness (Jesus brings peace for us, with God and with others), and that it is sturdy enough to give you words for times of gut–wrenching pain (the Psalms tell us that our relationship with God is big enough to carry our brokenness). What does this mean for the idea that Christians are supposed to be the happy joyful ones? It reorients it completely. When you’ve been through hurt and had God pick you up out of it, however long it took, you suddenly see what God’s faithfulness really is. If you’re used to thinking that God’s love is all flowers and violin solos, then experiencing pain can push you into cynicism. But, seeing God then step in and take you out of that pain and pull you out of the pit He’s allowed you to be in, can re–teach you about who He is. This re–orientation doesn’t take you back to where, or who, you were before. The gift of His faithfulness to you is not about letting you stay safe, cosy and wrapped in cottonwool. The joy that comes when God pulls you through pain is real and new and all the new possibilities that come with it could not have happened if you hadn’t been through the pain. Go back again to the Psalms. Flick through and pick one that sums up today’s idea of ‘reorientation’ (Psalm 30 is a good one). Keep it, not just for when you need it, but to guide you through every season of your life.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['You too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives.' Ephesians 2:22 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stuff you might already know: Jesus gave His life for you. He died for you to bring you new life. Which is pretty awesome. And it doesn’t stop there. It’s not just an individual thing: ‘&lt;em&gt;Christ…loved the Church and gave Himself for her&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Ephesians 5:25 NKJ) His design isn’t that you come to know Him and then carry on with your own thing exactly as before. In case you hadn’t noticed by now, we reckon doing this Church–as–body–in–community thing is really important. Realising who Jesus is and what He’s done for you is the vital first step, but God wants most of the other steps in your life to involve others who know Him: Hebrews 10:25 NIV instructs us to make sure we’re ‘&lt;em&gt;not giving up meeting together.&lt;/em&gt;’ Why? Because when we’re together we’re ‘&lt;em&gt;a dwelling in which God lives by His Spirit&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Ephesians 2:22 NIV) When we’re living our faith with others, we can have confidence that our efforts at being ‘Church’ isn’t a hit–and–miss ordeal. It’s God’s design. Welcoming newbies is important. The idea is to do it in the same way we’ve been accepted by God: ‘&lt;em&gt;Receive one another, just as Christ…received [you]&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Romans 15:7 NKJ) And yes, that’s not a piece of cake. It’s probably several coffees, chats and relationship–building conversations later that a never–heard–much–of–Jesus/ isn’t–Church–for–old–people/ new–to–the–faith person will start to see what Church is meant to be. So whether your church life is tightly connected or you’re struggling to fit in, remember this: you’re not designed to do life on your own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Heb 9:1-11:16; Luke 10:13-24; Ps 28; Pro 5:3-6 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65500&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Make up your mind not to put any stumbling block...in your brother's way.' Romans 14:13 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Every not–yet–a–Christian person you speak to has a reason why they’re not ready to get to know Jesus. Sometimes, that reason will be a big hurt, not a lack of knowledge about faith. It may be something they feel they can’t help but hold against the Church, or against God Himself—maybe a nasty experience of ‘religion’, or a life experience they blame God for. That’s tricky, and can be a deeply sad situation. It can also be a perfect chance to show the true meaning and heart of Christianity—the love of Jesus. If you’ve met someone like this (or been in this position) before, you’ll know it can’t be fixed over a single cup of coffee. It needs to be a slow, gentle process that’s really all about showing love. That might look like a listening ear, an apology, or even a difficult conversation where you admit you don’t know all the answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Easy? No. But, through patience and prayer, God can do some serious work. Keep close to Him, keep open and honest with the hurting person and, slowly, they’ll begin to see God for themselves; not just through you. Don’t think this is relevant to you? One day you’re sure to meet someone in need of this kind of restoration. So, get thinking. And praying. Is there someone who you know has a block sitting between them and getting to know God? Pray that God will begin to show you the right way to help them take the block down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Ok. So we’ve thought about how people may have been hurt, and how that can put up a block. There’s another big reason people can be put off Christianity: they have a certain idea of how it’ll play out. People see the Church in a million different ways, and some of the ways they see it can be less than inviting. And, by extension, they think the same of Christianity in general: centuries out of date with the real world, full of restrictive rules and weird lingo (&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;splagchnizomai&lt;/em&gt;, anyone?), obsessed with emptying your wallet. We know that idea isn’t quite right, but it’s still a real barrier between some people and God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;So what do we do? We think the best thing to do is be honest. Opening up to the fact that the Church is a huge body of believers is a good start, but it also leaves plenty of room for error. Sometimes the preaching is boring. Sometimes the conversation and after–service tea are equally weak. But there’s a flipside: that isn’t what Church is about. Church is about welcoming everyone. Maybe to change someone’s idea of Church, you’ll not only have to be honest about its shortcomings, but confident in the fact that God moves through Christians. What has God done in your life, through the Church or in a personal way? Don’t shy away from sharing it.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...If we could control our tongues, we...could also control ourselves in every other way.' James 3:2 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The Bible talks a lot about the power of words. And it would know. It’s made of them. Let’s have a look:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;(1) Proverbs 29:20 NKJ says: ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Do you see a man hasty in his words? There is more hope for a fool than for him&lt;/em&gt;.’ Ever been ‘hasty in words’ (or on the receiving end of some)—spoken before you’ve realised what’s coming out of your mouth? Hmm. We all have. And it hurts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;(2) How about Psalm 5:9 NKJ? ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;There is no faithfulness in their mouth…they flatter with their tongue&lt;/em&gt;.’ When was the last time you told someone what they wanted to hear, despite it being a complete lie? Being unfaithful in your words can come back to bite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;(3) Finally, Matthew 7:1 NKJ says: ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Judge not, that you be not judged&lt;/em&gt;.’ Hypocritical judgment starts small. It often starts behind people’s backs. Yup, we’ve all been there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Alright, so we already know that we shouldn’t lie and speak badly of people. But how seriously do we take that? Words are really, really powerful things. They can change people’s opinions in an instant. And the words that we hear said about us stick with us, sometimes forever. We could all be more careful with what we say. Maybe we don’t go around making a verbal burn book, but we can still hurt people by launching into some sharp sarcasm without thinking or through our quick convenience lies. When you’re about to let negativity slip from your mouth, catch it, flip it and find something positive to say instead. If negative words escape out of your mouth before you can catch them, look straight away for three positive things to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Num 14-15, Luke 7:11-23, Ps 107:23-32, Prov 3:25-26&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63573&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted there by the devil.' Matthew 4:1 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the start of His public ministry. Jesus has walked into the desert, guided by the Holy Spirit. No food. No shelter. No friends. Why? He’s deliberately removed Himself from those helpful things in order to grow closer to His Father. But there’s a sly presence in the desert with Him, out to do Him real harm. The devil tempts Jesus to miraculously create His own food, throw Himself off a building and ask for unlimited power. The common factor in these temptations is this: ‘Stop trusting that Your Father cares for you. If God can’t provide food, protection, and purpose, then what’s He good for? Just take it Yourself.’ Jesus’ hunger and fatigue makes it an opportune moment for the enemy to launch an attack on the core of His love for His Father. Jesus (not just fully God, but also fully human, remember…) really could have chosen against His Father. But the immense trust Jesus chose to invest in Father God at this point strengthened Him on His lonely journey to the cross. He was leaving no space for any dangerous half–doubts as to whether His Father might have His back. The trust Jesus had for His Father was demonstrated through 40 tough desert days. Amazingly, we get given this faith as a gift. Where are you tempted to stop trusting that your Father cares for you and take things for yourself? Realise that these are opportunities to get closer to the Father, and turn in trust to Him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Exo 16:1-35; John 6:30-40 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65484&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Temptation comes from our own desires, which entice us and drag us away.' James 1:14 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a war out there. And the enemy can, and does, use your own moves against you. In yesterday’s story (if you read further in the Bible passage) Satan started mouthing off Scripture against Jesus. God’s own Word used against God. It might seem a bit of a weird strategy, but it’s something that can trip us all up and be used against us. Satan’s attempt to twist God’s powerful Word against God Himself was ingenious. Of course, because Jesus was on to it, He was able to identify the lies. But the attack strategy is still crafty as. How so? The enemy goes after our weak points, sure, but he also attacks our strengths and the things we lean on for support—places where we feel comfortable. Whether it’s your knowledge of the Bible, or some good thing you think you have complete control over (great self discipline, helpful conversations with others, a hobby you love), there’s a real danger to watch out for there. The enemy took Scripture out of context and attacked Jesus with it. Don’t let the enemy take good (even Godly) things out of their right context and use them to attack you. Instead do what Jesus did. The enemy used Scripture, and what did Jesus do? The same. ‘&lt;em&gt;Jesus responded, “The Scriptures also say, ‘You must not test the Lord your God.’”&lt;/em&gt;’ (Matthew 4:7 NLT) Whatever you’re being tested with, even Scripture, getting to know your Bible better front–to–back will give you the context to spot the enemy’s craftiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Num 16-18; Luke 7:24-35; Ps 107:33-43; Pro 3:27-28&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65485&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['My power works best in weakness.' 2 Corinthians 12:9 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Know those times when one thing after another after another after another just seems to be going wrong? You’re not abandoned! Author CS Lewis wrote this in a letter to a good friend on January 20, 1942, at the very height of the Second World War: ‘No amount of falls will really undo us if we keep on picking ourselves up each time. We shall of course be very muddy and tattered children by the time we reach home. But the bathrooms are all ready, the towels put out, and the clean clothes are in the airing cupboard. The only fatal thing is to lose one’s temper and give it up. It is when we notice the dirt that God is most present to us: it is the very sign of His presence.’ CS Lewis knew that when we’re weak, messy and completely unable to save ourselves, then it’s God’s moment—if we let Him. At those times, we learn that He never wants us to have to do life all on our own. And we learn an almost secret truth: God doesn’t like it when we fall over, but He loves it if we turn to Him for help and allow Him to show Himself strong on our behalf. So, if you see one of those ‘ugh everything is going wrong’ Facebook statuses, then it’s time to pray for God to pick that person up from the dirt. Even if—&lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; if—the person is you. God’s power in your life shows itself most clearly at your point of weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Num 19-21; Luke 7:36-50; Ps 111; Pro 3:29-30&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65486&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Don't you know Me...?' John 14:9 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know those awkward moments when you’re about to introduce your best buddy to an old friend— —and suddenly you can’t think of anyone’s name? Today’s verse is involves a similarly embarrassing moment in the friendship of Jesus and His follower and friend, Phillip. Jesus’ conversations, actions, and instructions had always been about showing who God the Father was, and then this little interchange happened:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘If you know Me, you know My Father,’ said Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Show us your Father, then!’ retorted Phillip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Don’t you know Me…?’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phillip had missed a crucial part of who Jesus was, even though he’d spent so much time with Him. If you were asked questions like ‘What upsets Jesus?’ or ‘What would He like to see happen most in your family / workplace / college?’ or ‘What makes Him happy?’, what would your answer be? Would you be able to give one that reflected what Jesus would say? Or, like Phillip, maybe you’re still wondering what Jesus is really all about, at the most basic level. If you’re not sure, it’s time to start digging around to see what Jesus really has to say about Himself. The best way to get to do that is, &lt;em&gt;ta–da!&lt;/em&gt;, to look in the Bible. God’s desire is always for you to know Him more. If you’ve dropped the habit of reading your Bible, or haven’t had it in a while, why not start reading it each day. SoulFood is here to help you. It’s designed to enable you read through the Bible in easy bite–sized chunks in just one year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Num 22-24; Luke 8:1-15; Ps 108; Pro 3:31-32&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65487&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Sensible people will see trouble coming and avoid it, but an unthinking person will walk right into it and regret it later.' Proverbs 27:12 GNT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes things just happen that trip you up, whether it’s within your family, your friendship group or something out of the blue. But just like King Solomon in the Bible tells us, we should be prepared for the toast to land butter side down. Ok, ok, he didn’t put it exactly like that but he did tell us days of trouble are inevitable. Why does the Bible record the failures of the greats like Abraham, Moses, Elijah and Peter? To give us hope; to let us know nobody performs flawlessly; to help us believe if they can do it then, by God’s grace, we can too. If you’re walking in God’s path, you’re bound to come across trouble. Satan doesn’t bother to lay traps on the wrong path. It’s when you’re on the right path, you’ll run into the most enemies, the most challenges (and the most adventure). The more we head in the direction God has laid out for us, the more the enemy is going to try and stop us from heading down it. So we need to anticipate trouble and avoid it. God promises that ‘&lt;em&gt;no weapon forged against you will prevail&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Isaiah 54:17 NIV) And that’s why we can look ahead—knowing Satan hasn’t got power over the future. God’s got that. If you’re the kind of person who tends to think only in the moment, then pray to God that you develop a ‘trouble–sensor’ so you know ahead of time when to start presenting the problem to God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Num 25-26; Luke 8:16-25; Ps 120; Pro 3:33-35&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65488&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.' Matthew 5:9 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being willing to look past differences; commending people to each other; tactfully steering on–the–edge conversations in a different direction; this is the stuff that a peacemaker should be geared up for. ‘&lt;em&gt;You’ll be called children of God&lt;/em&gt;,’ says Jesus about these sorts of people. That’d be a fairly cool thing to be called by someone (and by Jesus Christ, no less.) Hmm. But what if you’re not the peaceable sort, deep down? What if inner turmoil, unresolved issues or a few weighty chips on your shoulder are stopping you from building bridges of peace with other people? A good place to start would be this: do you want to feel anger whenever you think of specific people who get on your nerves, or would you rather be reconciled with them? Are you quite happy to carry on feeling anxious about by them, or would you rather feel at ease even with people who bother you? The bonus about any decision to be a peacemaker is it heightens your own sense of wellbeing. Still God wants you to be a peacemaker for the other person’s sake. Start by asking Him, not for a nice peaceful vibe for yourself, but for genuine patience with especially difficult people. Pray for them and plan ahead as to how you might respond to conflict or argument. Commit to practising peace with them. And, all through the process, keep talking to God about the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Num 27-29; Luke 8:26-39; Ps 67; Pro 4:1-2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65489&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God's grace.' Ephesians 1:7 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Gospel stories we come across a man called Peter, famous for his brash declarations of love for Jesus, and then skittishly running away from his own words. He was one of Jesus’ disciples and he messed up, big time. Even though he promised he’d always follow Jesus whatever the cost, when it came to the crunch he denied (three times...) that he even knew Him. Dark days. But when Jesus met him after His resurrection He did an amazing thing—He forgave him without hesitation. Then Jesus told him, ‘&lt;em&gt;Follow me&lt;/em&gt;.’ God is always willing to forgive you if you repent when you’ve messed up, so that it doesn’t get in the way of your relationship with Him. A mate hurt you? Jesus still forgave Peter even though he had right royally failed Him. Jesus didn’t hold a grudge. Not for Peter, and not for you when you mess up too. ‘&lt;em&gt;In accordance with the riches&lt;/em&gt;’ of that grace, make sure you’re not holding grudges against a person. God is not finished with them yet—so should you be? In the meantime, He doesn’t want us grudge–keeping. Can you match that? Before you take communion at church this week, get in touch with someone who you feel you’ve broken off communication with, whether your fault or theirs. Jesus tells us: ‘&lt;em&gt;Leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled...then come and offer your gift&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Matthew 5:24 NIV) That’s crystal clear as to what we should do to reconcile with people—so see how this will help with your relationships in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Num 30:1-32:24; Luke 8:40-56; Ps 125; Pro 4:3-4 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65490&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I press on toward the goal for the prize.' Philippians 3:14 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could spend a day on YouTube looking up videos of people doing stupid things in public who then wished the ground would swallow them up. Never mind stupid public moments—it’s far more painful when we feel that way about our sin. Sometimes we can look back on our lives and still feel ashamed about the stuff we did around people, even though we’ve already been through the process of saying sorry to God and them. We can’t change our past (despite Doctor Who/Marty McFly/all other time travellers) and sometimes our mistakes do have long–term consequences, but God calls us to look forward, not back. We can learn from our mistakes without dwelling on them. That’s what Paul was getting at when he said: ‘…&lt;em&gt;forgetting what is behind and straining towards what is ahead&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Philippians 3:13 NIV) So, next time you find yourself looking back, remember that (a) you’ll probably trip over if you’re not looking where you’re going (which would just be another moment to add to that embarrassing fails list) and (b) believers are forgiven. God’s already got your back. Turn and face the future. If you don’t, it’ll be like putting a cup of water on a table, turning your back and trying to pick up the cup with two hands. Pretty tricky, right? But that’s just what it’s like when we try to grasp God’s truth still looking the other way—it’s a mess waiting to happen. So keep yourself pointed in God’s direction: He’s on your side and wants you to look ahead with Him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Isa 53:1-12; Acts 8:26-40 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65491&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Life does not consist in an abundance of possessions.' Luke 12:14 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why does it seem like God is so against us wanting the good stuff in life? Well, maybe He’s not. Sometimes we get caught up in chasing the stuff that we believe is good, and neglect the real, Godly, ‘good stuff’. Since God made us, He alone knows what can, and will, truly satisfy us. Jesus’ parable in Luke 12:16–21 talks about a guy who goes after all the best stuff (in this case, crops), and thinks if he stores it all up he’ll be fine. But here’s the problem, if we do like this guy did and go filling up our metaphorical barns with crops/clothes/other–delicious–but–worldly–stuff, we leave little room for God (look at verse 21). With no room for God, we push away the offer of salvation and leave no opportunity for Him to fill, renew and change us. We also miss out on sharing the truly good stuff with others. Let’s put it like this: if you had a warehouse full of clothes, you’d have decent threads for a lifetime (especially if you’re not sharing them...) But fill it with God and you’d not only have an abundance of His deep–joy bringing presence, but it’s the sort that only increases when you share Him with others. Having ‘stuff’ isn’t wrong; in fact, God can bless others through it. Open up your barn and have a look at what you have stored there. What has taken the place of God and can be shared with others?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Num 32:25-33:56; Luke 9:1-17; Ps 134; Pro 4:5-13 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65492&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['God is working in you, giving you the desire and the power to do what pleases Him.' Philippians 2:13 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a question: what are you afraid of? Bees, spiders, maybe even just the dark? Here’s an even bigger question: are you afraid of using your God–given abilities? Ouch. That last one might have had more sting than a bee, because it’s often something we struggle with. The ‘but–I’m–not–good–enough’ culture makes its way around the church. A lot of the time we naturally strive to be the best we can be; we love to succeed. But there’s a difference between serving God and striving for ourselves. God isn’t after the world’s view of ‘success’. He’s after a sincere heart and a disciple ready to use their gifts for His glory. 2 Chronicles 16:9 NIV says: &lt;em&gt;‘For the eyes of the Lord range throughout the Earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to Him.&lt;/em&gt;’ Wow, sounds pretty big, right? It is. And we don’t get left with a flat–pack and a confusing manual. God encourages us through His Word (the Bible), and we’re told to use our gifts to benefit others and to bring glory to His name (take a look at Romans 12:6–8). So, next time you feel a bit hesitant about your abilities, remember whose strength you’re relying on, and be encouraged to start to use them. Get a wise friend or older Christian to pray with you about the desires and passions God is putting on your heart. Write them down and ask God to use them in the right way as well as take the sting from any anxiety you have. Let go of your fear!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Num 34-36; Luke 9:18-27; Ps 138; Pro 4:14-17 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65493&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her.' Ephesians 5:25 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perfect worship, faultless preaching, sinless people and delicious food. Sounds like the perfect church? Yes. Does it exist? No. (And not just because church food normally consists of budget biscuits.) Even though we know the perfect church doesn’t exist, we can still find ourselves complaining about the Church* instead of doing something about it. In Ephesians 5:22–33 we get some pretty direct instructions about our attitude towards the Church. The passage describes Jesus as the head of the Church (Ephesians 5:23) and us as His bride (Ephesians 5:24–25). It’s a pretty picture, but what does it actually mean? It means we should respect and love the Church, being keen to see it grow and develop to become more like what Jesus desires. How does that happen? In verse Ephesians 5:29 we’re reminded that just like our human bodies, the Church needs nourishment—in the form of a real, meaty, Bible–based diet that comes from Christ. It also talks about Jesus caring for the Church, something we should be passionate about too. We need to care about the future of the Church, even when it’s looking more like bride–zilla than wife material. And this change of attitude starts with us! Jesus loves your church with all its imperfections—look at it the way He does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;* &lt;em&gt;Church (big C) = the name for all of God’s people, through all time; church (little c) = the name for one group/meeting/meeting place of God’s people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Jonah 1-4; Luke 9:28-36; Ps 141; Pro 4:18-19 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65494&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['And you are living stones that God is building into His spiritual temple.' 1 Peter 2:5 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right, so we go to church but we are the Church? The Oxford English Dictionary describes ‘church’ as ‘a building used for public Christian worship’. But not everyone will set foot into a church building in their lifetime (some people actively avoid it), so we need to take Church to them. We’re like a motorhome of worship. Which kind of puts today’s verse into a bit more context—being living stones, we can take ‘church’ past the four walls of the building. Great, but do we have the authority and ability to do that? Well, 1 Peter 2:9 NIV describes us as ‘&lt;em&gt;a royal priesthood&lt;/em&gt;’ and ‘&lt;em&gt;a holy nation&lt;/em&gt;’, which basically means that, having been the recipients of God’s mercy, we’re now accredited trainers (authorised) in God’s love. That’s quite a big deal. What about the ability part, though? Are we strong enough to be Church in the real world? Yep, God’s got that covered too. We’re ‘&lt;em&gt;living stones&lt;/em&gt;’ (1 Peter 2:5 NIV) because life’s been breathed into us through the Holy Spirit. Think of that as super–powered Spirit–petrol in the tank. We go out in Christ–led, Spirit–filled power, and we have a pretty amazing example to follow in Jesus, the cornerstone: take a look at Ephesians 2:20. The cornerstone is the first stone set in the foundation of a building. It’s super important, because all other stones are arranged around this particular stone. Ask God how you can be a ‘living stone’ to build the body of Christ—the Church, remembering that Jesus loves His Church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Titus 1-3; Luke 9:37-45; Ps 145:1-13; Pro 4:20-22 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65495&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The glory of the Lord filled the house of the Lord.' 1 Kings 8:11 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have a read of 1 Kings 8:1–21. Let’s set the scene: King Solomon has built this incredible temple. If temples were cars, this one would have been a Ferrari. Having taken seven years to build it, it was worth having a bit of a celebration, so he invited lots of important people to bring the Ark of the Covenant (the holy box with the original stones of the Ten Commandments inside) inside. They put it in the inner sanctuary, the Most Holy room (1 Kings 8:6). And then God showed up. His glory came in a cloud, and He filled the temple (1 Kings 8:10). Pretty cool, but what does it all mean in our modern day Church? It means that, if we want to be people filled with God’s presence (you know, now that we’re the walking, talking temple of the Holy Spirit… see 1 Corinthians 6:19–20) we’ve got to ensure that God takes centre stage in the Church. Not a worship leader or preacher. The Ark of the Covenant was less about the objects it contained and more about the fact it meant that the presence of God was with them. Reminder time: get a bit arty and cut a cloud shape out of some paper, write 1 Corinthians 6:19 (‘&lt;em&gt;Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own.&lt;/em&gt;’) on the back and put it in your purse/wallet as a reminder that God’s presence lives in you. You are meant to make a difference wherever you go as you carry God’s glory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Thess 1-5; Luke 9:46-56; Ps 145:14-21; Pro 4:23-24 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65496&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

Well here is some deeper stuff to take note of in that body analogy: (1) &lt;em&gt;We need each other&lt;/em&gt;. People can offer stuff you can’t, and you can offer stuff other people need. We need to be inter–dependent (1 Corinthians 12:21–22). (2) &lt;em&gt;Unity is major&lt;/em&gt;. This means we need to be willing to work together. It doesn’t mean we have to all like the same stuff or even agree on every topic. (Unity doesn’t mean we should compromise on the essentials of the faith.) (3) &lt;em&gt;All body parts are important&lt;/em&gt;. Without ears we can’t hear, but if the whole body were an ear it wouldn’t be a body anymore (1 Corinthians 12:17–20). It would just be one gigantic mutant ear—useless. And weird. (4) &lt;em&gt;We need to be more like a real body&lt;/em&gt;. Paul is chatting about stuff that could never happen in a physical body—a foot couldn’t get jealous and wish it was a hand. And yet, in the body of Christ it happens. How do we guard against it? We choose to love the diversity in the Church and we exercise whatever our particular body part is. When we stretch our body and get on with serving we will be growing and strengthening the Church. Individual but working inter–dependently…mutant ear avoided. Think of a three–legged race. It’s a joint effort, right? Just like that, we’ve got to get in step with others in Church and be willing to work together as one body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Heb 1-4; Luke 9:57-62; Ps 149; Pro 4:25-27 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65497&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['If My people who are called by My name will humble themselves...' 2 Chronicles 7:14 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, we’ve established that Church is a place for not–perfect people, that you’ve got a part to play, and that it’s all about God. So what about when we get it properly right? How do we keep it up? If a church is doing well, and is full of the glory of God, then the only way it will keep itself from an ego–overload is by passing that glory straight back to Jesus. Yes. All of it. In the book of 2 Chronicles, you’ll find even more about Solomon’s temple. God promised to carry on working with the people (and us) to ‘&lt;em&gt;forgive their sin and heal their land&lt;/em&gt;’ (2 Chronicles 7:14 NIV), if we do a very important thing: Get humble. The Hebrew in today’s verse for the word ‘humble’ is &lt;em&gt;kana′&lt;/em&gt;, meaning ‘&lt;em&gt;to bring low&lt;/em&gt;’. This can be done by prayer, in the first place. The best kind of prayer is supposed to be simple—we can pray when we see or hear about someone. Saying sorry (out loud, not to yourself) and not holding people’s pasts against them are two humility top–ups. Knowing how much God has done on our part already (giving His Son Jesus) is the key to this. That’s what ‘lowering’ yourself looks like (see Hebrews 2:9. Also Philippians 2:7–8.) Humility isn’t just a way to put others first, it’s also a way to protect yourself when things are going really well for you. ‘&lt;em&gt;God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble&lt;/em&gt;.’ (James 4:6 NKJ) Today, look for a way to delight in a situation where someone else is being blessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Isa 9:1-7; Luke 2:1-7; Matt 4:12-16 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65498&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Lord will lift up a standard [shield of defence].' Isaiah 59:19 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solomon had some serious confidence in God. Check it out in 2 Chronicles 6:26–31. He’s pretty confident that life won’t be easy for God’s people, so he doesn’t wait around; he brings it before God. Then what? He recognises the need for God’s people to bring everything before God together: ‘&lt;em&gt;When a prayer or plea is made by anyone among your people Israel&lt;/em&gt;.’ (1 Kings 8:38 NIV) And he trusts that God will keep them close, so that they can ‘…&lt;em&gt;fear you and walk in obedience to you.&lt;/em&gt;’ (2 Chronicles 6:31 NIV) Quite a nice little pray–obey–pray cycle there. See, God wants us to rally together with other Christians and pray. Does it grab God’s attention and remind Him to ‘&lt;em&gt;lift up a shield&lt;/em&gt;’ (Isaiah 59:19) for you? Not really—God is not ‘forgetful’. But how much stronger and life–impacting can faith be when we remember we’re not alone? Prayer solidifies a higher–than–just–church–friends bond: regardless of what you’re praying for, it’s been a fact through the ages that ‘&lt;em&gt;He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Psalm 91:1 NKJ) So, when we dwell in that prayer–place at the same time as others, we’re drawn together under God’s protective shadow. Praying together keeps you vulnerable to each other, protected by God, and your faith is stronger when shared. If your church runs a regular prayer meeting (the chances are good), go along. If there’s not one, why don’t you ask to arrange one? There’s always something to pray about—whether it’s thanks, or prayer in a time of need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Heb 5-8; Luke 10:1-12; Ps 5; Pro 5:1-2 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65499&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...after you have suffered a while, the God of all grace will perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle you.' 1 Peter 5:10 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;God sees the Church as finished—‘&lt;em&gt;complete in Him&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Colossians 2:10 NKJ) The Church is as saved right now as we’ll be when we stand in Heaven. But, yeah, look up the news headlines. Chances are if you scroll enough, the Church will be mentioned in there somewhere, looking as if we’re making gigantic idiots of ourselves. (Sometimes it’s media bias but sometimes we really &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; being foolish.) Some Christians would rather only think about the Church in its perfected, free–from–sin state, in Heaven. Great. But. Looking only at that understanding of Church takes our eye off the reality of the broken brothers and sisters around us who aren’t perfect, who need our prayers and practical help now. It also stops us looking out for the glorious moments when that perfect Church breaks through into this world, and makes us less keen for the process of a community growing together through the Spirit. ‘&lt;em&gt;We all…beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image…by the Spirit of the Lord&lt;/em&gt;.’ (2 Corinthians 3:18 NKJ) That’s today, now. The Holy Spirit is at work in Church life every day, in every way (really), moulding us into the image of Jesus. That means we don’t look only to the one–day–will–be perfect Church, or look only at the messy, broken Church as it is today, but look to the Christ at the centre, where all is stillness and He remains the same, being powerful to change us. Give thanks that God loves His Church, right now, just as it is! And pray that the Church can look outward to those who need it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Num 6:1-21; Matt 4:1-17; Mark 2:18-22; Luke 9:23-26 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65501&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['He departed again to the mountain by Himself alone.' John 6:15 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you were always wandering off alone at random points in the day, people would slap a label on you pretty fast: loner, likes your own company, drifter, introvert, whatever. They’d be wondering what you were doing. Just as Jesus’ friends wondered about His times alone in the mountains. Was this just a bit of Me–time? What was Jesus doing up before dawn? He’d disappear whenever people wanted something more from Him, like trying to make Him king. Was something else going on? Jesus was away from anyone else on earth, but this wasn’t space for Me–time. It was time to spend with His Father—real time, in real conversation. What was the draw? Along with all the helpful prayer requests that He was probably dropping in, He was also getting back to His source. He was making sure to keep firmly in control of a life that could have been pulled away from His Father by so many distractions. He was grounding it in real experiences of joyful meeting with Him. Can you really have that shared space with God in a way that charges you with joy, launches you into the day with a spring in your step? Yes. Your time with God is not your alone time. You’re sharing it. Make your time with God your well–kept secret. Have a regular early morning space with Him (or if you have that anyway, take it extra slow) and, without making it about you, see if other people notice the difference in you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Heb 11:17-13:25; Luke 10:25-37; Ps 33:1-12; Pro 5:7-14 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65502&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you.' Matthew 5:44 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the old ‘&lt;em&gt;love your enemies&lt;/em&gt;’ verse gets quoted too many times, it becomes easy to ignore. ‘&lt;em&gt;Enemies&lt;/em&gt;’ can become a big group that includes the sort of people who lightly tread your personal like/dislike line, not just the people who are more than intolerable and fry your brain when you think about them. Today’s translation of the verse gives it back some of the ‘meat’ it might be missing for you. ‘&lt;em&gt;Those who spitefully use you&lt;/em&gt;.’ Mmmh. That’s beyond ‘sort of enemy’ status, that hits some bitter ground. Try thinking of people who make you feel like that. Thinking about people who have hurt you is hard, and it can cause you to take out your anger in other ways—like punching pillows or writing furious blogs. This is a common way we try to ‘get over’ our anger, but it’s scientifically a bit questionable: all it does is reinforce the anger mode in your brain. And now some actual practical help: you can make some gestures of helping and loving people you really dislike, but getting to the place where you can genuinely love your enemies from your heart might mean going through a few stages first. So. Part one of the process. If you’re struggling to get rid of some anger, try this. Just stop. Tell God how angry you are. He’s ok with that. (See, for instance, Psalm 83 where Asaph told God just exactly what he’d like done to His enemies.) Then ask God for help to park up those feelings for the moment, so you get on with your day. Come back tomorrow and we’ll talk more about dealing with this most difficult of problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Kings 1-2; Luke 10:38-42; Ps 33:13-22; Pro 5:15-20 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65503&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Then the Lord said, &quot;Is it right for you to be angry?&quot;' Jonah 4:4 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Don’t complain. That attitude isn’t of God. Just rejoice!’ How many times have you heard that, or a variation of that, in church? Anger gets a bad rep in Christian circles. Lots of ‘super–holy’ people see it as just cynicism or bitterness, and not something a good church–goer should be going through. Jonah’s bitterness against a whole city of people nearly took him over the edge, to the point where he could have happily watched that whole community, kids and all, burn to the ground. God waited with Jonah, showing him His patience and wanting him to share in it. So, yes, anger’s not something to dwell on. But it’s so much worse to pretend to be happy and ‘over it’ when you’re actually broiling with anger. Breaking the pattern means taking the anger to God as often as it bubbles up. That way, you can be freed to love your enemies from the heart. Feeling anger isn’t wrong. Letting it take root is. To stop it taking root, though, you have to process it (work through it) and do what it takes to get it out of your system. How? When the feeling rises, know it for what it is—‘this is anger’—without trying to pretend you don’t feel it. Then, examine where it’s coming from—‘is this from a real wrong that’s been done to me? Is my reaction legit?’ —and talk out what caused (not how angry you are) it with a trusted and wise friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Kings 3-5; Luke 11:1-13; Ps 36; Pro 5:21-23 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65504&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Warn... those who are out of line.' 1 Thessalonians 5:14 AMP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We tend to shy away from confronting others with truth. ‘Why can’t we just sit back and let people get on with whatever they want?’ Answer: ‘We’re all part of the Body of Christ—the Church.’ And the healthier/less distracted we (the parts) are, the more effective we’re likely to be, as a whole Church. See, if we’re saturating ourselves in God–time, getting closer to Him and His will, things that don’t match His will start to stand out. Look up at today’s verse: it’s up to us to call others out when it seems they’re straying. But, how do we do that without: (a) &lt;em&gt;Getting proud of ourselves for not falling into the same trap&lt;/em&gt; and/or (b) &lt;em&gt;Going in all–guns–blazing and causing more harm than good&lt;/em&gt;? Well, Paul says: ‘…&lt;em&gt;be patient with everyone&lt;/em&gt;.’ (1 Thessalonians 5:14 NIV) That way, those we need to confront may be patient with us. And, recognising that sin isn’t a public affair. Jesus tells us to always begin the ‘you’re–a–bit–wrong–there’ process with a private conversation (Matthew 18:15–17). Here it is then: confronting someone if they seem to be straying from God–ideals isn’t a bad shout. But ‘&lt;em&gt;speaking the truth in love&lt;/em&gt;’ (Ephesians 4:15) needs care and attention. Not willing to do more than just tell someone off, nor to help them through a rough patch? Might be worth praying about whether you should be the one to approach them. Has God placed people in your life recently to confront you to guide your actions? If so, be grateful. Thank them for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Ps 23; John 10:7-18 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65505&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['In everything set them an example...' Titus 2:7 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Gospels, you’ll be able to see that Jesus’ whole life was about showing mankind how to live. The time between Him coming to earth and Him giving His life up to save us wasn’t just ‘filling in’ time; it was when He lived out the perfect way of how to be human. ‘&lt;em&gt;Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me; or at least believe on the evidence of the works themselves&lt;/em&gt;.’ (John 14:11 NIV) Jesus tells us the things He spent His life on earth doing reflected the very nature of God. Whoever was watching Him was being shown a reflection of Love. And, because every action was centred in His being God, there’s proper integrity (Titus 2:7) from one action to the next. Jesus’ integrity is entirely based in the love of God, and that love is in every action. That means that, when He said, ‘&lt;em&gt;Father, if You are willing, take this cup from Me; yet not My will, but Yours be done&lt;/em&gt;’ (Luke 22:42 NIV), He was wholeheartedly admitting that He wasn’t looking forward to being nailed to a cross (understandably). But… He was also saying that He loves us enough (He loves you and me enough), to have the integrity to go through with His Father’s will rather than submit to His own human vulnerability. That’s consistency for you. And that’s our example—love–inspired integrity to do God’s will, over any of our own human fear or dismay. So, follow His example and pray ‘not my will, but Yours’ in your time with God today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Kings 6-7; Luke 11:14-28; Ps 40:1-8; Pro 6:1-5 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65506&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...that you may be successful wherever you go.' Joshua 1:7 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘That you may be successful wherever you go’. How lovely. Being a Christian means success in all areas. Win. Go be prosperous in every way. End of reading? Wait! Let’s back this truck up a bit. Grab a Bible. Flick to Joshua 1:7, and read all of it. Right. According to that, true success only stems from following God’s laws carefully and consistently. And if success is defined by obedience to God, then it doesn’t always mean being an Oscar–winning actor/supermodel/wealthy philanthropist. Those who are definitively ‘successful’ in the eyes of the world aren’t necessarily God–defined ‘successful’. Their obedience to God is between them and Him, so only He knows if they, and we, are successful in the real sense of the word. In fact, let’s talk about that. The real sense of the word. The original root of the word ‘success’ comes from the Latin &lt;em&gt;succedere&lt;/em&gt;, which means two things—‘to follow after another’ and ‘to ascend, or go up’. That’s pretty much the handiest hint to being successful ever. Think about it. If you’re following someone (Jesus, we hope…), straining upwards towards their standards, growing towards them, ascending, and keeping your eyes aloft, then you’re ‘&lt;em&gt;succedere&lt;/em&gt;’–ing. If you’ve made the decision to follow Jesus Christ, you’re successful. By default. You, friend, are already a winner. Regardless of situations, outcomes, or whatever–you–feel–right–now, you are succeeding at life. It may be almost a Christian cliché, but give Romans 8:28 a read. Chew it over, and give it proper consideration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Kings 8-9; Luke 11:29-44; Ps 40:9-17; Pro 6:6-8 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65507&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Either way, Christ's love controls us.' 2 Corinthians 5:14 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul said, ‘&lt;em&gt;Whatever we do, it’s not for our gain, but because Christ’s love controls us.&lt;/em&gt;’ Paul regularly introduces himself as ‘a servant’ for Christ. We’ve often heard it said that ‘God isn’t looking for slaves.’ Well. Maybe He sort of is, but it’s not in the way we think. God isn’t looking for forced labour from vulnerable oppressed workers. The New Testament word &lt;em&gt;doulos&lt;/em&gt; is actually a word that we also translate as ‘slave’. It means ‘bondservant’: someone who is bound, tied, to serve someone. Quite a physical description actually. Imagine being tied to your work… or worse, your teacher or your boss. Being ‘bound’ to something doesn’t match our ideals of wanting to be free. It also doesn’t match up with our idea that Jesus has won us freedom, and taken our burdens away. But how about this: What if our response to Jesus doing that amazing work for us was to look Him in the face and say, ‘Thank You Lord! However I can honour You, please let me!’ What if our love for Him, our love for seeing Him given the glory He deserves, would be enough to make us all passionately want to be ‘slaves’ of His Kingdom of freedom? Again, it’s not about forced labour… but our love compelling us? That’s a different matter altogether. First, spend time talking to Jesus about what He’s done for you. Now, if you want a symbolic and prophetic reminder, get a piece of string or ribbon and tie it around your wrist for the day, to remember Who you’re ‘bound’ to, and why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Kings 10-11; Luke 11:45-54; Ps 53; Pro 6:9-11 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65508&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['No evil shall be allowed to befall you...' Psalm 91:10 ESV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much of our time is spent worrying about stuff that doesn’t matter? What we’re actually doing is giving a situation or a person a high standing they don’t deserve. This leads to the matter getting out of proportion, and occupying a bigger brain–space than it ought to do. As Christians, we have a God–given arsenal of tools for us to stand our ground. We can stand firm against Satan’s schemes, ‘&lt;em&gt;for God has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self–discipline.&lt;/em&gt;’ (2 Timothy 1:7 NLT) Thing is, we often forget how much God really has our backs. Passages like Psalm 91:10–11 NLT remind us that God is absolutely working for our good—He places angels to guard us from evil: ‘&lt;em&gt;For He orders His angels to protect you wherever you go&lt;/em&gt;.’ Not a trace of dictatorship. There is a good type of ‘fear’, though. If God provides for our every need (with angels thrown in, and all), what’s there to be afraid of? The ‘fear of God’ is different. It’s about reverence; it’s about our need to recognise the place that God has in creation—He’s infinitely higher than us. To ‘fear’ Him means to be in awe of His majesty and accept Him as no less than incomparable. Then, everything (including every other fear…) will find its place under Him. So now, take a moment to name one of your fears. Speak it out. Now imagine standing firm against that fear, surrounded by Him and His angels guarding you against that fear. How does it feel? Stand tall—you’re protected from evil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Kings 12-13; Luke 12:1-12; Ps 58; Pro 6:12-15 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65509&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Hide me in the shadow of Your wings.' Psalm 17:8 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a look at Paul’s words to the Romans: ‘&lt;em&gt;Don’t you realise that you become the slave of whatever you choose to obey?...give yourselves to be slaves to righteous living so that you will become holy.&lt;/em&gt;’ (Romans 6:16–19 NLT) This isn’t about making a new ticklist, or to constantly be checking that every single part of us is in perfect shape all the time. It’s about choosing to live with God in charge of our decisions: then He’ll work in us to become more like Him. Which means we have a choice to make: are we going to set our minds/efforts on living with God? But there’s also the other side to it: Choosing to indulge in things that aren’t pleasing to God. Jesus didn’t mince words on this kind of thing. In Matthew 5:28 NIV He says that ‘&lt;em&gt;anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart&lt;/em&gt;.’ It doesn’t matter what level you’re operating on, any form of sexual indulgence/ theft/ gossip is not only against God’s will, but dangerous. Yes, we’re at the heavy end of things here, but we all need to get this: if we include not–so–godly decisions in our lifestyle, then we offer the enemy a way to entrap and enslave us. (1) &lt;em&gt;We need to choose God&lt;/em&gt;, and (2&lt;em&gt;) We need to &lt;/em&gt;‘&lt;em&gt;throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles.&lt;/em&gt;’ (Hebrews 12:1 NIV) Galatians 5:19–21 is a great place for a spiritual check–up. It’s free. Do it. But here’s the good news: He’s already paid the price—all your mistakes are forgiven already.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Kings 14-15; Luke 12:13-21; Ps 61; Pro 6:16-19 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65510&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I have given you authority ... over all the power of the enemy.' Luke 10:19 ESV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spiritual warfare&lt;/em&gt;. There’s a spiritual dynamic to life—and some of it isn’t healthy. But God is definitely the boss; Satan only has authority in your life when you give it to him; he has no power over you when your life is ‘&lt;em&gt;hidden in Christ&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Colossians 3:3 ESV) If you’ve compromised your cover in some way by walking away from the God who is protecting you, there is still room for repentance. Essentially, this means changing your attitudes (which in turn, changes your actions). Repentance is the key to freedom from all oppression of the enemy. When we choose to get on board with what God wants, we gain access to Christ’s authority: ‘&lt;em&gt;I have given you authority…to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you.&lt;/em&gt;’ (Luke 10:19 NIV) In Ephesians 6:10–17, Paul compares the kind of protection we get from God to a suit of armour. They’re well worth checking out, but for now we’ll stick to just one: the ‘Sword of the Spirit’. Which Paul writes is ‘&lt;em&gt;the Word of God&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Ephesians 6:17 NIV) That’s the one offensive weapon we’ve got—and it’s all that we need. You see, Satan can only trick us if we don’t know the Scriptures; it’s on God’s Word that we will get a peaceful, solid knowledge of our love for Him. Not only is Scripture full of that ‘good stuff’, but it’s paralysing to the forces of evil. You have been given the Word of God to use as part of your spiritual battle—it’s true and it’s living—use it! It will protect you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Kings 16:1-18:15; Luke 12:22-34; Ps 66:1-12; Pro 6:20-22 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65512&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Keep me from looking at worthless things. Let me live by Your word.' Psalm 119:37 NCV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could apply today’s verse to your time on the internet, watching tv, shopping… (you get the idea). Anything that involves coming across information or images. So what’s the benchmark of ‘worth’? Philippians 4:8 NLT says this: &lt;em&gt;‘Fix your thoughts on what is true, and honourable, and right, and pure, and lovely, and admirable&lt;/em&gt;.’ If you find you’re taking in a lot of stuff that’s at odds with what God wants, your mental filter for straining out impurities is under attack. It’s been the same since Adam and Eve. The fact that the Psalmist writes about his battle to keep his mind God–honouring is pretty telling. Put it like this: the world we live in has always gravitated toward selfishness. Even if you disconnect yourself completely from the world of technology or never look at a billboard again, there’ll still always be a reason to guard your mind. The answer’s always been the same too: replace the world’s influence with God’s. &lt;em&gt;‘How I long for Your precepts! Preserve my life in Your righteousness&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Psalm 119:40 NIV) What does that look like, then? Actively inviting God to build a guard for your mind through Bible reading and prayer time and teaching podcasts, rather than passively hoping that the world won’t pollute your mind. Is it worth it? Yes. The freedom that comes with looking for what God wants above earthly desires will clear the mind–smog and take you much closer to the fullness God has for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Ruth 1:3-18; John 6:41-69 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65547&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Go in the strength you have and save Israel out of Midian's hand. Am I not sending you?' Judges 6:14 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll find that as you go on with God, you go through different kinds of ‘seasons’. Often, those seasons follow on logically, and the one prepares you for the next. Sometimes, though, God prompts us to go somewhere/do something that we don’t feel ready for. First reaction? If you’re anything like us, you’ll have been tempted to (a) &lt;em&gt;hide&lt;/em&gt;, or (b) &lt;em&gt;talk God out of it&lt;/em&gt;. Gideon (in the book of Judges) was the smallest guy in his family and his family was the weakest in his tribe. Yet God used him to lead an army. The thing is, it was an army of 300 that went to war against another army of over 100,000 men. Yikes! Outnumbered by over 300 to 1. It seemed an impossible task, but God declared: ‘&lt;em&gt;I will be with you.&lt;/em&gt;’ (Judges 6:16 NIV) That’s all that counts really, isn’t it? One ‘Yes’ from God like that is enough to cancel out all our ‘but what ifs’ and ‘maybes’. If God brings you to the edge of something, even if it’s somewhere unknown and looks like a sharp drop, He’ll bring you through, and show you how it fits your journey with Him. If it looks like God is prodding you in a scary direction, it’ll be for the best. So, don’t let it frighten you into inertia. Do you feel God is calling you to do something that, for you, is really scary? Pray to Him to take care of your next step, then ask Him for His plan so you can take it. Don’t stay static. Gideon up!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Kings 18:16-20:43; Luke 12:35-48; Ps 66:13-20; Pro 6:23-25 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65514&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['When you didn't think much of yourself, God made you king of Israel...' 1 Samuel 15:17 TLB&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Samuel anointed Saul as king, Saul couldn’t believe it. He couldn’t understand why God would choose someone as seemingly unimportant as him to be king. Things were looking really bright—Samuel said, ‘&lt;em&gt;The Spirit of the Lord will rush upon you, and you will prophesy with them and be turned into another man&lt;/em&gt;.’ (1 Samuel 10:6 ESV) Awesome! Yet over time Saul got a bit too comfortable. Gradually, he stopped listening to God, went increasingly his own way and starting making some catastrophic mistakes. Remember that time when you first heard that God chose you to be in His family and Jesus chose to die for you? How amazing was that? How in awe of His Word and His ways were you? Over time though, it can be easy to start to take that relationship with Jesus for granted and to not listen to God so much anymore. The ability to forget is staggering. The most dangerous moment in our life is when we think we can succeed without God. The key is in truly knowing our worth, and why. We need to know how loved we truly are—enough to die for, enough for God to tell us to make a difference in this world. But sometimes we can forget that the valuation of us was God’s, and that ability to make a difference was His gift. The key: humility—knowing our worth because we know the One who values us. So today: here’s an assignment for you! Go for a short walk with God—without your phone! Ask Him to show you what you mean to Him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Kings 21-22; Luke 12:49-59; Ps 70; Pro 6:26-28 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65515&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Know that it is near, right at the door.' Matthew 24:33 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you heard of a Bucket List? It’s a list of all the things a person wants to do before they die (or ‘kick the bucket’.) Say a whole group of people, with the ability to carry out world–changing actions, knew their time was nearly up—how would that change what they usually did? Say that group was… drum roll… the Church? The same Jesus who spoke God’s truth to people in Israel 2,000 years ago speaks the same God’s–truth–promise to those of us living as His followers, today and in any age: ‘&lt;em&gt;I am coming soon&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Revelation 3:11 NIV) The first Christians really took this seriously. They spread God’s goodness with a ferocious energy, as if they’d had it revealed to them specifically. The truth is, we don’t know when Jesus will return and when this life as we know it will be over. We’re not supposed to (we’re told that the timeframe for His return is something only God knows, and not public knowledge). Which makes every day count. Christians in 2AD, 500AD and 2015AD are all supposed to be asking themselves: Are we ready? Are we living with an eye open to the fact that Jesus is coming back? What differences would you make to your life and those around you? Write your own Bucket List, one inspired by Jesus’ return. Pray into it and see how God helps you tick it off. He has made us to be world–changers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Rev 1-4; Luke 13:1-17; Ps 77; Pro 6:29 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65516&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Go throughout the whole world and preach the Gospel to all people.' Mark 16:15 GNT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s always good to have someone introduce you to new people. In a nutshell, that is what Jesus asks us to do: introduce people to Him. Our primary call isn’t to ‘bring people to church’, or to turn evangelism into a massive project with no personality or heart. We are, most simply, called to introduce people to this Jesus we know. We just need to be honest and brave, and Jesus will do the hard bit (the ‘heart bit’?...). We hear stories of people going into the deepest parts of the world for God, but there are heaps who don’t know Jesus right here in Australia—they’re in our lecture halls, our offices, our coffee shops, our footy teams. You don’t have to know everything about Christianity or the Bible; you just have to be in love with Jesus. When you have real love for someone, you can’t help mention them naturally in conversation. Oh, and in case you’re wondering, Jesus said, ‘&lt;em&gt;If I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw all people toward Me&lt;/em&gt;.’ (John 12:32 NCV) The work of ‘drawing people toward Him’ belongs to Jesus. He just wants us to make Him visible initially. Is there one person who you’d really like to concentrate on introducing to Jesus? Now, pray that you are able to introduce them to Him in a natural way. After that, it’s Jesus who develops the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Rev 5-9; Luke 13:18-35; Ps 136:1-12; Pro 6:30-31 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65517&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Encourage one another daily...so that none of you may be hardened by sin's deceitfulness.' Hebrews 3:13 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sin is a filthy, stinking, rotten liar. That stuff that promises to feel soooo good at the expense of being able to stay close to God, well, it’s bad stuff. If you’re reading this, you’ve probably already got an inkling of that. So why mention it? Because we all have to be continually careful not to fall for the lies. Today’s verse is about the sort of encouragement that stands alongside your Christian brothers and sisters and says, ‘Come on family! We know Who we stand for! I’m with you, don’t give in to that distraction!’ And frankly, from time to time, we all need someone to say it to us. The full verse even includes the phrase ‘...&lt;em&gt;encourage one another daily, as long as it is called “Today”.&lt;/em&gt;..’ (Hebrews 3:13 NIV) The writer’s got a sense of urgency—like the message of solidarity, of support for each other, is really needed, and needed now. We suspect you’ve noticed this already, but your Christ–siblings are surrounded by tasty temptations, right now, that would trap their hearts and turn them to stone, if they give in. God’s prevention plan for this disaster? You, fellow–Christian. Your encouragement could be the lifebuoy that drags someone back from sin. Get on to it now! Who do you know who loves Jesus, and needs to know the arm of a fellow–follower around them ‘&lt;em&gt;whilst it is still called “Today”&lt;/em&gt;’? Fire off a message to remind them why they’re a Christian, and that they’re not alone. Quick!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Rev 10-14; Luke 14:1-14; Ps 136:13-26; Pro 6:32-35 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65518&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['David gave his son Solomon the plans for...the temple.' 1 Chronicles 28:11 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;David was an achiever. His rule and reign of Israel went over pretty well most of the time, he got some nice feedback over the Goliath incident, he wrote a good chunk of what’s called the Psalms, and was described by the Lord as ‘&lt;em&gt;a man after [God’s] own heart&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Acts 13:22 NIV) So there’s nothing David couldn’t do, right? Well, oddly, God specified that David wasn’t the man for the job of building His temple. Go read about it in 1 Chronicles 28:6–7. David could have piped up: ‘Actually Lord, how’d You feel about me taking this one? I mean, I’ve got the runs on the board, don’t you think it’s best if I handle this?’ But he didn’t. David knew God better than to try to push his own plans on Him. So what about us? Well, making our own plans isn’t wrong, in fact, it’s positively good. Taking them back to God to get checked out is what makes them best. In 1 Chronicles 28:2 David gets his plan–correction from God, and in verse 20 he gives us a great example of how to handle that correction—with wisdom, grace and love. Is God the lead–planner in your life decisions? And if you get a nudge from Him to change tack, how willing are you to change? The best achievement the Bible describes is a life fully submitted to God. Got plans? For work? For time with mates? Even for this weekend? Great. Now ask God what changes He’d make, and listen out for a response. (Keep your Bible open, He likes to answer with it most times.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Rev 15-18; Luke 14:15-24; Ps 106:1-23; Pro 7:1-2 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65520&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Each one should carry his own load.' Galatians 6:5 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Galatians 6 starts by telling us to keep watch on ourselves. It’s telling us to step back every now and then and take stock of our life. Know what’s inside you. Learn how to outsmart your own weaknesses. God’s growth plan for you is: ‘&lt;em&gt;We will no longer be immature... We won’t be tossed and blown about... We will not be influenced when people try to trick us... Instead, we will speak the truth in love, growing in every way more and more like Christ.&lt;/em&gt;’ (Ephesians 4:14–15 NLT) Say your life is a backpack you’re lugging up a steep hill. Wouldn’t it be fairly helpful to know what’s in there, and why? If you’re still being defeated by the same habits and hang–ups you struggled with as a new believer, or five years ago, then pause—God wants you to be aware of what’s going on inside you. Search out His help. Instead of always having to be ‘carried’, get on your feet to the place where you can feed yourself spiritually (with the right stuff—Spirit–food that’ll help you grow), pray in faith over your own problems, and make Spirit–led decisions concerning your life. Write down on different bits of paper all the things—spiritual gifts, strong friendships, defining moments, wrong choices—that float around your heart and head. Now start to pack your backpack. What’s worth putting in for the journey? And what’ll just weigh you down? Give some of them to God to deal with if you’re not sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Sam 21:1-6; Hosea 6:4-6; Matt 12:1-14 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65521&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.' Galatians 6:2 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Truth is, you’ll probably need to be lifted and carried for parts of your life—things will get tricky occasionally. But that’s not the long–term plan. Instead of always having to be lifted, God wants you to lift others. Why is it ‘&lt;em&gt;more blessed to give than to receive&lt;/em&gt;’ (Acts 20:35 NKJ)? When you give out (of your personal resources, your ability to bless others, your spiritual gifts), you make yourself vulnerable and open to relying on God to make it up to you. God, then, can make it up to you by pouring out everything you need and more, not just enough for your own needs, but just loads left over to give out—joyfully—to others. That’s the cycle. God will give you so much so that you can give away so much. When you’re in a community, and everyone is giving away on a person–to–person level, you’ll all be provided for, and that’s how God has designed things to be. (PS: this currency is God’s, though, and He gives you what He wants for you, not necessarily $500 in an envelope after you double–tithed last week.) When you’re all wrapped up in yourself, you make a pretty small package. It’s when you open up and reach out in love to others that you begin to grow, and that God flows through you big time. So how about this coming weekend, you organise one day around someone else? Spend time just hanging out and, when you do, see if there’s anything you can help them with or pray about with them. You’ll be fulfilling the law of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Rev 19-22; Luke 14:25-35; Ps 106:24-48; Pro 7:3-5 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65522&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Discretion will preserve you.' Proverbs 2:11 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are very few things in the world worth pickling. Pickled onions. Pickled eggs. Pickled pigs’ feet. Ok, we’ll stop there. Today’s proverb says: ‘&lt;em&gt;Discretion will preserve you&lt;/em&gt;.’ It’s worth preserving a character of decency and keeping it stored up inside you. Discretion basically means guarding your tongue when it comes to the facts you know about other people—sensitive facts, like: ‘She struggles with hating her family,’ ‘He’s really conscious of his self–esteem,’ ‘He was once a drug addict,’ etc. Divulging what you know about other people’s problems and failures can gain you rapt attention from an uncaring crowd. That may make you feel good momentarily, but afterwards it may have a terrible impact on the relationship. Plus, you get a reputation as a person who can’t be trusted. Not good. You’ve probably said the wrong thing, at the wrong time, to the wrong person, and ended up biting your fist on the way out the door. The good thing is you actually can conserve and preserve good characteristics. Once you’ve started to hold your tongue in one tricky situation, it gets easier the next time, and so on. Sometimes you need a prompt to start acting that way, though. Make sure to not let that prompt be someone’s shock over some accidentally revealed info. As you consider the sensitive things you know about other people that would hurt them if they got out, draw up your own privacy policy. Decide that this is info you won’t share or sell to unnamed third parties. Let your discretion preserve your character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Kings 4:18-6:33; Luke 15:11-32; Ps 27; Pro 7:10-20 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65524&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Cast your cares on the Lord and He will sustain you.' Psalm 55:22 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Augustine defined sin as ‘humanity turned in upon itself’. Now, you might be pretty confident in yourself. Or, you might be someone who really struggles to accept compliments, who doesn’t really like mirrors (or friends with camera–phones…) and sees no reason why anyone should like you—psst… you’re made in God’s image and He thinks you’re beautiful, by the way. Either way, the problem comes when we look at ourselves (or others) more than we look at God. If we spend more time looking at ourselves (yes, whether out of self–love or self–loathing), we’re taking our eyes off the One who wants to give us the true, objective definition of who we really are. It’s not even about what we think of ourselves: it’s that we do think of ourselves more. Martin Luther said, ‘&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; have held many things in my hands, and I have lost them all; but whatever I have placed in God’s hands, that I still possess.’ Putting everything, especially ourselves, into God’s hands, is the best and only way to keep our perspective right. So what about those worries? Or about those doubts? Will I be able to keep this up? Will I ever be good enough?&lt;em&gt; ‘Cast your cares on the Lord and He will sustain you.&lt;/em&gt;’ (Psalm 55:22 NIV) Today, make a point to walk everywhere with a straight back, chin up. As you walk, mull over where in your life you’re ‘turned in upon yourself’, rather than looking ‘up’ at Jesus’ opinion of you. (Also, it’s good posture…)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Kings 1:1-4:17; Luke 15:1-10; Ps 112; Pro 7:6-9 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65523&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I cry out to You, O God, but You do not answer.' Job 30:20 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Lord. Where. Are. You?’ Do you feel like God isn’t answering that prayer? Job felt like it too. ‘&lt;em&gt;I cry out to You, O God, but You do not answer; I stand up, but You merely look at me… When I hoped for good, evil came; when I looked for light, then came darkness&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Job 30:20; 26 NIV) All of us go through times when it feels like God vanished just when we blinked. And when we go looking for Him in all the usual places—prayer, Scripture, worship, church, creation—He seemingly isn’t there. When you’ve been in that place for a while, you meet two old friends for the first time, again. Yourself. And, eventually, God. By recognising that God doesn’t always talk in the same way, you surrender that control over your expectations. Maybe you used to hear from God in a particular way. But then He’s silent. There’s no answer. The change doesn’t mean He has abandoned you. It can mean that you’d started to put Him in a box. You began to rely more on the method than the relationship. And if that’s the case, it’s about waiting on God as He takes you beyond the way it used to be into the heart of a new relationship. There’s a real communication that goes on when you, and God, are silent together. More on that tomorrow, too. If this speaks to you today—stop asking for things to be the way they were. Just for a little while. Plan some prayer times over the next few days that are just about listening out for God. Look for Him to speak to you in an unexpected way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Kings 7-9; Luke 16:1-18; Ps 135; Pro 7:21-23 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65525&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['He will bring justice if you will only wait.' Job 35:14 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Silence isn’t absence&lt;/em&gt;. Sometimes God says to you, ‘&lt;em&gt;Be still, and know that I am God&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Psalm 46:10 NIV) When God seems silent, He can be giving us a chance to discover Him again in a totally new way. You have to be really secure with somebody to just sit quietly with them. Silence takes the emphasis off words and builds a level of intimacy where they’re no longer necessary. Something changes in your relationship with God when you sit silently with Him. But what if you’re waiting desperately for some answer to prayer? First up, check out the conversation around today’s verse in Job. Second, Charles Trumbull said, ‘God knows when to withhold or grant visible signs of encouragement. It’s good when He sends confirmation, but we grow faster when we’ve trusted Him without it. Those who do, always receive the greatest visible evidence of His love.’ God answers every prayer; it’s just that across some He writes, ‘Just wait.’ It takes as long as it takes—and usually feels uncomfortable the whole time. But there’s good news. Eventually your prayers become less about getting answers and more about realising that you’re with God, and right alongside His long–lasting provision for you, at a deeper level than you imagined. If this reading speaks to you today, well this may seem repetitive (word4U2day said pretty much the same yesterday) but stop asking for things. Just for a little while. Plan some prayer times over the next few days that are just about listening out for God. Look for Him to speak to you in an unexpected way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Kings 10-12; Luke 16:19-31; Ps 24; Pro 7:24-25 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65526&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['&quot;I am the Lord's servant,&quot; said Mary; &quot;may it happen to me as you have said.&quot;' Luke 1:38 GNT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mary famously gets called to be the mother of Jesus in the story behind today’s verse. Popularly, that story’s called the Annunciation, which is a fancy way of saying ‘&lt;em&gt;the announcement&lt;/em&gt;’. God sends an angel to announce to Mary His plans that her life would become a space for Jesus’ arrival into the world. Wow. But nothing happens until she says ‘yes’. It’s a curious one, this. God has determined something is definitely going to happen but still gives Mary the chance to confirm His plan by saying: ‘&lt;em&gt;let it be done to me as you have said&lt;/em&gt;.’ That’s key. When have you felt the announcement of God, calling you out from the normal, asking if He can make you more aware of His presence and start working more and more through you? The poem Annunciation by Denise Levertov asks, ‘Aren’t there annunciations of one sort or another in most lives?’ Moments when you feel a dream on your heart especially strongly. Moments when you feel weighted down with darkness. These moments carry opportunity, chance to see the purpose that extends down beneath the surface of your life. So, will you let Him in? Not begrudgingly. Not turning away as if dodging a bullet. Will you be space for the uncontained God, today? Even if you don’t feel a fully spelled–out call of God on your life, know that God can turn anything to His use. Examine your life to see where it is most stressed or most enlivened right now. Are those places you could invite God into?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Kings 13-15; Luke 17:1-19; Ps 26; Pro 7:26-27 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65527&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['We have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us.' 2 Corinthians 4:7 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look at Jesus’ family tree and notice He’s not descended from the people society admires. His mother got pregnant outside of marriage. (We know the full story of that, of course, but not everyone around her at the time believed it.) This would’ve led to her being seen as ‘undesirable’ in society. But God was using her. In an absolutely huge way. And, look further back in the Bible—God quite often uses the underdog. David and Goliath ring a bell? What this shows us is that God is the one with the power. God never goes for the same type of person over another. He is so far beyond the categories we’d choose (people that impress us, experienced winners, ‘the most likely to succeed’). We are all (and they are all) ‘&lt;em&gt;jars of clay&lt;/em&gt;’; we’ve all been made and sculpted by God and are fragile. And He uses us, fragility and all. The treasure we’ve been given is that God is for us. Hands down, He’s for us. Which is kind of a great relief: to know that it’s not up to us; to vindicate ourselves; to make something of ourselves; to be someone worth boasting about; but that God’s already done all the work. Are there any relationships or areas in your life where you aren’t living like God is the one with the power? Take it before God and take courage, as Paul says, ‘&lt;em&gt;What, then, shall we say in response to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?&lt;/em&gt;’ (Romans 8:31 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Sam 5:1-6:16; Rev 11:15-19 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65528&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['What is the best thing to do in the short life that God has given us? I think we should enjoy eating, drinking, and working hard. This is what God intends for us to do.' Ecclesiastes 5:18 CEV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to let your eyes drift off what God’s given you and find yourself fixated on someone else’s lot. Surprisingly, God has a lot to say about this idea of contentment with your own lot in life. In fact, the writer of Ecclesiastes lays out how God’s given you opportunities to find joy and let it bubble out of every corner your life, even the dark ones. Ecclesiastes 5:18–20 NKJ says: ‘&lt;em&gt;It is good and fitting for one to eat and drink, and to enjoy… for it is his heritage&lt;/em&gt;.’ But when you’re struggling to find that contentment and basic happiness in life, there’s a tendency to be envious about what other people’s lives look like. Somebody else’s life suddenly becomes much more appealing and seems all rosy–glow wonderful. This makes us susceptible to extremes in perspective. One myth, the ‘forever myth’, tells you your own situation will never improve. Another, the ‘never myth’, says if things get any worse you’ll never be able to handle them. Both are distortions. Contentment with your life comes from the hands of the God who deals out enough for today. Think over things in your life that you may take for granted: a great friend, listening to music, sports or the taste of your favourite meal. God has made them all for your appreciation; they are signs that He’s with you. If you’re going through some tough times, remember that they’ll pass, and that God’s with you all the way (Isaiah 41:10).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Kings 16:1 - 18:16; Luke 17:20-37; Ps 115; Pro 8:1-3 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65531&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<title><![CDATA[Don't Run--Be Bold!]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[dont-run-be-bold]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['The wicked flee though no one pursues, but the righteous are as bold as a lion.' Proverbs 28:1 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a guilty conscience means always running—whether from the people you’ve hurt; from the people who’d be in charge of punishing you; or even (Jonah–style) from God. But today’s verse tells us that running is pretty much pointless, because ‘no one pursues’. When we’re running from guilt, chances are that we’re mostly only running from our own conscience. And, especially because this running is all in our heads, we don’t really get anywhere. We’re far more likely to just implode. So, is there another option? What about the second half of that verse then? ‘&lt;em&gt;The righteous are as bold as lions&lt;/em&gt;.’ Actually… That says a lot about God’s power. It says that, when we’re righteous, we’re granted the boldness of the fiercest lion. And here’s even more good news: John 1:12. Yes. &lt;em&gt;‘Yet to all who did receive Him, to those who believed in His name, He gave the right to become children of God&lt;/em&gt;.’ Because of Jesus, we’re fully adopted into God’s family. That means that, because He chooses to always see us in and through Christ, we’re called, and most importantly enabled, to be righteous. That means that we can all take a firm hold of that boldness. The first step towards that is to focus our whole attention on living out the righteousness we’re offered. So let’s use our righteous–boldness to avoid fleeing in fright. If you feel like there are some mistakes you’re running from (or have run from in the past) do these three things: (1) &lt;em&gt;Worship&lt;/em&gt;. Know that you’re righteous, because of Jesus. (2) &lt;em&gt;Own up to the mistake before God.&lt;/em&gt; Ask for His healing for it. (3) &lt;em&gt;Own up to the people/person affected&lt;/em&gt;. Have any conversations that need to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Kings 18:17-20:21; Luke 18:1-17; Ps 11; Pro 8:4-5 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65532&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Their hearts are secure, they will have no fear; in the end they will look in triumph on their foes.' Psalm 112:8 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s probably fair to say that we’re most likely to be bold (especially about sharing our faith) when we’re feeling closest to God. So, lesson 1: if you’re a Christian but have made a mess of the whole purity/truthfulness/ kindness/fruit–of–the–Spirit (see Galatians 5:22–23) thing, God won’t reject your ‘sorry’. The past is there to be learnt from, not burnt from. Yet what about when we mess up over and over? Ever done the ‘I promise I won’t do that sin any more’ thing, and then (no matter how long you manage to hold off) you seem to fall back into the habit? Breaking news! God is transforming us ‘&lt;em&gt;from one degree of glory to another&lt;/em&gt;.’ (2 Corinthians 3:18 NRS) One degree. To another. That implies that you (1) &lt;em&gt;aren’t perfect&lt;/em&gt;, and (2) &lt;em&gt;can, with God’s help, get closer to His likeness&lt;/em&gt;. Satan loves to reach into whatever dark pit of ‘won’t–go–back–there’ he can find, and drag back up whatever he knows will make you squirm before God. We’ve all been there. Guess what? There is no darkness in your life that Jesus hasn’t forgiven. To bring this back round: don’t sweat that you aren’t perfect. God’s aware of that bit. When you know you’re out of your depth or really struggling, don’t sweat. He’s got you—‘Be still’ and let Him take the strain. God wants you to pray, declare out loud even, the pains that stop you from feeling His closeness and power. Giving these faith–on–hold pains to God gives the enemy no room to operate in your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Kings 21-23; Luke 18:18-43; Ps 19; Pro 8:6-7 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65533&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['They go from strength to strength, till each appears before God in Zion.' Psalm 84:7 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The great boxer Muhammad Ali once said, ‘What keeps me going is goals.’ He’s right; our motivation for doing something is nearly always the prize we receive at the end. Jesus didn’t beat around the bush when He appealed to these desires in us: He promises ‘&lt;em&gt;treasure in Heaven&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Matthew 6:20 NIV) But to get the treasure, we’re to live boldly for God here in the world. That means going from strength to strength in our living out of what God asks us to do, here. Paul says, in 1 Corinthians 9:24–27, that we’re to keep our eyes fixed on the prize of where God and His people are—Heaven—and run with all our might toward it. As we live for Him, there are two things that keep us going: joyful remembering and hopeful looking forward. That’s what pilgrims used to do, back in the day when pilgrimages were a popular way of expressing faith in God. A pilgrim is described as: ‘a traveller (literally one who has come from afar) who is on a journey to a holy place. Typically, this is a physical journey, often on foot, to some place of special significance.’ As they travelled they’d be remembering Christ, letting Him be known, and looking forwards. Treat your day like a pilgrimage. As you go about your day, with its ups and downs, remind yourself that you have the sure hope of Heaven. Let that motivate you to do bold, good works for God. And, don’t forget to enjoy your day too—Jesus came that we may have abundant life here on earth too!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Kings 24-25; Luke 19:1-21; Ps 116:1-11; Pro 8:8-9 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65534&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not men.' Ephesians 6:7 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are two great verses: ‘&lt;em&gt;Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not men&lt;/em&gt;’ (Ephesians 6:7 NIV); and &lt;em&gt;‘I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know his master’s business. Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from My Father I have made known to you&lt;/em&gt;.’ (John 15:15 NIV) They give a whole new spin to what service is. When we work to serve God, it becomes more than drudging, low–level service. We’re actually part of some of God’s plans (we’re certainly in on His biggest plan of all—the whole Salvation Plan). And that, in turn, means that Jesus calls us ‘friend’. Hold on a second. Friend. He calls us friend. When we decide to serve Jesus, He doesn’t say, ‘Oh, thanks for that, little minion.’ He says, ‘Bless you, my dear, precious friend.’ The One who’s worked for forever to save us all calls us friend, and not even because of the meagre amount of good that we (might) get done here on earth. It’s purely because, ‘&lt;em&gt;Everything that I learned from My Father, I have made known to you&lt;/em&gt;.’ (John 15:15 NIV) So, when we’re told to: ‘Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not men,’ we’re actually being told to serve as if we’re serving our closest friend, who’s given everything He has to allow us to live truly well. Kind of puts things in perspective, doesn’t it? Do something servant–like for a friend (an earthly one) today. You’ll feel the new spin. Your heart will soar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Hos 1-5; Luke 19:22-40; Ps 116:12-19; Pro 8:10-13 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65535&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry.' James 1:19 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever thought what would happen if everything you thought came straight out of your mouth? This is what it may sound like: ‘So, this Bible verse is… ooo, a bird! Anyway… What’s for lunch?’ Probably not the most productive. Let’s face it, if we said every single thing that came into our heads, we’d probably look like we had the attention span of a butterfly (and offend almost everyone we met by the end of the day). Proverbs 17:28 says ‘&lt;em&gt;Even fools are thought wise if they keep silent, and discerning if they hold their tongues&lt;/em&gt;.’ We all have foolish thoughts, and sometimes the smartest thing to do is, well, keep it shut! Not speaking can be great. Jesus was pretty good with His words (He never put His foot in it by speaking too soon), and He was also a great listener. As a result, He attracted people like a magnet in a room full of drawing pins. Doubtless there were times He was tired and didn’t feel like it—but He listened anyway. Listening is often more effective than talking. In fact, there’s a point in every conversation where you need to say less and listen more. It’s only by listening that we can learn. We can never come into deep relationships with those around us unless we listen to what they have to say. Can you think of anyone in your life you don’t listen to enough? Next time you see them, make it your mission to (fully) listen to what they have to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Hos 6-10; Luke 19:41-20:8; Ps 13; Pro 8:14-16 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65536&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The... Lord is my strength... He enables me to [go on].' Habakkuk 3:19 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the things the prophet Habakkuk counted on started to crumble, he was forced to discern between what was truly important and what was just ‘here–today–gone–tomorrow’ stuff. We all have to do that at some point. Here’s what Habakkuk said, in the final three verses of his book: ‘&lt;em&gt;Even though the fig trees have no fruit and no grapes grow on the vines, even though the olive crop fails and the fields produce no grain, even though the sheep all die and the cattle stalls are empty, I will still be joyful and glad, because the Lord God is my Saviour. The Sovereign Lord gives me strength. He makes me sure–footed as a deer and keeps me safe on the mountains.&lt;/em&gt;’ (Habakkuk 3:17–19 GNT) Habakkuk realised he had no control over certain things. So he chose to control his response. He rejoiced in the Lord regardless of what happened, and drew from God the strength to ‘go on’. What’s your source? The Bible says that ‘&lt;em&gt;the eyes of the Lord range throughout the earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to Him.&lt;/em&gt;’ (2 Chronicles 16:9 NIV) As you read this maybe you could stop and listen as He draws close. May your eyes fix on the eyes of God, who loves, trusts, and wants to strengthen you. Draw close to Him and He will draw close to you (James 4:8). Write down some of the things that are bothering you or stressing you out, talk to Jesus about them and keep your joy. He will help you go on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Lev 24:17-22; Deut 15:7-11; Matt 5:38-48 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65537&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['A peaceful heart leads to a healthy body, jealousy is like cancer in the bones.' Proverbs 14:30 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jealousy starts as a seed. It’s the little, fleeting moment when we compare our abilities, appearance, or life–in–general with someone else’s (or with your whole Instagram feed…?) Chances are, when that happens, we probably don’t even recognise it to be the starting seed of jealousy. It’s such an insignificant thing, right? Well, it might look that way. But stick it in a lovely rich fertiliser of our oh–so–human insecurities, and water it with a bit of a desire for self–improvement, and it starts to grow. That tiny seed becomes a green–eyed monster plant of jealousy. Here are a couple of tips to root out the seed before it gets a chance to grow. (1) &lt;em&gt;Contentment&lt;/em&gt;: It’s not always easy to decide to be happy whatever our circumstances and uproot those twinges of jealousy. In Philippians 4:10–13, Paul chats about contentment, then says: ‘&lt;em&gt;I can do everything through Him who gives me strength.&lt;/em&gt;’ This means asking for help from the Holy Spirit. (2) &lt;em&gt;Community mentality&lt;/em&gt;: We’re all on the same team. Let’s call it Team Humanity. When someone else is winning at life, that doesn’t mean you lose. If we’re on the same side, someone else’s happiness should be able to make our side stronger. The cure here is to literally celebrate with them, get in touch and enjoy their good times with them. Jealousy doesn’t have room to breathe when you choose to focus on someone else’s needs, especially someone who you might be a bit envious of. Think of a way to bless them and root out the jealousy seed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Hos 11-14; Luke 20:9-26; Ps 55:1-11; Pro 8:17-18 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65538&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Why is this happening to me?' Genesis 25:22 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of us live waiting for a specific title or courier–delivered letter from God to find out what part we have to play in His Kingdom. But as Christians we have all already been given a role, an identity to take on, an invitation to accept. Understanding this truth makes sense of what God is doing in our lives. In the story behind today’s verse we find Rebekah asking the question, ‘&lt;em&gt;Why is this happening to me?&lt;/em&gt;’ She’s carrying twins and the two babies in her womb keep wrestling with each other. She asks God and He tells her that there are two nations within her womb, and that one will serve the other. Why me? Why now? This is so difficult, so uncomfortable, so inconvenient. Have you ever found yourself saying these things? Just as it reassured Rebekah, often just knowing the fact that God’s at work helps us with these ‘Why me?’ moments. It’s easy to forget in the difficulties of the moment but turning to God and developing an awareness of His purpose and His presence makes all the difference. It’s about the direction of your heart, knowing that God’s already been working out His purpose for your life. Before you needed to ask. If the direction of your heart is towards God and the outworking of His will in you, then everything around you changes as you realise He is with you. Bring this question into your situation today: God what are You doing in this? Let me know that You are with me, help me to be aware of Your presence inside whatever I face today. What now, Father?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Jer 1-3; Luke 20:27-47; Ps 55:12-23; Pro 8:19-21 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65539&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The merciful... will be shown mercy.' Matthew 5:7 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus taught us to pray ‘&lt;em&gt;on earth as it is in Heaven&lt;/em&gt;.’ The earth–looking–more–like–Heaven thing seems to be fairly central to His whole message. Jesus’ life was all about bringing the Kingdom of Heaven near. ‘The Kingdom of Heaven’ He spoke about doesn’t mean where we go when we die, but places/ people/ homes/ hearts/ communities right here on earth. And Jesus is all about us advancing that Kingdom, right here, right now. Sounds abstract! What does that ‘advancing’ look like? Truthfully—it looks fairly messy. It probably looks like Christians getting our hands dirty; taking ourselves into the not–so–nice places, places we wouldn’t normally choose to be; it looks like gradual (sometimes difficult) prayerful work, with real, broken, hurting people. And, here’s the curious thing. We often forget that the Lord’s Prayer (Matthew 6:9–13) involves Jesus saying some incredibly challenging words about forgiveness. ‘&lt;em&gt;Forgive us what we owe to You, as we have also forgiven those who owe anything to us&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Matthew 6:12 PHPS) So: if we forgive, we’ll be forgiven, if we refuse to forgive, we won’t! Whoops! To be Heaven to others, we need to start and end by forgiving. Surely Jesus’ challenge to us is clear, then? We really should (we absolutely need) to get over our own judgment if we have any hope of being a part of His Kingdom. What’s bugging you now? Are you feeling offended? Whether it’s a person or a group, find a practical way to show forgiveness. Bring the Kingdom of Heaven’s love and mercy down to earth today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Jer 4-6; Luke 21:1-24; Ps 38:1-12; Pro 8:22-23 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65540&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['God blesses those who work for peace.' Matthew 5:9 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peace feels like an advert for a brand of tea—some hardworking soul arriving home for a soothing cuppa, accompanied by relaxing music and slow–wafting aroma. Most of us crave and deeply appreciate the peace that comes as a break from frantic busyness. But the Bible gives a much bigger picture of peace. It’s not just a calming interlude in the midst of problems. It’s something called ‘&lt;em&gt;Shalom&lt;/em&gt;’. &lt;em&gt;Shalom&lt;/em&gt; is restoration, making amends, making things good, bringing full well–being. Shalom is the world completed—as it was meant to be. The wholeness of God arriving. It’s not stepping back from the world to take a rest, it’s taking the world by the scruff of the neck and pulling it forwards into what God wants for it. &lt;em&gt;Shalom&lt;/em&gt; meaning God re–forging things the way He intended, into real peace. It feels so good to say, ‘Aah, that’s better,’ when you put your feet up after a long day. More satisfying though, is that feeling of peace when you’ve patched up a friendship after an argument, when you’ve gone out of your way to help a needy person, when your family (or any family–like group) sits down together for a meal. It takes work to make peace arrive the way God wants, and it takes some knowledge of what He likes. But &lt;em&gt;Shalom&lt;/em&gt; is His worked–for peace that brings a really solid satisfaction. So be Heaven in your world. Be someone who makes peace, who actively works for peace. If there conflict in your family, could you be the one who helps make amends and restores relationships?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Jer 7-9; Luke 21:25-38; Ps 38:13-22; Pro 8:24-26 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65541&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Through love serve one another.' Galatians 5:13 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus said something incredible: His disciples would be recognised by their love for each other (John 13:34–35). And He used a special Greek word for love: &lt;em&gt;agape&lt;/em&gt;. This distinguishes it from other kinds of love. &lt;em&gt;Agape&lt;/em&gt;’s a love that serves, even it isn’t served. A love that gives before it receives. A love that forgives before it is forgiven. It’s a lavish love that goes beyond the love of a parent for a child, beyond the affection of one friend for another, beyond the attraction of a starry–eyed bridal couple. It’s the wildly–outrageous love that comes from God and enables people to overcome their selfish self–centred me–focus and instead give themselves in sacrificial service to strangers. It’s the kind of love that took Jesus to the cross for our sins. It’s the kind of love that enables us to follow Jesus’ command to do good to our enemies, bless those who hate us and pray for those who persecute us. (Matthew 5:44) That way, Jesus goes on to say, ‘&lt;em&gt;you will be acting as true children of your Father in Heaven. For He gives His sunlight to both the evil and the good, and He sends rain on the just and the unjust alike. If you love only those who love you, what reward is there for that? Even corrupt tax collectors do that much. If you are kind only to your friends, how are you different from anyone else? Even pagans do that. But you are to be perfect, even as your Father in Heaven is perfect.&lt;/em&gt;’ (Matthew 5:45–48 NLT) What can you do today that shows &lt;em&gt;agape&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Jer 10-13; Luke 22:1-23; Ps 69:1-18; Pro 8:27-29 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65542&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Whoever desires to become great among you shall be your servant.' Mark 10:43 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pastor Andy Stanley says that you don’t need character in order to be a great leader. At first sight this looks plain wrong. When you look into it, it’s obvious. History teaches us that lots of people achieve greatness through lying, cheating, stealing, murdering, slandering and backstabbing their way to the top. Just read 1 and 2 Kings—prime material for a hit TV series. There’s a difference between great leaders and leaders with character. But it’s only the second sort who are actually worth following. Think for a moment about the people who’ve been able to motivate you. Most of us are (hopefully) inspired by people of integrity who’ve gone through suffering with determination, who’ve proved true greatness through overcoming challenges. Jesus is big on that too. Look at His letters to the churches in the first few chapters of Revelation—each one is packed with His shoulder–to–shoulder encouragement to ‘Hold on! Keep in there!’ Each one ends by mentioning the rewards He has planned for people who hang in until they get the victory. That’s what we mean by ‘leaders with character’. If your desire is simply fame, notability or even notoriety, then you’ll avoid learning to serve. But if you want to be one of those leaders who’s worth following, then you should begin to learn the true grit of servanthood. Paul says that Jesus humbled Himself, and in humbling Himself God exalted Him to the highest place (Philippians 2:5–8). Greatness starts as you humble yourself and take on all the ways of a servant. Serve someone today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Jer 14-17; Luke 22:24-53; Ps 69:19-36; Pro 8:30-31 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65543&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['If you think you are too important to help someone, you are only fooling yourself.' Galatians 6:3 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever felt as though you’re ‘above’ some task at church each week? It’s fair to say that we shouldn’t spread ourselves thin and try to be the hero that upholds the church. The point is that if everyone got stuck in, then our church services would run really well. But, why do we even talk about ‘serving’ in church in the first place? Somewhere along the line, in many churches, a committed few do most of the work. If we thought of Church as the ‘meeting of God’s people’, where we’re all coming together, and all playing a part, then instead of our assumption being ‘church is where I go to watch, but there’s no way they’re signing me up for some serving team,’ maybe we’d say ‘I love our church–family meetings, I think serving tea and coffee afterwards might help.’ If that’s already how you roll, great stuff! If you’re used to treating church like a theatre show rather than a family, maybe your definition of ‘fellowship’ and ‘worship’ need a check–up. So that service business then. It’s not just the necessary bit to stop your church’s most faithful bunch from crumpling with exhaustion, it’s also necessary to get you stuck into that larger ‘family’ a bit more. Funny what happens when we ‘serve together for Jesus’. Grab some church friends and chat about the service thing: do we see church more as theatre than family? Then, be the agent of change—ask your church leader where’s best to serve—and get stuck right in and work together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Matt 21:1-16; Ps 118:19-29 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65544&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Always keep busy working for the Lord.' 1 Corinthians 15:58 CEV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember yesterday’s reading? Yes? Good. Remember that verse about not trying to feel more ‘important’ than the task at hand? Today we’re going a step further—and we’ll let Paul do the talking for now: ‘…&lt;em&gt;If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Galatians 1:10 NIV) Ouch. We’ll be the first to own up. Offering to help out is often met by a ‘You sure?’, followed by our obliging ‘Yes, of course, I’ll make drinks. How many sugars?’ Half an hour later, though, when we aren’t met by a round of ‘thank you’ from all involved, the prospect of service gets a lot bleaker. Yep, when the ‘thank you’ is forgotten, it’s tough to remember we’re doing it for the Lord, not others. Got that? Essentially, we like (love?) being noticed by others. Why’s that, then? Well we, as mistake–prone humans, are partial to being a bit proud of ourselves. And if we aren’t careful, our motivation for ‘doing stuff’ will be whether we get the credit for it or not. There. Said it. Being humble in service requires us to look at God and others more than at ourselves. There. Said that too. Service is about starting small: it’s not easy but, at the end of the day, we’ll have trained ourselves to serve in the shadows when it comes to being ‘&lt;em&gt;trusted with much&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Luke 16:10 NIV) Still up for serving at church this week? (No? Huh? See yesterday’s reading.) Why not whip up a batch of home–made cookies for another group who spend time serving? Go onnnn.

<introtext><![CDATA['Through love serve one another.' Galatians 5:13 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve been quite service–minded for the last few days, so here’s a final thought. The doing–it bit. Now, we don’t want to give you a guilt trip. Nor do we want to skirt around the edges of what it looks like to take God’s ‘care–for–everyone–regardless’ love to a world that needs it. You see, service (as you might have gathered from the past few readings) is definitely an active thing. But it’s up to each one of us to recognise it for ourselves, and be ready to put our effort in. It’s far too easy to get into such a day–in–day–out routine of predictable, comfortable living that we forget that God is willing to use us in world–shaking ways. The challenge is found here: ‘&lt;em&gt;Whenever we have the opportunity, we have to do what is good&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Galatians 6:10 GWT) And sometimes, those (big but seemingly small) opportunities will come when we really aren’t expecting it. We’ve just got to keep an eye out for the opportunities, and a free hand to be able to take them. So, the ‘serve one another’ part of today’s verse is a bigger challenge than meets the eye: it needs us to be ready for that thought–poke from God that could change the course of your day/week/month. Leaving your schedule closed to spontaneous initiative will result in gathering boring, spiritually dry dust. Been meaning to call a friend or help out somewhere for a while? Been procrastinating about getting something worthwhile done? Now’s the time to shake off the dust and do it. You will not regret it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Jer 22-24; Luke 22:63-71; Ps 31; Pro 8:34-36 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65546&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Whoever believes will not act hastily.' Isaiah 28:16 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cast your mind way back to primary school. That favourite playground activity: trading things. Especially things that didn’t quite balance out. Ever swapped out a shiny collector’s card/ pack of lollies for someone’s promise of lifelong friendship? Those days are behind us, right? Hmm... We may still be tempted to put God to one side and choose something else. We might be more prone to cheap trade–offs more reminiscent of our school days than we’d first think. The story of Jacob and Esau (check Genesis 25) highlights this pretty well. After a day’s work hunting, Esau wasn’t feeling too perky, and his feelings got the better of him. Then what? Well, his brother Jacob had exactly what he was after: food. ‘&lt;em&gt;What good is the birthright to me?&lt;/em&gt;’ (Genesis 25:32 NIV) (Note: a birthright was stunningly important. Essentially a share in the family inheritance.) And in return? ‘&lt;em&gt;Jacob gave Esau some bread and some lentil stew.&lt;/em&gt;’ (Genesis 25:34 NIV) Bread and bean soup in exchange for the land and livestock that formed the family inheritance! Wow. Perhaps a worse deal than we can see ourselves making. But the question is, how often do we swap out God’s promises of something much better for a cheap, short–lived pleasure? Answer: probably a lot. It’s probably worth a thought–process before making decisions. So when we’re asked to give up something for a momentary gratification, it’s good to ask: ‘Why do I want this? Why am I doing this?’ These are handy questions to ask anytime we’re distracted or tempted. It’ll also help us identify the things of real worth and value them enough not to swap them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Jer 25-27; Luke 23:1-12; Ps 72:1-11; Pro 9:1-6 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=65581&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I have rejoiced in Your decrees as much as in riches.' Psalm 119:14 NLT &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s Maundy Thursday. Maundy (from &lt;em&gt;mandatum&lt;/em&gt;) means ‘commandment’. It’s the day during Easter week when we remember the Last Supper and Jesus’ command to ‘l&lt;em&gt;ove one another&lt;/em&gt;’ as He loves us (John 13:34 NIV). That’s a great place to start acting like today’s Scripture–loving Psalm writer. When we get that the basic principle of love is behind all of God’s laws, we can start to dig deeper into other teachings in Scripture. Paul writes: ‘&lt;em&gt;All Scripture is inspired by God and is useful to teach us what is true and to make us realise what is wrong in our lives. It corrects us when we are wrong and teaches us to do what is right.&lt;/em&gt;’ (2 Timothy 3:16 NLT) That means the Bible’s teachings aren’t just helpful things to think about—they’re things we &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'do'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; with delight: commandments. Commandments require you to turn good thoughts into good actions. They’re not just words on a page written a couple thousand years ago, they’re alive, still being spoken by God: ‘&lt;em&gt;For the word of God is alive and powerful. It is sharper than the sharpest two–edged sword… It exposes our innermost thoughts and desires.&lt;/em&gt;’ (Hebrews 4:12 NLT) The Bible commands us as well as teaches us because it’s still His &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'living'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; word, which is working today. Take up the challenge, listen to the commandments, and you’ll not just survive, you’ll live well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Jer 28-30; Luke 23:13-25; Ps 72:12-20; Pro 9:7-9 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2015 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=66461&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

&lt;p&gt;Greek philosopher Aristotle called death the thing to be feared more than everything, because ‘it appears to be the end of everything’. Even as Christians, death’s appearance of ‘the end’ can still be intimidating. The first disciples themselves saw Jesus’ own death as a terrifying, hopeless end to begin with. ‘Good Friday’ is a strange name for remembering that day. Jesus Christ, the Saviour—the Messiah—was crucified, after a false trial and heavy torture. Those disciples wouldn’t have called it ‘good’. And don’t let yourself fall into the trap of seeing this as a fairy story or an unreal legend. In fact, scholars have used historical accounts, and solar and lunar calendars, to work out that Jesus’ crucifixion was likely to have been AD 33, Friday 3rd April… That’s a coincidence for us this year, but maybe it helps bring the important message home: this happened. In a real time, in a real place, our God really died. So why ‘Good’? Maybe it’s helpful that we call today ‘Good Friday’, to keep us from forgetting what God achieved through this death. God dying, when our sin means that it’s really us who deserved to, hits ‘reset’ on our relationship with Him. His death allows us to count our sin–life as dead with Him, and be ‘born again’ into a new life with Him. But that’s not the end. Stick around for Sunday, yeah? Jesus’ death was the universe’s biggest act of reconciliation. Today is a good time to take that up: do you have someone you can offer forgiveness and healing? An ‘enemy’ you can show love to in a practical way? Try it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Easter Saturday’ is a weird time. It’s the middle day, between the sorrow of Good Friday and the joy of Easter Sunday. So we wait, twiddling our thumbs, not even bothering to name this day. But actually, we think it’s really important. The disciples spent ‘Easter Saturday’ grieving. Jesus was dead. Murdered by the authorities they’d hoped He might overthrow. But, a verse we often skip over might give us a wake–up call: ‘&lt;em&gt;graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised…they went into the holy city and appeared to many&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Matthew 27:52–53 NKJ) Jesus died, right then and there. Becuase we have the benefit of hindsight, something the disciples didn't have Easter Saturday is a day of impending hope becuase we the resurrection is coming on Sunday.&amp;nbsp;The disciples would see that resurrection is real. But their fear and grief kept their hearts from knowing the hope that Jesus’ own resurrection promises would be fulfilled. Our hearts can live in the same place. Resurrection’s a lovely story, we may even see proof of God’s power, but it &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;'almost'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; doesn’t seem real enough. We can get on with life without ever fully living in the hope that Jesus offers. We acknowledge that He died for us, but sometimes forget that He rose for us. But... He did rise. For real. We haven’t yet seen what God has planned for us in Heaven, but Jesus beat death, for you to know that His life–giving power is real. He, the prototype, has gone on before us and made the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul wrote ‘...&lt;em&gt;if Christ has not been raised, then all our preaching is useless, and your faith is useless... and you are still guilty of your sins. In that case, all who have died believing in Christ are lost! And if our hope in Christ is only for this life, we are more to be pitied than anyone in the world.&lt;/em&gt;’ (1 Corinthians 15:14–19 NLT) Jesus rising from the dead on Easter Sunday is creation–shaking news. God died, God rose again, and beat death, so that you can leave death behind and be reunited to Him, too! Without that, there is no ‘Christianity’. But there’s more. Jesus says, ‘...&lt;em&gt;I am going to prepare a place for you... when everything is ready, I will come and get you&lt;/em&gt;...’ (John 14:3–4 NLT) History lesson: when an ancient Israelite marriage was agreed upon, the groom went back to his dad’s house, and built a new home for the bride. When it was finished, he’d collect her, they’d have a wedding, then they’d live there together. Jesus’ words to the disciples set the scene for the ‘Bride’ of Christ (that’s us, His Church) to be reunited to Him. God as Groom, and His people as Bride, paints a wondrous picture of how much He loves us, how close He wants us to be, and what He has planned for us when He comes to take us home. Easter Sunday turns a funeral into a wedding feast. Today, take some time out from the chocolate egg feast to spend with the God who’s preparing a home for you, with Him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hope we can have because of Jesus’ resurrection isn’t an airy ‘in–an–ideal–world’ hope. Jesus secured our future in Heaven with a promise: ‘…&lt;em&gt;Because I live, you will live also&lt;/em&gt;.’ (John 14:19 NKJ) Paul records the amount of witnesses who saw Jesus soon after the resurrection: &lt;em&gt;‘five hundred of His followers at one time&lt;/em&gt;’ (1 Corinthians 15:6 NLT) amongst several other instances. Hold up. That’s quite a lot, isn’t it? More than that, these witnesses saw Jesus in the flesh. Not some sort of ghost, or a ‘warm feeling’ in their memory. Jesus’ followers didn’t follow up His death with eulogies; the resurrection changed that. The disciples carried on acting as if He was alive—because something had convinced them He was. Anyone ever who has been convinced and changed by Jesus’ resurrected life has the same hope they had. Heaven is a reality we can look forward to. And more than that, just like the disciples, eternal life with God is something we can start living out right now. Discipleship isn’t a remembrance club, it’s a living walk with a real life God. When Jesus rose on the third day, He proved that sin could no longer come between us and God (Romans 6:18). We’re free. Today, as well as looking back to the world’s greatest sacrifice, let’s look ahead to the fact that our lives, and the lives around us, can change because of it. Does it feel like a while since you last asked God to change something in your life? Maybe you’ve gone back to an old habit. Don’t let anything delay you—invite Him to bring His resurrected life into those parts of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if there’s more to staying in tune with God in easy times than meets the eye? Take Samson. If you know one thing about him, it’ll be that he could push a pillar or two. Samson’s enemies tried time and again to discover the secret of his stupendous strength. Time and again, God helped Samson overcome his enemies, even when Samson was disobeying Him. Samson thought God would be with him always, no matter what sin he was involved in. He didn’t realise God was giving him time to repent. In the final (and successful) attempt of Samson’s enemies to take him down, it was his own pride that undid him. ‘&lt;em&gt;“I will go out as before, at other times, and shake myself free!” But he did not know that the Lord had departed from him.&lt;/em&gt;’ (Judges 16:20 NIV) Look up the story in Judges 16. Surrounded by enemies and his own fame, he forgot that he had been drawing on God’s strength the whole time. Matthew Henry said, ‘Our minds and memories are like a leaky vessel, they do not, without much care, retain what is poured into them.’ Samson’s story is an extreme, but it illustrates quite a lot. If you’re strong at one point, don’t rely on yourself to keep that up. All good comes from God (James 1:7), and He wants you to move forward, not drift back. If there’s a sin you keep on committing, don’t assume like Samson that God will be with you, regardless. This is the time of His mercy. Don’t knock it back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were offered an access–all–areas tour of the inside of your head, would you take it? For a lot of us, this idea would send us bolting. We know that our restlessness and endless activity is coming from somewhere, but we’re not quite sure where and why. We’re not totally comfortable with being alone with ourselves. Some of us try to escape that feeling of blandness by rushing around all the time, but it doesn’t work. We’re just moving mental shadows. If we’re honest, what we really long for is for God to take our minds, rinse them out in His cool living water, and set them to dry in the warmth of His light. If we’re always rushing to escape our own heads, though, we’ll never be still enough for God to deal with the problem. God wants to fling the shutters open, and let the fresh air of His Holy Spirit blow in over your peace of mind, health, and your closeness to others. Doing more or less won’t be what helps. It starts as He fills your mind and renews your soul in stillness, so you have to be ok with being still for a bit. Today take a minute to simply sit still and receive this blessing: ‘&lt;em&gt;The Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make His face shine upon you and be gracious to you; the Lord turn His face toward you and give you peace.&lt;/em&gt;’ (Numbers 6:24–26 NIV) Now spend a moment thinking about someone you could send this blessing to. Text it, Facebook it, Instagram it or just use the old way: speak it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know… when you were little, you were going to be President of the Universe. LOL. Unfortunately, you’ve not quite made it yet and, guess what? That’s ok! And, even with your more realistic ambitions—graduating with top marks, getting the perfect job as a steppingstone to that Cosmic Presidency—it’s actually ok you’re not quite there yet either. Yes. You heard it correctly. It’s ok to not meet your own high–as–the–sky expectations. In fact, it’s impossible not to fail at the most important thing of all: pleasing God. Can’t do it. Just. Not. Possible. Sin gets in the way. But there’s hope. In the words of the prophet Jeremiah: ‘&lt;em&gt;Through the Lord’s mercies we are not consumed, because His compassions fail not. They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness. The Lord is my portion…therefore I hope in Him&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Lamentations 3:22–24 NKJ) What’s that? God doesn’t have any less compassion for us, no matter what we do or don’t achieve? Even better than that, He renews His concern and interest in us every single day. Regardless of what happened yesterday, God is raring to faithfully refresh and provide for you today. He is with you in this new day. He’s already picked you back up. And, once you ask Him to, He’s ready to point you in the right direction for today’s fresh new plans. Give yourself a break. Allow God to renew and refresh you right now. Take the load off yourself and press the ‘Reboot’ button. God’s mercies are new every day—and that’s His promise! Wow, that’s a relief!&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Cast all your anxiety on Him.' 1 Peter 5:7 NIV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve been told it many times but when we’re stressed, we don’t really think about it. Here it is again: ‘Cast all your anxiety on Him.’ (1 Peter 5:7 NIV) First, put this verse into context. ‘...&lt;em&gt;be submissive to those who are older... “God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.” Humble yourselves, therefore, under God’s mighty hand, that He may lift you up in due time. Cast all your anxiety on Him because He cares for you.&lt;/em&gt;’ (1 Peter 5:5–7 NIV) The verses just before the ‘&lt;em&gt;cast all your anxiety&lt;/em&gt;’ bit are about being humble. Seems humility and ‘&lt;em&gt;casting anxiety on the Lord&lt;/em&gt;’ are interconnected. Casting anxiety on God starts when we are humble enough to say: ‘God, I can’t handle it alone, I don’t have the strength without You.’ Also, let’s think about that word ‘cast’. It’s what you do with a net when you’re fishing. So, it’s to do with catching stuff. No coincidence that Peter the apostle who’d been a fisherman wrote this. So, when we think about how to ‘cast all [our] anxiety on Him’, it’s about that fishing technique of throwing out and pulling back in. Yes, it’s about casting out worries and drawing God close—catching and pulling in a glimpse of His presence and His peace. And that’s the practicality of 1 Peter 5:7. Use the throwing away of worries to draw in closer to God. Use the high–stress times as a sign that we should step back, and try to catch sight of God.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['The Gospel...of which I, Paul, have become a servant.' Colossians 1:23 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;In the early Corinthian Church, certain people were becoming very jealous over their favourite leaders and causing a lot of strife amongst themselves because of it. A whole bunch of people were siding with Paul, ready to argue down the supporters of Apollos or Peter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;But Paul wasn’t having any of it. And he was right. He had a properly balanced opinion of himself, and of those around him. Look at what he said—he was quite happy to say of himself and the other leaders in the church: ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;This is how one should regard us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God&lt;/em&gt;.’ (1 Corinthians 4:1 ESV) He never thought of himself as a superhero of the Church, as superior to anyone. It was because he saw them all, himself included, as servants and stewards of the Gospel. He also wrote: ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;What then is Apollos? What is Paul? Ministering servants [not heads of parties] through whom you believed, even as the Lord appointed to each his task&lt;/em&gt;.’ (1 Corinthians 3:5 AMP) He and the other leaders were a team, under the orders of God, and so they were all completely equal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;And so are you. Being a Christian, whether that’s the Christian–church–leader or the Christian–who–makes–the–coffee–after–the–service, means you are a servant of God. No more, and no less. Whatever role we’ve been given, it’s clear from Scripture and from the example of His Son Jesus, we are to serve. And in our serving others we are serving God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['If your gift is to encourage others, be encouraging.' Romans 12:8 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;We all need encouragement. Sometimes life is exhausting and we want to give up. Sometimes the apple of temptation is too shiny and we want to give in. All sorts of people around you may be in very weak places today, under the surface. So, do a beautiful thing today—and encourage. The Bible gives us different ways to do it…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;(1) &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Encourage through gifts&lt;/em&gt;: ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;All those about them encouraged them with articles of silver, with gold, with cattle and with valuables…&lt;/em&gt;’ (Ezra 1:6 NAS) So begins the story of God’s people pooling together gifts to encourage a group from Judah to rebuild God’s house. Perhaps you know a missionary or someone going on a short term mission trip—encourage them by giving a gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;(2) &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Encourage with kind words&lt;/em&gt;: ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;And he who smooths metal with the hammer encourages him who beats the anvil…&lt;/em&gt;’ (Isaiah 41:7 NAS) A compliment on the quality of somebody’s work goes a very long way. How about complimenting your church leader about the sermon this Sunday?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;(3) &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Encourage through writing&lt;/em&gt;: ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;When they had read it, they rejoiced because of its encouragement&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Acts 15:31 ESV) We’ll leave you to figure out your way of doing that. You never know when a humble ‘thanks’ or an honest compliment might just be the thing that keeps somebody going. So, use your imagination. Get creative in how you show your appreciation for someone today. You could make sure your church knows what you appreciate about it. Whether it’s a note or an email (or whatever you like, really), it’s important to point out the good stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...When He saw the multitudes, He was moved with compassion for them...' Matthew 9:36 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Let us not love with words or tongue but with actions and in truth&lt;/em&gt;.’ (1 John 3:18 NIV) Jesus set a pretty strong example, actually. Turns out He didn’t say: ‘Oh go on guys, play nice, please?’ or throw casual platitudes over His shoulder at the homeless and hurting as He passed: ‘Mm, yeah, bless you…’ Jesus was massively concerned about the wounded world He’d stepped into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;So concerned, the Gospel writers had to create a new word to describe that compassion. They said that Jesus was ‘moved in the depths of His gut’ (yep, it’s &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;splagchnizomai&lt;/em&gt;, Greek fans) for people. And then there’s the shortest verse in the Bible: ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Jesus wept&lt;/em&gt;.’ (John 11:35) Ours is a God who, when He stepped into this messy and broken world of ours, chose to heal the sick, feed the hungry and restore outcasts. It turns out they were (and we are...) pretty precious to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;So, what about the poor and hungry in your city? What if your area has a people–trafficking problem, behind closed doors? What if one Sunday the back row of your church was filled with homeless, (literally) unclean, maybe even alcohol–dependent people who had wandered in to see what your church was like? Do we get stirred up for these precious–to–Jesus people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Is it time to put your compassion into action, rather than cross the road? Ask at your church about ways to serve in your area.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...Faith...if it does not have works, is dead.' James 2:17 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Ever heard the word ‘chuggers’? It’s short for ‘Charity Muggers’, a not very complimentary name for people who stand in the streets stopping passersby, trying to persuade them to sign up and to give money to their cause. Our society doesn’t seem to like ‘chuggers’ very much… But why do they even exist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Probably because the needs exist, and not enough people are doing/giving enough to fix them. Charities talk about us having ‘donor fatigue’—we’ve seen so many ‘Please, give just $20 a month…’ ads they just don’t have an effect on us anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Contrast that with Mother Theresa, who gave her life to rescuing sick babies and caring for the dying. She said: ‘The biggest disease today isn’t leprosy or cancer. It’s the feeling of being uncared for, unwanted—of being deserted and alone.’ She was asked why she did what she did, and her response? ‘Because Jesus did.’ Hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Of the 1,189 chapters in the Bible, 250 contain the words of the prophets. That’s over 1 in 5. Half of what they say calls out sin and the other half calls out those who see people suffering and do nothing about it. If we call ourselves God’s children—we call ourselves to His action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Today’s title verse isn’t meant to be a guilt trip, about forcing you to donate regularly to a charity—it’s a reminder that our faith is the sort that has actions partnered with it. If your faith is all words and no action at the moment, you’ll probably find that choosing to serve strengthens your faith. So, if you haven’t yet asked at your church about places to serve, tomorrow would probably be a good opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['This High Priest of ours understands our weaknesses, for He faced all of the same testings we do...' Hebrews 4:15 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Dr Joseph Parker once told his theology students, ‘Preach to the suffering and you will never lack a congregation. There is a broken heart in every pew.’ Have you ever heard a preacher give a message about suffering that ‘moved your gut’? (Yep, that would be &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;splagchnizomai&lt;/em&gt; again, folks.) Some of the most powerful preaching we’ve come across has been when the preacher was the most connected to the hurt in the world. And some of the least when the preacher just... wasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Jesus gets our brokenness. He went looking for the loser, the lost, the lonely—the lowest. He was comfortable around them. He served them naturally, without a ‘mask’ to hide behind. Serving these people did a lot for them. Just like you can make a real difference to those near you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Newsflash, though: giving’s not a one–way street. It’s good for you! Yep, there are some major benefits to being a giver. Apparently a survey across 44 major universities suggests that giving actually protects your overall health twice as much as aspirin does against heart disease! (Incredible! God has hardwired the human body to be healthiest when we’re expressing gratitude and actually giving to others! Not that that’s why you should give, but it’s nice to know that God’s planned it to be good for us, isn’t it?)&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'...You need someone to teach you...' Hebrews 5:12 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The end of Hebrews 5 and the beginning of chapter 6 is a bit of a smack–down. The writer of that letter said to his readers that they should really be further on in their understanding of God. It’s pretty blunt: basically saying, ‘Grow up!’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Actually… come to think of it, that’s pretty good advice for all of us. ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Surely we don’t need to start all over again with the importance of turning away from evil deeds and placing our faith in God. You don’t need further instruction about baptisms, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Hebrews 6:1–2 NLT) The writer tells us to stop being stuck in a rut with this basic stuff and get on with digging into the meaty principles of following Jesus. Hands up who knows everything there is to know about this Christian life, and about God? Yeah. Thought so. There’s just so much to learn about God and how to live for Him, that we can never say we’re done with learning. Part of being a Christian is being open to absorbing truth that is new to us. That’s why we have sermons in Church. That’s why you’re reading these Bible notes. That’s why there’s a Bible in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;God is eager to pull us deeper into relationship with Him. No matter how much you already know, or don’t know, there is so much for Him to reveal. And, when you devote the time to study Him and ask Him to teach you, He will start to grow you in knowing Him.&lt;/p&gt;

<title><![CDATA[CITY WALLS]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[city-walls]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Whoever has no rule over his own spirit is like a city broken down, without walls.' Proverbs 25:28 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Back in ancient times, one of the most effective defences a city could have was whopping great walls around its perimeters. Without those walls, anyone who fancied having a crack at invading could just waltz right in. With them, though, a city had much less chance of being taken over. Walls provided a first line of defence. There’d be trained watchmen stationed on top of them, and the minute they caught sight of an incoming enemy, they’d raise the alarm for the guards to rush to the gates and fight back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Whoever has no rule over his own spirit is like a city broken down, without walls&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Proverbs 25:28 NKJ) So, when we don’t bother with self–control, we leave ourselves wide open to an incoming enemy we wouldn’t want to settle down in the city of our soul. The minute we allow ourselves to do just–that–one–thing–we–know–we–shouldn’t, we start to let our walls down. And once those walls are down, it becomes ever–easier to let one more thing slide. And then another thing. And another. And…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;You get the idea. The bottom line is this: letting something slide, even one tiny little thing, doesn’t work. We may not feel the impact immediately, but even the smallest thing changes the way we think about what’s right. It draws us a step further away from God. And each step further away makes the next one a little easier to take. So ask the Holy Spirit for His help in growing self–control. And then ask for His help in maintaining it and keeping your walls intact.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'...What must I do to be saved?' Acts 16:30 NIV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An old lady spent her first flight sitting forwards awkwardly in her chair, elbows firmly on both armrests, looking straight ahead for the whole journey. When the plane landed the passenger next to her asked if she’d enjoyed the flight. ‘It was alright,’ she said, ‘but I didn’t put my whole weight on it...’ The punchline: we do the same thing when we try to get along with God based on our own awesomeness—by working harder, praying longer, having a super–lovely personality, or whatever. There’s no way to do work that Jesus has already done for us. Christianity says we’d never be able to walk with God because all the wrong we’ve done acts as a huge obstacle—one we cannot move ourselves. Sin prevents us from seeking or wanting God. We can’t trust in our own ability to get on God’s good side; we just don’t have that ability, any more than old ladies can cruise at ten thousand metres without putting their full weight on the plane. But God’s done something for you. He loves you. So He took the punishment which you justly deserved, pouring His wrath out fully on Jesus—on the Cross. He did it, and only He did it. And the moment you place your trust in Jesus, His sinlessness is placed in you. You’re flying with something you can lean back into with your full weight, and the full forgiveness of God bearing you up and onward. If you haven’t already put your ‘full weight’ on Jesus, today might be the day to start. See &lt;a href=&quot;Christianity.&quot;&gt;http://word4u2day.com.au/Christianity.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title><![CDATA[SPRINT OR MARATHON?]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[sprint-or-marathon]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...When he died...his eyes were not weak nor his strength gone.' Deuteronomy 34:7 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Ever heard Christianity described as a race? It’s much less of a sprint, and more of a marathon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Think of Usain Bolt. His sprint is spectacular. But ask him to keep that speed up for 42 km, though, and he’d end up needing an inhaler and ambulance. It’s impossible to sprint a marathon. Trouble is, so many of us are impressed by the sprinters in church. It’s good to be ‘on fire’ for God (in fact, it’s not only pretty brilliant but what we’re aiming for). But without those steady, do–it–even–when–you–don’t–feel–like–it times of devotion where we let God take the lead, it’s too easy to burn out. There’s nothing wrong with stepping out for God. But Jesus set an example of clocking in regularly for the ‘upward’ God time as well as the ‘outward’ service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Life is a marathon, not a sprint. King Saul ran like a sprinter. He got out of the blocks well enough but he compromised and ran without God. King David on the other hand, ran marathon style—he waited fifteen years to be crowned King. A lesser athlete would’ve given up years before. Despite his shortcomings (a whole heap of them), the marathon approach meant that, as long as he was heading towards the finish line, there was time to get up again. Ask yourself: do you need to think longer ahead in life than the day or week ahead of you? This is a simple question but it might need lots of mulling–over time.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'But seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.' Matthew 6:33 ESV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American pastor and author Francis Chan uses a piece of rope as an illustration. He holds a piece that stretches the length of a stage and points to the very end which is painted red. The majority of the rope is white and he asks us to imagine this representing eternity. The red part represents our lifetime on earth. The red part is insignificant compared to the white. He suggests that too many of us focus on the small red part of the rope when there is a lifetime of white awaiting us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most stuff here comes and goes. And where we invest our time, money and energy has a lot to do with that. Using your resources to bless others is going to have a lasting effect in their lives. Now, we aren’t dead set on having a dig at your shopping habits… but holding back on your next impulse–buy will, frankly, leave more room to give generously. Asking ‘where else could this go?’ can apply to anything: time spent watching TV, scrolling through Facebook; whatever, any ‘non–necessities’. We all need rest. We all need chill–space. But sometimes it helps to toughen up on our habits. It leaves that space open for us to pray about where we can invest. What areas of your life do you need to reassess in view of eternity? It’s helpful to keep this question in mind, at least some of the time: when you’re about to impulse–buy or spend an afternoon in front of Quickflix, ask yourself ‘where else could this go?’&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'...Forgive as the Lord forgave you.' Colossians 3:13 NIV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1977 at the age of 14, Sokreaksa Himm saw thirteen members of his family killed by soldiers in the killing fields of Cambodia. Miraculously surviving the massacre, Sokreaksa swore revenge. Years later, after surviving refugee camps and roving death squads, the man became a Christian. Through years of Bible study and prayer, Sokreaksa was able to let go of his hatred and desire for revenge. Through the act of letting go in his heart, he found peace. He describes years of fantasising about torturing his family’s killers. The pain became like a prison that trapped him. Forgiveness unlocked his cell. In time, forgiveness opened up channels for the holy power of wholeness and healing. In the years that followed, he developed a new mission; to find and forgive the killers face to face. Eventually he tracked down two of the soldiers in the very village where the murder had happened. God gave him the strength to shake their hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can learn from this story. Forgiveness isn’t instant—it’s a process. Forgiveness brings you the healing from pain. Forgiveness enables you to do things you never dreamed possible. You’ll survive if you hold grudges against others, you’ll get by—but only just. Forgive them and you’ll thrive. ‘Don’t repay evil for evil. Don’t retaliate with insults when people insult you. Instead, pay them back with blessing. That is what God has called you to do, and He will bless you for it.’ (1 Peter 3:9 NLT)&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['That they should seek the Lord, in the hope that they might...find Him, though He is not far from each one of us.' Acts 17:27 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;In the years before Jesus was born in Bethlehem, Herod had become increasingly unsure of the threats to his throne. He’d had three of his sons executed on a bare sniff of treason, as well as one of his wives. So, when a bunch of weary travel–stained wise men turned up looking for a baby born to be ‘King of the Jews’, it was more of a nuisance than a crisis. Herod had dealt with much more menacing problems. So long as no one got to hear about this Baby, it’d be business as usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Fast forward two thousand and fourteen years, give or take a few. Herod’s policy is still in play. The Baby born to be King can’t be mentioned in many classrooms. Songs that celebrate His name are deemed too controversial for airplay. Instead there are jingles about a red–clad rotund man who encourages people to wish each other ‘Happy holidays’. Semi-clad women dancing to the songs of misogynistic men are deemed a better form of entertainment than the old, old story about the coming of the Prince of Peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;But God cannot be silenced—back in Herod’s day or now. No matter how many innocents Herod slaughtered, no matter how many nails his successors ordered hammered into a splintered cross, a new King reigns forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Do you know of a mate or two celebrating Christmas without knowing about Christ? Got friends who know about Santa but not the real reason for the season? Send them a text asking them how much they know about Jesus and open yourself up for discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Search the Scriptures, for...these are they which testify of Me.' John 5:39 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Not too many people recognised Jesus as the Son of God when He was born. In fact, only a few unnamed shepherds, some equally–anonymous wise men, an old bloke named Simeon and an old woman named Anna seemed to realise. Maybe a dozen all up. Yet, there was enough Scripture flying around at the time definitely pointing to Jesus as the Messiah. Simeon and Anna sussed the truth—so, why did most people miss Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Some had buried their heads in Scripture—but were too busy to go ten kilometres from Jerusalem to Bethlehem to check out a manger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Now, the study of Scripture is absolutely necessary to a relationship with God. It’s one of the healthiest things in life. Don’t think anything different. The unhealthy thing is when you replace living out the Bible with more and more world–ignoring study. When you have more of a relationship with the words than with the Word of life Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Bible reading only works as a part of a wider life. As they say: recommended as part of a healthy lifestyle. We have to use Bible study as one tool in a tool–belt. It should be right there alongside prayer, listening to God’s Spirit, and action. We really need to know Scripture inside out (after all, that’s where those prophecies about Jesus were that most people missed). But we need to keep our eyes open for real–life God–action alongside that.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...The message...did not benefit them, because it was not mixed with faith...' Hebrews 4:2 AMP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Catalysts make things happen. Alka–Seltzer without water has no fizz, flour without yeast produces no bread. Faith is the catalyst in your life. Without it, religion is dry. Talking about the Israelites, Paul said, ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;When the good news of deliverance…came to them…the message…did not benefit them, because it was not mixed with faith.&lt;/em&gt;’ So: let’s mix it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Without faith, reading your Bible turns into intellectual curiosity; sermons become something to critique rather than inspire; church becomes a social club rather than a place of worship. There are no prizes for memorising verses or hymns—unless you use them as stepping stones to action. Faith requires you to move. There’s a difference between what you believe and what you trust. You may believe that a chair can hold you but never sit down; only when you put your full weight on it are you demonstrating trust. Faith is the catalyst to action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;A gold medal requires you to win. The Booker prize requires you to write. An Oscar requires you to make great movies. If you want to see examples of God’s Kingdom coming in and around your life, faith requires action. Do you sense God is calling you to something that feels ‘out there’? Maybe sharing your faith in class or at work, signing up for that mission opportunity, preaching or leading worship for the first time? Get some support. Go for it.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...After waiting patiently, Abraham received what was promised.' Hebrews 6:15 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;What exactly is our part in waiting? Do you wait until God arranges the clouds in the sky to spell ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;NOW&lt;/em&gt;!’? Do you take the initiative and expect God to bless your efforts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Put yourself in Abraham’s shoes. He’d been waiting ten years for the promise made to him—to become ‘a father of many nations’. By now, he was starting to wonder. Perhaps the word was meant poetically—maybe he was going to be a father in a spiritual sense rather than a biological one? Maybe he’d imagined the whole thing. Or maybe he was supposed to take matters into his own hands. Sarah was too old to bear children—you hardly need a degree in biology to see that—so maybe he was supposed to shop around for a surrogate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Waiting can play terrible tricks on the mind. Abraham would have to wait twenty–four years before seeing the first glimpse of a promise. Even then, one boy hardly made him a father of nations. And yet here we are—thousands of years later—and we know Abraham as the father of our faith (Romans 4:11).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Waiting is difficult because it means we have little control of the future. And let’s face it, we can tend towards a bit of control–freak at times. But God says: ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;You need to persevere, so that when you have done the will of God, you will receive what He has promised&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Hebrews 10:36 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;It is said that often the waiting is more important than the receiving. So if you’re waiting on God for a promise fulfilled—it’d be a good idea to keep a journal to track how you’ve developed in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['... their eyes were opened and they recognised Him...' Luke 24:31 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Sometimes, when we’re too busy staring at screens, updating our statuses, consuming what’s in front of us—we miss something greater. God is willing to teach us more about Himself, and to give us amazing opportunities. But it isn’t enough just to ‘get by’ and hope that we’ll find ourselves walking on the clouds all of a sudden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Looking up to God is how we really ‘see’ things as they are, despite the fact that life often goes on in its usual fashion all around us. It’s a massive deal. And we aren’t just talking about putting life as a whole into perspective or looking at the bigger picture (although focussing on God helps that, too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Looking to God can set you up for some life–changing moments. Forty years before God’s people entered the promised land, Moses saw it— ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;It was by faith that Moses left the land of Egypt. He was not afraid of the king. Moses kept right on going because he kept his eyes on the One who is invisible.&lt;/em&gt;’ (Hebrews 11:27 NLT) Why? He trusted God. Jesus spent most of His life on earth not being recognised for who He was—people just didn’t ‘see’ it. In Mark 10:46–52 he met a man born blind. A man who had to beg to earn money, who couldn’t see the ground he sat on, but who recognised Jesus as the long–awaited Messiah. That’s a great reminder for us all to look up and see God, and not down at our earthly circumstances. So, ask God to open your eyes to the awe and wonder all around you and to what He is doing in your world today.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...Remove the obstacles out of the way.' Isaiah 57:14 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Running a marathon is just too easy these days—right? Yeah, we thought so, too. Alongside the more traditional road races, a new breed of adrenaline–pumping running challenges are springing up all over the world. Take the ‘Spartan Race’ for example. As well as a steep and arduous course, the Spartan chucks in an extra challenge: obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;And not just any obstacles. On the Spartan, you’ll find yourself swimming through mud, scaling craggy walls, crawling under barbed wire, heaving tractor tyres and hurling javelins. Nice. Not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Very few of us are up for this kind of competition. Yet surprisingly, we probably scrabble through life doing a Spartan without realising. Yup. We can put up, invite in, and stubbornly leave emotional and spiritual obstacles in our way that stop us from really running ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;with endurance the race that is set before us.&lt;/em&gt;’ (Hebrews 12:1 NLT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Perhaps during this edition of &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;word4U2day&lt;/em&gt;, you’ve already been reminded of an obstacle that stops you from getting close to God. Holding on to such an obstacle will only lead to more hurt and less freedom. We’re not asking to you to try to be perfect, but rather to turn your imperfections over to God. So, be real with Him. Share your thoughts with Him. Turn around and thank Him for His ability to undo any tricky situation you find yourself in.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['A good man leaves an inheritance...' Proverbs 13:22 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;‘Legacy’: a gift handed down from the past. Ok, this is not about getting; it’s about giving. About a question that hangs invisibly over each of our lives: what kind of legacy do I want to leave behind? What am I going to contribute to society to make it a better place after I’m gone? Just what kind of world do I want my kids, or whoever comes after me, to be living in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;You’ve probably never given this a thought. Our current culture of rampant consumerism doesn’t encourage you to think this way: the idea our culture promotes is that life is all about you in the now, you in the thrill of the new, you in the very midst of the experience you can enjoy right here, right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The Bible stops us in our tracks and makes us ask: am I here to consume or here to leave a legacy? God is a God of the long view. He doesn’t set us up for the quick win: ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Whoever believes will not be in haste&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Isaiah 28:16 ESV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Whatever stage in your education/work/life you are in right now, and whatever opportunities are floating around you, here’s a challenge as we move into a new year: &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Are you going to take every chance in your life for yourself, without thinking of others, or leave a legacy that will advance the Kingdom of God and peace, justice, mercy and truth with it?&lt;/em&gt; If you’re thinking about a New Year’s resolution for tomorrow, perhaps it should revolve around the bigger picture than just your personal goals for 2015. Now’s the time to talk to God about legacy planning.&lt;/p&gt;

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...And the Lord added to the church daily.' Acts 2:47 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;As the New Year begins, let’s think back to the beginnings of the church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;What started as an apprenticeship group around Jesus has spread to the four corners of the globe, taking root in many and varied cultures and in many and varied languages. Churches meet in homes, stadiums, in secret, in public spaces; some are loud, some are quiet… Globally, around two billion people make up the worldwide Church family. Reports suggest more people are becoming Christians today than at any other point in human history, even though the Bible has only been translated into 500 of the 7000 languages in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;How did this begin? Well, with just the first disciples. They believed in Jesus, not just as the One sent to redeem the world but as their personal Saviour. Jesus told a parable of a great banquet. The master of the house wanted his table full: ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Then the master told his servant, “Go out to the roads and country lanes and compel them to come in, so that my house will be full.”&lt;/em&gt;’ (Luke 14:23 NIV) God loves for people to ‘come in’ to His family. His heart is for those of us who know what being a part of it is like to share it with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;A New Year challenge: what ways can you, as part of the Church, do more this year to urge people to ‘come in’ and discover God’s great banquet for themselves?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood New Year: Rom 13:12-14:19, 2 Cor 5  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63543&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.' Hosea 4:6 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The first Church grew in a world without smartphones, social media, TV or even magazines. So how did it spread? Simply by people passing on the truth about Jesus to other people. They would write letters (like Paul writing to Christians in Rome or Corinth). But more often they would just spend time showing people how to live for God in word and action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The first Christians didn’t cling onto the truth like a gift to be hidden, so they didn’t lose it. As vital as it is, they were ready to give it away to anyone who would listen. They travelled as far and as wide as they could, passing on the world–shakingly Good News. Those first disciples have long gone, but the fearless Spirit that drove them lives on. Now it’s our turn to pass on the knowledge—the truth we have learnt about Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Contrary to what you might be thinking, you don’t need to be a theology hero for this. Acts 1:8 says that God is asking each one of us to be a ‘witness’. The job of a witness is simply to say what they’ve seen, what they have experienced. So don’t worry if you’re not an expert, don’t worry about making a mistake, just tell it like it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Passion is infectious. Passion helps pass on knowledge. Probably a fair few of us chose to live for God because of a passionate Christian youth leader, friend or family member in our lives. Be the most passionate, enthusiastic follower of Jesus you can be, and other people will catch that passion too.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['... they were all filled with the Holy Spirit.' Acts 4:31 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;It turns out cars don’t work so well with empty fuel tanks. Sometimes God asks us to do things that really stretch and challenge us, but He always provides fuel for the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The first Christians were tasked with something quite huge: ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Go, then, to all peoples everywhere and make them My disciples.&lt;/em&gt;’ (Matthew 28:19 GNT) But whilst Jesus was still physically with His disciples He said that He would not abandon them like orphans but would send someone to comfort, counsel and encourage them, as well as remind them of everything He said and did. That ‘someone’ is the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The Holy Spirit is available to all people. He is a source of power, of peace, of God’s presence, of authority, confidence, faith. He is the greatest counsellor, the best encourager, the most gracious comforter. If you’re ever in a difficult situation, you only have to ask and He gives you the words to say. More than this, like a dynamo, the Holy Spirit doesn’t just give us that first moment of belief that allowed us to see Jesus, but He works through us, on and on, giving us the motion to keep believing, even when times get tough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The Holy Spirit is the dynamic power of God available to all people who simply say, ‘God, please come and fill me!’ At the end of our prayers we often say AMEN. This word is more than a religious full stop. It’s one of the oldest words in human language, and means ‘let it be’, ‘I agree’, or our favourite, ‘bring it on!’ So today pray, ‘God fill me with your Holy Spirit. Bring it on!’&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['The new wine is found in the cluster...' Isaiah 65:8 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;Jesus’ first miracle was turning water into wine at a wedding reception. He loved spending time with people at huge get–togethers. So He didn’t have the best reputation with the Pharisees: they called him a ‘friend of sinners’. Problem is, there aren’t many people (in fact any, except for Jesus Himself), who aren’t ‘sinners’, left to their own devices. And that includes people inside the Church, too. Christianity is best done with others—and none of those others is perfect. (We hope this doesn’t come as a surprise, but you are one of the ‘others’ to someone!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;The fact the Church is designed as a community is a strength. Church should be a community marked by love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self control (in case you didn’t spot it, this is from Galatians 5:22–23, the Fruit of the Spirit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;There’s a challenge in today’s reading. Something for any of us who go to church every week (good habit!) Are we adding to the generous, inclusive, welcoming atmosphere that makes the Church a breath of fresh air? ‘Out there’ in the world, it’s all too easy to find that most people have layers of pretence that cover up their real selves. So, when the Church makes room for people to be real, it’s on to something. It’s time to do our bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...He will reward each person according to what he has done.' Matthew 16:27 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;So, we like our faith to be clear. And one thing we hope you can see clear as daylight is this: choosing to believe in Jesus is life–saving. And life–changing. And that’s non–negotiable. Paul tells it to us straight in Romans 8:37–39. Read it and let it sink in: ‘…&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future&lt;/em&gt;’ are going to prevent Jesus from holding out His nail–pierced hand for you to reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;‘Oh, so that’s it then?’ you might think. ‘Don’t my selfless acts count for anything?’ Well, first up: be careful. Make sure your self–sacrifice isn’t a secret longing for recognition or that you’re hiding a selfish motive. We all have to be on guard: being a ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;cheerful giver&lt;/em&gt;’ (2 Corinthians 9:7) means you shouldn’t be checking your inbox every hour for a ‘thanx’ from the struggling person you sent a gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;But, at the same time, it’s true there are things that count toward your eternal ‘reward’. Your God–inspired acts of kindness. That encouragement/gift may never come back round to you, but look at today’s verse—God sees it all. He’s got you. And money/success/fame? They are, at their best, a means of making God known to the world. They won’t be coming with us to Heaven, so treat them that way, too. Don’t prioritise them over serving others for God.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...The humble...retain honour.' Proverbs 29:23 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The first lie ever told was one that appealed directly to our oh–so–human sense of pride. Satan told Adam and Eve that, if they ate the fruit that God had told them not to, they definitely wouldn’t die. He said they’d become just like God instead (that’s in Genesis 3, by the way). That lie was a lie of power, and of status and, well, Adam and Eve bought it. A lot of people would have done the same; after all, we’re mostly inclined to follow our own egos. That’s why Satan hasn’t had to update that particular battle tactic since Eden. He still tells us lies about ourselves, to try and get the upper hand. Whether they’re lies that flatter our ego and make us think we’re so much better than everyone else, or lies that lead us to believe we’re losers compared to everyone else, Satan tries to make us forget God’s truth about us. And that’s so not healthy. The only way we can have a really, truly good view of ourselves is if that view comes from God. In the Psalms, David talks about being ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;fearfully and wonderfully made&lt;/em&gt;’ (Psalm 139:14 NIV), and that’s exactly right. We are wonderful. YOU are wonderful, because God made you. And, because God made you, you are HIS. Every human being is unique, and equal. No better, and no worse, than anyone else. Let’s start to live like it!&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['A new command I give you: Love one another.' John 13:34 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;A newspaper told a story about a boy going through chemotherapy and losing his hair. In support, his classmates shaved their heads too. When he returned to school he looked no different to any of the others. The paper carried a picture of these bald–headed students, with the headline, ‘Everything we do; we do together.’ That’s the ‘law of love’ Jesus talks about: ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;A new command I give you: Love one another&lt;/em&gt;.’ Even when it stings a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;People live by many laws. There’s the ‘law of revenge’ which says, ‘You hurt me; I hurt you harder.’ There’s the ‘law of balance’ which asks ‘an eye for an eye.’ But Jesus’ system storms the law court. It goes against our feelings. It’s a system that asks to turn a cheek and walk an extra mile. It’s the kind of justice that offers to love the enemy or pray for the persecutor. The law of love means you don’t have to get even; you can forgive. It isn’t weak or a walk–over; it’s strong enough to put others first and it chooses to withhold the punch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;1 Corinthians 13: 4–7 NLT says it well: ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous or boastful or proud or rude. It does not demand its own way. It is not irritable, and it keeps no record of being wronged. It does not rejoice about injustice but rejoices whenever the truth wins out. Love never gives up, never loses faith, is always hopeful&lt;/em&gt;…’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Focus on one part of this ‘love check–list’. What needs brushing up on? Hone in on one part of it, and bring it to life for someone who needs it today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[Above all, clothe yourselves with love...' Colossians 3:14 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Is it possible a 2015 application of the Good Samaritan might look a bit like this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;A man was attacked by thugs. A pastor saw him and crossed the road, leaving him for dead. A bunch of other folk saw him and crossed the road. But then this random church–goer came, saw and took pity on the man. He stooped down, tucked a Gospel tract into the man’s pocket and went to leave. The critically–injured man was barely conscious but held out a hand for help. The church–goer stopped and was filled with pity. So he carefully took the man through the booklet and pointed him towards some helpful resources online. Finally he invited the dying man to a church service the following Sunday. Then he left. He was disappointed that the man never showed up (being, as he was, otherwise engaged in the ICU unit of the hospital with stab wounds.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The modern church places great emphasis on getting people into church meetings and courses. We promote prayer and study and fellowship. Not that these are bad things, but what about love? Jesus never said, ‘And they will know you by your extensive knowledge and inerrant doctrine.’ His emphasis was on demonstrating love. Clearly the wounded man needed bandaging and medical help. William Booth who founded the Salvation Army is just one of many followers of Jesus who believed in feeding and caring for the person as well as giving them the Good News—because it is part of the Good News. Be alert this week to ways you can care for others. Trust that doing good will lead to opportunities to share the Gospel in a meaningful way.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...You are members of God's family.' Ephesians 2:19 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Working out differences with others helps to mature us in our faith. Arguments give us the chance to learn. Even disagreements can be an occasion to celebrate diversity. Some difficult stuff can be a chance to take a humble step back and ‘turn the other cheek’. Yes, we certainly wouldn’t advise you to go looking for ways to fall out or get stabbed in the back, but when we bring these things before God in prayer, He can really use them for our good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Years ago, people would huddle together round a television or a record player. But technology now is geared to our own personal, even private, entertainment experience. Life can become like that too—so walled–off and private that we no longer feel we need others so much. Community, though, breaks down our walls. We come face to face with what we dislike in others and in ourselves. Working through disagreements can show us how to respect other peoples’ personalities—yes, don’t seek out arguments, but don’t necessarily run from ‘healthy debates’ when they flare up. God lives in community (Father, Spirit, Son) and, made in His image, we were made for community too. So make sure you aren’t going it alone and meet regularly with other Christians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;And if you’re stuck in an argument you can’t get out of, give it a rest for a bit. Stop thinking about what the other person has said, and think about where you could sensibly and generously give ground.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...If you suffer for doing good ... this is commendable...' 1 Peter 2:20 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Sticks and stones may break my bones but words will… stamp on my heart with lead boots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;So how do you just get on with your life with a size ten studded footprint in your soul? Well, let’s take a look at the Son of God, giving sight to the blind and hearing to the deaf and raising children from the dead—and what thanks does He get? ‘Devil child!’ ‘He’s possessed—by Satan, no less!’ Huh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Yet Jesus refuses to back down. He continues to heal and help. He knows what He is here for and nothing will deter Him from it. When you know what you’re here for, you’ll do the same. People are entitled to their opinions but it doesn’t mean they’re right. Yes, they can mock you. But between you and God, you know the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Jesus didn’t try to look good; He was good. He didn’t try to be truthful; He was truth. Despite leading this blameless life, He still faced insult. His followers did too, and they followed in His steps: ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name [of Jesus]&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Acts 5:41 NIV) Words are important and they can hurt. But. God’s words about you are true, and as you go through day to day life, you can probably see why it’s worth having them handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;If you’re being insulted or accused by people—pray for them. Pray blessings for them. Why? Because it’s the Jesus way. (And it’s a pretty powerful one.)&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['For the despairing man there should be kindness from his friend...' Job 6:14 NAS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;It’s when life comes crashing in on us that we need the love, the sympathy and the support of our friends the most. Poor Job longed for it, but didn’t get it. In the midst of his suffering his friends offered him no more than churchy clichés and pious platitudes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Job needs what we all need when we’re suffering—not someone to try and explain why things are happening or even to suggest strategies for how to cope with it, but just someone to be with us, and share our pain. That’s the real meaning of sympathy: not someone saying ‘there, there’ but someone actually being there. Sympathy says, ‘I understand what you’re going through and I’m here for you.’ Sympathy acknowledges our struggles and gives us the strength to overcome them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Even when there seems to be no one around who can sympathise with your struggles, there is. Jesus sympathises with us—He can, because He’s been through the full spectrum of pain and suffering: ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;For we do not have a High Priest who is unable to sympathise with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Hebrews 4:15–16 ESV) Jesus is the great High Priest mentioned here. Think He hasn’t been tempted like you have? Think again! With this in mind, ask the Holy Spirit to show you someone who is hurting today, and pray for an opportunity to show sympathy in an appropriate way.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail...' Luke 22:32 ESV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;We all know how it feels to fail. Perhaps you’re used to hearing a voice inside your head repeating, ‘You’ve let all these people down… but most of all you’ve let yourself down.’ Ouch. At times like these, we need to remember Jesus’ disciple Peter. Perhaps no one in history has felt the weight of failure like he did. After promising he would never turn his back on Jesus, Peter publicly disowned Him, and felt the crushing, agonising pain of his own failure (Luke 22:54–62).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;That’s why we need to start telling the hopeful truth about failure. Yes, the hopeful truth. First: failure is inevitable. Don’t believe the lie: ‘If you were a real Christian, you wouldn’t have failed like that.’ When you put your trust in Jesus, He set you free from the law of sin and death, but your human emotions, appetites and desires are still at war with the Spirit at work inside you (Galatians 5:17). By His grace, you’re not the person you were, but you’re not the person you’re going to be either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;But also, notice what Jesus said to Peter before this all happened: ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;I have prayed for you...&lt;/em&gt;’ (Luke 22:32 ESV) Even in the middle of Peter’s ‘epic fail’, Jesus was in control. He was going to use this, the most painful episode in Peter’s life, to begin something amazing and new. Read for yourself the way Jesus restored Peter and how reconciliation made way for Jesus to use him in the future (John 21:15–19). Thank Him that He’ll use even the ugly parts of us to bring about something pretty wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...And they chose Stephen...' Acts 6:5 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Growth often brings problems. The early church had grown so fast (like a dozen or so to 3000 on the first day!) so the demands on it grew too, and especially as they related to serving the poor. People shared so wonderfully to start with that there wasn’t a needy person among them (Acts 4:34). But slowly the early church stopped focusing on helping the poor and started discriminating against certain racial groups (Acts 6:1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;What to do? Make no mistake, this was a significant issue: remember what Jesus had to say about both serving the poor and preserving unity among believers (e.g. Matthew 25:35–40, John 17:21). In other words, it was a big deal when the apostles decided to delegate this one out. It meant they needed to choose carefully from the possible candidates. In the end, they let the community pick seven men, but they gave them a bunch of criteria to follow: the men needed to be ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;of good reputation, full of the Spirit and of wisdom&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Acts 6:3 NAS)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;We’ll look at each in turn over the next few days. First of all, what does it mean to be ‘of good reputation’? And why does it matter? Proverbs 22:1 NLT says, ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Choose a good reputation over great riches; being held in high esteem is better than silver or gold&lt;/em&gt;.’ Can you think of an example from someone in public life who has sacrificed a ‘good reputation’ for ‘gold’? Get some friends to pray with you for them today.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Choose...men...full...of the Spirit.' Acts 6:3 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;As we saw yesterday, the seven men chosen to serve in Acts 6:1–6 were not picked on a whim. Their job was far too important to turn just anyone loose on it. So we see three things that the apostles were looking for; three things they thought were absolutely essential to do this important job: a good reputation, and being full of both the Holy Spirit and wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Why’s it so important to be full of the Holy Spirit as a leader in the church? Let’s think about why Jesus promised the Spirit in the first place. In John 14:26 ESV, Jesus said, ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you&lt;/em&gt;.’ Jesus talks about the Spirit as a Helper, sent with a purpose: to teach His followers and to remind them of everything Jesus taught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;In order to go about Jesus’ business, these seven men needed all the love, compassion and grace of Jesus Himself. Hence why they needed to be full of the Holy Spirit. The same is true of anyone who would serve in Jesus’ name. The poor don’t need us, they need Jesus. We don’t have the power to reconcile fragmented communities; only Jesus does. Start to think of a mission activity you are involved with (street outreach? Alpha course? Youth group?) in this light: Jesus hasn’t sent you alone; He’s empowered you by His Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Choose...men...full of...wisdom.' Acts 6:3 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Seven men of good reputation, full of the Holy Spirit and… wisdom&lt;/em&gt;.’ Yesterday we saw how the Spirit would ensure the men were kept on track by the close presence of Jesus through His Spirit. So what extra benefit is meant by including ‘wisdom’ in this list? What wisdom would be lacking if they already had the words of Jesus echoing round their heads?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;‘Wisdom’ here likely refers to the knowledge, skills and insights gained by experience of working with people in real life and business, and the study of the Scriptures. These men were not pretty faces—they had substance. Perhaps they were experienced businessmen or leaders in their family households. They had something specific to bring to the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Very occasionally, God takes a man or a woman with no prior experience in what He’s calling them to—and teaches them everything they need to know on the job. But much more often, God carefully (if sometimes unusually) prepares people for the job He has in mind for them (think Moses, David, Paul). So you don’t need to go to Bible College to influence people in church, but that’s the route God sends most leaders. God can prepare you to lead and serve His people wisely in any sphere of life—in the words of your career advisor, these are ‘transferable skills’. Track down someone you consider to be a wise leader and ask them how God prepared them to serve Him. (And how about you offer to buy the coffee). You might be surprised by what you learn.&lt;/p&gt;

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Stephen, a man full of faith...' Acts 6:5 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Just one more thing before we move on from our look at what qualified Stephen and the Seven for being used by God. Stephen is picked out as ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;a man full of faith&lt;/em&gt;.’ Maybe that’s a pointer to what’s about to come—in just a few verses’ time, Stephen will launch into a sermon so powerful and insightful it gets him killed. As Stephen knew, faith isn’t just what you believe, it’s what you say and it’s what you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;How do we remain ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;full of faith&lt;/em&gt;’ like Stephen? (Without the getting killed bit, of course.) One thing is to feed it. The Bible is faith food. It says, ‘…&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.&lt;/em&gt;’ (Romans 10:17 ESV) That’s not just a verse about what happens when you find faith for the first time—it’s about the daily nourishing effect of reading God’s Word in the Bible. If &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;word4U2day&lt;/em&gt; is your only spiritual ‘food’, you’re just not going to see the same growth as if you get stuck into &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;SoulFood&lt;/em&gt; as well. You need to feast on Scripture itself—the more the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The other way to stay ‘full of faith’ is to use it. Faith is a bit like a muscle—exercise it and it’ll grow strong; don’t and it will grow weak and flabby. If you exercise regularly and get used to flexing it in all the different areas of your life, you’ll find yourself increasingly ‘full of faith’ like Stephen. Think about how you might flex your faith muscles in each of these situations: when you find out a friend is sick; when you hear of a financial need in a local ministry; when your church asks for volunteers to serve.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['He went about doing good... for God was with Him.' Acts 10:38 ESV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;One of the most amazing things about Jesus is His approach to time management. As Peter preaches to the Gentiles about Jesus in Acts 10, one of the key things he mentions is that Jesus ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;went about doing good&lt;/em&gt;.’ He was a man in demand with the not insignificant task of training twelve men to lead a movement that would change the world. Yet central to His ministry was simply ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;doing good&lt;/em&gt;’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Throughout the Gospels, we see Jesus’ agenda interrupted by the demands of seemingly random people. But every story was selected by the Gospel writers for a reason; nothing arrived by accident. So what are they trying to tell us? Surely that what we see is in His life is a glimpse of what He would do in His death: Jesus laid down His life for others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Following Jesus means doing the same—laying down our lives as He laid down His. That’s a hard thing to do, and, to be honest, we’re experts at finding reasons not to obey it: &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;I need to work these extra hours to provide for my family. I need skip that, so I can study more for these exams. I need to hang on to that money because I deserve that holiday&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;But if we let them, Jesus’ words cut through our excuses: ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;If you try to hang on to your life, you will lose it. But if you give up your life for My sake, you will save it&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Matthew 16:25 NLT) How do you tend to respond when God tries to interrupt your inflexible, tightly–organised, written–in–concrete schedule and asks you to make time for someone who’s hurting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'...That you may not bear it yourself alone.' Numbers 11:17 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;At some point in our lives, we’ve all felt inferior. Not needed. On the outside looking in. Like we don’t fit—anywhere. And it hurts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Take Church as an example: it can be SO easy in a world that seems to be run by outgoing extrovert types to believe that centre–stage is where the cool dudes hang out. But this is wrong, and there’s a bigger picture to look at. The best job you can possibly do is the one God has given you the gifts to fulfil. It’s more than likely your church is full of people who need someone to encourage them. An outcast who needs a friend. A tech desk that needs a faithful worker. A project that needs volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Is this an aspiration–knockdown? Well, you’ll be pleased to know we aren’t telling you to wash prayer meeting coffee mugs until the end of time. But God is always ready to teach someone and lead them into their ‘calling’—and that can start small. Starting with people who know you can be an ace way to trace your way into your calling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Bottom line: get to know yourself. Praying and learning about your abilities/personality type can be really helpful. Why? Because you can relax, knowing that God ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;set His faithful people apart for Himself&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Psalm 4:3 NIV) Make an appointment to meet up with someone you trust, and ask them what they think your gifts are. (Perhaps the same person you found for January 16.) Commit to challenge each other to put them to service, then meet up one month later to see what came from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Don't let anyone look down on you...' 1 Timothy 4:12 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can't live a life that's not your own. It's really important to accept the guidance of others, and to take on board any gentle nudges (or steel-toed kicks too, come to think of it) God might give to you through your fellow human beings. However, it's not up to other people to determine what's for you and what isn't. Just because your parents want you to be a doctor, doesn't automatically mean that's what God wants. You've got to have an open enough mind for God to guide you to what you should be doing, even if it's entirely different to what your friends and family think you should be doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world defines 'success' differently from God. The most successful person in God's Kingdom isn't necessarily a CEO in an Armani suit. So, defy the world's expectations. God does. Paul told Timothy, 'Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young,' because people thought Timothy was an inexperienced kid. It's easy to let other people decide what your life should look like, and just assume they're right because they're older or cleverer or genuinely lovely. But Paul thought differently; and so does God. So get God's opinion. In the end it's the only one that counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Ezra 3-5, Lk 9:46-62, Ps 78:1-8, Prov 19:21-23&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62141&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...They called the name of that place Baal Perazim.' 1 Chronicles 14:11 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a man. They called him David. King David. And the Philistines invaded his part of the land of Israel. (They had a history... David the Israelite vs. Goliath the Philistine. Awkward.) But before David slapped on his swordbelt, He checked with God. He said, 'Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will You deliver them into my hand?' and God replied, 'Go up... I will...' so David fought and defeated the Philistines through God's power (1 Chronicles 14). 'Afterwards, David said, &quot;God has broken through my enemies by my hand like a breakthrough of water.&quot; Therefore they called the name of that place Baal Perazim (which means &quot;breaking through&quot;).' (1 Chronicles 14: 9-11 NKJ)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do we learn here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) David reminded himself that 'the Lord had made him king' (1 Chronicles 14:2). God called you, and His Spirit lives inside you. You are His. He is on your side. That's huge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) David simply asked God, 'Shall I go up against the Philistines?' (1 Chronicles 14:10 NKJ) Seriously. Just ask God. What is He telling you to do? Obey that, and you'll come out on top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3) David gave God the credit: 'God has broken through my enemies.' (1 Chronicles 14:11 NKJ) God does amazing things. Sometimes He does them for you, sometimes He does them through you. When He does something good, let the world know. When the breakthrough comes for you, make sure you remember to tell everyone Who made it happen. Sing His praises whenever you can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Ezra 6-8, Lk 10:1-15, Ps 78:9-16, Prov 19:24-26 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62142&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Benaiah...went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion.' 2 Samuel 23:20 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benaiah was the warrior in charge of all King David’s bodyguards. He went into a pit on a winter’s day, maybe to shelter from the cold. Just as his feet were defrosting, he found a new pit buddy: a lion. Maybe it had come in for shelter too. Or more likely, it was hungry and at most fearless in the scarce winter months. Benaiah couldn’t turn and run because he’d only meet a wall. He had to fight, or he’d die. The strongest animal in Israel was staring him down, snow steaming off its flanks. Benaiah’s courage, especially with cold feet, is the reason he is a famously valiant member of King David’s mightiest men. Because there was no middle ground to hide in, he fought the lion and killed it. Thousands of years later, God and His people still look at this personality trait as characteristic of the God–centred soul: boldness, right at the moment that fear threatens to swamp you. Think: when you can’t keep any more distance from the thing you’re afraid of, how do you respond? What puts steel in your spine when fear presses in? If you’re frozen with fear, for any reason, a good idea would be to ask some Christian friends if you can all meet up and pray about it. While it’s great to ask for advice, praying together is much more powerful. Because praying together lets God in on the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Ezra 9-10; Luke 10:16-28; Ps 78:17-31; Pro 19:27-29&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62144&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['And the Lord answered me: &quot;Write the vision; make it plain on tablets, so he may run who reads it.&quot;' Habakkuk 2:2 ESV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In today’s verse, Habakkuk the prophet had been given the job of getting God’s message out to everyone in Israel. Big ask. To do this he had to write down God’s message on tablets (no, this was not like an iPad, more like an iRock.) The idea was for Habakkuk to write God’s words down so that, like an athlete in a relay race, he could pass them on to the next runner quickly. Then that runner would pass them on to the next, and so on until the message was spread around the land. People would be able to share the message quickly because it was a clear message, an obvious message; anyone could get it. God always does this when He has an important message: He makes it clear. He makes it simple. Remember how He introduced Himself to Moses at the burning bush? ‘I AM!’ Think of the most popular verse in the Bible, too: ‘For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.’ (John 3:16 NIV) Some of the Bible is tricky to understand, but the important stuff isn’t. So how are you introducing God to others? Is it in a way they can simply and quickly understand? For some people, the idea that ‘God is real!’ needs to be the first thing they hear. For others, the fact God is loving is a brand new concept. What message has God given you to share?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 John 1:1-3:10; Luke 10:29-42; Ps 78:32-39; Pro 20:1-3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62145&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Don't worry about anything; instead, pray about everything.' Philippians 4:6 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happens when you’re praying instead of worrying? What feeds your worries? Until you can express your fears you can’t get rid of them. Putting your worries into words strips them of much of their power. In the book &lt;em&gt;Life of Pi&lt;/em&gt;, Yann Martel’s main character, Pi, finds himself adrift at sea on a lifeboat with a 200kg Bengal tiger as his companion. While on the lifeboat, Pi begins to analyse his fears, both of the sea and the tiger. He gives this counsel: ‘You must fight hard to express your [fear]. You must fight hard to shine the light of words upon it. Because if you don’t, if your fear becomes a wordless darkness that you avoid, perhaps even manage to forget, you open yourself to further attacks of fear because you never truly fought the opponent who defeated you.’ So pull back the curtain and expose your fears, each and every one. They’re creatures of darkness and can’t stand the sunlight. Financial fears, relationship fears, professional fears, safety fears—call them out in prayer. Drag them out and make them stand before God. How do you do that? ‘Don’t worry about anything; instead, pray about everything… Then you will experience God’s peace, which exceeds anything we can understand…’ (Philippians 4:6–7 NLT) Send your fear packing. Pray, now. God’s the one who can act on the object of your fear, but the act of praying will also reassure you that you’re not being controlled by fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: John 1:1-14; Matt 4:12-16; Matt 5:14-16; Acts 9:1-19&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62147&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I tell you not to worry about everyday life...' Matthew 6:25 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, ‘Therefore I tell you, stop being perpetually uneasy (anxious and worried) about your life…’ (Matthew 6:25 AMP) Not because the stuff you’re worrying about doesn’t exist, but because committing it all to God throws our focus back on the One who can fully care for us, has cared for us, and is going to carry on caring for us. Philippians 4:6–7 NKJ says, ‘...let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.’ And the Phillips version puts it like this, ‘Don’t worry over anything whatever; tell God every detail of your needs in earnest and thankful prayer, and the peace of God which transcends human understanding, will keep constant guard over your hearts and minds as they rest in Christ Jesus.’ (Philippians 4:6–7 PHPS) When you’re more caught up in your love for God than concerned with getting over your worry, you often find that the worry melts off like candle wax anyway. So let your problems drive you into the arms of Jesus. And when you get there, stay there. Isn’t it odd how trying not to worry can become just another thing to worry about? Shouldn’t it be easy, this whole ‘not worrying’ thing? So go to God right now, tell Him all those worries and leave them with Him. If you start to worry again, say, ‘Sorry, Lord. I took back what I’d given You.’ And keep doing this until His peace really does keep guard over your heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 John 3:11-5:21; Luke 11:1-13; Ps 78:40-55; Pro 20:4-6&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62148&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He has sent me to proclaim freedom...recovery...release...favour.' Luke 4:18-19 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you look at ancient maps, you’ll see places which are marked with pictures of sea monsters (‘&lt;em&gt;Here Be Dragons&lt;/em&gt;,’ that sort of thing) to warn off sailors. Were the dragons real? Well, they were real enough in the minds of the sailors. Think of a barracuda in an aquarium tank. A glass barrier divides one half from the other. Each time the barracuda tries to swim at it, it bumps into it. Ouch! Eventually, even if the barrier is taken away, the barracuda still won’t swim beyond that point—because, yep, it’s learned the ‘ouch’ point. The barrier is still in its mind. Jesus was sent to proclaim freedom, recovery and release. Satan will place barriers in your mind that say you can’t go beyond a certain point in life. The barriers are lies. But a lie is as effective as the truth if you believe it and act on it. The Bible is filled with stories of people who were thought to be too ‘little’ or way too insignificant to matter. Those same people went on to smash through barriers they thought they couldn’t. God used them to do amazing things. He’ll do that for you too, no matter how small or limited you feel, if you ask for it. A lie is as effective as the truth when you believe it. Christians are people of the truth, so ask God for His help to see where you or other people are struggling believing wrong things about themselves. Pray for ways to join Jesus today in proclaiming freedom, recovery and release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Chron 1-2; Luke 11:14-28; Ps 78:56-64; Pro 20:7-10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62149&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Each of you must...speak truthfully to his neighbour...' Ephesians 4:25 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christian lingo: that strange language that means we say, ‘Wow, that guy is really anointed at playing guitar’ instead of ‘nice guitar playing, friend.’ Sometimes to speak the truth properly, we have to ditch the lingo. Sometimes for people to feel heard and properly related to, we need to speak a little more, well, honestly. This isn’t to say that Christian words are wrong; specialised Christian words can make tricky ideas plain and shed light on deeper truths. But when these are overused, hard–to–spot barriers can form between Christians and our non–Church friends. To them, what does ‘grace’ or ‘God bless you’ even mean? We can throw in the odd ‘Christian–ese’ word when it needs to be there, but it is so much more honest when we say, for example, ‘I was hurt by what you said,’ than ‘You are being un–Christlike’; or ‘I don’t understand either,’ than ‘God’s ways are higher!’ The list goes on. Let’s use our language honestly to open a window on truth, not cover it up. And if there are tricky Christian words you use all the time but don’t know the meaning of, then check it out online or in one of those wildly big Bible concordances, if there’s one lying around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Chron 4:24-5:26; Luke 11:45-54; Ps 119:1-8; Pro 20:15-18&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62151&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I find this law at work: When I want to do good, evil is right there with me.' Romans 7:21 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know those times when you know the right thing to do, but just can’t go through with it? When we walk away from something good and we dislike ourselves for it. When we actively hurt other people and it really sticks in our gut. Maybe we know our own sin quite well—and when we see it in our actions and attitudes or the things we attach ourselves to, it hurts. Sin constantly causes that inner struggle. The back–and–forth between good and bad. Check out the bigger passage behind today’s verse and you’ll get the idea: ‘I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. ...in my inner being I delight in God’s law; but I see another law at work in me, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within me... Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death? Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord!’ (Romans 7:16–25 NIV) What we’re called to do when we see our own sin is not to melt down, or get really annoyed at ourselves. It’s to return to God in our thoughts, not to our guilt. Eventually, as you do this more and more, you get the sense of the ‘the fear of the Lord’. ‘The fear of the Lord’ is a gift that prods us to go to God so He can reorder our habits, our mind’s patterns. He is willing to do this, and is just waiting for us to return to Him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Chron 6:1-7:19; Luke 12:1-12; Ps 119:9-16; Pro 20:19-21&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62152&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Put on the new self, created to be like God...' Ephesians 4:24 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are times when God’s laws seem ludicrous to us. It’s probably fair to say that some of them seem beyond human ability. Like, ‘be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect’—just what, even? But perhaps that’s the point. In Jesus you have a new, different self, and when you surrender your own ability to ‘do’ Christianity, you ‘put off your old self…and…put on the new self, created to be like God…’ (Ephesians 4:22–24 NIV) Is this still true even when you have to grit your teeth and really force yourself to obey God’s laws, moving past your first instincts? Yes. Living by God’s laws will become your instinct with time (Romans 6:17 tells us so.) It’s like when you’re coming around after waking from deep sleep. It takes a while to remember who and where you are. With time you realise you are a new person. Christian speaker Arthur Burt said, ‘I knew a man who always said “Keep looking down,” “You mean keep looking up, don’t you?”, “No! No! We are seated together with Christ in heavenly places!”’ As Christians we are no longer our old selves. We’re new, and we’re already at home with Christ and His laws, even if it doesn’t feel that way just yet. Next time you have the impulse to check Facebook or whatever on your phone, take the moment to pray for the person whose message you’re scrolling past. Caring for others is one way to ‘keep looking down’ and to ‘put on the new self, created to be like God.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Chron 7:20-9:44; Luke 12:13-21; Ps 119:17-24; Pro 20:22-24&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62153&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...take thought for what is honest...' Romans 12:17 AMP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all want good, honest friendships. But we also can’t help hoping that our friends see the right ‘version’ of ourselves. They are allowed to see the carefully–crafted Facebook profile, but we keep our raw, honest selves hidden. Author Brennan Manning calls that crafted persona ‘&lt;em&gt;The Imposter&lt;/em&gt;’, and said that we put it on when we want to ‘present a perfect image to the public so that everybody will admire us and nobody will know us.’ You may find that in your Church community or house group it’s difficult to really be yourself. There is this idea that, if we just all show up together and call ourselves Christians, everything will work out. But real life’s not always as simple as that—we have to learn to remove our masks. To make a space for honesty, we need to trust God that people won’t be so offended by honesty it will destroy us. Honesty is a decision to act for other people’s good and our own good. Actually being honest, by not holding back our shortcomings and failures, means our friends have to get used to what’s true and real about us. But this is a real relief. It is so worth it. When we live genuinely, and trust in God, before our friends and the world, then the glory of God will be on show in our lives more than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Exo 16:1-18; John 6:1-15; John 6:25-40; 1 Cor 11:23-24 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62154&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...In all things grow up into Him... that is, Christ.' Ephesians 4:15 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we saw that when we trust God, we can be more honest with ourselves and others about our shortcomings. Today we’re looking onwards. Ephesians 4 gives us a route into becoming someone who looks, sounds, and moves like Christ. The whole way through, this chapter is confident that we can get there. You are ‘created to be like God, truly righteous and holy.’ (Ephesians 4:24 GWT) ‘Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind...’ (Ephesians 4:14 NIV) What this Bible chapter says sounds next to crazy—‘&lt;em&gt;You, dear reader, hello—you! Yes, you can become like Jesus!&lt;/em&gt;’—and it doesn’t hold back from letting you know. But spiritual growth doesn’t happen automatically. Growth always begins with a decision. When Jesus asked Matthew to become His disciple, Matthew didn’t really get all the implications of his decision; he more–or–less said, ‘Yeah, alright boss,’ and went from there. That’s all you need to get started. A decision. Nothing shapes your life like the decisions you make. If you want to know what you’ll be like twenty or thirty years from now, look closely at the commitments that rule your life today. Is the challenge of Ephesians 4 pressing into your life, now? Look at your commitments and priorities. Type them up. And put today’s verse at the top. How do the things you want or need to do line up with becoming more like Jesus? If they don’t, it’s time to rethink them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Chron 10:1-12:22; Luke 12:22-34; Ps 119:25-32; Pro 20:25-27&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62155&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['You gave me life and showed me kindness, and in Your providence watched over my spirit.' Job 10:12 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re not likely to hear people say ‘God is my mother’. But some of the things we usually expect our mothers to do, God also does for us. God’s care, kindness and (yep, almost motherly...) life–giving love is there for us. We’re supposed to get comfort from it, when we need it. In Job 10, Job’s life has gone down the tube. He was alone. He was covered in painful sores. Most of his family was dead. Then he remembered where he came from in the first place. Job asked God where His comfort and care went to and why God had stopped acting like the good Parent he used to know. When we’ve lost perspective on our life because things are tough, we can turn to God like this. He’s the Provider who has promised to keep a caring eye on us all our lives, so we can say, ‘God—you birthed me into this world. You saved me and promised to look after me. Where are You now? Come help me!’ Job recognised he needed this kind of perspective. He looked back on his life and recognised that God had always been faithful, and it’s the same for us—He’s been with us since day one, and isn’t about to stop. You know that ‘just came back after a weekend/month/term away’ catch–up chat that happens when you get home? Have it with God. Just spend time talking through life right now with Him. Ask Him to have His hand in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Chron 12:23-15:29; Luke 12:35-48; Ps 119:33-40; Pro 20:28-30&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62156&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Blessed are those whose ways are blameless, who walk according to the law of the Lord.' Psalm 119:1 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we want to actually grow as His children, God wants us to do more than lean on His mercy. We need to start there. Absolutely everything has to come first from His love for us. Equally, that isn’t the end of His gift to us. He wants us to develop our character as we put His laws into practice, because we can grow into something better. God is a Father who wants to see us become closer to Him both in relationship and likeness. He doesn’t want us to see Him as Someone shouting down rules from the clouds. When we get this, His correction starts to make sense. We start to listen to His laws, to stay attentive for His voice that draws us into life, to see joy where we currently struggle with sin, to ‘get’ the need for discipline where we have no patience. He will resist our excuse–making, our posing, and our hiding from obedience because He’s painting a bigger picture. We only know whatever details are in front of us right now. But He knows how the whole thing is going to look when it’s finished! We only know the corner of the room we happen to be in today, He has the blueprints for the whole house. Be reassured that He knows what He’s building in you and that His plans are perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Chron 16-18; Luke 12:49-59; Ps 119:41-48; Pro 21:1-3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62157&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Give ear and come to Me; listen, that you may live. I will make an everlasting covenant with you...' Isaiah 55:3 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;So let’s bring these last two days’ readings together. God’s care looks like the love of a good parent: sometimes comfort, sometimes discipline. But when we zoom out, it’s all part of His promise never to stop loving us. There’s a word for that. Many Bibles translate it as ‘loving–kindness’, but the Hebrew word for it is ‘chesed’ (pronounced ‘hes–ed’). ‘Chesed’ is the love promised by God to His people. It’s very different from every other form of love out there because it involves loyalty from a perfect God. His unshakeable, undeserved love that sticks with us because He is for us. Even when we’re against Him. 2 Timothy 2:13 NIV says: ‘If we are faithless, He will remain faithful.’ God knows we’re an unfaithful bunch—But that doesn't phase Him. ‘Chesed’ is an active love: not just a one–off sweet deal at the Cross, but God moving in our lives every day. This is great news. It makes us here at word4U2day excited, anyway! And God doesn’t force us to reflect His love! We enter out of our own freedom into a relationship with Him. Even when our feelings betray us, or we have a bad day and can’t be bothered with the thought of picking up a Bible, God’s given us something that goes beyond emotions, a love that we can decide to do, not just feel our way into. One good way of helping your decision/will to support your love for God is to read the Bible everyday.

<introtext><![CDATA['Whatever is right... think about [it].' Philippians 4:8 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A man chained in a prison cell wrote, ‘...whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things.’ This was Paul, locked up in a foreign country just for being a Christian. He was writing the letter to the Philippians. He won’t have taken a lot of inspiration from his immediate environment—four tight corners and a damp ceiling—and, worse, he was stuck there day in, day out. It’s not always easy to get inspiration from what’s physically in front of you. Your school may not have been the nicest place to attend. Your street may not have been a great place to grow up. And on a bad day, being pushed into a tight corner just one time too many can kick off a gloomy mood. God is the stable centre of all beauty. Wherever and whenever you are, you can live healthily, if you are fixed on Him. Whether that’s some truth you’ve found in the Bible or a person who shows you the beauty of Jesus or just a morning of quiet worship while you get on with your job, it doesn’t matter. When we have God at the forefront of our minds we can say, ‘The Lord is my chosen portion and my cup; You hold my lot. The lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; indeed, I have a beautiful inheritance.’ (Psalm 16:5–6 ESV) American pastor Jonathan Martin said, ‘Whenever and wherever you see beauty, you will always be able to follow it back to Jesus.’ Keep an eye out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Chron 23:21-26:19; Luke 13:18-35; Ps 119:57-64; Pro 21:7-9&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62159&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Do not be unbelieving, but believing.' John 20:27 NKJ &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Previously, in the book of the Gospel of John...&lt;/em&gt;* The resurrection happened and someone missed it. He got a bit huffy. ‘Unless I see the nail marks in His hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into His side, I will not believe.’ (John 20:25 NKJ) Yep, it was Thomas and he wasn’t going to be taken in by any nonsense about people rising from the dead. As if! ‘A week later His disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you!” Then He said to Thomas, “Put your finger here; see My hands. Reach out your hand and put it into My side. Stop doubting and believe.” Thomas said to Him, “My Lord and my God!”’ (John 20:24–28 NIV) Jesus put an end to Thomas’ unbelief, but He didn’t tell him off for having doubts. It’s so important we get this. Jesus does not hate us for struggling with doubts—not even doubts about His existence. What He wants to do is show you Himself, not punish you for wondering or thinking. Your doubts do not disqualify you. (It’s important to add we shouldn’t allow them to take control. God isn’t a ‘tame lion’ and He won’t always show Himself up the way we ask Him to. But countless doubting Christians have found that when they’ve searched for God, they’ve found hope.) Recently been finding yourself doubting? Take it slowly. Step by step. Whatever’s on your mind, share it with someone you trust—maybe your youth pastor. And, our inbox is always open. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Chron 26:20-29:30; Luke 14:1-14; Ps 119:65-72; Pro 21:10-13 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62160&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...This has been your manner from your youth...' Jeremiah 22:21 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;How often do we go through our days multi–tasking between our ‘Christian’ mind and our ‘normal’ mind? Like tabbing between pages on a web browser, this can eventually use up all our attention and wear us out. We are whole people, not fractured beings. Splitting off our minds into a spiritual bit and non–spiritual bit ends up being unhealthy. How do we fix this? First up: habits are key. The patterns in how you think about things, how you act in certain situations, and the behaviours you return to, make up your whole person. So they’re pretty important, and God cares about them (Like, a lot. The story behind today’s verse is God calling out His people for repeatedly ignoring Him over centuries...) Habits can keep your attention on God and the person He has made you to be, bringing your mind into a focused peace. Habits free you up to do things more quickly and remove mental clutter so that you can think clearly about important things. They play a part in making your whole being a place that God can come and live in. More on that tomorrow! A good way to check your habits may be to have someone you respect and trust question you on the way you react to people, particularly when you’re tired or upset. Are your responses coming from a fear of people, or a ‘fear of God’? (check back to August 8 for more on the ‘fear of God’.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: John 4:4-26; John 7:37-41; Exo 17:1-7; Isa 35:1-7 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62161&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['And you shall again obey the voice of the Lord and keep all His commandments... [He] will again take delight in prospering you...' Deuteronomy 30:8-9 ESV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your habits make a habitat. If those habits make a habitat of praise, then it will be a place where God comes and lives. ‘You inhabit the praises of Israel.’ (Psalm 22:3 NKJ) When we try hard to live in a way that is in line with God’s law, though we can’t fully get it right at first (trying to love your enemies—whaaat?) our attempts make room for God to come and ‘fill in the gap’. So, for example, we may start out trying to love people who are very hard to like. It’s definitely possible to act for the wellbeing of another person without actually liking the person. And God wants it, and we’re keeping His command, so that’s great. But as we keep on trying out that ‘practical’ love, we make space for God to come and fill our hearts with a love that includes feelings, includes joy, and includes—yes!—actually liking the people we find hard to like. This is the power of the Holy Spirit. Our attempts to do things we find impossible make us fall back on the transforming power of God, and His grace. We submit to God and He enables us to make it happen. You could start (if you’re feeling brave... err, not feeling brave? Then ask Him for a bit of courage), by approaching the person who’s come to mind in this reading. A few difficult but meaningful kind words can change a lot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Chron 1-4; Luke 14:15-24; Ps 119:73-80; Pro 21:14-16 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62162&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Who is he who condemns?...' Romans 8:34 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to an area of your life that needs improvement, it’s good to be concerned about it, but not consumed with it. You’ll always be working on some area of your life, so learning that who you are in Christ is not going to change will be pretty important if you want to sleep at night: ‘There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus…’ (Romans 8:1 NKJ) Because God has chosen to see you ‘in Christ’, He finds you acceptable, every day (more than that, He’s downright thrilled to know you. Really.) and you always have access to Him. Your ‘who’ is not based on your ‘do’. God’s not about shaming and blaming you. Yeah, He’ll convict you (meaning His Holy Spirit will point out the things you’ve done wrong.) When you stop resisting His goodness (hint here: repent—that means decide to turn your back on your bad habits and turn to Him) He’ll get you back up on your feet, but He won’t be shaking His head and glaring while He does it. You do that to yourself. God never will. ‘Who is he who condemns? It is Christ who died, and furthermore is also risen, who is even at the right hand of God, who makes intercession for us.’ (Romans 8:34 NKJ) This means Jesus gives you His thumbs–up, and it remains the only thumbs–up–or–down that matters. Conclusion: ”What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?” (Romans 8:31 ESV)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Chron 5-7; Luke 14:25-35; Ps 119:81-88; Pro 21:17-19 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62164&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Blessed are they... who walk according to the law of the Lord.' Psalm 119:1 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have a flick through Psalm 119, and you’ll see that the writer really, really liked getting stuck into God’s law. This is not just a hobby. So, why should we choose to focus on what only God wants for us, and not work off our instincts or other people’s advice? You’ll start to understand the Psalmist’s enthusiasm about hard moral codes if you think about kids playing on a cliff edge. Without a fence you’re counting the seconds until one of them makes a fatal faceplant. With a fence, there’s no worries. God’s law is a fence that brings incredible freedom. Maybe it’s only a matter of time until one of the kids starts wondering what’s on the other side of the fence. If they don’t know or trust the fence builder, they hop the fence—and kerplonk. Brutal. If they survive, they come back saying like the Psalmist, ‘I used to wander off until You disciplined me; but now I closely follow Your Word.’ (Psalm 119:67 NLT) The Ten Commandments start with the words, ‘I am the Lord your God…’ (Exodus 20:2 ESV) All the don’t kill, steal etc. bits come after; God speaks about the relationship first, then about the rules that keep it on safe ground. It’s when we understand that the fence builder absolutely loves us and wants the best for us we’re happy to stay on the right side of the fence. In your prayer time with God today, ask Him to point out where He’s put up important fences you might have not seen yet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Chron 8-11; Luke 15:1-10; Ps 119:89-96; Pro 21:20-23 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62165&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Anxiety weighs down the heart, but a kind word cheers it up.' Proverbs 12:25 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your stomach’s in knots, you feel like an elephant’s on your chest, your thoughts are smashed by a whirlwind. Where can you find relief? In stressed–out days it’s hard to remember that you, as you are, with all your weakness and tired thoughts, are still valued by God. He has said you are His beloved. Even when you come down harshly on yourself, He does not change how He thinks about you. When you forget that God has said you are valued, it’s important to have friends who will come and show you that. Especially if you show kindness to others when they are struggling, but you don’t always show to yourself. One of the wonderful things about being part of the Church is that other Christians can ‘be’ Christ to you in those moments. They can show you what God thinks of you, in patience, quiet listening, in some well–placed humour at the right time. These are really important ways we experience the love of God through our friends who carry His Holy Spirit. Do you have those sorts of friends? And, if you’re feeling pretty on top of things at the moment, are you that sort of friend to someone else? If you’re going through a stressy patch, it could be helpful to venture out and connect with friends who’ve proven to be good listeners before. Or you can txt (0401 132 888) or call PrayForMe (1800 PrayForMe), if you want to chat it over anonymously. Find a way to bring your anxiety to God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; SoulFood: 2 Chron 12-15; Luke 15:11-32; Ps 119:97-104; Pro 21:24-27 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62166&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['In the multitude of my anxieties within me, Your comforts delight my soul.' Psalm 94:19 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;About three hundred years ago, minister Matthew Henry rifled through the Bible and wrote cool comments on all the verses. Here’s what he had to say about today’s verse: ‘The world’s comforts give little delight to the soul, when hurried with melancholy thoughts; but God’s comforts bring that peace and pleasure which the smiles of the world cannot give, and which the frowns of the world cannot take away.’ Today, most people sense there must be something deeper to how we feel than ‘just getting through’ from day to day. To stay in touch with our humanity we have to look out for God’s comforts. As you walk around today, notice what God puts in your path. The old clichés are to watch a sunset or lie on a beach. It’s true; these are things we can be grateful for when we’re able to do them. But you might have to train yourself up to look out for the beauty of God in places you can notice every day. To appreciate a conversation with a friend. To make a small gesture of kindness to someone in your family you take for granted. To stop being hurried and find that deeper comfort that the world can’t take away. When you do this, you might even find that the Author of beauty Himself sneaks up on you to delight in it with you. Nothing restores your soul more than God Himself. If you’re on autopilot today, take a deep breath, switch it off and turn to Jesus in prayer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Chron 16-18; Luke 16:1-18; Ps 119:105-112; Pro 21:28-31 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62167&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.' 1 Peter 4:14 ESV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corrie Ten Boom was a young Christian when her home country, the Netherlands, was invaded in World War II. She quickly got fearful she wouldn’t know what to do if the Nazis confronted her. So her dad told her, ‘When you are going to take a journey on the train, do I give you your ticket three weeks early or just as you get on the train?’ Corrie said, ‘As I get on the train.’ ‘So God will give you the special strength you need to be strong in the face of death just when you need it, not before.’ Are you worried you don’t have the strength to live for God? Feel like you lack the ‘oomph’ to be a powerful Christian? Whether you discover it like Corrie, facing danger and persecution, or right when you step out to tell someone the Gospel, or in the moment when you get hit by hurtful insults, God’s strength comes right when you need it. We’re even promised: ‘...don’t worry about what to say or how to say it. At that time you will be given the things to say. It will not really be you speaking but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.’ (Matthew 10:19–20 NCV) Whether you feel it or not, your God has got your back: when you step out for God (and maybe not even a second beforehand), you’ll discover you have all that you need. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Chron 19-21; Luke 16:19-31; Ps 119:113-120; Pro 22:1-3 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62168&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...God led you through the wilderness...to prove your character...' Deuteronomy 8:2 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Florida, wiry trees called Caribbean Pines thrive in deadly environments. They stick out drought, fire and hurricanes. In fact, if you plant them in a setting trees normally love, they’re so hardcore they just shrivel and die. It can be a similar case with our souls: we shrivel because things go so well we feel we don’t need God. Sometimes we need a wilderness to refine our faith like the children of Israel who were led into the desert: ‘to prove [their] character, and… find out whether or not [they] would obey His commandments.’ They could choose to give up and shrivel up there, or trust Him to bring them safely to the Promised Land. When things get too comfortable, our faith actually shrivels. The odd blast of wilderness can be genuinely good for us. Sometimes God allows the fiery draught of very difficult times so we can see what’s in our faith—is it made of the good, solid stuff that trusts in God?—and to mature it and get to the true and better person inside. God leads you through the wilderness to prove your character. That also means that He’s in control. Your ‘wilderness’, if you’ve given your life to God, is both for a purpose (the best there can be: His loving plan for you) and it’s safe—in His hands. Look back on the last three months. What hard times have you been brought through? What good things have come from them that couldn’t have happened otherwise? Rejoice when rough times look like they’re about to sweep in. Bring it on! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: John 10:1-18; Rev 7:13-17; Ps 23; Luke 15:1-7 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62169&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The works that I do [you] will do also...' John 14:12 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jesus told His disciples, ‘The works that I do you will do also.’ Skip forward to the book of Acts and guess what? They did! They took on His character and became like Him. What happened in between? He mentored them. If you want to get somewhere in life, ask God for the right mentors. Some mentors you get for a short chunk of your life, others for a lifetime. Some of them might even be close friends who end up discipling you in a quiet, hidden way. So how do you recognise a mentor? They might be someone who sticks by these promises: (1) I’m willing to spend time to build a close relationship with this friend; (2) I’ll keep believing in the potential of this friend, keep getting them excited about the future I see ahead of them; (3) I’m willing to be vulnerable and available to my friend, to share not only my strengths and successes, but also my weaknesses, failures, and generally–rubbish moments; (4) When it’s right to, I am willing to be honest in confronting my friend; (5) I am committed to standing by them through trials—even trials that they bring on themselves; (6) I’ll help them set goals for a spiritual life or ministry; (7) I’ll actually practice what I preach. None of this ‘talking the talk without walking the walk’ business. Find a mentor. Become a mentor. It’s a top way to fit all the different pieces of the Christian life together. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Chron 22-24; Luke 17:1-10; Ps 119:121-128; Pro 22:4-7 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62170&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...His sheep follow him because they know his voice.' John 10:4 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re chatting with a good mate, there’s an ease in the flow of your conversation because you know who you’re talking to. You know the person who’s listening to your words. You feel safe in knowing what you say won’t be taken the wrong way. Talking to God is sometimes less easy when you’re first getting to know Him because it can feel like talking to a blank canvas (maybe you remember that, or you’re going through it now). Who is He? What does He want to hear? What does He want me to say? Or even if He seems to have gone quiet with you, or was never ‘loud’—how do you get into a place where you can even begin to learn to hear His voice? This is why so many of Christianity’s traditional prayers start with thanks. When we start our prayers with gratefulness we are doing what’s right (giving God His due for everything He’s given) and we’re starting to get a sense of the person we’re talking to: the Giver of all good gifts. When we’re thanking Him, we’re starting to learn His character. Ann Voskamp says, ‘Giving thanks in all things is how to pray continually [1 Thessalonians 5:17–18]... This is the way to do God’s will for your right now. Thanks to God is what calms the wild heart.’ So, praise Him! Lots! Then listen out...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; SoulFood: 2 Chron 25-28; Luke 17:11-19; Ps 119:129-136; Pro 22:8-10 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62172&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['He... shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.' Psalm 91:1 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the ‘shadow of the Almighty’? You might think of an overcast day and wonder if this is a bit of a not–very–sunshiney gloomy thought. But if you’d been living in the blistering heat of a desert for the last forty years—which is exactly what God’s people had been doing for a fair chunk of the Old Testament (post–Prince of Egypt)—then it’s something a little more appealing. So the Israelites, as you can imagine, liked a good shadow or two. It meant shelter and comfort in a very hot climate. What does it mean for us? We know that God’s personality isn’t all–guns–blazing, instead He’s our place of safety. We can read ‘shadow’ as ‘safety’. In the blistering heat of life’s battles, temptations, and worries, God is the life–saving shadow we can always come back to. Yes, we have to go on the offensive sometimes, and withstand the attacks of Satan, and fight back with Scripture. But, in reality, as humans, we aren’t set up to be at the forefront of battle all the time. We need to rest in God. Think about this: could you spend the whole day walking in the shadow of the person beside you. How close would you have to stay to be able to manage it? Would you have to change the rhythm of your walk to stay there? What does this tell you about ‘being in God’s shadow’? Yep, stay close and move as God moves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; SoulFood: 2 Chron 29-31; Luke 17:20-37; Ps 119:137-144; Pro 22:11-13 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62173&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Faith is the substance of things hoped for...' Hebrews 11:1 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s lots we can’t do on our own. Especially as Christians. Stuff like overcoming the world—see 1 John 5:4—can only be done with faith in God. ‘Faith’ is one of those words that’s not often defined for us (like ‘Hosanna’ or ‘Amen’... ‘Bless’...) But today’s verse gives a pretty clear definition of what faith is. What does it look like? (a) Being certain of victory. Back to 1 John 5:4. Our victory over Satan comes by faith, not by willpower and discipline. Faith comes from the Word of God, not from anything within ourselves. (b) Being certain of growing to be like God. Faith isn’t a one–time event that starts and finishes the moment you become a Christian. We keep growing in our faith. By learning. ‘So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.’ (Romans 10:17 ESV) And by doing. ‘What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works?’ (James 2:14 ESV) So much of this ‘faith’ business is about being ok with the future. This is not easy… if you’re struggling to see past things that worry you, head back to August 3 &amp; 4. And soak in the knowledge that, as you spend daily time in the Word of God (try SoulFood), that God will build faith in you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Chron 32-34; Luke 18:1-17; Ps 119:145-160; Pro 22:14-16 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62174&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...He has commanded us to love one another...' 2 John 1:6 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life can be busy. And it’s great (really, really great) you take time out with God in the middle of all that. So now, what about your on–earth relationships? Jesus made it pretty clear the second most important thing in life, right after loving God, is loving people (that’s in Matthew 22:37–40, team). And to do that, we have to spend time around others— even those irritating, imperfect, demanding, frustrating people. It’s awful for our relationships if we don’t put time and effort into them. That’s how friends ‘drift apart’ and how families can start to misunderstand each other. Plus, we need other people. That few minutes spent chatting to your mate, or that Sunday roast round the table—it all adds something to your life because God made us to live in community. The love of others is good for us. And, the love we send out is good for those others. Ask God to fill you up with His love, to the point that you’re positively overflowing with it. Then, if you take the time to really share a little of your day with another person, chances are, you’ll be able to share God in some way too. Even if that’s just in the friendly hello someone needs to hear today. A practical exercise in loving: Go to your phone. Scroll down to the 10th person you texted and start there. Pray for that person that they’ll have a really blessed day. You could even send them an encouragement to top it up, if you liked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Chron 35-36; 2 John; Luke 18:18-30; Ps 119:161-168; Pro 22:17-19 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62175&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...but I focus on this one thing: Forgetting the past and looking forward to what lies ahead.' Philippians 3:13 NLT &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Philippians 3, Paul talks about how he really, genuinely, very–very–earnestly wants to live a Jesus–centred life. But he’s under no illusions. He knows he’s not already perfect. Read Philippians 3:12–13. There, Paul explains something so important— that, no matter how human he is in this life, he’s adamant that he’ll press on, looking forward to his future relationship with Christ perfected in Heaven. What a brilliant example! We all need to recognise where our lives don’t look like Jesus’, and take those areas to God in prayer and apologise. As soon as we give our mistakes up to God, He lays them to rest, reminding us to move on, looking ahead to our final goal of being with Christ forever. But we can have a tendency to keep hold of the past. Sometimes that’s through guilting ourselves, but sometimes in a very different way. In a weird way, it can be tempting to look fondly on our past sins (Really. Think about it… it happens more than you might realise). There’s a part of us all that’s twisted and wants to be loudly proud of those ‘wasn’t I a rebel’ moments. Truth is, that point of view is just not healthy. If you’re still tied to your past in any way, it’ll be harder to move forwards, towards ‘that perfection’ that Paul calls for us to focus on. Think: what have you done (or do you still do) that you feel stops you heading towards ‘that perfection’? Pray your apology, and ask for help. Then hit delete. Let it go from your records, just like it’s gone from God’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 3 John; Jude; Luke 18:31-43; Ps 119:169-176; Pro 22:20-23 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62178&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Endure until your testing is over. Then you will be mature and complete...' James 1:4 GWT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow is the official start of Spring. Flowers and stuff. Great. Then, a few months from now, spring will have sprung and it’ll be sizzling into summer. Your life works the same, in cycles and seasons. That means some periods of our lives are all green grass, shiny newness and fresh loveliness. It also means some periods will be dead leaves, rain and sniffles. Whichever you have right now, God’s on it. He’s the one who decides when we get spring–like growth seasons. And when we need a stretch of... being s t r e t c h e d... He brings us into (and through) it. ‘For everything there is a season.’ (Ecclesiastes 3:1 NLT) That’s not to downplay how outright rubbish those tough seasons can feel. But they’re a necessary part of God’s long–term plan. Think about a tree. The only reason it has space to grow strong, healthy, green leaves in spring is because it lost the leaves it’d finished with last autumn. And it only grew new ones after shivering, bare–branched, through winter. If everything looks barren and cold around you right now, we 100% guarantee it’s only for a time. In that time, the best thing you can do is stick to God, and let the difficulty He has allowed you to face do its work. Seasons come and go. So it’s important to have a stable centre to your life. Are there any places in your room that you can turn into ‘prayer spaces’? It doesn’t have to be a wooden bench to kneel at, it could even just be a beanbag. Make it special place to remind you to meet with God each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Phil 2:5-11; Rev 19:11-16; Acts 3:1-16; Matt 1:18-21 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62180&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Tell the Israelites to designate the cities of refuge...' Joshua 20:2 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Old Testament, God’s people had a High Priest every generation, set apart and ‘anointed with the holy oil’ (Numbers 35:25 NRS) to represent that generation to God, and also to represent God to them. When he died, then the one who had represented God had passed away. God allowed his death to signify the removal of sin from His people and to ‘reset’ their relationship with Him. This was particularly useful with regard to the laws about accidentally killing someone. Legally, the victim’s family could take your life in exchange. Not good. But God is all about forgiveness. He told Israel to set up six ‘cities of refuge’—essentially safe bases. You ran to them, explained your story to the town elders, and hid out in the town, knowing they were duty–bound to protect you. No–one hunting you was allowed to enter the city at all. Safe. And the thing that really showed the extent of God’s grace was this: you weren’t even trapped there for life. When the High Priest died, you were ‘forgiven’—released from your sanctuary and allowed to go home. No one was permitted to harm you. The relationship had been ‘reset’. Spotted Jesus yet? Jesus, our ‘High Priest’, really represents us to God (Hebrews 4:14): Jesus didn’t just carry us into a Temple’s Holy of Holies but into the throne room of Heaven itself. He died once, for all time, resetting our relationship with God to ‘forgiven’. If you run to God’s refuge in Jesus, then wherever you are, Satan can’t touch you, and you’re in a completely restored relationship with God. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Josh 1-4; Luke 19:1-10; Ps 84; Pro 22:24-26 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62181&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!' Psalm 133:1 KJV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grab a Bible and read Psalm 133. It’s short. It’ll probably take about half a second. Ok, maybe half a minute. Chances are you’ve heard that opening verse before. And yeah, it certainly is nice when we get along. But why? What is there about unity that’s so special for us Christians? Is there something more to it than it just making us feel warm and fuzzy? Well, verses two and three of Psalm 133 name oil and dew. Hmm. It might seem a bit poetic at first, but it’s got real meaning. Oil being dropped on a person happened as a symbol of the Holy Spirit ‘anointing’ them, and the power that comes with that. More often than not, that ‘anointing’ was a sign of God giving someone the power to go and carry out one of His plans. And dew crops up in Isaiah 26:19. Interestingly, it’s a symbol of that same power giving new life (by resurrecting the dead) to God’s people. Oil = God’s Spirit and power. Dew = God’s Spirit and power. So, what the Psalmist seems to be saying here is that, when we ‘live together in unity’ (Psalm 133:1 NIV), something mind–blowingly huge happens—as a community, we receive death–beating power that enables us to do what God wants. God comes to rest in a very real way over the collection of people who are brought together because of Him. As individuals, we don’t have what we have as community. Pretty good reason to do that ‘fellowship’ thing, huh? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Josh 5:1-8:29; Luke 19:11-27; Ps 103:1-12; Pro 22:27-29 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62182&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['In Christ we who are many form one body, and each member belongs to all the others.' Romans 12:5 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was all about what happens when Christians work together. Wonderful stuff. Now. How? How do we work together? How do we do unity? Paul has some great advice in Romans. He compares the Church to the human body. He writes: ‘...since we are all one body in Christ, we belong to each other, and each of us needs all the others. God has given each of us the ability to do certain things well. So if God has given you the ability to prophesy, speak out when you have faith that God is speaking through you.’ (Romans 12:5–6 NLT) One good way to work together with the church around you is to do exactly that: to find out from God what role He has made you to fulfil, and then fulfil it. After all, He created the overall plan. He’s created everyone around you to fit together, kind of like a jigsaw. If every piece chooses to be the right shape, the overall picture will come together, no problems. And, with a God–designed team around you, you have no reason to be nervous of taking up your part in things. You can step up to your place in the knowledge that the guys and girls around you are commissioned by the same, unshakable God. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Josh 8:30-10:43; Luke 19:28-40; Ps 103:13-22; Pro 23:1-3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62184&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...he who does wrong will receive the consequences...' Colossians 3:25 NAS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Ortberg writes: ‘My friend Andy Chan headed up the placement office for helping graduates find work. He says that some day he wants to write a book called The Myth of Passion. This is the myth that somewhere out there is the perfect job, the idealised calling that fits my soul the way a key fits into a lock. And if I could just find that job, torrents of passion would cascade out of my heart like water going over Niagara Falls.’ Just about all of us have a romantic idea that we will find ‘job–love at first sight.’ But what if you are in a job that doesn’t excite you? What if you have to study stuff that seems downright boring? Ortberg writes: ‘Passion for our work is not usually a subterranean volcano waiting to erupt… It is a muscle that gets strengthened a little each day... as we do what is expected of us, and then some.’ Paul wrote: ‘Whatever you do, do your work heartily, as for the Lord... knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance. It is the Lord Christ whom you serve. For he who does wrong will receive the consequences of the wrong which he has done.’ (Colossians 3:22–25 NKJV) Maybe it would help to put a sticker up on your phone: ‘For God’s sake—do your best!’ Why? For two reasons: (1) Because you represent Christ wherever you go. (2) When you are faithful in small things, He will promote you to greater things (Matthew 25:21). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Josh 11-13; Luke 19:41-48; Ps 111; Pro 23:4-6 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62185&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['If I can just touch [Him], I will be healed.' Mark 5:28 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark’s Gospel records the story of a Jewish woman who, for twelve solid years, had been suffering from an ‘issue’ of constant bleeding. For this lady, in the society in which she lived, the impact on her life was devastating. She was totally broke, having spent all her money on medical bills. The religious laws said her husband couldn’t go near her. Babies were totally off the cards. Everything she touched was considered ‘spiritually unclean’. The religious laws meant she couldn’t even go to worship God in the Temple. She was completely worn–out, and not even allowed to go to God’s house to be refreshed. At the end of her tether, she decided to put her trust in God. She went out into a crowd that was disgusted by (and probably afraid of) her, and she grabbed hold of the fringe of Jesus’ prayer cloak. And it worked. Her earnest faith did something amazing—it drew the power of God to her, and she was healed. She was freed from all of the laws that made her life difficult. She could enter God’s temple, stand tall in her community again, not look in the mirror and see ‘unclean’. And all of this, just from grabbing Jesus’ garment in an act of faith as He passed by. What could you do, if He stood in front of you now? Is there an ‘issue’ where you need to reach out in faith to Jesus to be healed? Take it to Him now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Josh 14-15; Luke 20:1-8; Ps 142; Pro 23:7-9 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62187&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit...' 1 Corinthians 12:4 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul writes, ‘There are different kinds of gifts, but the same spirit.’ Successful people invest their time, energy and resources into their core strengths. Why? Because that is where they get their highest return! Occasionally they’ll try their hand at something new. Take Michael Jordan, for example, arguably the world’s most famous basketball player. For various reasons MJ decided to try his hand at baseball for a season. He may have enjoyed the experience, but exiting the game so early is probably not what he’d like to be remembered for. God gave you gifts that make you unique, gifts that hold great possibilities. But you have to discover them and develop them. A sign on a DIY shop says it all: ‘We’ve got it, if you can find it.’ Nobody was ever born without talent, including you, but you’ve got to find it. What keeps us from doing that? (1) The company we keep. The old saying goes, ‘If you run around with turkeys, you’ll never fly with eagles.’ The Scripture says, ‘He who walks with wise men, will be wise...’ (Proverbs 13:20 NKJV) (2) Failing to spend time in prayer and in God’s Word. God is not only the giver of your gift, He supplies the strength to function successfully in it. Aristotle said, ‘We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence then is not an act, but a habit.’ So if you want to succeed, consult God, and operate in your God-given strength. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Josh 16:1-19:23; Luke 20:9-19; Ps 20; Pro 23:10-12 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62188&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Let us love one another, for love comes from God...' 1 John 4:7 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oops. We said it. But relax; we’re not going to force you into marriage. What we’re talking about is Godly commitment to everyone around you, and everything you do. God commits to loving, growing and parenting you. And with Him doing that, you can’t help but share that love with others. The whole of 1 John 4:7 NCV reads: ‘Dear friends, we should love each other, because love comes from God. Everyone who loves has become God’s child and knows God.’ Now, hands up… who speaks Greek? Hmm, stick with us anyway. That second sentence, ‘Everyone who loves has become God’s child and knows God’ isn’t exactly straightforward. In the original Greek, there is one word that means ‘has become God’s child’, and it does some weird stuff with tenses. It’s past and present all at the same time; it means ‘has become God’s child right at that point, and will continue to become more and more God’s child as time goes on.’ Sooo… everyone who shows God’s love has been adopted by God and shows Him through their relationships and work. But it doesn’t stop there. God promises to put work into fathering and teaching them, every day, for the rest of their lives (pretty good model for commitment). And under that sort of attention from God, our human commitment to sharing love with the world becomes way more do–able each day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Heb 11; Matt 21:18-22; Matt 8:5-13; Mark 6:1-6 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62189&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...be patient, bearing with one another in love.' Ephesians 4:2 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to any of our ‘relationships’ with others (literally any friendships, siblings, colleagues you kinda–don’t–wanna–but–kinda–hafta sit next to, marriage, parents), there’s a simple acid–test we should be checking. Ready? Here it is: ‘Am I going in the right direction?’ But what does this question mean about navigating a world populated with friends and strangers? Well, all your thoughts, plans and decisions are either heading in your direction, or away from yourself and to God’s direction. And God’s direction is always towards the well–being of the other person. Guess it’s kind of obvious. We all have relationships we don’t enjoy, though: what about when they just keep getting it wrong, and we have to get all defensive? Or when they’re so full of gossip that it’s impossible not to join in (and maybe later gossip about them too?) Or when they’ve messed up but so have we, and still the easiest thing to do is just pass the blame entirely on to them? Hmm. When you are taking the trouble to bring about the best for another person, not to focus on their problems or mistakes, you’re doing it right. Choose not to gossip. Instead, make it a habit to give genuine compliments to others and build them up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Josh 19:24-21:45; Luke 20:20-26; Ps 112; Pro 23:13-15 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62190&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The words that I speak unto you, they are Spirit, and they are life.' John 6:63 KJV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, ‘The words I have spoken to you—they are full of the Spirit and life.’ (John 6:63 NIV) Obviously, the Bible as we read it today wasn’t in existence when He said that; He was talking about His own, out–loud words. But His words are recorded in what has become the Bible—the parables and sermons that He used to tell His disciples are now part of Scripture. Just like Jesus’ on–earth speeches, the rest of the Bible is made up of words that have come right from God. And they remain full of God. The potency and power that will change your life is still there, waiting for you to discover them. Sometimes, though, reading those words just doesn’t happen. Too much effort. Not enough time. Simple forgetfulness. So let’s tackle this head–on. This week’s readings will focus on how to grasp the words of the Bible, remembering that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Bible is massively important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And sometimes it’s hard to know how to use it as a practical tool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But we think we can help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next few days, we’re going to have a good dig into what the Bible is, what it does and how to use it. Whether you’re well up on the Scriptures, or you struggle to remember where you left your Bible, we think it’ll have something good to offer you. The Bible really is great, but it’s worth taking some time to remind yourself of the whys and hows of its greatness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Josh 22-24; Luke 20:27-40; Ps 27; Pro 23:16-18&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62191&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my daily bread.' Job 23:12 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Job could not find God. He just couldn’t. And it’s not like he didn’t try. The thing is, sometimes God chooses to be silent for a while. Sometimes He steps back. He’d never do it without good reason (and it’s frustrating when we don’t know the reason), but sometimes it’s necessary. The question that lives in that type of silence is: ‘How do you fill it?’ If it seems you can’t feel or find God, how do you navigate your life with Him? Well, the fact is, by some sort of Design, His words are always around. You guessed it. The Bible. Even if you don’t feel bird–sized butterflies in your stomach while you’re reading it, the Bible’s still speaking directly into the life you’re living. That’s what it’s there for. Job didn’t feel the presence of God for ages, but could still confidently say, ‘I have kept to His way without turning aside. I have not departed from the commands of His lips; I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my daily bread.’ (Job 23:11–12 NIV) He loved the words of God that He remembered from the past, even when God wasn’t speaking to him in the present. And that’s what kept him going. That’s what kept his life right when he couldn’t hear God in any other way. What are some Bible verses you should write out and keep in your wallet for those days when God seems silent? Commit them to paper today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; SoulFood: Col 1-2; Luke 20:41-47; Ps 78:1-8; Pro 23:19-21 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62192&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that...you may grow...' 1 Peter 2:2 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it. We don’t always feel like reading the Bible. It’s all well and good to be told to ‘crave pure spiritual milk’ like that, but craving isn’t a choice, is it? Not exactly. But you can choose to make it a daily practice, steering yourself towards a place where it’ll happen naturally. Scripture mentions the need to get rid of ‘all malice and all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and slander of every kind’ (1 Peter 2:1 NIV) before craving spiritual milk. It makes it seem like Peter thinks that it’s not possible to get to a place of true, honest desperation for Godly growth whilst having a heart full of hateful emotion. Hmm, curious that… Also, 1 Peter 2:3 NIV explains that craving good God–things comes from having ‘tasted that the Lord is good.’ You have to ‘taste’ your Bible (read it a bit) and notice the positive effects, before you can start to crave it regularly. The first step towards that is to commit to a routine. To make the decision to read a bit of your Bible every day. The second step is to actually do it. Even when you really don’t want to. Especially when you really don’t want to. And if you miss a day or two (or a week), pick it up again anyway from that day. Keep going. Then, maybe after a while, you’ll find that it becomes a part of your day that you look forward to. Get started then! Plan exactly when you’ll spend that time today, then actually do it. SoulFood will help you start. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Col 3-4; Philemon; Luke 21:1-11; Ps 78:9-16; Pro 23:22-25 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62193&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...You received His message... And this word continues to work in you who believe.' 1 Thessalonians 2:13 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, after taking yesterday’s advice onboard—what then? What do we do with the Bible that we read? Let’s look at 1 Thessalonians 2:13–14. It explains a sort of folding–out effect from getting close to God’s words—starting with hearing or reading them, and ending in living them out. Thessalonians 2:13 lays out the in–between steps that makes living the Bible possible. And they’re pretty interesting: (1) ‘You received the word of God…’ —That’s the reading, the listening. There’s no way around it. Read your Bible. (2) ‘You accepted it not as a human word, but as… the Word of God.’ —This is about recognising the value and authority of those words of God. It’s so important to remember the Bible is a Spirit–infused letter, full of God’s authority and knowledge. (3) ‘Which is indeed at work in you who believe’ —All of that Spirit, authority and knowledge of God that’s in the Bible… well, it’s ‘at work in you who believe.’ If you read God’s words and acknowledge the power of them, that power starts to work as part of your life. Then, after the reading, the accepting, and the having–it–work–in–you, comes the action. And it comes very naturally. Once you’re changed on the inside, the choice to ‘live it out’ should be an easy one. You’ll learn the best way to act from your Bible (Jesus is a good example for that), and find yourself more ready to follow it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Neh 1-4; Luke 21:12-24; Ps 78:17-31; Pro 23:26-28 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62194&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Your promises have been thoroughly tested, and Your servant loves them.' Psalm 119:140 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psalm 119 is kinda incredible. It’s a really impressive acrostic poem (remember them? They’re the ones where the first letter of each line spells out a word or name) and it constantly refers back to the words of God. Every single thing that this Psalm says about God, or asks of Him, comes back to the Torah (the old Hebrew word for teaching or direction. It comes from an archery term and the idea behind it is instruction on how to hit a bullseye every time). It’s veeeeerrrryyy obvious this poet was extremely focused on it; he’s clearly read it a lot and constantly comes back to it. All of the stuff the poet knows about who God is circles back around to his knowledge of the Torah. There’s something we could (and should) learn from this. In 2014, Christians always seem to stress the relationship with God as the important thing. And that’s true. But, over the centuries, it’s possible we’ve lost touch with the fact some of that relationship is built through following the Bible’s instruction. We can get to know so much about God’s personality through the pointers He gives us in His Word on how to live. When we really get to grips with how to live as God wants, we automatically get to know Him better. Psalm 119 demonstrates it. When we read the Bible in a way that changes us and our actions, we open ourselves to being pulled a whole lot closer to Him. So, if you don’t already, why not dedicate a day a week to God as a ‘Sabbath’ holy day? Decide to rest, to make real time to dig into His written word (start with Exodus 20:8–11), and serve Him through serving those around you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Neh 5-7; Luke 21:25-38; Ps 78:32-39; Pro 23:29-35 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62195&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['There is one...mediator between God and men...Jesus.' 1 Timothy 2:5 KJV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’re a professional bricklayer. We all are. We spend our days adding bricks to the wall that separates us from God. Most Christians call that wall ‘sin’. Call it what you will, it’s built to separate us from any sort of relationship with God–the–Father. And sin would’ve gotten away with it, if it wasn’t for Jesus. He came, He gave Himself up, and He tore down all the walls we ever built (and ever will build) between us and the love of God. That’s what 1 Timothy 2:5 means—that Jesus is the one who stands alongside humankind and God–the–Father at the same time. He communicates across the gap between us and God, and makes things right—He even prays on our behalf (see John 17 for details). When Jesus said, ‘No one comes to the Father except through Me’ (John 14:6 NIV), that’s exactly what He meant. No one can kneel, stand, sing, whisper, cry or anything before God if they don’t go to and through Jesus first. He fought and died for our right to be on good terms with God. And that’s the absolutely vital importance of Jesus in Christianity. If it wasn’t for the Master–Plan of His sacrifice, we’d have no place before God. We’d have no Heaven to look forwards to. Instead we’d have, well, nothing but outer darkness for company. Practical exercise: grab a scrap of paper. Write down the name of a particular sin you feel is really hard to shake off at the moment. Read your Bible. Pray that God will remove that sin away from your life through the power of His Son Jesus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Heb 11:23-28; Exo 3; Exo 33:7-23; Exo 34:29-35 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62196&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The Lord forgave you, so you must forgive others.' Colossians 3:13 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s fair (and right) to work through feelings of hurt, not deny them. But, forgiveness still has to happen. Have a look back at yesterday’s reading. Jesus stepped in to fix things between us and God. This hurt Them—the Father and Jesus both. It hurt Jesus in the shape of metal nails, whip–lashes, spears and a crown of thorns. And it came with its own soundtrack of the careless laughter of His enemies, alongside the heartbroken cries of His family. But He embraced the experience, full of forgiveness. Jesus shows there is a healthy way to get over hurt. Forgiveness is not about staying the victim, but about taking control through loving–but–strong action. He did it so we could be let off for all of the wrong things we still do. Wow. That’s inspiration enough to forgive the people who’ve acted really terribly towards us. Still, it doesn’t actually make it much easier to do. (And sometimes there need to be other steps first—like letting people know if you’ve been seriously hurt and it’s been kept secret.) But it provides the reason to. And, incidentally, the whole amazing plan of the Cross provides a bridge back to God as well as access to His power. And if anything can help you to forgive, it’s God’s power. Just ask Him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Neh 8-10; Luke 22:1-13; Ps 78:40-55; Pro 24:1-4 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62197&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.' Matthew 7:7 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Matthew 11:5–8, it tells the story of some guy who knocks on his neighbour’s door in the middle of the night to ask to borrow some bread. The neighbour mutters to himself, rolls over, grumbles, rolls over some more and finally, because he can’t stand the guy’s continual knocking, opens up and gives the guy what he wants. All because he wouldn’t stop knocking. You see, God admires persistence. It’s not that He wants us to be rude, He wants us to know what love He has for us. He invites us to ask for what we need so that we will experience that love. He makes it pretty clear—‘Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.’ (Matthew 7:7 NKJ) If you want to hear from God, start up the conversation. Ask Him to speak. Don’t shout out from a distance, go right up to the door of His Word and knock. Steadily. He’s already on the other side of the door, waiting to answer. But don’t hightail it outta there as soon as you’ve pressed the buzzer once. Stay there, and make sure you’re ready for His response. It’s no good asking anything of God if you don’t make space and silence to hear back. Stay parked at the door of His Word, reading it carefully and you’ll find what you truly seek. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Neh 11-13; Luke 22:14-23; Ps 78:56-64; Pro 24:5-10 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62198&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...By love serve one another.' Galatians 5:13 KJV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;To work for God properly we have to have the right people around us, giving us the necessary pointers, handing us the necessary materials or just cheering us on when we need it. And God makes sure that happens. Whatever He’s planning for you, He’ll first drop you in exactly the right situation to make it happen just how He wants. That means He’ll steer you into the right place, at the right time, with the right group of people around you. That’s pretty good of Him, huh? All of the people around you are there because God wants them to be. Seriously. If you carry the person of Jesus in you (like… by being a Christian) then God will be arranging appointments for you. He’ll put people in your path. And they might just be the key to His next step for you, whether that’s by developing some part of your character, or by sending an opportunity your way. So take your relationships to God, the good along with the bad, and ask Him for the strength and maturity to recognise God–given people and opportunities. And make sure to be patient with every single person in your life. Extend grace to them constantly. Who knows what role they may end up playing in the future? And lastly, pray for those around you. Whenever you get the chance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Micah 1-4; Luke 22:24-38; Ps 78:65-72; Pro 24:11-14 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62199&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['We know that all things work together for good...' Romans 8:28 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a danger to stop Romans 8:28 right after the word ‘good’ as lots of people do. We miss some critical information that way. This verse packs a real punch. It calls for active life–changing. Take a moment to read it again, slowly, out loud. ‘And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love Him, who have been called according to His purpose.’ (Romans 8:28 NIV) Try the same with John 14:21 NIV: ‘Whoever has My commands and keeps them is the one who loves Me. The one who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I too will love them and show Myself to them.’ So, those who obey God love Him. And those who do that have everything in their lives sewn together for their good. If we want the ‘all things working together for good’ bonus, we’re called to live like God wants. We have to actually love God in our actions and thoughts, not just sing it in songs and tell Him in prayers every now and then. Re–reading Romans 8:28 with that thought in mind feels a little punchier. It’s no longer just something encouraging to say when someone’s had a bad day. It becomes a call to act in the way that Jesus teaches us to, in order to have a really good life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Micah 5-7; Luke 22:39-53; Ps 24; Pro 24:15-18 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62200&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus.' Philippians 2:5 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think about all the rights we have enshrined in Australian law. The right to education, free speech and communication, to live free of all sorts of discrimination. But, sometimes, we can cling to our ‘rights’ until our fingers turn blue and we’re kicking and climbing on others to keep hold of what we think we’re entitled to. That isn’t Jesus–like. Think about it. Then check out Philippians 2:1–11. That’s right. Jesus ‘...did not think that being equal with God was something to be used for His own benefit... He gave up His place with God and made Himself nothing.’ (Philippians 2:7 NCV) He took on the status of a slave. A slave. The King of the universe didn’t see Himself as too entitled to anything to step right down onto this messy, ignorant earth. And He didn’t step down onto a comfy, shiny, golden throne; He placed Himself in a rough old animal trough. More than that—He died the death of a criminal. He definitely didn’t deserve that. And that’s our example to follow. If stuff that we don’t deserve comes our way (and it will, at some point), Jesus shows us that it’s our job to deal with it gracefully. We’re called to find the balance between living healthy lives for ourselves, and putting others (appropriately) first. Tricky, but it’s definitely do–able. That’s the way that Jesus lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Tim 1-4; Luke 22:54-62; Ps 19; Pro 24:19-22&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62201&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Grace and peace be yours in abundance through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.' 2 Peter 1:2 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ve heard it. You probably aim to do it. Why, though? To show your friends what Christianity should look like? To make the world a better place? To please God? They’re all good reasons, and they all happen, in their own way, when our lives start to look more like that of Jesus. But God has a far more personal reason to ask us to imitate His Son. You see, the request for us to ‘live like Christ’ is an offer, not just a command. After He’s set you free from sin (and only after that), God offers a new way of life, filled with ‘grace and peace’. The fact of the matter is this: living that new, Jesus–style life is exactly what we were built for. So once we start allowing ourselves to act like God wants, we start to look like the person He designed us to be. That’s when that ‘grace and peace’ come into play. Making the decision to delve as deeply as you can into Jesus’ life, and putting what you learn into practice, won’t lead you any way other than towards God. And, the closer you get to God, the more you’re surrounded by His ‘grace and peace’. So, when He asks you to live like Jesus, what’s He’s saying is ‘come closer to Me, and life will start to feel as it should.’ And that is the ultimate offer of all time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Zech 1-4; Luke 22:63-71; Ps 3; Pro 24:23-25 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62202&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Leaving you an example, that you should follow in His steps.' 1 Peter 2:21 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus’ heart is geared towards others. He loves us, and He loves God. Everything about Him is built on His own relationship with His Father and the Holy Spirit, which is, safe to say, entirely perfect. He’s also intent on bringing us imperfect humans into that relationship. So, obviously, Jesus is pretty plugged in to the Holy Spirit and God–the–Father. Jesus’ first recorded sermon starts: ‘The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me…’ (Luke 4:18 NAS), and He went off alone to talk to His Father heaps of times throughout the Gospels. He’s so in tune and in love with the Spirit and the Father that they’re a constant feature of His words and actions. That’s a great model to live by. The way that God works (the Jesus–Spirit–Father bond) is the best model of living in relationship that you could wish for. It’s worth spending some time having a look into how Jesus lives it out in the Gospels. That others–focused heart is one of the foundation–bricks of knowing how to live like Him. If we’re raring to love and serve God and, by extension, the people He’s created, then being Jesus–like becomes more of a natural leaning. If you think you’re ready, pray to God that He will make your heart more like Jesus’. Ask Him to prompt you throughout the day to act in a Jesus–like way towards others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Ki 17:1-6; 1 Ki 18:16-39; 1 Ki 19:9-18; 2 Ki 2:1-12 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62204&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Take the yoke I give you. Put it on your shoulders and learn from Me...' Matthew 11:29 CEV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have the last three days got you worried? Does the challenge to ‘live like Jesus’ sound too much? Stop, and maybe even write this down somewhere. The first call of Christianity is not ‘Live Like Jesus’. The first call is: ‘Come Home, All Is Forgiven.’ The call to live like Jesus is for after that. It’s for after you’ve come home, after you’ve been picked up and held safe by the Father of the universe. So if you’re worried that you’re not thinking, or acting, like Jesus, don’t panic your way out of His arms. From inside those arms you can watch His heart and thoughts close up. It’s only once you’re home that you can see how the Son deals with problems. Sure, we really want you to live like Jesus. (Fact is, we really want us all to live like Jesus...) Imagine what the world would be like if we all did. But if we allow ourselves to slip into thinking, ‘If I don’t live like Jesus... am I really a Christian?...’ we’ve allowed ourselves to swallow the secret lie that it depended on us being holy enough, or doing enough ‘things’ as a Jesus–copy. That’s not what the Cross was for. Living like Jesus is something that God grows (and not overnight) in the lives of those who have been called to Him whilst they were still dirty, tired, and broken. The only thing that every single one of us needs to ‘do’ is receive the love of His Father. The rest comes from there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Zech 5-8; Luke 23:1-12; Ps 39; Pro 24:26-28 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62205&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Let's go off by ourselves to a quiet place and rest awhile...' Mark 6:31 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In today’s verse, we notice Jesus telling His disciples He wanted a decent bit of quiet time. Did He get it? Well, no. Not right then. They went off to find that ‘quiet place’ and got followed by crowds. Instead of a chilled Jesus–and–His–pals time, a little thing we’ve come to call the ‘Feeding of the Five Thousand’ happened. Not that relaxing at all. As soon as that amazing miracle was done, Jesus ‘went up on a mountainside to pray.’ (Mark 6:46 NIV) Just like the rest of us, Jesus needed time out. He had a busy, busy, busy life but He never allowed Himself to be overwhelmed by His work. When things were too hectic, He took Himself off, normally up a mountain, and spent a while away from everything. Just Him and God. Now, even though we don’t have crowds chasing us around, our lives can feel (nearly) as hectic as that of Jesus. And, just like His, our planned time off can be sniped far too easily, either by work or by that super–active eager friend. It’s so important to step back every now and then, sometimes to just do nothing (yes, that really is ok sometimes), as well as having those times to spend with God. So, pick a day. A whole day. Schedule it in as a day for nothing but rest, relaxation and time with God. Plan to do something you enjoy. And stick to it. Put it on your calendar now. Maybe even think about making that a regular thing… Yes! Actually have a Sabbath?! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Zech 9-11; Luke 23:13-25; Ps 34; Pro 24:29-31 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62206&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...All...were astonished at the catch of fish...' Luke 5:9 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus never trained as a fisherman; His trade was carpentry. Yet, in Luke chapter five, He gave fishing advice to professional fish–catcher Simon and his partners. Simon had worked all night and seemed to have decided to follow Jesus’ advice more to humour Him than anything else. Despite showing more than a hint of doubt, he still did what Jesus said. He didn’t say, ‘Look, buddy, I’m the professional here. It’s not the right time to fish.’ He simply said, ‘Because You say so.’ It works exactly the same for us. Whatever our specialist area is, God knows what we need to do to max–out our potential in it. And He’s ready to share that know–how. The problem is, we often assume we know best. Or that God isn’t particularly interested telling us how to be the best essay–writer ever, or most–efficient barista ever to have worked the coffee bar. But if God’s placed you in a role, He’s the best person to advise you on it. Just ask Him. Don’t let doubt stop you from saying, as Simon did, ‘Because You say so.’ Taking God’s advice in the everyday can often be more important than it seems. Simon did what Jesus suggested concerning his fishing–job. Then, as soon as that was done, he found himself moving on to being a ‘fisher of men’. God’s current plans and instructions may be preparation for, or a sign of, bigger plans to follow. So, take Him up on His advice, and see what happens. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Zech 12-14; Luke 23:26-34; Ps 52; Pro 24:32-34 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62207&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...God...calls things that are not as though they were.' Romans 4:17 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Umm, stop a second. Just think about that verse. God ‘calls into being things that were not.’ God speaks, and things that didn’t exist suddenly… do. That’s huge in two ways. First, only God has that power. The Bible definitely doesn’t say we call into being things that were not. It doesn’t say your parents or friends call into being things that were not. At the end of the day, no matter what effect we feel people’s words have on us, they don’t actually change anything. Just because someone you thought was your friend called you an idiot, doesn’t make it true. If your parents tell you you’re going to be a doctor, it doesn’t automatically mean it’s going to happen. On the flipside, it means that whatever God says is absolutely 100% true. Whatever He speaks comes into being. If He says you’re going to be a doctor, you will. And by Him saying it, it becomes a thing. A real–life, living–breathing, guaranteed thing. You need to have faith like Abraham and be “fully convinced that God [is] able to do what he [has] promised.” (Romans 4:21 ESV). We’ve pointed out God’s promises and declarations for you lots of times before. (If you missed them, then Romans 8:1 &amp; Romans 8:31 should get you started.) Forget what anyone else has said. The only important thing is what God has said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood (Feast of Trumpets): Num 29:1-6; Matt 24; Rev 11:15-19; 1 Cor 15:50-58&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62208&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...His own received Him not.' John 1:11 KJV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all come up against rejection. Jesus had a lot of it. ‘He came to that which was His own, but His own did not receive Him.’ (John 1:11 NIV) There are two examples of ‘His own’ here: His very own created universe, belonging to Him. And ‘His own’ did not receive Him; this means His people—those whom He chose and loved as His own didn’t want to be seen near Him. Ow. They even accused Him of being fake (check out Matthew 12:24, for instance.) When God gives you a passion for something, when you’re dead set on making a positive change, then it’s usually not a dead–end (unless you’re ignoring God–honouring motives and into something a bit reckless or stupid—worth asking your church leader if you want a double–check!) Jesus didn’t let one person’s voice silence Him, He simply moved on and took His life–giving message to whoever would listen: ‘...to those who believed in His name, He gave the right to become children of God.’ (John 1:12 KJV) So, what matters most, rejection or reaction? Whenever you feel put down by someone’s dismissal of you, going back to God first is your best bet. Don’t go into a knee–jerk defence, ask your heavenly Father to defend you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Cor 1-3; Luke 23:35-43; Ps 54; Pro 25:1-3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62216&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ 'Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.'  Matthew 6:21 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever been to a pawnshop? The idea is simple; if you need money, you take a valuable item like jewellery or a musical instrument to the shop where the pawnbroker checks out the quality of it and gives you cash in exchange. But if you don’t return within the specified time to redeem the item, you lose ownership. Although it was yours originally, you no longer have legal possession till you buy it back. And if you wait too long, it can be lost forever. Have you ever thought of yourself as somebody who needs to be redeemed, so you can be returned to your rightful owner? God created us to enjoy a relationship with Him. But sin caused us to fall into ‘the snare of the devil...held captive...to do his will.’ (2 Timothy 2:26 NAS) Restoration to God, your rightful owner, could only come through redemption. And that’s exactly what God did! ‘For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life.’ (John 3:16 ESV) Christ’s death was the price of your redemption; that’s how much God values you! But redemption only becomes a reality when you realise you’re a sinner, and trust Christ as your Saviour. The moment you do, He reunites you with God—ransomed, redeemed, restored to your original owner. So the question is: have you taken up His offer of salvation, the one that makes you a member of His family? If you’re able to read this, it’s not too late. You can do it right now wherever you are. (If you’re a little hazy on what to pray, check out the inside back cover of this devotional for some help.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; SoulFood: 1 Cor 4-6; Luke 23:44-56; Ps 13; Pro 25:4-8 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62210&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...There was a man who had two sons.' Luke 15:11 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a story you may have heard before. A father. Two sons. The younger brother wants out of the house. He leaves and messes up. On return, he is welcomed with open arms. Is this about leaving for uni? Nope. It’s about walking out on what our heavenly Father wants. He has an awful lot in store for His ‘children’, but sometimes we don’t want to live under His care. Now, let’s look a bit closer: Both sons had their faults: one was miserable, but obedient. The other, younger one was the classic rebel of the story. It’s hard to say who was really worse, deep down. Both of them were self–centred. You might not be the problem child, but (and we know this is rough to consider) do you have any traits of the jealous older brother? In the parable, the father says ‘…Everything I have is yours’ (Luke 15:31 NIV) to his older son. The older son didn’t seem to get that. He was worried about his kid brother getting an extra share of their inheritance. Sometimes, even though we’re right in front of the Father, we can be so focused on our ‘rights’ that we forget to look at Him for guidance. So, let's keep our eyes on Jesus. He's the 'older brother' of everyone who is part of the family of God and He gives us an example of how any 'older brother' should rightfully behave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Heb 11:7; Gen 6:9-22; Gen 8:18-22; Matt 24:36-41 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62212&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['He came to his senses...' Luke 15:17 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;To fully understand exactly who God is, it might be we have to reach a low point. A really low point. Our own personal pig–sty can put the love of God that we’re missing back into perspective. It can lead us to the first part of repentance (turning back to God). So, it took a lot for the younger son to finally come to ‘his senses’, after walking out on all his father had for him. However, today’s curveball from word4Uday is another thought regarding the older brother in the story: was he guilty of something just as bad? In a house with his loving father, completely cared for, supplied with everything he needed, he still hadn’t come to his senses. Check this out: ‘…This son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!’ (Luke 15:30 NIV) Ouch. He didn’t think his kid brother deserved any favours… true, but neither did he. Unlike the younger son, he wasn’t aware of his problem: judgmentalism. He built himself up by tearing his ‘unholy’ brother down. As Christians, one of the first stumbling blocks we need to get past is simply accepting that God, our heavenly Father, loves us. Sounds simple, huh? But if we truly get our heads around it, that we simply can’t do anything to earn it, it makes accepting others a lot easier. That’s the kind of perspective on things that the younger brother had—he knew he wasn’t worthy. Think about what God gives us freely. Acceptance? Freedom? What else? Now, show some of that grace to someone who needs it—invite them into your life/friendship group and get alongside them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Cor 7-9; Luke 24:1-12; Ps 91; Pro 25:9-12 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62213&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He was lost and is found.' Luke 15:32 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last couple of days we’ve focused on the older brother in the parable of the prodigal son. There’s a lot there for long–standing ‘got it together’ Christians. But today, we thought we’d address the main character in the parable, the younger brother. Like his sibling, he didn’t fully grasp the nature of his father, but for different reasons. When he walked away from his home, he left all the good he could have freely had. Who in their right mind would do that? Everything he needed to live life to the fullest was right under his nose. That definitely sunk in later. And like the prodigal son, when we look back in hindsight at a good thing we’ve left behind, it’s easy to admit we’ve been stupid (think of the robes! think of the inheritance! think of the cake!) Finding yourself stuck in a rut with no strength left and nowhere else to turn is often when you realise you should have stayed in the house, where God’s got everything we need. But, in practice, turning back to God takes some real humility—we can either stick it alone, or run back home with nothing to show for what we’ve done. Yet, that’s what matters. Messing up is not the end of the story. Nope. The younger brother got up, and chose to admit his mistakes. The Father was waiting for the son with open arms. Do you need to come home today? Take a look at the inside back cover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; SoulFood: 1 Cor 10-11; Luke 24:13-24; Ps 68:1-18; Pro 25:13-16 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62214&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...All that I have is yours.' Luke 15:31 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last one. Let’s wrap this up with three big points: (1) Anger holds you back. You won’t learn or grow if, whenever you see something positive happening in someone’s life, you take up the ‘older brother’ attitude of criticising it. Nah. That’s not good. We’ve all been there, and there’s no other way round it, if we’re ever to grow: along with the Father, we need to forgive and move on from the irritations that others might cause us. (2) ‘…Son…all that I have is yours.’ (Luke 15:31 NKJ) There it is, plain and simple: there was enough to go round for not just the prodigal son, but the older brother. When you notice God rocking someone’s life, He’s not forgotten you. And He certainly won’t hold back from blessing you beyond anything you could imagine. (3) God always listens. Sounds obvious? The older brother didn’t think so. But God says: ‘Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.’ (Hebrews 4:16 NIV) We reckon that, if the older brother just asked for help to overcome his bitterness, life would have even far simpler for him. If any one of those points resonates, make time now to be honest with God. It pays off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Cor 12-14; Luke 24:25-35; Ps 68:19-35; Pro 25:17-20 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63435&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...When they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they are not wise.' 2 Corinthians 10:12 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a look at today’s verse (we couldn’t fit it all—definitely a good excuse for you to crack open your Bible… :) hint…) It’s a bit of a pressure–point in society today, but comparing themselves to others can make our lives difficult. Thankfully, it’s possible to find confidence in God. But, can it go both ways? Is it sometimes a little too easy to be comfortable in our own skin? Here it is: what about when we KNOW we’re good? Like, being humble is all well and good, but as soon as you know you’ve got an intelligence/ability one–up on your mates/colleagues, doesn’t it get a bit too easy to be happy with yourself, at the expense of relying on God for your self–worth? Well, those who are ‘commending themselves’ (first part of the verse), was written in reference to false teachers within the Corinthian Church who were big–noting themselves and criticising Paul and his authority as an Apostle. They thought they were 'all that', and pretty much nobody could touch them. Yet here, they (and we) are warned of assuming we’re the standard to measure by. So, how is it possible to really be good at something, but not compare yourself negatively with others who aren’t so good? ‘Let the one who boasts boast in the Lord.’ (2 Corinthians 10:17 NIV) That winning ability that you have? Don’t let your self–worth hinge on it: acknowledge that it’s God–given. Whatever it is, it’s meant to build others up, not for putting them down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Cor 15-16; Luke 24:36-44; Ps 60; Pro 25:21-22 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62217&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['When I am afraid, I will put my trust in You.' Psalm 56:3 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oi. You! Yes, you! Come out from behind that plant. Metaphorically speaking. In Genesis 3:8, Adam and Eve knew they’d done wrong. It was enough to make them need to change their fig–leaves (and they’d only put them on fresh about a verse ago, sigh). They were so terrified of the consequences they went and hid in some bushes. That didn’t work too well, either. God is good at finding people. So, why do we still try to hide? When that ‘sin’ happens, we can often try our very best to avoid God. We don’t want to face telling Him about it, or dealing with the aftermath. We don’t want to experience His disappointment in us. Or our own disappointment in ourselves. It’s easier to just keep our mouths shut, and hope we can carry on without having to face Him. But that’s not God’s plan. Life with Him isn’t some sort of monstrous game of hide–and–seek. Take a look at Genesis 3. When God found Adam and Eve, He started a conversation. He dealt with their mess. Then (in the first verse of chapter 4), He still helped them. You see, there’s always going to be consequences for our mistakes. But, when we take them to God and ask Him to deal with them, there’s still Life with Him in and after those consequences. So, trust God’s justice. Be honest with Him about your mistakes now, tell Him about them frankly. Deal with the consequences. And watch Him make something beautiful out of your life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood (Day of Atonement): Lev 16; Lev 23:26-32; Heb 9:1-14; Heb 13:11-16 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62219&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures.' Matthew 22:29 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember playing Pin the Tail on the Donkey as a kid? As soon as that blindfold went on and you started to spin around, your other senses would go into overdrive to try and compensate. Could you sniff your way to victory? The world teaches us to rely on the stuff we can see and sense to be able to find our way. So when one or more of those abilities fails, we end up pinning tails nowhere close to target. But what if someone you trusted guided you all the way? What if you had a mate who whispered ‘Left a bit… straight ahead… up a centimetre!’ in your ear? Yes, it’d probably get you disqualified, but you’d also land right where you’re supposed to. Knowing and trusting God’s Word is a bit like that (except it’s not cheating!  happy days.) There will be plenty of times in life you’ll need to pin a tail blind, when you won’t be able to see clearly ahead. But you’ll still need to make wise choices. Taking the time to know what the Bible says about the things you might face is vital—it means that, when all your senses fail, you’re still right on course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; SoulFood: Heb 11:8-12; Gen 17:1-27; Gen 22:1-18; Jas 2:21-24 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62221&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

Psalm 19:8 CEV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a hilarious section in Adrian Plass’ book, &lt;em&gt;The Sacred Diary of Adrian Plass, aged 37¾&lt;/em&gt;, where Adrian opens his Bible at random. He’s in search of some encouragement, but lands on: ‘The dogs licked up the blood.’ (1 Kings 21:19, in case you wondered…) Not exactly the words of promise he’d hoped for! Do you ever do that? Wait until you’re upstream without a paddle and then go frantically scrambling for random Scriptures? Do you ever treat the Bible a bit like a lucky dip? ‘Must find a verse—ANY VERSE—to make me feel better!’ Psalm 19:8 CEV tells us God’s Word ‘makes our hearts glad’, that His commands ‘give us light’. But why wait until you’re in the middle of darkness to go lucky dipping for light? Instead, the Psalms say that God’s Word should be ‘stored up’ (Psalm 119:10–11 ESV) and Job says ‘I have treasured the words…’ (Job 23:12 NAS) Storing and treasuring take time and dedication, but it’s totally worth it for the sake of not getting into a flap when trouble comes. Count the Bible verses you know off by heart, not including John 3:16. Have you counted more than three? It’s useful to know Scriptures word–for–word, because there will be times when it helps LOADS to have those promises already stored in your head. Writing them down or saying them out loud might help you to memorise them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Exo 4-6; John 1:1-13; Ps 63; Pro 25:26-28 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62222&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The entrance of your words gives light...' Psalm 119:130 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you type ‘Bible or the Bard’ into an internet search, you’ll come face to face with a quiz that asks stuff like: ‘Who invented the phrase give up the ghost—Shakespeare or the Bible?’ Frankly, would you know where that phrase came from? It’s a decent exercise for letting us know whether we’ve spent more time in the sonnets or the psalms, but the Bible is so much more than just a collection of snappy catchphrases. So here’s where we level up and get serious. Paul says to Timothy, ‘Study and be eager and do your utmost to present yourself to God approved (tested by trial), a workman who has no cause to be ashamed, correctly analysing and accurately dividing [rightly handling and skilfully teaching] the Word of Truth.’ (2 Timothy 2:15 AMP) That’s a tricky verse to get your head around, but it basically says: ‘Get your head in the Bible. Know it. Understand it. Tell others about it.’ That doesn’t mean just memorising the bits of the Word that give you warm fuzzies. It means studying the bits you’d rather skip. Why? Because time and again we’re told that God’s Word—all of it—is a ‘light’, and not only for us, but for those around us too. Started with SoulFood yet? Had a try but found it too hard to keep going? Ask God for help as you switch on the ‘light’ and begin again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Exo 7-9; John 1:14-28; Ps 92; Pro 26:1-3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62223&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['In this world you will have trouble...' John 16:33 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re told not to worry about our lives (Matthew 6:25), but it’s also vital not to be naïve. Wearing a WWJD wristband does not make you exempt from life’s issues—and if Jesus Himself says trouble is a certainty, you can be sure that sooner or later it’ll be doing more than knocking on your door, it’ll be kicking it down. You could encounter any number of testing scenarios—health issues, relationship breakdowns, money worries; a whole bunch of things that could potentially stare you out and threaten to take you down like the Incredible Hulk on a bad day. But the next bit of today’s verse in John 16:33 is the ultimate save–the–day line. Jesus says: ‘But take heart! For I have overcome the world.’ Note Jesus doesn’t say that all the trouble will evaporate. Instead, He’s pointing you out to the bigger picture—a picture of the endgame. You don’t need to sit there paranoid and wondering when the next battle is coming, because He told you 2000 years ago that it’s already taken care of. And just in case there’s any doubt about the outcome, here’s a hint: you in Him = win. So, armour up today. Read Ephesians 6:10–20 to remind yourself of the spiritual weapons at your disposal: helmet of salvation, breastplate of righteousness, belt of truth, shield of faith, sword of the Word of God, shoes of the preparation for the Gospel of peace and, capping them all, prayers and songs of praise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Exo 10-12; John 1:29-42; Ps 29; Pro 26:4-6 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62224&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Do not be dismayed, for I am your God.' Isaiah 41:10 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;, Neo discovers his mind has the ability to create and affect the world around him. He can withstand bullets, jump 50-metre gaps, and bend spoons—just by focusing all of his mental energy on the ‘truth’ (and by engaging his intense stare/squared–jaw combo, naturally). He learns the hard way that, the moment he loses sight of that ‘truth’, the world around him has the ability to crush him. The battle is primarily in his mind. The Bible says that the truth sets you free (John 8:32 NIV), but that’s not a one–time event. Your mind is a battleground, and knowing Jesus doesn’t make you immune to very real attacks of despair, fear or self–pity. Sometimes, we just don’t have the mental energy, and that’s ok. But the ability to remind yourself of His truth in the middle of the turmoil is the difference between withstanding the enemy’s ‘bullets’ or not. Verses like Joshua 1:9 ‘I am the Lord your God, and I will be there to help you wherever you go’, Deuteronomy 31:6 Be strong and courageous... the Lord your God goes with you; He will never leave you...’, Jeremiah 15:20 ‘I am with you to rescue and save you,’ says the Lord, Isaiah 12:2 ‘The Lord Himself is my strength and my defence’ and many more exist to make you strong when the world tries to crush you. They are the kind of truth to build your life on. As soon as the worries start to wage war in your head, declare with certainty: ‘I will not be afraid. The Lord God Himself will fight for me.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood (Feast of Tabernacles): Lev 23:33-44; John 7:1-40; Zech 14:16-21 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62225&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth...' John 4:23 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may not believe your ten minutes of wailing &lt;em&gt;Amazing Grace&lt;/em&gt; in the shower does a whole lot, but the Bible says that worship packs quite a punch. Ever heard the story of Jehoshaphat? His people were about to be smashed to bits by a huge enemy army. Jehoshaphat didn’t hang about. He went straight to God and reminded Him, ‘You are so powerful that no one can defeat You’ (2 Chronicles 20:6 CEV), and God—through a prophet called Jahaziel—replied, ‘You won’t even have to fight... the Lord will be there with you.’ (2 Chronicles 20:17 CEV) Jehoshaphat led his army out to the battlefield, and told the worshippers to get right out there in front and sing praises to God. As soon as they started to sing, God did all the fighting on their behalf. He confused the opposition, and they began to wipe each other out. Nobody in Jehoshaphat’s army raised a weapon. Pretty soon ‘every soldier in the enemy’s army was lying dead on the ground.’ (2 Chronicles 20:24 CEV) As soon as you see an enemy on the horizon—whatever that might look like to you—don’t waste time. Seek God and worship him. See, worship requires you to look up to God. And if you’re looking up, you can’t navel–gaze (unless you’re one of those ‘gifted’ folk who can do multi–directional staring...) When you focus on His power instead of your problem, He moves on your behalf. So if you have a tendency to wallow, it would be a good idea to create an anti–navel–gazing playlist, and make your first port of call Psalm 42. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Exo 13-15; John 1:43-51; Ps 131; Pro 26:7-9 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62226&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Lead me, O Lord... make straight Your way before me.' Psalm 5:8 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever had the Sat-Nav take you to a dead–end street rather than the highway on–ramp you were expecting? Or failed to re–direct you off that one–way street or the access to the river? Do you still remember the smash or the splash? When it comes to the question of your life’s direction, you don’t want to rely on a dodgy Sat-Nav to steer you the right way. Here are a few navigation systems to avoid: (1) &lt;em&gt;Your emotions&lt;/em&gt;. Very rarely will raw feelings about something point you down the right path. These powerful little hormone combos make up a large part of who we are, but emotions are also very changeable. Handle with care. (2) &lt;em&gt;Your mind&lt;/em&gt;. Sometimes God’s direction just doesn’t seem logical at all. Rub mud into a man’s eyes and he’ll see (John 9:11). Throw your net down for the thousandth time, and you’ll finally catch some fish (John 21:5–6). Sounds a bit strange, right? Except, God says clearly, ‘My thoughts are nothing like your thoughts... My ways are far beyond anything you could imagine.’ (Isaiah 55:8 NLT) (3) &lt;em&gt;Well–meaning people&lt;/em&gt;. When someone starts a sentence with ‘God told me to tell you that...’ resist the urge to take everything at face value immediately. (Or to dismiss it!) Whilst God absolutely does use people to deliver His messages, sometimes people get things wrong. Go to God for yourself. Ask Him. There’s a lot of stuff out there promising to show us the right way, when really what we need is a solid, close relationship with God and a hunger for his Word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Exo 16-18; John 2:1-11; Ps 23; Pro 26:10-12 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62228&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Enjoy life with your wife, whom you love...' Ecclesiastes 9.9 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless you’ve got a specific calling to be single all your life, you’re probably hoping to get married at some point. And that’s totally fine because, in the first book of the Bible, God establishes that ‘It’s not good for the man to be alone.’ (Genesis 2:18 GWT) There are two unhelpful schools of thought about marriage running rampant in Christian culture right now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) That God wants you to be perfectly happy being single and then (and only then) He’ll present you with the man/woman of your dreams and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) That you must find ‘the right person’ or ‘be the right person’ before you get married.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is wrong because although the Bible tells us to learn contentment in all situations, God knows our hearts’ desires and He isn’t a mean dad who withholds good things just for kicks. There is no magic formula your singleness will ‘unlock’. There is only His will, and the command for you to seek it. The second is wrong because your walk with God doesn’t end the moment you meet your future spouse. You must work to be the ‘right person’ every single day, primarily for God, but also because if both of you are doing that, your relationship will thrive. You don’t have to be a perfect person when you get married. Your spouse won’t be, that’s for sure. Read Galatians 5:22–23 and Corinthians 13:4–8 for some foundational truths about love and the spirit–filled life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Heb 11:22; Gen 39:1-23; Gen 45:1-11; Gen 50:15-26 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62229&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The Lord corrects everyone He loves...' Proverbs 3:12 CEV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does God’s correction look like? Back in the Old Testament, the consequences of messing up were steeeeeep. Plagues of locusts, rivers of frogs and pillars of salt, anyone? Jesus came so that, if we believe in Him, we don’t get punished like we deserve. But that doesn’t mean God sits idly by while we get on with crazy living. Correction, rather than punishment, is a sign of a God who loves us and wants the best for us. Sometimes correction might come in the form of direct consequence. If you get drunk and end up throwing up all over your new shoes, you might think again before drinking too much, right? Alternatively, correction might feel like a quiet spiritual prompting. A tiny voice inside that says, ‘Not that way...’ And you can choose—because you can always choose—whether or not you listen. Part of the point of being corrected is so that you don’t stay the same. Romans 12:2 NIV says ‘...be transformed by the renewing of your mind...’ and in 2 Corinthians 3:18, Paul says that we’re all ‘...being transformed...’ into God’s likeness. That process requires change, and—yes—correction. The key is to lift your gaze from your correction to His process. Take a moment today to think about the ways you feel God corrects you. Do you need to become more sensitive to His nudges? Could you do with learning from the consequences of a lesson you’ve repeated over and over? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Exo 19-21; John 2:12-25; Ps 110; Pro 26:13-16 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62230&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<title><![CDATA[Does God Really Heal?]]></title>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I am the Lord, who heals you.' Exodus 15:26 NIV &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does God really heal? Let’s cut to the chase: God calls Himself a healer, Jesus spent a lot of miracle–hours healing people, the Holy Spirit is more powerful and loving that we can even begin to imagine. So we can safely say that yes—God can and does heal people today. But that’s really easy to say before someone we love gets diagnosed with cancer, or the doctor says we’re injured beyond repair. Believing in God for healing is a whole other ballgame when facing sickness head–on. And then there are the healings that don’t ever come: the times when our faith gets shaken out and thumped hard because we just don’t understand why. So we wrestle with the idea that God is still good and powerful when it feels like He’s nowhere. And we wonder if we prayed the ‘wrong way’, or not enough. And all the while the pain of disappointment sits on our chest like a double–decker bus... There is a choice to be made. Either God is a liar, or He’s telling the truth. If He’s telling the truth, then perhaps our perception of healing is incomplete. Perhaps it’s possible to face sickness, and still know total peace—and even joy. Perhaps, when it feels like God’s ignoring you, He’s actually healing the stuff that’s unseen. Here’s a thought from CS Lewis: ‘God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in our conscience, but shouts in our pain. It is His megaphone to rouse a deaf world.’ Is He whispering, speaking or shouting to you today? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Exo 22-24; John 3:1-21; Ps 89:1-14; Pro 26:17-19 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62231&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['They are...to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share...so that they may take hold of that which is truly life.' 1 Timothy 6:18-19 ESV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;How rich do you want to be? You might have ambitions to be a millionaire or even just to be ‘comfortable’, but have you considered what the Bible says about you and money? For a start, nothing we possess actually belongs to us: it’s all God’s (Psalm 24:1). So no matter how hard you struggle to acquire more, you’re still only ever the caretaker of it. That truth is actually really freeing: it means that the pressure is off. You’re not defined by the size of your bank account and you can start trusting God to bless you so you have enough to give to others, without sorrow for yourself. (Proverbs 10:22) God’s hugely keen on stewardship—that is, the way you manage the stuff He gives you. Are you stingy? Are you reckless? Are you self–centred when it comes to money? Don’t expect Him to bless you with very much of it then. The Bible is clear about generosity. It’s also clear about taking responsibility: in Luke 16:11, Jesus says that, if you can’t be trusted with worldly wealth, you won’t be trusted with ‘true riches’. What have you been given? You might have a job, a part–time job or an allowance; whatever it is, you’ve been entrusted with it. So start thinking about ways you can be generous with it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Exo 25-27; John 3:22-36; Ps 89:15-37; Pro 26:20-22 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62232&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['If we receive God's approval by obeying the laws in the Scriptures, then Christ's death was pointless.' Galatians 2:21 GWT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grace (the undeserved love that God gives us) doesn’t give anyone permission to live as they please just saying: ‘God loves me so it doesn’t matter’ but the ‘judgmentalism’ that comes from insisting others live by our standards has caused untold damage. Chuck Swindoll writes, ‘Legalism spreads a paralysing venom... blinds our eyes, dulls our edge and arouses pride in our heart... Love is overshadowed by a mental clipboard with a long check–list... requiring others to measure up... Soon friendship is fractured by a judgmental attitude and a critical look.’ Think you’re not guilty? Check out your own attitude when you meet another Christian who doesn’t think, act or dress the way you do. You might break out a fake smile to disguise your real feelings but what is your head thinking? It doesn’t take long before your mouth is talking! Jesus said, ‘Never criticise... or it will all come back on you.’ (Luke 6:37 TLB) When you throw mud you don’t just get your hands dirty, you lose ground! ‘If any one of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.’ (John 8:7 NIV) Blowing another person’s light out won’t make yours shine brighter. Paul writes: ‘If we receive God’s approval by obeying the laws in the Scriptures, then Christ’s death was pointless.’ You say, ‘What if someone is deliberately sinning?’ Paul answers: ‘...humbly help that person back onto the right path... be careful not to fall into the same temptation yourself.’ (Galatians 6:1 NLT) It’s good that we try to live God’s way but it isn’t a competition. Build people up, don’t knock them down and show them the grace that God has shown you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Exo 28-29; John 4:1-12; Ps 89:38-52; Pro 26:23-26 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62233&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The reason you don't have what you want is... you don't ask God.' James 4:2 TLB&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine walking into your local Chinese takeaway and asking if your order is ready. ‘When did you phone it in?’ the server asks. ‘Oh I didn’t,’ you reply, ‘I just thought perhaps you’d have something with my name on it.’ Sound ridiculous? No more so than expecting God to answer requests you haven’t made. The book of James says, ‘The reason you don’t have what you want is... you don’t ask God.’ Does that mean He’ll automatically give you everything you ask for? No. James adds, ‘Even when you do ask you don’t get it because... you want only what will give you pleasure.’ (James 4:3 TLB) Your motives need to be in tune with what God knows is best for you. John says, ‘This is the confidence... we have in Him... if we ask anything... according to His will...He...hears.’ (1 John 5:14 AMP) Lamentations 3:25 AMP says, ‘The Lord is good to those who wait... expectantly for Him.’ Expectant prayer demonstrates confidence in God’s goodness. Instead of stressing out and taking matters into your own hands, say, ‘Lord, I’m going to trust you with this, no matter what happens,’ so He can honour your faith. Do you need a job? Help overcoming a problem? Do your friends or family need to become Christians? Need a deeper walk with God? Do you need physical or emotional healing? Jesus said, ‘It gives your Father great happiness to give you the [benefits of His] Kingdom.’ (Luke 12:32 NLT) God wants to be good to you, so tell Him the ‘desires of your heart’. (Psalm 37:4 NKJ) Thank Him that the answer will come in His time! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Exo 30-32; John 4:13-26; Ps 100; Pro 26:27-28 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62234&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Always full of the joy of the Lord, and always thankful.' Colossians 1:11-12 TLB&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once there was an old and very wise man. Every day he and his granddaughter would sit outside a petrol station in his rocking chair, waiting to greet tourists as they passed through their small town. One day a tall man, who surely had to be a tourist, began looking around as if he were checking out the area for a place to live. ‘So what kind of town is this?’ he asked. The old man replied, ‘Well, what kinda town are you from?’ The tourist said, ‘One where everyone is very critical of each other. It’s a real negative place to live.’ The old man said: ‘Well, y’know, that’s just how this town is.’ Later, a family passing through also stopped for petrol. The father stepped out and asked the old man, ‘Is this town a good place to live?’ He replied, ‘Well, what about the town you’re from?’ The father said, ‘In the town I’m from everyone is very close and always willing to lend a helping hand. I really hate to leave it.’ The old man smiled and said, ‘Well, y’know, that’s a lot like this town.’ After the family had left the granddaughter looked up and asked, ‘Grandpa, how come when the first man came you told him this was a terrible place to live, yet when that family came you told them it was wonderful?’ The old man looked down into his granddaughter’s wondering blue eyes and said, ‘No matter where you go, you take your attitude with you. And that’s what makes it terrible or wonderful.’ Life is what you make it! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Exo 33-35; John 4:27-38; Ps 32; Pro 27:1-3 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62235&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...all of this is a gift from God, who brought us back to himself through Christ. And God has given us this task of reconciling people to him.' (2 Corinthians 5:18 NLT)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reconciliation. Restoring relationships. That’s what the Cross does. It changes everything. The moment we give ourselves fully over to God because of that Cross, life changes completely. Nothing will ever be the same again. And if we think that stops at us, we’re totally wrong. What starts in our individual lives has a ripple effect, out into the lives of others. Pastor Matt Chandler puts it like this: ‘Think of the Gospel as a stone landing in a pond. The life, death, and resurrection of Jesus are the cause of many ripples; they are the epicentre of God’s work in the world.’ And he reckons the ripples go out like this: (1) The first restores our personal relationship with God. (2) The second helps us restore and create human–to–human relationships to make up the worldwide Church. (3) The third ripple happens when we move ourselves out and take the message of Jesus to those who are not yet a part of the Church. Essentially, what he’s saying is that God ‘reconciles’ us to Himself, and that makes us able to go out and let Him use us to restore other people’s relationships with Him. Once we’re brought back into that beautiful relationship with God, it only makes sense to share that with those around us. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Acts 13:21-22; 1 Sam 16; 1 Sam 17:32-51; 1 Sam 24:1-17&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62236&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I saw the Lord sitting on a throne...' Isaiah 6:1 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s absolutely impossible to have a real encounter with God and not be changed by it. Just look at Isaiah, and in particular Isaiah 6:1–5. After meeting with God, Isaiah said, ‘Woe is me, for I am undone! Because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King.’ (Isaiah 6:1–5 NKJV) Heavy, yes. But the point is, Isaiah’s entire outlook turned around after one encounter with God. The guy was ‘undone’! You see, as soon as Isaiah gets a glimpse of God’s holiness, he immediately understands himself and his own mistakes. Butcher–turned–writer Simon Ponsonby puts it like this: ‘God doesn’t tell Isaiah he is sinful—He doesn’t need to. As light reveals darkness, God’s holiness exposes man’s sinfulness… he never saw it before, but then he had never seen God before.’ It all starts with seeing, with light coming to shine into darkness. That’s why it’s good to confess our mistakes to God and, in some circumstances, to other trustworthy Christians—asking God to shine that light, and allowing others to see it can help a whole lot. This is one of the (not–so–secret) secrets of finding a way past sin, and making positive changes to become more like Jesus. We all prefer others to see our ‘wow’ rather than our ‘woe’, but letting God shine a light into our darkest places is essential for our holiness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Exo 36-38; John 4:39-54; Ps 87; Pro 27:4-6 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62237&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['How long, O Lord, must I call for help?...' Habakkuk 1:2 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s one very good word you could use to define the Christian view of the world: ‘waiting’. This whole crumbling creation is waiting for the day Jesus returns and sets things straight once and for all. But in our own lives too, there’s often an agonising amount of waiting. Perhaps you’re waiting for an answer to a prayer? A breakthrough in a painful situation you’re facing? Mr or Ms Right? Well, you’re not the first person to struggle with the idea of waiting, and you won’t be the last. God said to the prophet Habakkuk, ‘The revelation awaits an appointed time … and will not prove false. Though it lingers, wait for it; it will certainly come and will not delay.’ (Habakkuk 2:3 NIV) Why did God say that? Well, it was a direct answer to Habakkuk’s question, ‘How long, O Lord, must I call for help, but you do not listen?’ Waiting is never easy. So what should we do? Make it active waiting: pour yourself into the job at hand; otherwise you’ll short–change your own future. Even if it feels like all you’re doing is standing on God’s promises, waiting for change, keep at it. Sighing and resorting to twiddling your thumbs won’t go towards anything. James writes, ‘Be patient… See how the farmer waits for the land to yield its valuable crop and how patient he is for the autumn and spring rains. You too, be patient and stand firm.’ (James 5:7–8 NIV) So: next time you’re in a queue, make use of that time. Pick a person out, and silently pray for them the whole time you’re waiting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Exo 39-40; John 5:1-15; Ps 41; Pro 27:7-9 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62238&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I will wait, 'til my change comes.' Job 14:14 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the most helpful advice for living comes from the natural world. A mud–covered and unnoticed seed becomes a giant, fruit–bearing plant after weeks in the dark, suffocating underground. Then the shoot that forms must force its way out to be seen by everyone for its beauty. It’s not quick, and it’s probably not much fun for the seed. The same is true for your life in God: when you don’t rush His purpose in your life, the results will be powerful, and unexpectedly good. Perhaps you’re thinking, ‘I can’t wait for this (job contract / school term / illness / loneliness / unemployment* (*delete as applicable) to be over.’ That’s understandable—Job couldn’t either. He said, ‘All the days of my hard service I will wait, ’til my change comes.’ But by God’s grace he made it, and ended up with twice as much as he lost. Twice as much. So hold on, your change is coming. God won’t give up on you, so don’t give up on Him. He’s working through you as we speak, you know... Perhaps something is ending that has to end, so that something better can come through. God never disappoints; don’t look at what’s going around you without seeing it through His eyes. Ecclesiastes 3:1 tells us there is a right time for all things and a season for every activity—including waiting! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Isa 1-3; John 5:16-30; Ps 15; Pro 27:10-12 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62239&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Go to the land I will show you ... and I will bless you.' Genesis 12:1-2 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nobody likes to be the first to arrive at a party, and it’s a brave thing to show up alone to an event where you might not know anyone. Most of us chicken out and try to pitch up with at least one other friend (or lurk in the doorway till we see a familiar face...) What is it we’re so afraid of? Looking like a fool or a Billy–no–mates? Maybe it’s the fear that our friend might not show up at all. If we’re honest, we sometimes think God might leave us hanging too. What if I go and You don’t come through for me? But if God’s called you to go, you can be sure He will show. In fact, He won’t just turn up, He’ll get there before you do. Abraham discovered this to be true: ‘By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going.’ (Hebrews 11:8 NIV) Read his story and you’ll see how God went ahead of him, working things out for him and his family, rearranging circumstances to his advantage. Here’s a verse to copy into the front of your Bible: ‘I am the Lord your God, who teaches you what is best for you, who directs you in the way you should go.’ (Isaiah 48:17 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; SoulFood: Isa 4-7; John 5:31-47; Ps 5; Pro 27:13-16 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62240&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Jesus told His disciples a story to show that they should always pray and never give up.' Luke 18:1 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key part of prayer is persistence. Often, it’s not enough simply to ask. God doesn’t want us to be afraid we’re being rude if we keep on asking. How do we know? Jesus told a story about a widow who’d been in a dispute with an enemy. She approached a judge to get him to intervene. The judge couldn’t have cared less about her case. But she decided she wasn’t giving up pleading with him. Finally he gave in. ‘I’m going to see that she gets justice, because she is wearing me out with her constant requests!’ (Luke 18:5 NLT) What a great attitude to prayer, right? Never giving up? But wait… what about that judge? He sounds a little off. Does this story mean God is indifferent to our needs? Does He really care about us, or does He only give in because we’ve nagged Him enough? Not at all. Jesus made his story’s judge unjust to make exactly this point: if this tired, grumpy old man gives in, ‘...don’t you think God will surely give justice to His chosen people who cry out to Him day and night? Will He keep putting them off?’ (Luke 18:7 NLT) Remember this is God in Heaven, who loves to see you blessed. If you don’t see an answer to prayer, keep asking Him. He’s not reluctant to answer you, but He’s working things to give you the very best, and wants you to get even closer in the meantime. When you pray, don’t prepare yourself for a weary battle against a distant, half–hearted God. Go with confidence He’ll answer. God is willing and is waiting. Pray and pray again for something you’ve given up on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Isa 8-11; John 6:1-24; Ps 126; Pro 27:17-19 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62241&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Holy Spirit... will teach you all things...' John 14:26 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did you ever have a teacher who carried around a chipped, coffee–stained World’s Best Teacher mug? The real World’s Best Teacher doesn’t carry around any sort of mug. According to Jesus, the WBT is the Holy Spirit. And there’s two good reasons why. (1) His tuition is one–on–one personal. He doesn’t mind your questions or your mistakes, He’s there to help every step of the way. (2) He has full knowledge about you, your past and your future. And He wants to clean up your past so your future is a blessing to yourself and others. He has the perfect solution to every problem you face. He knows exactly how to turn around a nightmare scenario into a win–win. But unlike a school teacher, He won’t demand that you pay attention. If you want to be a disciple (or ‘learner’) of Jesus, you need to show up every day for class, not just every once in a while. It means you have to listen intently, do the reading assignments and take notes. It means trusting that the Teacher knows what He’s talking about even if you don’t see how what He’s telling you right now relates to you personally. The Holy Spirit doesn’t make mistakes: what seems irrelevant now may be just what you need tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Isa 12-16; John 6:25-34; Ps 85; Pro 27:20-22 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62242&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Spirit will... make it known to you.' John 16:15 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked what makes a good teacher, William Arthur Ward wrote: ‘The mediocre teacher tells. The good teacher explains. The superior teacher demonstrates. The great teacher inspires.’ The very best teachers are not the ones who just tell you what they think you need to know. They are the ones who explain it and demonstrate in such a way that it leaves you utterly inspired. This is what Jesus did for His disciples (remember, the word disciple literally means ‘learner’ or ‘student’). In Jesus’ day, disciples not only learned from listening to a rabbi, but also by observing and experiencing his way of life from every angle. In the same way, Jesus invited His twelve mates into (almost) every part of his life for three years. They knew Him intimately. It meant that, when the time finally came, they were ready. He could say to them, ‘...[you] will do the same works I have done, and even greater.’ (John 14:12 NLT) True discipleship is a 360–degree thing. There should be people you are learning from (those a little further along than you), people you are learning with (those of a similar level of maturity to you), and people who are learning from you. The Spirit will reveal the life of God to you in different ways through all of these relationships. And that’s the important thing—relationships. If you’re not part of a community of Christians, how can you be learning from them or learning with them? Not sure where a church is in your area? Go to www.word4U2day.com.au/Church-Search and pray the Holy Spirit will direct you to the right place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Ruth 1:8-18; Ruth 2:5-12; Ruth 3:1-6; Ruth 4:9-13 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62243&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Jesus saw her... and said, &quot;Dear woman, you are healed of your sickness!&quot;' Luke 13:12 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we get to see Jesus doing what He loves to do: healing and setting people free. Luke 13:10–14 NLT says, ‘As Jesus was teaching in a synagogue, He saw a woman who had been… bent double for eighteen years and was unable to stand up straight… He called her over and… touched her, and instantly she could stand straight. How she praised God! But the leader… was indignant that Jesus had healed her on the Sabbath day. “There are six days of the week for working,” he said to the crowd. “Come on those days to be healed, not on the Sabbath.”’ This woman had suffered for nearly two decades from an evil spirit that was keeping her hunched over and looking down at the ground. But Jesus found her in the synagogue, so perhaps she hadn’t yet given up hope God would heal her. Wonderfully, that’s exactly what He does: without waiting to be asked, Jesus compassionately calls her over and releases her with a word and a touch. It’s telling that Jesus accomplished in seconds what eighteen years of religion had failed to do for this woman. That’s because the kind of religion which majors only on rule–keeping has no power in itself—it relies on controlling the crowd, like the synagogue leader in this account. Run from religion like this. Consider: is it possible to do ‘spiritual’ things (such as going to church, reading the Bible or praying) with a legalistic, rule–keeping mindset which actually stops us from meeting with Jesus? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Isa 17-21; John 6:35-51; Ps 98; Pro 27:23-24&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62244&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Your beauty should come from within you.' 1 Peter 3:4 NCV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A long time ago (in a galaxy, well, here) Jonathan Edwards wrote this: ‘But saints and angels behold that glory of God which consists in the beauty of His holiness; and it is this sight only that will melt and humble the hearts of men, wean them from the world, draw them to God, and effectually change them.’ We don’t often think of ‘holiness’ as being something that makes you beautiful. But if your life is rooted in God that much, then what else can give beauty to it? Only your relationship with Jesus defines you. Only God pieces you together, with all the care and attention in the world. Only His plans forge your path. Only His beauty, deep as oceans and huge as mountains, counts. It’s the only beauty that can stir up something far–down in a human soul. God is beyond beautiful. He is sublime, wondrous, so stupendously gorgeous it’s enough to make normal humans afraid. And He made us to reflect Himself. For Christians, that’s hardwired into our spiritual DNA. We can say: You. Are. Beautiful. God–defined beautiful. And that carries strength. God has placed some of His deep, light–filled power in you, enough to make dark ugliness flee. When that’s inside, what does the outside matter? Outward looks make very little difference. Your God–filled heart is what will show the world there is a higher, purer, perfect Beauty. And, when it does, it’s your job to tell the world that the Beauty’s name is Jesus. Fiery, Jesus–focused souls are what change the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; SoulFood: Isa 22-25; John 6:52-71; Ps 127; Pro 27:25-27 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62245&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['If God is for us, who can ever be against us?' Romans 8:31 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faith is like a muscle; using it may cause a strain but in the end it grows stronger. David (the bloke who wrote all those Psalms and killed Goliath) totally understood this. He was always getting into trouble but instead of losing faith in God’s promise, David understood that, ‘The Lord has set apart the godly man for Himself.’ (Psalm 4:3 NAS) So he said, ‘In peace I will...lie down... for You...Lord, make me to dwell in safety.’ (Psalm 4:8 NAS) Even when he was captured by the Philistines he prayed, ‘When I am afraid, I will...trust in You.’ (Psalm 56:3 NAS) When he ended up in a cave after escaping from a very angry King Saul, he said, ‘I will hide beneath the shadow of Your wings until this...is past.’ (Psalm 57:1 TLB) During the third century, when Felix of Nola was running from his enemies, he and a friend hid in a cave. A spider began to weave a web across the small opening, sealing it off and making it look like nobody had been inside for months. As a result the guys hunting him didn’t even bother to go in. Later, stepping out into the sunshine, Felix declared, ‘Where God is, a spider’s web is a wall. And where He isn’t, a wall is but a spider’s web.’ Jesus said you’d have problems on earth; people will disappoint you and you’ll disappoint yourself. Sometimes you’ll end up in a cave because of something you did, other times because of circumstances you’d no control over but God is with you either way. Like Paul said, ‘If God is for us, who can ever be against us?’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; SoulFood: Isa 26-29; John 7:1-13; Ps 114; Pro 28:1-4 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62246&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Job...fell to the ground and worshipped.' Job 1:20 NAS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Job had a seriously bad week. Thieves came and stole everything of value; all his kids died when they were at a party and the building collapsed on top of them; he fell agonisingly ill. But his attitude to it all? He worshipped God! Every day God sends us opportunities to grow spiritually, disguised as problems! After losing everything, ‘...Job... got up and tore his robe and shaved his head to show how sad he was. Then he bowed down... to worship God.’ That’s not the normal human response to tragedy, is it? Job didn’t react that way because he understood what was happening or because he was crazy. Despite his sadness, he worshipped God. He was able to respond that way because: (a) he looked inside! He knew God was teaching him something really valuable: ‘When He has tried me, I shall come forth as gold.’ (Job 23:10 NAS) (b) he looked forward! He reminded himself it’s all going work out when we stick with God. (c) he looked up! In the middle of a nightmare, Job saw the God who promised to direct each step we take. More importantly, he trusted God’s heart of love. Don’t make the mistake of thinking it was easier for Job to trust God than it is for you. Remember, Jesus hadn’t even been born at that point so He didn’t even have the same proof of God’s love as we do! So what should you do when troubles multiply? Look in, look forward and most of all look upwards! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Isa 30-33; John 7:14-24; Ps 104:1-23; Pro 28:5-8 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62247&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...we can come before God with freedom and without fear. We can do this through faith in Christ.' Ephesians 3:12 NCV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you walk by faith God will test you like he tested Elijah! The prophet was sitting alone beside a dried–up stream when God sent him on a 160km hike through the desert to Zarephath. At the time Elijah was a wanted man, so coming out of hiding meant really trusting God for his safety. Next, God told him that, when he got there a poor widow, would provide for him. Elijah found the widow in the middle of a famine, cooking her last meal with her last bit of food; a bit depressing! Elijah challenged her to obey God, promising: ‘There will always be plenty of flour and olive oil...in your containers until...the Lord sends rain and the crops grow.’ (1 Kings 17:14 NLT) Why on earth did Elijah have the confidence to say that to a broke widow during a famine? He had lived a life of faith and proved God to be faithful! You can talk that way when you walk that way! Rubbing shoulders with people who trust God is contagious, it builds your faith. This woman was no exception. She and her son may not have eaten fine cuisine every night but God made sure that as long as the famine lasted they had all they needed. So if you don’t have everything you want right now, give God what you’ve got and trust that, when the time is right, He’ll look after you. Paul says, ‘...we can come before God with freedom and without fear.’ So wherever God is directing you, even if it’s somewhere that doesn’t make sense to you right now, don’t argue. Go, and remember His promises—they will strengthen your faith to believe in Him for all your needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Deut 18:9-18; Dan 2; Isa 47:5-15; Acts 16:16-34 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62249&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Then their eyes were opened and they knew Him...' Luke 24:31 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;You’ve read the book &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&lt;/em&gt;? Or seen the movie &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;The Voyage of the ‘Dawn Treader’&lt;/em&gt;? The Christian themes are pretty obvious, huh? Yet the author CS Lewis was once a hardcore atheist and wrote tracts defending it. He said, ‘I maintained God did not exist. I was also angry with God for not existing.’ Then two friends of his, JRR Tolkien (yup, the guy who wrote &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;The Lord of The Rings&lt;/em&gt;) and HVD Dyson, both devout followers of Jesus, urged him to do something he’d never done before: read the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;So he did. He began to wrestle with the things Jesus said. And eventually he came to a realisation: Jesus was either a loony, or a brilliant conman, or exactly who He claimed to be. No other options. There was a big jump to concluding Jesus was the Son of God, and Lewis knew it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;He talked it through with his friends. There was no denying it, the Bible made massive claims about truth and reality. One evening he and friends took a long walk and chatted late into the night. Soon afterwards, Lewis became a believer. Eventually he was so famous the Atheist Society had to stop using those tracts he wrote. His world turned around and, as a result, so did the worlds of millions of readers. Could it be this simple? Could the chasm between doubt and faith be spanned with just the Bible and Christian friends?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;If you know friends questioning God or interrogating faith right now—don’t write them off! Talk to God about the questions you can ask them to help them work things through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Is 34-37, Jn 7:25-44, Ps 104:24-35, Prov 28:9-12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63436&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...do it all in the name of the Lord...' Colossians 3:17 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;‘Look out for number one.’ That’s such great advice for life, yeah?? (Shakes head.) So, how about we remind ourselves that Jesus ‘did not please Himself.’ (Romans 15:3 NIV) You won’t find a shred of selfishness in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Ivan O Miller said, ‘Humility is such a frail and delicate thing that he who dares to think that he has it, proves by that single thought that he has it not.’ So, the challenge that he sets out is: how much can you forget about yourself so that you can put others first?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Sound a bit harsh? Inhuman? Perhaps it’s a way to enjoy life without obsessing over yourself. When you succeed and the pats–on–the–back start coming your way, enjoy them briefly, and then pass the accolades on to the true source of all your accomplishments. Where your mind is singing to itself about how great you are, get re–tuned. Do it in the name of the Lord Jesus—actually, ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Colossians 3:17 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;There’s an aim and a half! Kick off, today, with something small so that one day, you’ll be able to say that ‘whatever’ you do is done for God. Remember: pride brought Satan down. It’ll burn us to the ground too if we let it. So start today with an act of praise to God. End today with one too. And see how many times you can do the same in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Acts 9:1-19, 2 Cor 11:21-33, 2 Cor 12:7-10, Phil 3:4-14  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63437&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['There is a time for everything.' Ecclesiastes 3:1 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Cleaningroster–setupteam–worshippractice–missionsweek–prayermeeting–home–sleep–zzz. Sound familiar? Sometimes it’s hard to say ‘no’ because as a Christian you feel obligated to do everything you’re asked. But not every ‘need’ is an order from God to jump in and meet it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Urgency is stressful. It’s also addictive, so if you find yourself always reacting to outside demands, check that you’re not hooked. Like any addiction, urgency meets your need to feel needed—for a while, anyway. It may make you feel satisfied, but it will bite back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;It creates a sense you’re getting important tasks done, falsely inflates your self–esteem, but tends to make stuff worse because mostly ‘haste makes waste’. You weren’t made for urgency. Jumping from one task to the next without being rested or centred breaks up your personality. Too much and you’ll probably struggle with sleep. We have to find space for ourselves, not in a selfish, me–first way, but to get settled in our home in God and get our hearts rested. There is a time for everything, but, not everything has to happen all the time! Walker Percy said, ‘You can get all A’s and still flunk life.’ Try to be discerning about the tasks you need to do and the tasks that will only drain you. Ask God to help you make a list of the ‘must do’ tasks in life. Then ask Him to help you prioritise the list—and stick to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Is 38-41, Jn 7:45-53, Ps 9, Prov 28:13-16&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63440&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<title><![CDATA[THE SIN OF OMISSION]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[the-sin-of-omission]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...To him who knows to do good and does not do it...it is sin.' James 4:17 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;We spend a large chunk of our time at church/youth groups/home groups/this magazine talking about honouring God by not making wrong choices (which, for hopefully obvious reasons, is a decent shout). The wrong we do holds us back from knowing God. Yet, Jesus focussed a lot on something a little different: the good we fail to do. And THAT can be a touchy subject. Not something Jesus wanted to shy away from, though. The servant who buried his resources (Luke 16:19–24), and the barren fig tree (Mark 11:20–24) are examples of Jesus calling out procrastination, laziness, unwillingness and the like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;And guess what? We’re not free from that, either. How many times have you caught yourself killing productive–time by scrolling down that news feed, and forgetting exactly why you opened up Facebook in the first place? We reckon we’ve all done something similar. And if that’s true; we’re probably fairly prone to larger–scale laziness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;It’s fair to say you might not have got it all together yet, and you need to get to know God better. But at the end of the day (and at the start/middle, too)—the way to get a deep spiritual life is to look out for ways to serve others, and don’t think twice: get straight to it. (Worried that you aren’t doing these things? Your works for God aren’t the way you get saved, but it’s definitely time to consider thanking Him through your works.)&lt;/p&gt;

<title><![CDATA[MILIEU THERAPY]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[milieu-therapy]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['I will bless the Lord at all times.' Psalm 34:1 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Milieu therapy is pretty cool. It’s a type of therapy that puts the patient into a new living environment, changing their surroundings in order to make room for a healthier life to grow. So here’s today’s idea: worship can change your surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;A century ago GK Chesterton put it like this: ‘You say grace before meals. All right. But I say grace before the concert and the opera, and grace before the play and pantomime, and grace before I open a book, and grace before sketching, painting, swimming, fencing, boxing, walking, playing, dancing and grace before I dip the pen in the ink.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Hmm... which kinda translates as: ‘...grace before Facebook, grace before YouTube, before Instagram, before movies, before texting...’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Sometimes you don’t feel like praising God. But feelings don’t have to always fill praise, and a good relationship isn’t based on emotion but on commitment. A songwriter in the Bible said, ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;From the rising of the sun to its going down, the Lord’s name is to be praised&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Psalm 113:3 NKJ) They scheduled praisebreaks throughout their day: ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Seven times a day I praise You&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Psalm 119:164 NKJ) What if, every time you stopped for a break (tea, coffee or chocolate), you took time to praise God too? If you want to change your environment and your attitude, start praising God throughout the day. Try it and see. Eventually the emotions and feelings may come along and make the praise spontaneous and just flowing out of you, just like Chesterton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Is 42-44, Jn 8:1-13, Ps 96, Prov 28:17-20&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63441&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let everything that has breath praise the Lord.' Psalm 150:6 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;When it’s time to praise God you should give it 100 percent: ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;I will praise You, O Lord, with my whole heart.&lt;/em&gt;’ (Psalm 9:1 NKJ) The story’s told of an old man named Joe, who’d been a drunk and a derelict most of his life and, as a result, he could barely make ends meet. During a Sunday morning service he gave his life to Christ and the transformation was so radical that everybody in the congregation noticed it. Joe had a problem, however. He was just so thrilled with Jesus that he sang louder than everybody else. And when the pastor made a point that touched his heart, he’d jump up and shout, ‘Hallelujah!’ Concerned that the interruptions were drawing attention more to Joe than God, the pastor said, ‘Joe, you’ve got to be quiet. As a matter of fact, if you’ll just sit in church next Sunday and say nothing, I’ll buy you a new pair of boots.’ Joe needed those boots, so he said he’d try. But after restraining himself through several high points in the sermon, he couldn’t stand it anymore. He jumped up and shouted, ‘Boots or no boots, I’m gonna praise the Lord!’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Are you holding back because you feel shy? Sorry, God doesn’t make exceptions based on personality types. ‘Let everything that has breath praise the Lord!’ In other words, unless you’re dead, you’re supposed to praise the Lord! Not because He needs it! But because He comes to dwell within the praise you give Him. (Psalm 22:3) Want to be closer to Jesus? Just open your mouth in praise!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Is 45-48, Jn 8:14-30, Ps 86, Prov 28:21-24 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63442&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The high priest then asked Jesus about His disciples and His doctrine.' John 18:19 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;You think Jesus never had any embarrassing moments? What about when Mary and Joseph interrupted Him as a twelve-year-old, sitting in the temple dazzling its best scholars. (Luke 2:48) They scuttled Him off, saying, ‘We thought we’d lost you. You had us worried to death.’ Or what about the time He stood up in His home church to announce He was the prophesied One and the neighbours tried to throw Him off a cliff? (Luke 4:29) Or the occasion when He told Jairus his daughter wasn’t dead but sleeping and everyone ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;laughed him to scorn&lt;/em&gt;’? (Matthew 9:24 KJV) Now think about this. When the high priest asked Jesus about His doctrine, He replied, ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Why do you ask Me? Ask those who have heard Me…&lt;/em&gt;’ (John 18:21 NKJ) One of the officers nearby slapped Him in the face. That’s embarrassing! But the supreme embarrassment in the life of Jesus may well have been when the high priest asked Him about His disciples. Where were they? Judas betrayed Him, Peter denied Him, and the rest ran for cover. What could He say? More importantly, what can He say about you?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes;&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Are your character and your behaviour a reason for angels to rejoice or an embarrassment to Jesus? Gandhi said, ‘If Christians would really live according to the teachings of Christ, all of India would be Christian today.’ When it comes to what you believe about Jesus, you may stand tall. But when that belief translates into behaviour, where do you stand?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes;&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Dishonouring Him or as His disciple?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Is 49-52, Jn 8:31-41, Ps 30, Prov 28:25-28&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63443&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<alias><![CDATA[house-fires-and-snooze-buttons]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['We have a good conscience, in all things...' Hebrews 13:18 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Your conscience works on the same principle as a fire alarm—the rest of the house might be asleep, but when the fire alarm kicks off everyone should be bounding up and paying attention. And when sin obstructs the connection between you and God, your conscience will be the thing that signals something’s going wrong. At that moment you don’t rub your eyes blearily and rouse yourself grumbling. No, you should be lively, alert, and sprinting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;You can develop the ability to sleep through sin–alarms, of course. And it can be quite tempting to hit the snooze button, because no one likes being called out on something they’re doing. But actually, let yourself feel good about the sin–alarms. It means your conscience is alive—and the Holy Spirit will never use it to crush us with shame, but to encourage us to do better. The Holy Spirit is really important here—He’s the one who engineers the conscience to guide you from continuing down that path. So foster that feeling, and listen to Him. And if you plough on regardless, like trying to sleep through a house fire, your conscience will stop you from being at ease with your decision. Don’t wait until there’s smoke in the air. Don’t wait until you can taste house fire in your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;You will likely still have blind spots about certain sins. So alongside your conscience, remember that God puts other Christians around you so that He can speak to you through them. Think about people who you can trust to offer godly advice and make it a priority to connect with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Is 53-57, Jn 8:42-59, Ps 123, Prov 29:1-3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63444&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Keep your tongue from evil...' Psalm 34:13 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;You know the feeling. You’re walking along, not quite paying attention, and your foot goes straight into a little pile that some prized poodle’s owner failed to clean up. Walk that through a doorway and the whole household will soon let you know about it. Yet, we can bring something just as dirty and smelly into a room and it’s so much harder to notice: and that thing that’s ‘on the nose’ is gossip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Think about the mess you’re likely to make with gossip. Ask yourself, ‘Who’s going to benefit from me saying this stuff?’ ‘Who am I going to hurt?’ ‘Whose confidence am I betraying?’ If it has the potential to cause a stink, leave it outside. Don’t drag potentially hurtful half–truth into your house. Clean your shoes and your conscience, at the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;James 1:26 NIV implies that ‘gossip’ is a stain on our spiritual lives: ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;If anyone considers himself religious and yet does not keep a tight rein on his tongue, he deceives himself and his religion is worthless&lt;/em&gt;.’ Solomon warns us that we will eat the effects of our unwise words: ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;The tongue has the power of life and death and those who love it will eat its fruit.&lt;/em&gt;’ (Proverbs 18:21 NIV) And just in case we need it spelt out further, 1 Peter 3:10 NIV tells us, ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Whoever would love life and see good days must keep his tongue from evil&lt;/em&gt;.’ Words can run away from you, and get out of hand. Don’t let it happen. Ask the Lord to help you if you have a problem with gossiping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Is 58-62, Jn 9:1-12, Ps 15, Prov 29:4-6&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63445&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...His...riches...in the saints.' Ephesians 1:18 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Paul wasn’t meaning to sound like a financial adviser when he prayed the Ephesian church would understand the riches He had ‘invested’ in them. No, he was helping them to get a grip on why God had lavished so many extravagant gifts on them. The point of God’s generous investment is that He sees the potential for something great to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;God is in the entrepreneurial game. Not to make us self–centred, gifted busybodies (although He wants us to feel good about our gifts—He knows what we’re like). But He uses us to serve the world. If our skill is business and making money, then through us God can bless the poor. If our talent is care and tasty–food–making, then through us God can welcome and feed the lonely. If our gift is teaching, then God can show the world what His character is like. That’s what our skills are for—to make the world more like one where God rules and cares for everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;It’s why in other places in the Bible it talks about God giving us an ‘inheritance’. It’s a little mind–bending, but the (very) serious suggestion is that we’re to take part in God’s rule over the earth. The inheritance is Himself. The gifts He gives us aren’t coincidences—they are a part of His character. We are the means by which He looks over and tends for this planet. And doesn’t that just blow your mind? Read the whole of the parable of the talents in Matthew 25. Maybe have a quick scan over the things people have said you’re good at. Do any of them seem like ‘talents’?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Job 1, Job 2:7-10, Job 40:1-5, Job 42:7-17   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63446&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<title><![CDATA[PRAYER FORMULA? (1)]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[prayer-formula-1]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[ '...Lord, teach us to pray...' Luke 11:1 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Jesus didn’t give us &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;The Lord’s Prayer&lt;/em&gt; as an automatic plug–in. Yes, it’s a ready–made prayer, but it’s not made so that we don’t have to think about what we’re saying. Jesus understands how we’re wired inside. He knows we can be tempted to love what He can do for us more than loving Him for who He is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The Lord’s Prayer re–points us to God first, starts our focus with Him. That’s a pretty good way for us to get a good perspective on our issues. William Barclay points out that &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;The Lord’s Prayer&lt;/em&gt; ‘…has two major parts: the first for God’s benefit, the second for ours. Honour the first part, and the second is guaranteed.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Part one begins with ‘Our Father’. We are not approaching Santa with our gift list—we are entering family. Family—coming with a responsibility to our brothers and sisters. Family—coming with security and benefits. ‘Our Father’ reminds us that what God says goes. &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;The Lord’s Prayer&lt;/em&gt; might feel like a packaged prayer, but it doesn’t mean we don’t think about it. The next few days we are going to turn our mind to &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;The Lord’s Prayer&lt;/em&gt;. Use the time to think about prayer in a rounded way. Over–familiarisation of famous Bible passages can dilute the meaning for us. Look up these famous words in a variety of translations online (Luke 11:2–4; Matthew 6:9–13). Or refresh the words by writing one of them out in your own words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Is 63-66, Jn 9:13-23, Ps 115, Prov 29:7-10  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63447&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...before the throne of our merciful God... we will find help.' Hebrews 4:16 CEV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;‘Our ruler in Heaven…’ or ‘Our Lord of the universe…’ Jesus could’ve begun like this. Both are theologically correct. Yet when He chooses to model His way of praying, He uses the words ‘Our Father.’ Not ruler. Not king. Not head–honcho. Daddy. That’s an even better translation than ‘father’. Jesus chose these words to remind us to think like family. We’re not orphans. We have a heavenly Daddy who loves us and expects us to love one another. So we have a responsibility to love our brothers and sisters. We are family, God’s family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;We have roles in this family—one is the role of sibling. Because of this, we should actively choose not to climb all over our brothers or sisters to get to the top of our profession—or even the head of the queue. Because of this, we should actively choose to care for others, like the hungry in our communities. This is the kind of family God adopts us into: a caring family, not a selfish one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;As well as being siblings, we are also children. Jesus reminds us God is a good father—the best. He provides and accepts and loves, always. A father of compassion and comfort. We can always go to Him when we feel hurt by others. He’ll never let us down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;When we’re rooted into that sort of family, and we’re getting what we need emotionally from God, that selfless love flows out of us. Right now, ask God to show you how He is a perfect Father to you. Then, reckon you can ask Him to give you one good opportunity to share this family love today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Rom 1:1-3:20, Jn 9:24-41, Ps 99, Prov 29:11-14  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63448&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Is anything too hard for Me?' Jeremiah 32:27 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Our Father in Heaven, hallowed be Your name&lt;/em&gt;…’ ‘Hallowed’ is a way of describing God as holy. Or blessed. Or respected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;We’ve looked a little at God being our Father. But what if your experience of the word ‘Dad’ isn’t great? What if the word is loaded because Dad was distant or absent or let you down? Well this word ‘hallowed’ reminds us God is no ordinary dad. God is holy. This means He doesn’t let us down. God is unchanging. This means He isn’t influenced by moods and feelings. God is love. This means He doesn’t get interested only when it’s convenient. God has us on His mind constantly. He cares about us. He loves us with perfect love. And what’s more, God is the God of overcoming the impossible (ever read that bit about mustard seeds and moving mountains?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;So get this: the God who parted the Red Sea is your Dad. The God who was designing the Universe before it sparkled into existence out of nothing—yep, He’s your Dad. The God who scattered stars in the night, came up with ideas like sight and smell and sound, who knows the secret of the meaning of life—yep, He’s your Dad. Is anything impossible for your Dad? No! Nothing. ‘…&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Is anything too hard for Me?&lt;/em&gt;’ God asked Jeremiah. That’s what we call a rhetorical question: one that doesn’t need an answer. Because we already know what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Your Dad is all powerful God. There’s an incredible amount of safety in that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Rom 3:21-6:23, Jn 10:1-10, Ps 133, Prov 29:15-18&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63449&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Give us each day our daily bread.' Luke 11:3 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The first part of &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;The Lord’s Prayer&lt;/em&gt; puts things in perspective. ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Our Father&lt;/em&gt;…’ reminds us we are part of God’s family. ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Hallowed be Your name&lt;/em&gt;’ tells us God is no ordinary Dad—He is holy. To be respected. The God of the impossible. Next, ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Your Kingdom come; Your will be done&lt;/em&gt;…’ prompts us to put God’s way first. Nothing and nobody challenges God in Heaven. We’d do well to remember that too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Now comes the second part. We start to remember ourselves. We approach God as His child and ask for His help: ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Give us this day our daily bread&lt;/em&gt;…’ The word Jesus used here literally meant &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;food&lt;/em&gt;. In other words, give us our three square meals to keep us going. God cares for our everyday needs. Food to keep us fit and healthy. A home to keep us safe and warm. Friends and family to keep us loved and loving. Our daily ‘bread’ is all that makes life possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Our self–preservation instincts kick in too hard sometimes: What if I don’t get a job? What if I do, but I get the sack? What if I can’t afford to eat? What about bills? What if I never meet that perfect someone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Well. God doesn’t promise anyone a millionaire mansion and matching Maserati with a supermodel in the passenger seat. But God knows just what you do need. And when you need it. And how it will be provided. So learn to trust Him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Rom 7:1-9:16, Jn 10:11-21, Ps 83:1-8, Prov 29:19-22&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63450&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He will show you a way out...' 1 Corinthians 10:13 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Forgive us our sins, just as we have forgiven those who have sinned against us&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Matthew 6:12 NLT) God is holy. When we enter His presence, we soon realise we are not. Glossing over our mini–mistakes and little lapses might work in our own heads, but won’t get us anywhere with the God known as Righteousness (1 Corinthians 1:30). Best be straight with Him: God isn’t waiting to rap you on the knuckles with a ruler. He’s waiting to restore you. To give you back your dignity. But He can’t sort the problem, if you’re denying it. Tell it straight and He’ll straighten you out. Guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;There is a catch, though. You can’t get God’s forgiveness, if you won’t forgive others. Dad likes His house in order. He’s not impressed with backbiting children holding grudges against one another. If you want a clear mind, you’d better clear it with others too. ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;If you forgive men… your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not… your Father will not forgive your sins&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Matthew 6:14–15 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;This is as much for our benefit as for others. Carrying around a collection of hurts and insults is crippling. There is freedom for us when we let go. Somebody once said, ‘Forgiveness is letting go of the other man’s throat.’ But it is also letting go of our own throats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;How about spending time right now owning up to God? Think of those people you’ve been grumbling/brooding about. Decide to fully, completely, overflowingly forgive them. If this seems hard, work it through with God’s help. Ask Him to help empower your will to work towards forgiveness, however long it takes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Rom 9:17-11:36, Jn 10:22-42, Ps 83:9-18, Prov 29:23-27 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63451&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Deliver us from the evil one.' Matthew 6:13 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Lead us not into temptation&lt;/em&gt;…’ seems a bit of an odd thing to pray. William Barclay argues that the word ‘temptation’ here is referring to the craving towards the wrong things in life. The compromises. The giving–in. God will never Himself tempt us. James 1:13 is clear about this: ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;When tempted, no one should ever say, “God is tempting me.” For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He tempt anyone&lt;/em&gt;.’ The next line of the Lord’s Prayer implies where temptation actually comes from: ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Deliver us from the evil one&lt;/em&gt;.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Evil one—what does this mean? Take a look at the state of the world—children forced to join armies; 27 million people trafficked into slavery; whole regions of nations starving; diseases spreading... and the list goes on—it is pretty obvious there is an evil in this world. Some people try to ignore evil, hoping it will ignore them. But we need to be aware of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil&lt;/em&gt;…’ warns us to take the better path. Lusts, selfish ambition, greed, all contribute to what’s wrong with the world. Jesus teaches us to pray against it. To choose another way. To live, not as single individuals, but as God’s family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;We can practice ‘choosing to live like God’s family’ even in the smallest things. Look into the different movements that ethically source food and clothes and, if you like what you see, consider changing your regular shopping so you can make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Rom 12-14, Jn 11:1-16, Ps 4, Prov 30:1-4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63453&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...We walk by faith, not by sight.' 2 Corinthians 5:7 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;In today and tomorrow’s readings, we’ll be looking at what you see, and what you hear. Starting with the verse above, we have to recognise there’s always more than meets the eye. We have to trust God there’s more than what we see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;So, what are you seeing? Is something ruling your life that you haven’t brought before God? Joseph’s father saw a blood–stained coat, and the deceitful mask of sorrow on his son’s faces, and believed Joseph was dead. He lived for years in grief because of the coat that he saw—but sometimes, there’s a difference between what we can see and the actual reality of the situation. Here’s another example: in 2 Kings 6:16–17, Elisha’s servant becomes terrified at the size of the army approaching. Elisha’s answer is not one of panic. Not one of despair. He said: ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Do not fear, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.&lt;/em&gt;’ You can read what happens for yourself (well, go on then... we’ll still be here when you get back.) The servant’s fear was put well and truly into perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Trust in God isn’t a crystal ball, or a set of blueprints. It’s more like a lifejacket. We don’t necessarily see the way forward. But we can ask for God’s perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;We’ve all been there; taken one look at the deadline / job requirements / doctor’s prognosis, then allowed these things to dictate our perspective. If you need to pray about your situation and get God’s perspective on it; make sure you get on with that right now.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...The word of the Lord came to Elijah...saying... &quot;I will send rain on the earth.&quot;' 1 Kings 18:1 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;What we hear can be life–changing, whether for good or bad. What we hear changes the way we think and act. A snide comment can make us regret wearing our favourite outfit. A piece of gossip can make us prejudiced against someone we don’t really know. We (often believe and) act on what we’re told—and this includes all that negative self–talk, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;So, is &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;word4U2day&lt;/em&gt; about to give you some vague obvious advice about listening out for God, and leave it there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Well, not precisely. Answering why we need it is the best starting point for seeing all the ways He can speak to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Leaning in and keeping a spiritual ear out for God is the only way to get the most out of life. In fact, you really won’t be prepared for all life will throw at you without open communication with God. The prophet Elijah was an amazing guy. There’s a lot we can learn from him. Today’s verse comes after a long period of severe drought. The people were able to get ready to make the most of the long–awaited rainwater because Elijah heard from God and passed on the message—he heard God and changed lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Your relationship with God isn’t just a blessing to others. It’s meant to change you, the world and to spread the Kingdom of God. Getting close to God radically changes so many lives for the better. So spend time in your Bible today and get that ‘spark’ back in your relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...Take heart...l have overcome the world.' John 16:33 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Our last couple of days have been centred around the input into our lives: what we see and hear (forgotten already? Have a skim back through.) Now, what happens when we don’t keep watch over all of that? When there’s so much going on that we’ve forgotten to keep looking and listening out for God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Well, try this for size: &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;fear&lt;/em&gt;. And we don’t just mean being scared out of your wits about stuff. When we aren’t ‘fearing’ God (which means respecting and reverencing Him), we find ourselves giving people the final say in our lives. It might be a bully or a critic. In fact, Jesus knew that ultimately, if God calls you to something, you have to be careful that even those closest to us don’t hold us up from doing our ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Father’s business&lt;/em&gt;’ (Luke 2:49).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;It’s not always easy when the world around you seems to be fearful about what you are, too. Keeping your head screwed on even when it looks like a storm’s coming is a challenge to anyone. But Jesus says ‘…&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Take heart…l have overcome the world&lt;/em&gt;.’ (John 16:33 NLT) It wouldn’t have taken much for the disciples to start panicking about doing ‘life’ without Jesus. They’d just been let in on knowing how much opposition they’d come up against, and on top of that, Jesus was about to leave them. But the fact that Jesus promised to be with them in Spirit was more than enough to reassure them. And it’s got to be the same for us, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Ecc 1-4, Jn 11:28-37, Ps 50, Prov 30:7-10 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63496&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['O Lord...give me success today.' Genesis 24:12 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Ever spent much time thinking about what God thinks about your work? Whether it’s education / part time job / full time career, it probably fills up a reasonable amount of your headspace. In Colossians, Paul gives us a clear principle to live by: ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Colossians 3:23 NIV) Today we’ll be looking at what to do when ‘work’ is difficult/ you don’t really want to do it ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;as if for the Lord&lt;/em&gt;’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Minor character time. Ever heard of Eliezer? Back in Genesis, Abraham commissioned him with the job of finding Isaac (Abraham’s son) a wife. Bit of a strange–sounding task that—finding a spouse for the boss’ son. And not an easy one either; he had to start from scratch. This is where we learn a big lesson from Eliezer: just because it’s your job to do something doesn’t mean you aren’t allowed to invite God right into the centre of it. The verse at the top is a quote: he prayed for success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;A quick aside—praying for God to be with you is never going to be a bad idea. We just need to make sure success doesn’t become our god. If getting to the top (or staying there) is your reason for getting up every morning, you’ll need to dethrone that attitude quick smart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Yet God will help you become more like Jesus everyday—and fulfil His purpose in you. Don’t have a clue what that looks like? Under pressure? Read the whole of Eliezer’s success story. (Genesis 24)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Drink, and I'll water your camels too.' Genesis 24:46 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;So, Eliezer has embarked on his mission to find a wife for Isaac. He’s ended up in a place called Nahor; somewhere he probably didn’t have much of a clue about. But, God was on his side. Remember his prayer (yesterday’s verse)? Verse 15 tells us that ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Before he had finished praying&lt;/em&gt;’, Rebekah, a local girl, showed up. The future daughter–in–law to Abraham, household name in Israel, famous Bible character. Are you on the edge of your seat yet? What’s she going to do??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Ready? She offers him a drink of water… AND—get this—to water his camels, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Hmm. Maybe not the triumphant entrance you expected. Until you read between the lines (don’t worry, we’ll do it for you)—a full bucket of water is about 4 litres which weighs 4 kg. A thirsty camel can slurp through about 120 litres, and there were ten camels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;So, Rebekah drew 1200 litres of water (weighing over a tonne!) for a stranger—a fairly decent pointer for Eliezer. This is a great example of someone working ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;as if for the Lord&lt;/em&gt;’ (Colossians 3:23)—she was acting out of good will, not trying to please her boss / teacher. Aiming for our own success shouldn’t be our goal in life, but whether it’s this time round or in Heaven, ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;You know that the Lord will reward everyone for whatever good he does&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Ephesians 6:8 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Struggle with motivation for work? Nip down to your nearest well… ok, ok joke. But what excessive generosity can you offer to God through blessing someone today?&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...He rose up and went into the city.' Acts 14:20 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Ever feel like you’re on the receiving end of a barrage of curveballs? Over and over: one day stress, the next disappointment. And just as you’re slowly getting back up to your feet, worry and anxiety come hurtling round the corner to smack you down. We’ve all been in a ‘when–will–this–end?’ situation, and they’re never easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Check out the context for today’s verse: ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Then Jews…came there; and having persuaded the multitudes, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing him to be dead&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Acts 14:19 NKJ) Paul somehow got back up. And more impressively, he went straight on ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;into the city&lt;/em&gt;’ to carry on his mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;…What? He didn’t call the whole thing off after being stoned? And this was by no means the only time he was knocked down. Whatever Paul had, we definitely need it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;(1) He had a relationship with God. He was one focussed Jewish boy. Looking up to God is the way to keep hope in the future, so as not to throw the sweaty, bloodied towel in. Only this kind of gritty optimism could lead him to write in 2 Corinthians 4:8—‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;We are hard–pressed on every side, yet not crushed…struck down, but not destroyed&lt;/em&gt;.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;(2) He had a relationship with Godly people—Paul only got up after his ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;disciples gathered around him&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Acts 14:20 NKJ) He wasn’t alone. He needed all the encouragement and support he could get—and in tough times, so do we.&lt;/p&gt;

<title><![CDATA[THE DEMAS ROAD (1)]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[the-demas-road-1]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Demas has forsaken me...' 2 Timothy 4:10 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Paul writes one of the saddest verses in Scripture: ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world&lt;/em&gt;.’ Following Jesus is a bit of a rollercoaster. A rattling car of enormous peaks, terrifying lows, pulsating twists and turns, and thrilling loop–the–loops. Sometimes we’re speeding along, enjoying the ride; other times we’re hanging on with bare white knuckles. Whatever we’re feeling, though, we’d be super–crazy to unbuckle during the ride. And yet some Christians do. Like Demas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Perhaps he was tired of feeling alienated? Perhaps his doubts overcame him and he felt he couldn’t talk it over with others? Maybe a fellow believer hurt him? Maybe some stuff was too hard to believe now? Jesus seems to have that effect on some. ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Therefore many of His disciples, when they heard this, said, “This is a hard saying; who can understand it?”… From that time many of His disciples went back and walked with Him no more&lt;/em&gt;.’ (John 6:60–66 NKJ) Even today, bits of Jesus’ teaching are easier to swallow than others. Heaven is a wonderful thought but Hell... not so much. We love to hear that Jesus has a purpose for us. Loving God and loving others—nice one, Jesus. We’re really thankful Jesus sacrificed Himself and died for us. But what about making a sacrifice ourselves? What about the things that are even harder than love? And let’s face it, the ‘loving people’ thing isn’t always easy, anyway! But it’s a non–negotiable part of being a friend of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Demas...loved this...world.' 2 Timothy 4:10 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Again we ask, ‘What happened to Demas?’ Maybe his faith involved too many scrapes. When Paul came to town, some came to faith while others came with stones. Beatings, imprisonment, arguments probably featured in a big way on Paul’s morning prayer–list. Maybe Demas signed up thinking all life’s problems would vanish by following Jesus. Church conferences today, especially for young people, can sometimes have this flavour: ‘Hands up who wants life to be smooth and effortless? Great. Hands up those who want to follow Jesus?’ (Not a direct quote, but you get what we mean?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Think of the bits we leave out when we talk about our faith. How often do you hear, ‘Follow Jesus. Be misunderstood by people. Be the butt of jokes. Take the heat for controversial issues. Say “no” to fun stuff. Right, who wants to become a Christian?’ Ok, maybe this is not the way to win people over. But perhaps there is room in our evangelism for a fuller picture to be painted. Jesus certainly didn’t hide the tough stuff: ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;If the world hates you, you know that it hated Me before it hated you. If you were of the world, the world would love its own. Yet because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you&lt;/em&gt;.’ (John 15:18–19 NKJ) If we want more Paul–people and less Demas–dudes, we need to balance what Jesus Himself taught—taking the rough with the smooth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;At risk of failing exams. At risk of getting fired. At risk of messing up your future and being stuck in the same dead end, mindless, spirit–sucking job forever. At risk of bullying. At risk of never meeting that special someone and end up dying alone. At risk of identity theft. At risk of software crashing. At risk of friends betraying you. At risk of a ten–tonne bus crashing into you. At risk of a meteorite smashing into your car. At risk of cellulite. At risk of your sniffle turning into that deadly disease you googled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Living in 2014 is a risky business. Best roll yourself into a blanket of bubble wrap, cross your fingers and hope you get through this year risk–free, right? Flip! How did anyone ever get by in the old days? Perhaps they went to bed with this promise, ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Trust in the Lord and do good. Then you will live safely in the land and prosper. Take delight in the Lord and He will give you your heart’s desires. Commit everything you do to the Lord. Trust Him, and He will help you… Be still in the presence of the Lord and wait patiently for Him to act…The Lord rescues the godly; He is their fortress in times of trouble. The Lord helps them…He saves them, and they find shelter in Him&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Psalm 37:1–7; 39–40 NLT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Y’know. It probably helped with perspective or something. If it hasn’t helped you regain perspective yet, read it once again. Take time to let it soak in deep.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...This is My body which is broken for you; do this in remembrance of Me.' 1 Corinthians 11:24 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Whatever your church calls the distribution of bread ‘n’ wine, it is an amazing piece of what makes up following Jesus. Not only did Jesus say to do it in ‘remembrance’ of Him, but we’re somehow also meeting Jesus in that act of eating ‘bread’ (or wafers) and drinking ‘wine’ (or juice). We’re suddenly face to face with Jesus. In fact, when He started this bread and wine meal off with His disciples, He was echoing an ancient ‘covenant’ ritual, where two people exchanged everything they had, including their names. They even mingled blood, before sharing bread &amp; wine together. When they did this, it was considered that the two of them were as one person. Deep stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Flash forward to today: that bread and wine you take? That’s a moment to remember what Jesus has done for you, to remember who He is (not was), to remember that He came after you on a rescue mission of love whilst you were still far off. But it’s more than that too. It’s your half of the covenant ritual. In taking bread &amp; wine (and asking the Holy Spirit to meet you in it), you’re becoming one with Jesus. Yep. The two of you are considered as one person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;You exchange what you have for what He has. Your mess actually becomes His. His righteousness actually becomes yours. Communion is, quite simply, amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Gen 13-16, Jn 13:18-30, Ps 114, Prov 31:1-5 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63504&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['When I consider Your Heavens, the work of Your fingers...' Psalm 8:3 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Take a sec to think about how big the place you live in is. Then, consider the whole bunch of communities/suburbs/towns/cities that make up your electorate. And how many electorates there are in your country. And how many countries on the face of the earth? ‘Kay, now zoom out. Our earth is floating amongst a whole lot of stars, and other planets. And that’s just the Milky Way, one of many galaxies. Bottom line: each one of us is a very small part of a very large universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Now, we aren’t trying to send you into some sort of existential crisis. In fact, it’s the opposite. Think of all of that as context to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;God. Knows. You.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Yes, we might feel absolutely tiny. We are in the context of this staggeringly huge universe, but God still sees us. And He loves what He sees. Romans 1:20 suggests that one of the reasons that God made the universe so, well, drop–dead stunning is for us. It says &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;‘…since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—His eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made…&lt;/em&gt;’ Everything that God has made, from the complexities of the human body, to the massive expanse of space, is one of the ways He shows Himself to us. In Psalm 8, David talks about how he can see God’s glory in the world around him. Go read it.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['The magicians said to Pharaoh, &quot;This is the finger of God.&quot;' Exodus 8:19 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The magicians of Egypt were able to duplicate some of the signs Moses gave Pharaoh from God with visual trickery and illusion. Pharaoh was probably entertained by Moses but not impressed. And so Moses would return to his court again and again, each sign greater than the previous. But before long, the signs couldn’t be reproduced by Pharaoh’s magic circle any more. By the time of the plague of gnats and mozzies, they were scratching their heads (as well as just about everywhere else.) ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;The finger of God!&lt;/em&gt;’ they cried out in fear. But it didn’t matter to Pharaoh. He insisted on saying ‘no’ to God. ‘No’ to a God who was trying to help him not reap the consequences of the child–killing spree his ancestors had undertaken eighty years previously.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes;&quot;&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;The last plague was imminent but still Pharaoh said ‘no’. Every firstborn boy died as a result of his hard heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The Passover story teaches us that God’s finger will not force us to obey but He will claim back what is rightfully His. He will allow the consequences of the past to catch up with us. Pharaoh was given many chances. He didn’t take them. It’s not a formula, but we can take on a lesson for us today: don’t ignore the will of God. The Psalmist wrote, ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Your way, O God, is in the sanctuary&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Psalm 77:13 NKJ) Then he added, ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Your way was in the sea... in the great waters&lt;/em&gt;…’ (Psalm 77:19 NKJ) The sanctuary—the safe place where we learn the easy way—or the storm—the rough place where we learn the hard way: what’s your choice today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Gen 20-23, Jn 14:1-14, Ps 118:10-18, Prov 31:10-13  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63506&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He gave him the two stone tablets...written by the finger of God.' Exodus 31:18 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Why not on paper? Or parchment? Or inscribed onto wood? Perhaps there was something symbolic about the Ten Commandments being written on stone. Stone is hard and uncompromising. Not easily shattered. Here were rules not to be broken or messed with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;As God’s finger etched words of life into the cold stone, a moral code to build up a society was being written. Even today our laws agree with these principles: don’t murder, don’t steal stuff, don’t lie. Most people today couldn’t tell you all Ten Commandments and yet their conscience would still agree with what Moses brought down from Sinai all those years ago. It’s as if the finger of God has written His laws and principles onto the hearts of men and women. Our conscience bears the trace of God’s values. When we choose to ignore our conscience, sooner or later there will be consequences. A diver can break through the surface of a lake with ease during summer. And yet in the winter freeze it is possible to ride a truck across stony frozen water. It’s like that with our conscience. When our hearts are soft to God, we obey. When we repeatedly disobey, our hearts become frozen hard. It’s best to practise obedience, otherwise God may need to turn up the heat to thaw out our hearts.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...Jesus stooped down and wrote on the ground with His finger...' John 8:6 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;What was Jesus writing in the ground that day? A wife had been caught in the bed linen of a lover. She was dragged by the hair into the street by religious leaders. What should they do with her? Throw sharp rocks at her until she passed into unconsciousness—that was the usual routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;But then somebody thought of Jesus: &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;What would that upside–down preacher make of this? Let’s bring her to Him.&lt;/em&gt; They couldn’t get their list of accusations out quick enough. They probably sounded like they were foaming at the mouth. But Jesus didn’t even bother to look them in the eye. He stooped low, writing with His finger in the dust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;It’s not made clear in the Bible exactly what He wrote. Perhaps He wrote ‘forgiveness’ or ‘grace’. Maybe He recalled a verse from one of the prophets. Some people think He wrote down the sins of the accusers. (A subtle dig at their hypocrisy! After all, it takes two to commit adultery and the lover hadn’t been publicly shamed, had he?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The passage doesn’t tell us. It only tells us that Jesus didn’t join in the condemnation. He reminded the crowd that they weren’t saints themselves. Bit by bit the crowd dispersed. The woman looked around and there was nobody left to accuse her. Neither did Jesus. Instead He offered the woman a new start. The same goes today. Cheating, lying, backstabbing—whatever mess you find yourself in, Jesus lifts you up from the dust to give you a new start.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'We count them blessed who endure...' James 5:11 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Today, the whole idea of ‘endurance’ is a bit Bear Grylls. But we’re pretty sure that, when James wrote ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;we count them blessed who endure&lt;/em&gt;,’ he probably wasn’t saying that making an igloo out of your own frozen sweat gets you more blessings from God. In fact, to Him, endurance is much more of an everyday thing. Let’s face it, it’s more than likely you’ll face something difficult at least once a day. Your ability to endure has everything to do with that. Whether they’re big or small problems, endurance is in how we deal with those difficulties. If you ever studied French, you might remember that ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;dur&lt;/em&gt;’ is used to describe something that’s rock–hard, something that stands firm. So, en–&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;dur&lt;/em&gt;–ance then… we reckon we could call that ‘standing firm in the face of difficulties’. And that’s a pretty Biblical model for living life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;In his letter to the Corinthians, Paul writes: ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Be alert, stand firm in the faith, be brave, be strong&lt;/em&gt;.’ (1 Corinthians 16:13 GNT) That is how we do what James is talking about. It’s all too easy to start doubting God and His plans when things are difficult. It’s all too easy to start finding not–quite–so–Godly ways to make ourselves feel better, but that’s not endurance. The only really really good way to pull through is to ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;stand firm in the faith&lt;/em&gt;’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['You will be proved right in what You say.' Romans 3:4 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Whatever God says is absolutely true. And when He puts together a plan, He sees it through. Romans 3:4 quotes one of David’s psalms (Psalm 51:4, to be exact), where he’s crying out to God because he knows he’s messed up—big time. (Check out 2 Samuel 11 and 12 for the whole story. That’s a lot of Bible in this first paragraph, but it’s all the same story).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;After being told what the consequences of his sin are going to be, David tells God, ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;You will be proved right in what You say&lt;/em&gt;.’ He knew that God always delivers on whatever He says. And he was right; all that the prophet explained to David came to pass. Now, because of the way that David had acted, the consequences turned out a lot less than great. Sometimes, we act in ways that leave us picking up the pieces of what we’ve done. But here’s the thing: when David called on God, he wasn’t let down. God got him through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Now, there is a flip side. And a pretty great one at that. Imagine how God, the God who loves you immensely, definitely does rejoice in seeing through the good things that He promises. When He lays out His plans for your life, the minute that you say ‘yes’ to Him and to those plans, He starts to make them happen. And He absolutely loves doing so. Whatever He has said about you, pursue it. Because what God says, goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Gen 28:1-30:24, Jn 15:5-17, Ps 14, Prov 31:22-24 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63511&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I am watching to see that My Word is fulfilled.' Jeremiah 1:12 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;God told Jeremiah that He was going to use him as a prophet. Jeremiah wasn’t convinced he was cut out for the role and was pretty quick to tell God he wasn’t up for it. He didn’t think he had the skills. But God knew what He was doing (He tends to…) He gave Jeremiah the supernatural ability to do exactly what He had planned for him. And Jeremiah did it (not without difficulties along the way, but he went and he did it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;And that’s the power of God’s words. When He speaks them over us, He’s going to make sure that we’re ready for whatever–it–is He’s called us to do. And that’s why it generally works pretty well when we live in the plans that God has for us. That’s why it’s so good to spend so much time going: ‘Uhhhh, Lord… what do I do?’ He knows what you’re made for. He’s the one who made you for it in the first place. His plans for you fit nobody but you. If the plan isn’t His, there’s not too much chance that you’re going to be fully equipped for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Bottom line... If you’re wondering what to do next, try as a starter: ‘Help? Jesus, please!’&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes;&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Then go for what you think is right, and keep checking it. We may not get to see His original blueprints, so we wouldn’t suggest checking over your shoulder anxiously for God’s neon sign every day of your life. However, if you’re running your plans past the Planner, He’ll steer you right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Gen 30:25-31:55, Jn 15:18-27, Ps 65, Prov 31:25-27 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63512&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...In all things at all times, having all that you need...' 2 Corinthians 9:8 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;So, the past two days have been a bit inwardly focussed, all about what God’s saying over your life. That’s not a bad thing, at all. But what about when we fold that out? What are we, as Christians, supposed to do about God’s plans for other people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Well, in true 2 Corinthians 9 spirit, we think it’s a really good idea to get alongside anyone who is working towards fulfilling something that God’s said about them. If we’re generous with our prayers, our encouragement, and whatever else we can be generous with, the world around us will start to look a lot more like God wants it to. Paul goes on to say that we ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;will be enriched in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion and through us your generosity will result in thanksgiving to God&lt;/em&gt;.’ (2 Corinthians 9:11 NIV) You will definitely have something that can help someone else—God made us that way. We weren’t given our gifts, skills, or money for ourselves, but to serve others. If we keep these things for us, we’re wasting their potential to show off God in our lives. Be faithful in the small things, so God will trust you with the larger ones.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...He did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise...' Romans 4:20 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;So, if we’re completely clear on what God’s saying to us, raring to follow it, and have a bunch of people supporting us in it, it’s going to be like a walk in the park. Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Well… ummmm… maybe not always. The truth is, sometimes a part of the plan is difficulty. See, God can make anything happen, whichever way He wants to. Your Bible is full of examples. But because of the not–all–powerful human perspective that we have, some stuff looks downright impossible. In reality, we can be following God’s plans as well as is humanly possible, but it may still feel like nothing’s happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Abraham must have certainly felt like God had promised Him something impossible, at times. He was mooching up towards 100 years of age and still the son God had promised hadn’t been born. Kind of laughable to think it would happen at that point. But Abraham never (entirely) let those feelings come between him and God’s plan. For us, that’s often easier said than done. But it’s all about turning back to God every time His plan seems uncertain. If that happens, re–visit His original promise and ask Him to keep your faith clear. Isaiah 55:11 NLT is where God says, ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;It is the same with My Word. I send it out, and it always produces fruit. It will accomplish all I want it to, and it will prosper everywhere I send it&lt;/em&gt;.’ Keep hold of that. Whatever God has promised you will happen. No matter how unlikely it looks. It’s coming.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power.' Rev 4:11 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Jesus. The Name above all names. It’s a phrase you might have heard often enough, but what’s it really mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Well, there is power in a name. And the name of Jesus of Nazareth, son of God, Saviour of the world is the name that has the power to save us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Paul writes that ‘…&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;there is… one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ&lt;/em&gt;.’ (1 Timothy 2:5 NKJ) Jesus is the only One who is able to bridge the gap between us and God. He chose to die the brutal death that WE deserve, which broke open the gates to allow us to live in His power. When we say ‘in Jesus’ name’, we’re not just saying a nice little Christian phrase to show we’re done praying. We’re saying that we’re taking hold of the Name that carries the power of the most precious Man, and His most precious action (the death that beat Death for good).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Ok, so it might sound like the nineteenth century if we tell you to ‘meditate upon the name of Jesus.’ But… ummm… we’re still going to. Do it. Try to focus your mind and your heart on Jesus (the very real, living, breathing, death–beating person Jesus). Spend a while quietly in prayer, thinking about the power of His name.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Let us hold tightly without wavering to the hope...' Hebrews 10:23 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The history of humanity’s relationship with God revolves around hope. Before Jesus came to earth, God’s people lived in hope of His arrival—as promised. When He went back to Heaven, His followers waited in hope of the arrival of the Holy Spirit—as promised. Now, we live in the hope of Jesus coming back—as promised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;And, because we have God, hoping is not a matter of crossing our fingers and chancing it. True hope is confidence. God has always had a big plan for humanity; He’s known what to do right from the beginning (Revelation 13:8 shows that Jesus was ready to save us for, well, forever). That’s right. God’s got it sorted. Even when things look like they’re going horribly, horribly wrong, there is hope. There is a plan. That doesn’t mean that it’s not ok to feel a bit ragged and tossed–around sometimes. But it does mean we can’t ever lose sight of our hope in God. That’s what anchors our soul, and simultaneously allows it to have the freedom to rest in God it longs for. There’s a forgotten word that we here at W4U HQ think should be brought back into fashion. It’s ‘apricity’: &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;warmth of the sun in cold times&lt;/em&gt;. Godly apricity is what our hope in Jesus does for our souls in the hard times of our lives. Think of it like warmth of the Son in cold times.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...If they keep quiet, the stones will cry out.' Luke 19:40 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;‘Worship was rocking this morning!’ Hrmm. Ever cringed when someone’s said that? The verse above puts it in a different light. Rocks worshipping. And you might also have also sung about trees clapping their hands, or mountains bowing down. What does it all mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;All of creation is designed to show how worthy God is of praise. Because it demonstrates how much worth God deserves; it ‘worships’ (shows ‘worth’–ship of) Him. Just by existing—and doing what it’s supposed to do as a rock or a tree or a whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;And as God’s followers, we should follow suit. Just by existing as people of God, we worship God. ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Let my prayer be set before You as incense, the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Psalm 141:2 NKJ) It’s pretty much what you were made for: worshipping God is core to being part of God’s creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;One more story. At one point in history, the Philistines had taken the Ark of the Covenant from God’s people. The Ark symbolised the presence of God for His people back then. When they lost that, they lost everything. Without inviting God’s presence to be with you and fill you up, worship becomes dry. And probably half–hearted. Now, we don’t have time for the full story. But what happened when they got the Ark of the Covenant back? ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;David and all the Israelites were celebrating with all their might before God, with songs and with harps, lyres, timbrels, cymbals and trumpets&lt;/em&gt;.’ (1 Chronicles 13:8 NIV) So, ask God to gift you with His presence next time you’re about to start singing at church (or whenever you do worship).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Keith Hudson is a preacher who made waves on the internet, speaking about a Katy Perry concert. He said ‘…there were twenty thousand people... they were going at it. It almost looked like a church… I stood there and wept and kept on weeping and weeping… they’re loving and worshipping the wrong thing.’ It’s a fairly obvious thing to say until you learn that Keith Hudson is Katy Perry’s dad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Yeah, the rant sounds a little old–fashioned. But here’s something we can take away: it’s sad we can get so excited about things that have no eternal value. As a Christian we have to be wise with what we watch and listen to. ‘...&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;so that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and please Him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Colossians 1:10 NIV) The thrills and lights of stadium tours and promo videos can cut in on our search for the electrifying presence of God—something we’re designed for, something we’re supposed to be satisfied by. They may give us an easy high—but it’s a second best one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;God lived happy as a community of Father, Son and Spirit long before anyone strummed ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Bless the Lord oh my soul&lt;/em&gt;.’ And yet He is pleased when we sing and praise Him and, on top of that, it cheers us up. We need to worship far more than God needs to hear it. Have a go at adding some more worship songs to your music mix this week and work at keeping His praise always on your lips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  SoulFood: Gen 42-43, Jn 18:19-40, Ps 148:1-6, Ecc 5:1-3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63518&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Your attitude should be the same as that of Jesus Christ.' Philippians 2:5 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;We’re regularly told that status matters—that the best thing you can be in this world is a celebrity. The fame. The wealth. The fans. The award ceremonies celebrating your existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;What is it that makes us hanker after respect and power? Fame is like the shiny fruit hanging in Eden. We’d all love a bite but we’re half–sure we’ve been warned against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Ok, well what about spending a day walking like Mother Teresa? She set up schools for street children, held the dying in her arms, and cared for the disabled. Francis of Assisi traded his vast family wealth in order to live with outcasts and lepers and the homeless. This is the kind of fame that delights Heaven. This is the fame that Jesus is known for. Paul writes: ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;You must have the same attitude that… Jesus had. Though He was God, He did not think of equality with God as something to cling to. Instead, He gave up His divine privileges… took the… position of a slave… humbled Himself in obedience to God and died a criminal’s death on the cross. Therefore, God elevated Him to the place of highest honour and gave Him the name above all other names&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Philippians 2:5–9 NLT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Being a celebrity means we expect others to serve us; being a Christ follower means we are called to serve others. Start to practise serving others this week. It’s as easy as popping on the kettle for gran or washing the car for a neighbour. Try it!&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['I desire to do Your will, my God.' Psalm 40:8 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Imagine if Jesus came in the twenty–first century and not the first: He could have been a celebrity chef with the way He turned a couple of loaves and fish into a feast. Or got a TV series with the way He could heal the sick and raise the dead. But, despite having all of time to choose from, He came 2000 years ago. He’s obviously more interested in people than in making a name for Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Jesus doesn’t just think it is a good idea to serve, He expects it: ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;When you have done all things which you are commanded, say, “We are unprofitable servants. We have done what was our duty to do.”&lt;/em&gt;’ (Luke 17:10 NKJ) ‘Our duty’—key words. It isn’t always easy to decide every day to keep in God’s will. But as we stop dragging our feet to follow God, the obedience will pay off. Being ready to say ‘yes’ to that nudge He’ll gives us when it’s time to avoid that temptation/ speak to that person/ read the Bible/ whatever He wants, it gets easier. Jesus showed us what this looks like: ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;For even the Son of Man did not come to be served. But to serve and give His life as a ransom for many&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Mark 10:45 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;So, a challenge. There’s real joy in serving God, but you’ll need to put the willpower in. Up for it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;In your prayer time, have a look at your plan for today, and jot down the opportunities to serve someone in it. Ask Jesus to open some up, and step up to them.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...I do not seek My own will, but the will of the Father.' John 5:30 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Can God count on you? Can other people? Are you always reliable, kinda reliable (when it suits you) or mostly unreliable? The Bible describes Jesus like this: ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Having loved His own…He loved them unto the end.&lt;/em&gt;’ (John 13:1 KJV) Tick one for other people being able to count on Him. And when it came to God, He could say, ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;I do not seek My own will but the will of the Father who sent Me&lt;/em&gt;.’ (John 5:30 NKJV) Tick two for God being able to count on Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;When you make a commitment, do you keep it? Do you quit on a whim, or break your word because you get a better offer? Do you let people down? ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;In Damascus there was a disciple named Ananias. The Lord called him in a vision, “Ananias!” “Yes, Lord,” he answered&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Acts 9:10 NIV) God knew where to find Ananias. Does He know where to find you? And when He calls you, are you ready to stand up and be counted? Or is it: ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;I hear you, God, but what You’re asking is inconvenient right now. Would You mind asking again when my circumstances are better?&lt;/em&gt;’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Your faithfulness shouldn’t depend on convenience or affordability. It should depend only on your commitment to Christ. Remember the US Marine Corps motto, ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Semper Fidelis&lt;/em&gt;’, the Latin for ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Always Faithful&lt;/em&gt;’. It’s a good motto for a disciple of Christ too.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...A hot-tempered person commits all kinds of sin.' Proverbs 29:22 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;In Genesis 4:3–7, we read that Cain was jealous that his brother’s gift was accepted and his wasn’t. He had let resentment build up. He hadn’t found a way of dealing with his forceful emotions, and his feelings had swayed his thinking. When he murdered his brother, a timeless truth rang out, &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;‘…A hot–tempered person commits all kinds of sin.&lt;/em&gt;’ (Proverbs 29:22 NLT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Anger can be Godly when used to move us to righteous action. We are right to feel angry about human trafficking, for instance. When we see injustice, it can be a Godly reaction to want to say something and make a difference. But often anger is destructive leading to terrible consequences. Jesus said that when you let anger build up against someone in your heart, you’re already making a big mistake (Matthew 5:21–22). Anger can be a seriously damaging thing. Controlling it and asking God to keep it in check is a huge deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;So, there’s a right way and a wrong way to be ‘angry’. One of the most helpful passages is: ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;In your anger do not sin. Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry, and do not give the devil a foothold&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Ephesians 4:26–27 NIV) When you can feel something stirring up within you, take a deep breath first and ask—is this going to create more pain, rather than lead to healing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Analyse your own anger: is it righteous or destructive? How are you going to deal with it? Begin by talking to God about it.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Saul looked at David with suspicion from that day on.' 1 Samuel 18:9 NAS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;When you look through the lens of misguided anger, what you choose to focus on tends to end up being all you actually see. Being blind to reality is dangerous, because it causes you to go to extremes. At one point David was a young shepherd, who played the harp. He played for Saul (the fourth, the fifth; the minor fall, the major lift...), and kept him calm. Yet when it was clear that God had chosen David to take lead the nation, starting with the defeat of a giant named Goliath, Saul got bitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The people sang, ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands&lt;/em&gt;.’ (1 Samuel 18:7 NIV) He saw David as a threat to his throne. &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Don’t they realise this boy was nothing until I took him in&lt;/em&gt;, Saul thought. &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Who was it that saw him promoted to the highest ranks? Me! What next—my throne? Is that what he wants? To be king?&lt;/em&gt; And from that day on Saul kept a jealous eye on David; an angry fire burned in his veins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;If you read the story of this pair’s relationship, one thing becomes clear—David is one of the best friends that Saul could ever have had. Letting anger manipulate you, even in subtle ways, is always dangerous. Don’t let it happen. Think about it: what are the best ways to avoid envy taking over?&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry.' James 1:19 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Let’s get to the root of this anger biz:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;It’s pretty clear that charging angrily into a situation doesn’t get us anywhere. And God’s not keen on us doing that either. The thing is, there are much, much better (and God–approved) ways to deal with those smaaaaaaaash moments. We know, in some situations it’s impossible to not feel a flash of rage—we can’t exactly choose what to feel. BUT, what is our choice, is what we do with that feeling. Here’s our options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;(1) &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Keep it in&lt;/em&gt;. Don’t say anything while we let that anger stay with us for the rest of the day/ week/ century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;(2) &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Act in the heat of the moment and mood&lt;/em&gt;. Let the objects of our anger know exactly what we think of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;(3) &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Have a conversation&lt;/em&gt;. Calmly. Try to understand whatever–it–is–that–made–your–blood–boil, and go from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Now, only one of those options seems to make sense to us. Care to take a guess? Yup. We’d recommend facing the thing that bugs you, with as much grace and God–given understanding as you can pray for. Proverbs 15:1 NIV says, ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger&lt;/em&gt;.’ Gentleness may not seem like the easiest, or most impressive, response to an enraging situation. But it’s the right one. Next time you feel like giving someone a piece of your mind, stop. Take seven breaths. Ask the person: ‘To help me understand, what did you mean by…’ and use their answer as the start of a dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...The word of the Lord came to Elijah...saying... &quot;I will send rain on the earth.&quot;' 1 Kings 18:1 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;For three years all people talked about was the drought God had told Elijah to announce. Then God gave him a weather update: everyone should get ready for storm season. We’ve got to be ready for God’s updates too—listening in so we’ll be ready for what life throws at us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;God is more than willing to tell you when to save and when to spend, when to buy and when to sell, when to talk and when to be silent. ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, “This is the way, walk in it.”&lt;/em&gt;’ (Isaiah 30:21 NKJV) But, for many of us, Satan’s so busy whispering in our ears, the voice of God is drowned out. Satan’s got some special lines he’s perfected: ‘You’re a loser. You’re ugly. You’re rubbish. Nobody loves you.’ Like you’d ever hear that from God! Not a chance. He’s on your side and only waits your invitation to fight for you. Knowing He would soon be crucified, Jesus prayed, ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;“Father, glorify Your name.” Then a voice came from Heaven, saying, ‘I have both glorified it and will glorify it again.” Therefore the people who stood by and heard it said that it had thundered…&lt;/em&gt;’ (John 12:28-29 NKJ) Isn’t it amazing? Some can hear the voice of God, while others hear only noise. What are you hearing? Who are you listening to? The voice of God or the devil’s noise?&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes;&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Make a choice to tune out Satan and tune into God.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['It will produce thorns... for you.' Genesis 3:18 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;In Genesis 3, Adam and Eve made a choice, and because of that choice came consequences.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes;&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;After that, everything changes. Like everything. The whole world. The link between God and humans was no longer the same. People got locked into their own self–and–others–destructive choices. Existence became… well, thorny. Go back to Genesis 3 and check out verse 18. There. Those thorns mentioned represent all of the consequences of humanity’s choices—sin, separation and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Now, read Matthew 27:31 about the crown of thorns placed on Jesus’ head by the Roman soldiers: ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;When they had twisted a crown of thorns, they put it on His head…&lt;/em&gt;’ Just before He gave His life to free us all, Jesus took those thorns—sin, separation and death—upon Himself, and wore them literally as a crown. He took all of the consequences meant for us, and experienced the death that goes with them. And, by doing that, He became our bridge back to God. By wearing those thorns, He beat them. Jesus beat sin; He beat separation; He beat death. Because of Him, we can choose to live a life full of God and grace. Then, because of Him, we can spend the rest of forever with that same God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Take a few minutes to really think over what Jesus did. It’s the absolute centre of the Christian faith. Then, when you’ve done that, write a ‘thank you’ note to Jesus. Stick it up somewhere prominent to remind you regularly of what He did in dying for you.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['It will produce thorns... for you.' Genesis 3:18 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Yesterday, we thought about how Heaven’s answer to a thorny existence is a thorn–crowned Saviour. Now, there’s another part to that story. There is, shall we say, another set of thorns. After Jesus wore that crown and beat the consequences of sin, God decided to use thorns for His (and our) good. Being a Christian doesn’t mean that we get to entirely avoid all difficult stuff. It means we know Who we turn to when the difficult stuff happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Look at 2 Corinthians 12:7–10. Paul mentions ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;a thorn in the flesh&lt;/em&gt;’—something that really made life hard for him. Something that was trying to get in the way of his relationship with God. We all have those thorns. And God allows them for one reason: that we use them as inspiration to look to Him. We can’t beat thorns in our own strength. The only thing to do is to turn to God and ask Him for help. He may not remove them straight away, but He’ll certainly strengthen your relationship with Him while you’re dealing with them. And look back at yesterday’s reading—Jesus who bled from the thorn of death in our place. The ‘thorns’ of this life don’t last for eternity; they help prepare you for it. As long as you’re &lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;truly striving for the life of love that God asks for, He’ll make ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;all things work together for good&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Romans 8:28 NKJ) So, chat to some wiser/older Christians you really trust about your own ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;thorn in the flesh&lt;/em&gt;’. Get them to pray with you, asking for God’s strength in dealing with your personal thorns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Job 8-10, Lk 1:39-56, Ps 57, Ecc 7:19-22&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63528&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['They...compare themselves with themselves.' 2 Corinthians 10:12 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Remember that kid in your nursery class, you know, the one with cool light–up trainers that made your regular off–white sneakers feel really rubbish? No?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Just like that, chances are, in a few years you won’t remember measuring yourself against someone else’s standards. So why bother now? You might want what those around you seem to have, but honestly, you’ll have forgotten about it not too far down the track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;And, as for now, God gives you exactly what you need. Let’s say that again. God gives you exactly what you need. So, the guy next to you has something that looks really flashy right now (especially when they stamp their feet?) That’s a part of their plan. God’s taking care of your plan, and He’s asking you to work with Him to be all that you are made to be. And, believe it or not, He’ll give you the right tools to get there (He’s amazing like that!) Whatever you don’t have is as much a part of the plan as what you do have. And yes, that can be horribly, horribly disappointing sometimes. Especially when everyone else seems to have everything sorted. But, not getting those grades/that job/the girl may have been the first step towards a bigger and better plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Pray for God’s view of your situation, and ask for His help in seeing it His way. Cross out (with a pen, or, if you’re reading this on a screen, with your fingers…) the first NO COMPARE in the title when you’ve prayed it through. Repeat for the other two.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['So whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin.' James 4:17 ESV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Procrastination—we all do it, right? Like when you should be studying but instead you’re scrolling through Facebook, watching cute cat videos or doing anything BUT what you should be doing...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Following God can sometimes, very unfortunately, follow that routine. Have a think, are there certain aspects of the Christian life too difficult to start attempting? Or maybe something God’s been prompting you to do that just feels too big? You already know that the answer isn’t in ignoring those things. We don’t really need to tell you that. But we will anyway. The answer really isn’t in ignoring what needs to be done and doing something else instead. Procrastination gets you nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;James 4:13–17 talks about how we can’t really know about the future (aside from what God has already revealed to us in His Word). Then, it says: ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;So whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin&lt;/em&gt;.’ Essentially, James is saying ‘get your act into gear and do what you know is right.’ Is there something that God wants to you to do, that you’ve been putting off or ignoring? Is there a part of the Christian life that you’ve never really wanted to adopt, even though you know you should? Well then, here’s some practical advice for today: Do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Job 15-17, Lk 1:67-80, Ps 12, Ecc 9:17-18&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=63530&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Listen to advice...and...you will be wise...' Proverbs 19:20 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Paul took a young guy named Timothy under his wing. They had such a strong mentor/mentee relationship Paul called him his ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;true son in the faith&lt;/em&gt;.’ (1 Timothy 1:2 GNT) The pair ended up travelling around, helping to grow, and look after, churches. They even ended up in prison for their Godly work together on more than one occasion. Paul helped Timothy become the person that God wanted him to be, and he could only do that because Timothy knew how to take advice seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;It’s so, so important to be able to learn from others. No matter how much you know, you still have something to learn. André Agassi was a world-class tennis player whose coach wasn’t nearly as good as him on the court. But when asked, André stated, ‘Tennis requires subtle adjustments crucial to winning and my coach... is the best... The older I get, the more valuable he becomes.’ Even consistent winners need help to improve!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Chances are, there’s someone in your church who could teach you a lot—someone to go back to with questions and problems and ideas and prayer requests and, well, everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;It can sometimes feel a bit weird talking about faith with someone outside of our group of mates. Especially when the person seems to be one of those have–it–all–together people. But that’s exactly the sort of person who might just make a great mentor. It’s worth being brave. Go on. Ask for advice.&lt;/p&gt;

<title><![CDATA[GONE FISHING]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[gone-fishing]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['I will make you fishers of men.' Matthew 4:19 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;There were days Simon dreamt of packing it in. Catching fish wasn’t easy work. Days could be too hot for fishing; nights could be too cold. Some mornings it lashed down and he didn’t feel much like getting into a boat. Other days the waters were just freezing. And now, here was Jesus promising a lifetime of ‘fishing’ for men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Perhaps Simon hoped it would be easier. Yet he’d soon realise there would be easy and tough days with people, too. There would be long sermons and great healing meetings, and still nobody would bite. There would be days when trouble just lashed down. Sometimes he just wouldn’t feel like fishing for men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;But if the fishing business had taught him anything, it was to get out to sea. To be a do–er. The only way to scoop up a successful catch was to get the wind in his hair, the sea–breeze in his lungs and get on with the backbreaking work of hauling up nets. Following Jesus would be pretty similar. Spending most of his life sitting down, not reaching anyone, wasn’t for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;When it comes to walking out our faith, it’s sometimes best just get out there fishing in your school/college/workplace. Church is meant to help us in this, but not hide us from it. Sometimes, if we aren’t serving others, we start serving ourselves. If we aren’t helping the hurting, we can end up hurting the helping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

<title><![CDATA[NATIVITY WINDOW--JOSEPH]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[nativity-window-joseph]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Joseph, her fiancé, was a good man...' Matthew 1:19 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Mary rightly gets a lot of attention over Christmas. Fair enough. She’s a hero of the faith. But Joseph’s part in the Christmas story is often seen as a bit of a cameo appearance. After all, he isn’t the real father, right? But there’s a reason that God sent an angel to him, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The culture at the time called for Joseph to divorce Mary as soon as he found out she was pregnant. In fact, it is likely that some members of his community would have been out for her blood—a normal punishment for suspected adultery was stoning. But Joseph was faithful to God against culture pressure. He had the courage to stand up against these voices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Middle East expert Kenneth Bailey points out: ‘In the Middle East, men usually represent their families in any official or legal matters. Why did Joseph take Mary with him to Bethlehem for the registration? The easiest explanation is that he was unsure what might happen to her if he left her in Nazareth without his presence to protect her.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Joseph wasn’t the hero of the Christmas story. But without his courage and support there may have been no story to tell. Take a moment to think about the ‘minor characters’ in your life—the ones you rarely thank for their quiet, faithful (maybe even courageous) contribution to who you are today. Take the opportunity of writing to them this Christmas to show your gratitude.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...A tree is known by its fruit.' Matthew 12:33 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;There’s an old saying, ‘If you were accused of being a Christian, would anyone find enough evidence to convict you?’ Hmm. What evidence would they find? Maybe they’d find your Spotify playlist full of the best of &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Hillsong&lt;/em&gt;. A ‘WWJD’ bracelet tucked away in your drawer. Maybe an old Easterfest programme knocking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Ok for a start, but what about the deeper stuff? Would they find you praying when the door is locked? Or volunteering down the old folks’ home (or Foodbank) without being asked? Or slipping an extra tenner in the collection plate when nobody is looking? Would they find you on Bible Gateway more often than Facebook? Meditating more than gaming? Encouraging as opposed to backbiting? Could they trust you, respect you, admire your honesty? Would you be found moping or inspired? Lustful or loving? Jesus didn’t say, ‘A Christian is known by the size of his fish bumper–sticker.’ No, He said, ‘…&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;a tree is recognised by its fruit&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Matthew 12:33 NIV) ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;You…must be an example…by doing good works of every kind. Let everything you do reflect the integrity and seriousness of your teaching.&lt;/em&gt;’ (Titus 2:7 NLT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;God’s done everything needed to open up your relationship with Him. You can’t ‘work‘ it into perfection. But—&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;relationship&lt;/em&gt;—yeah? Now He’s made it available, have all of the areas of your life got involved in that relationship? How do you fare with these challenges? Think your relationship needs more commitment? Pray. Prayer is always the fuel for Godly character. Ask God for more good evidence in your life.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...be clear minded and self-controlled...' 1 Peter 4:7 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we said yesterday, becoming an adult can be a tricky process. But no matter how bewildering it is, it does end. You'll grow to feel more comfortable in your maturity, and once the transitioning is over you'll move out of that stuck place into having a stable identity as an adult. Until then, though, it could make things a whole lot clearer if you find someone who can give you pointers for the problematic things. Yep, that may mean taking advice from your mum, dad or someone else like that. Believe it or not, you can never be too old for advice. The Bible says '...you younger people, submit yourselves to your elders...' (1 Peter 5:5-7 NKJ) You know why it says that? Because they already know (some of) the answers. They won't stress about the questions. Standing in the middle of it, your own life can become a bit of a blur. Out of focus, like a picture up too close. Chatting to someone can pull it back into perspective, enabling you to '...be clear minded...' like God intends. From a zoomed out view, you can make clear-headed decisions. So go on. Stick your hands above your head and ask for help. Forget becoming 'cool' by lowering your standards; that's a no-win alternative. Nothing is as 'uncool' as trying to be 'cool'! Be yourself, maintain Biblical standards and follow in Jesus' footsteps.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...Encourage and help each other...' 1 Thessalonians 5:11 CEV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all spend far too much time comparing ourselves to others, wishing we had their looks/skills/friends/family/life (circle as appropriate). And we all need to stop, right now. Honestly, it's damaging. That person whose physique you wish was yours? That person whose job or grades you wish you had? Even that person whose faith you wish you could muster? Yeah, they probably don't see themselves that rosily. In fact, they wish they had your beautiful smile (they think that wonky tooth is cute). You're you, and you're never going to be anyone else. It's only going to discourage you wishing that you could be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;...God created man in His own image...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;(Genesis 1:27 NIV) You've heard it a million times, but really think about it. God made you to be a reflection of Him, and He's incredible. (You know what that means. Yup, you = incredible. Ok, maybe not at this very moment and to the same extent but yes, a reflection of His amazing character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more time you spend trying to take on His ways, the more you'll become the person He made you to be. The nearer you draw to God, the more like Him you'll become. And, being 'made in His image', the more like Him we are, the more truly we are our true selves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get close to God and you'll start mirroring his qualities in your own life. The Bible says,&lt;i&gt; &quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Love... protects... trusts... hopes... perseveres.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; (1 Corinthians 13:4;7 NIV) Instead of making comparisons, ask God to help you see yourself and others with the sort of love He does.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...Get ready to cross the Jordan River into the land I am about to give...' Joshua 1:2 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;God said this to Joshua: 'Moses my servant is dead ...get ready to cross the Jordan River into the land I am about to give [you]...I will give you every place where you set your foot, as I promised Moses... you will lead these people to inherit the land I swore to their forefathers to give them.' (Joshua 1: 2-6 NIV) The lead-up to this point was a rough ride for Joshua. Previously, he spent a load of time serving Moses, and did it graciously and attentively. That's totally admirable, seeing as they spent all that time wandering around a scorching desert with a bunch of guys who complained about everything (check the Old Testament, the people of Israel could be a right moany lot). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would've been easy for Joshua to become an impatient rebel along with them, but he didn't. He didn't get pushy or irritated. He used that time as a preparation. Every day in the desert prepared him for the mahooooosive task of leading Israel into the Promised Land. God never ever wastes experience. Every single thing you've been through, including all the stuff that makes zero sense right now, is preparation for what God's got in store. At the end of his life Joshua was able to say to the Israelites: 'Now I am about to go the way of all the earth. You know with all your heart and soul that not one of all the good promises the Lord your God gave you has failed. Every promise has been fulfilled...' (Joshua 23:14 NIV) So prepare yourself so the God who came through for Joshua can come through for you.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['I will give you every place where you set your foot, as I promised...' Joshua 1:3 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When God says 'I promise', you can be sure it's going to happen. However, don't think that means He's going to throw it at you gift-wrapped, while you sit twiddling your thumbs kinda-sorta-maybe hoping He might just come through for you. Joshua got given 'every place where [he] set [his] foot...' (Joshua 1:3 NIV), which means he had to step out in faith before God's promise became reality (Literally. He physically had to step out. One foot in front of the other. Yeah.) That same principle stands for you. When God makes you a promise, you've got to claim it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You've got to make that choice to accept it as fact. It's already yours if you're willing to own it. But that doesn't mean it's always easy to see those promises through. Joshua had to get through 31 kings, 7 nations and giants (tall-type guys built like fridges whose heads would knock against the light fittings you'd need an extension ladder to reach. &lt;em&gt;Gulp&lt;/em&gt;.) All to get Israel to the land God had promised to them. You'll face scary challenges on your way to God's promises too. But take heart, brave warrior, 'The Lord... is the One who goes ahead of you. He will be with you.' (Deuteronomy 31:8 NAS)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His promise is already fulfilled; you've just got to be daring enough to act on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Tim 1-3, Lk 8:40-56, Ps 1, Prov 19: 9-11&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62135&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The Lord is the stronghold of my life - of whom shall I be afraid?' Psalm 27:1 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stronghold. Strange word, we know. But when you really get into it, it makes a lot of sense. 'Strong'... 'hold'... someone or something that holds you safely and with strength. God's definitely the one to do that. When your life is all wrapped up in Him, anything coming at you has got to get through Him before it can touch you. Victor Hugo, the old French guy who wrote &lt;em&gt;Les Mis&lt;/em&gt;é&lt;em&gt;rables&lt;/em&gt; (yep, it was a novel to start with, but, nope, the novel doesn't have songs) wrote something cool about God. It was this: 'Have courage for the great sorrows of life, and patience for the small ones. And when you have laboriously accomplished your daily task, go to sleep in peace. God is awake.' Think about it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God doesn't sleep. Ever. He literally always has your back. Joshua faced a truckload of enemies (that includes those giants, so probably several truckloads of enemies, actually) whilst working towards God's promise of land for Israel. He still got there fine. God promised him 'I will never leave you nor forsake you' (Joshua 21:43-45 NIV), and that's why Joshua couldn't lose. While you're out fighting for God's promises, He'll fight for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is absolutely no one and absolutely nothing that is so big God can't handle it for you. If you let Him be the stronghold of your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Tim 4-6, Lk 9:1-17, Ps 42:1-5, Prov 19:12-14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62137&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...[God]... will not... leave you without support...' Hebrews 13:5 AMP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we looked at Psalm 27:1 NIV which says, '...The Lord is the stronghold of my life - of whom shall I be afraid?' God is your protector, provider and Saviour whether you're single or not. Yeah, it always seems that everyone around you has found that special someone just when you most need a friend. But Paul says this: 'Be satisfied with your present circumstances... God...will not...leave you without support.' Sure it's hard to believe He knows best even when it hurts to be so unwanted. But, long before we feel so lonely it seems unbearable, we should cry out to Jesus. He's 'close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.' (Psalm 34:18 NIV) The risk we run in loneliness is that we start to wonder what's wrong with us. We try to become someone else in the hope of attracting the right person. Then we start asking a whole parade of fearful questions: Am I good-looking enough? Charming and talkative enough? Or too talkative? God made us who we are and, if He wants to include some years of singleness along the way, it's not because He doesn't care about us. On the contrary, He will never leave us without support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Mt 5:10, 1 Th 2:13-3:5, 1 Cor 4:11-13, Rev 6:9-11&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62138&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Love never fails...' 1 Corinthians 13:8 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forming a negative opinion based on appearance takes less than seven seconds (or so science says). That means, in less time than you can read this paragraph (maybe even this sentence), you can meet someone and decide you don't like them. But John writes: '...Anyone who does not love his brother... cannot love God...' (1 John 4:20 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means that if you go around dismissing people, you 'cannot love God'. That is tough. Crazy tough. People can be really difficult to love. You try so hard to be nice and they're just... &lt;em&gt;ugh&lt;/em&gt;. Reality check. There are times when you're hard to love, too. God sees you when you do those really rubbish things. The things that, if anyone else did them, would make you facepalm and sigh. Yet God still loves you as fiercely as a mother lion loves her cubs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually more so. He loves you enough to give up His life for you, and He's raring to share that ability to forgive and love. If you ask Him, He'll teach you how to love other people as fiercely as He does. And if you unleash that kind of love on the world, something incredible is going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here's how to do it practically: you know that annoying person, the one you pretend not to see when you pass by them. Pray that God will do good things for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And don't stop there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next time you see that person, say hello, ask them how they are, and really listen to the answer. Maybe even have a whole conversation. You might surprise yourself when you discover that love works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Zeph 1-3, Lk 9:18-33, Ps 42:6-11, Prov 19:15-17&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=62139&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'...The Lord does not look at the things man looks at...' 1 Samuel 16:7 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God had David earmarked for King. However, his own family didn't see any royal potential. A prophet called Samuel came to his family home, looking for the guy who was to be King. David's dad showed Samuel the eldest son, Eliab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eliab looked pretty impressive - he was a general in the army. Samuel took one look at Eliab and thought, 'Surely the Lord's anointed stands here...' But the Lord said to Samuel, &quot;Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. The Lord does not look at the things man looks at. Man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.&quot;' (1 Samuel 16: 6-7 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would've been easy for David to give up and settle into the role of musically-talented little brother. But he didn't. He grew into God's call for him - to be a king - and outran the expectations of his family. He went on to do astounding things for God. It can be tough when the people around you tie you up with their expectations. But if you ask God to show you His opinion, you'll have the power to shake off those expectations. You'll see you were made by the Master of all craft to be a prized and powerful creature. If you give yourself over to His opinions, you'll see that you are a custom-crafted piece of the most valued design in nature.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'The Lord... gives you the ability to produce wealth...' Deuteronomy 8:18 NIV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God holds back '...no good from those who do what is right.' (Psalms 84:11 NLT) But it's important to realise He's actually the source of all our blessings. And on this one, we all fall short!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More isn't always better. In fact, your dependence on God lessens as your dependence on things increases. When we've got less, we focus on God, but when we've got more, we tend to focus on getting still more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet God wants us to depend on Him, not on our possessions. So He cautioned all of us, 'When...you may say... &quot;My power and...strength...have produced this&quot;...remember the Lord...gives you the ability to produce wealth...' (Deuteronomy 8:13-18 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep, wealth comes from God because He's the one who gives us the ability to produce it. His principles haven't changed. The Bible doesn't say that God is a rewarder of those who diligently seek 'things'. No - it says, '...He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.' (Hebrews 11:6 NKJ) Bottom line: if you're depending on anything but God, you'll always struggle in some area of life.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you.' John 15:12 NIV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes a good friend? We can make a checklist of our own but it'd be good to look at what Jesus said. He had a few really hard-to-swallow teachings on the subject. Try John 15:13 NIV for size: 'Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one's life for one's friends.' This is not any sort of a soppy tagged-in-a-facebook-montage-pic of 'love', but the kind that Jesus modelled. The kind that asks us to make sacrifices. (Check back to last Thursday's reading, if you've forgotten that Jesus asks us to make daily sacrifices on behalf of others.) You might never have to catch a grenade or jump in front of a train to save your friends, but there's plenty we can do - starting with time and effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why, though? Why bother giving up yourself for others? Well, one of the problems we all can face is opting to be superficial. When we're little more than skin-deep, we shrink our friendship-quality. Opening up to a trusted mate is good (girls have usually been a bit better at this than guys). Having a person you can totally trust is a bit of a lifesaver, and a life-giver, in the long run. Have you got one? And are you one to someone else?&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;h6&gt;'When I was a child...When I became a man...' 1 Corinthians 13:11 NIV&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every birthday, it feels like there should be some sort of fanfare and that someone should hand you the golden keys of maturity. (We know, we feel that too.) Unlucky. It's not going to happen. 'Reaching maturity' is a very (very, very) long and complex process. There's rarely a moment, other than on TV, that anyone ever gets a 'You're a man now!' experience (ok, pipe down, Bear Grylls). The journey towards feeling all wise and grown-up can leave you in a confusing no-man's land, between the safe, clear world of childhood and the responsibility and authority of 'grown-up' life. People tell you to 'grow up already' while others are saying, 'you can't do that, you're too young'. It's fine to be thrown by it all; it can be perplexing and majorly stressful. But there's a solution. 'Those who are planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish...' (Psalm 92:13 NKJ) That means that stressing won't help you grow: putting down roots in God will. If you chase God, and trust Him to take care of stuff, He'll give you direction and peace about your place in life. If you live for Him and have a little patience, He'll help you grow into that maturity. Sweet deal.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'He who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit...' Romans 8:27 NIV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we’re getting to the bit that seems hardest when we’re back at the starting line. With pure motives and obedience to God sorted (see yesterday), anyone’s set to serve God. Once you’ve got your heart sorted, here’s a heads–up on practical steps that naturally follow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) &lt;em&gt;Your priorities&lt;/em&gt;. Will change, big time. Jesus submitted His schedule to God, right from His carpentry job to taking time for a last supper with His friends in the middle of His most nerve–wracking 24 hours on earth. Would He have preferred an easier set of options? Maybe, but what mattered most to Him was what God wanted for Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2)&lt;em&gt; Your sacrifices&lt;/em&gt;. When your heart’s right, you’ll make them. Jesus made loads more sacrifices than dying for us on the cross. He knew how to give His life away in daily practical (doing stuff! &amp;lt;— important) ways. ‘Whoever wants to be My disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow Me. For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will save it.’ (Luke 9:23–24 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tells us the sacrifice He made on the cross flowed over into a lifestyle. You won’t find a verse about Him refusing to give time up for others. &lt;em&gt;Not. Easy.&lt;/em&gt; In fact, we’ve used Jesus as our prime example today. Not only because we’re Christians, but also because He was sorted in ways we very often aren’t. Talk to the One who searches hearts and ask what you should be sacrificing today.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Jesus knew what they were thinking [in their hearts].' Luke 11:17 GNT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we've opened our heart to God: confident in Him (Tuesday's reading), willing to obey Him (Wednesday) and putting Him first every time (yesterday). Mentally check up on these things every day and you'll be on your way to true discipleship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, in the last reading in this series, we want to turn it round 180 degrees. Other people are going to love it when we've been letting God do His thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You'll be freely forgiving them&lt;/em&gt;: 'Forgive as the Lord forgave you.' (Colossians 3:13) People just won't expect you to let their mistakes go without a condition attached! The profound work God's been up to in you will hit them: 'But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.' (Galatians 5:22-23) People notice that and it's refreshing. It's like you're wearing the beauty of Jesus' life and others will unconsciously sense it. They'll reap the benefits of your prayers for them. Want to see friends who don't like the Christian agenda come to know Jesus?: 'I urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people.' (1 Timothy 2:1 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTW, the Bible references today are taken from books written by the apostle Paul. He's a cracking example of someone who opened His life to God's scalpel (ex Christian-basher turned missionary: serious surgery there), and shared his changed heart with others.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'The Lord searches every heart and understands every motive.' 1 Chronicles 28:9 NIV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, now for some potential outcomes to God's heart surgery we haven't touched on yet. Heavier stuff; things that can go unnoticed if we aren't honest with ourselves. Praying for God to change you is going to mean you notice things that need changing, like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pure motives&lt;/em&gt;: Especially in areas where you consistently slip yourself. That person you look down on, the swearing that's become habitual with that group of friends, that intimacy you shouldn't have with your boy/girl-friend. Do you stop-drop-and-roll away from your sin as soon as God blows that nagging whistle in your conscience? If our hearts are truly open to God, we'll confess sin by name and turn away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Obedience&lt;/em&gt;: Letting God perform spiritual heart-surgery means you're vulnerable. Very vulnerable. If that's uncomfortable for you, you might never get to a point where you're willing to let God renew you. Everyone hates being corrected at first, especially if you've come from a background where everyone's critical. But this is about construction, not destruction. The Psalmist prayed, 'Search me, God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts. See if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.' (Psalm 139:23-24 NKJ) The way everlasting is being offered to you, in your life, right now. Make whatever change you need to in order to receive it.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'My times are in Your hand...' Psalm 31:15 NKJ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opening your life to God so He can see right into every part of it - especially the parts you're not proud of - is the best and only way to keep your feet firmly set on the right track. Attempting to make your way through big decisions - your choice of uni or job, starting a relationship, which church to go to, life-stuff - is best approached from a heart that has been open to God's surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next few days, we'll be looking at the benefits of getting beyond the awkwardness of opening that dark corner of your heart to God's scalpel of faith. Here are some major basics to get us off the ground: First, opening up to God means you'll feel sure in your salvation. If you're keeping things from God, then you might not really feel as confident in Him as you could. On top of that, your devotional life will take shape. It's great you're reading &lt;em&gt;word4U2day&lt;/em&gt; but, as you'll know, there's no substitute for getting stuck into God's Word. (That's why we have the &lt;em&gt;SoulFood &lt;/em&gt;Bible reading plan with each reading... so you can get through the Bible in a year.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After having your life refashioned by God, there probably won't be much room left for bragging. Humility will help others as much as it helps you - are you quick to let others off the hook when you're the one who hasn't got it right? How easy do you find it to celebrate others' success, even if it means yours will go unnoticed? As you are waiting to get where God wants you to be, build others so He will build you.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'...Your Word is truth.' John 17:17 NIV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the back of your head maybe you're thinking you could be doing more to get yourself - mind, emotions, all that - into Bible reading. But we've been friends a while and it'd be awkward to bring it up now. Well, no worries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've gone ahead and written today just for you...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One proven and helpful way to get better at Bible reading is an old practice where you simply slow down. Over 5 - 10 minutes, read a chosen verse or two of the Bible, slowly. Listen out for a word or section that touches your heart. In silence, repeat it over to yourself (repeating brings your whole attention to it.) Pray your distracting thoughts and concerns up to God, and let Him speak to you through what you've read. An example of how this kind of approach changes minds: in the 1950s in South America, some people who were too poor to own individual Bibles got together to read Scripture in groups. For them, the words of Scripture were their final authority. One day they read that God was a God who 'raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap.' (Psalm 113:7 ESV) They quickly realised He was for them, and could no longer live within oppression. Here we live in a country where the Bible is easily available. Are we going to use it to let it transform our lives like they did? What changes would you have to make in your life, if you allowed the Bible to be your final authority?&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'...The Word of God which...effectively works in you...' 1 Thessalonians 2:13 NKJ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever got so attached to your mobile you genuinely thought you could hear it go off when you were rooms away or outside? Or had that thing where you reach for it right before you get a text? You're just a bit too used to your handset. Your brain is listening for what it expects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you've spent enough time in your Bible, your brain will be expecting more too. It will begin to see deeper than the words, stories and rules on the surface. You go through them to get to God. After you've been reading and praying through it for a while, you intuitively learn God's heart patterns, you listen out for what to expect from His character, and in your real life decisions you can work out what to do much more simply. Wondering about who to hang out with? How much money to split between the needy and your own convenience? How far is too far in your relationship with Mr Cadbury's goods? When you've really got to grips with the Bible, God's truth becomes something you can feel in your bones, you can almost reach for it before you read: 'I will put My instructions deep within them, and I will write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be My people.' (Jeremiah 31:33 NLT) It has 'effectively worked in you' and become second nature. So, listen out for a word or phrase of God's truth for you in your &lt;em&gt;SoulFood&lt;/em&gt; today.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'You preserve me from trouble; You surround me with shouts of deliverance.' Psalm 32:7 ESV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stormie Omartian grew up with a mother who told her she was worthless. She locked Stormie in a cupboard because she couldn't stand to see her daughter's face. Stormie writes: 'I was raised by a mentally ill mother... her behaviour left me with guilt, hopelessness, helplessness and deep emotional pain. By the time I was a young woman I was still locked in, only the boundaries were emotional not physical - a deep, ever-present pain which expressed itself through self-destruction and paralysing fear. Years later [with help from a Christian counsellor] I learned that unforgiveness as deeply rooted as mine... must be unravelled one layer at a time. One day I felt led to pray, &quot;Lord, give me a heart like Yours for my mother.&quot; Immediately I had a vision of her as a beautiful, fun-loving, gifted woman with no resemblance to the person I knew... I was seeing her the way God made her to be, not the way she'd become. In an instant I put together the pieces of her past - her mother's tragic death... the suicide of her beloved uncle and foster father, her feelings of abandonment, guilt, bitterness and unforgiveness... Touching the heart of God brought such forgiveness that when she died... I had no bad feelings. In fact, the more I forgave her the more God brought to mind good memories.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only God knows the history of those who hurt you, and how life has shaped them. To move on in your life, you may need to, like Stormie, pray a prayer of release and let go of the past.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'...Life is not measured by how much you own.' Luke 12:15 NLT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good life that advertisements offer is all about owning more and more. But it's a trap. Any ad that says, 'Your hair could look like this!' is playing on your insecurity. Listen out: there's an underlying message that says, 'You're not good enough, and we'll make you better.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus calls out something totally different to the world's consumer choices. He just breezes right past the question of 'how much stuff is enough'. Life, for Him, is about getting a tight grip on your desires, and putting them in their right place. 'Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has been pleased to give you the Kingdom. Sell your possessions and give to the poor. Provide purses for yourselves that will not wear out, a treasure in Heaven that will never fail.' (Luke 12:32-33 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A life of listening to advertisements will get crushingly oppressive for your sense of worth. John Piper said, 'If the heart is satisfied with all that God is for us in Jesus, the power of sin [or ads...] to lure us away from the wisdom of Christ is broken.' Easily said, John, but what about that $0.99 app update for the level with the rainbow sweet things? Well, if God really is pleased to offer you a different way of life, even in tiny things, ask Him what it is! If He really has something better than the treadmill of buying stuff (and we think He does...), try finding out what it might be. God isn't opposed to you having money. He's just against anything taking His place in your life! He knows that 'Your heart will be where your treasure is.' (Matthew 6:21 NCV)&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Seek His Kingdom, and these things will be given to you as well.' Luke 12:31 NIV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would you want to be doing if Jesus came back today? Living comfortably on your Xbox throne amid piles of stuff? Or honestly doing the best you can to make the lives of those less well-off than you in some way better? One author writes: 'God deals with us individually. What may be ok for some isn't necessarily ok for others... When Pastor Renny Scott began wrestling with this issue, he said, 'I just couldn't resolve the tension of living in a peaceful bedroom community while hell on earth was all around me in the form of hunger and poverty.' He went to Africa with World Vision, which was the beginning of involvement with the needs of others. Next he moved into the inner city... Then he took a church of 50 which met in a school cafeteria. When a deacon suggested they give the entire Sunday morning offering to missions, Scott swallowed hard - because his salary was included!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually he and his wife came to grips with their lifestyle. Scott said, 'I had to pause and ask myself what I'd want to be doing if Christ returned today. And I found myself answering from Matthew chapter 24 and 25... to take my talents and invest them [where the need was].&quot;'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've been challenged by this reading, then next time you find yourself wanting to buy something you don't need, stop yourself. Use the money, like Renny Scott did, where the need is.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Daniel purposed in his heart...' Daniel 1:8 KJV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just after Jesus' time, there was a church at Laodicea that started off well, then turned away from Him with a compromised, over-fed shrug. They had stuffed their faces with everything corrupt culture had to offer. 'I am... increased with goods,' they said, 'and have need of nothing.' (Revelation 3:17 KJV) Centuries before, a man of God called Daniel had settled the issue of culture-compromise for himself. So when he got a job that meant he could eat the most luxurious foods - that God had said he shouldn't - he could swat the appetiser trays away with ease. Joseph had too, so he could say no to Potiphar's sex-fiend of a wife when she made her advances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think God might fail you, you'll never totally commit yourself to Him like those two did. Become used to His trustworthiness, even in simple things. Knowing that He'd come through for them when the king threatened to throw them in a fiery furnace, Daniel's friends said, '...Our God...is able to deliver us...and He will... But if not... we do not serve your gods...' (Daniel 3:17-18 NKJ) Have you given yourself over to compromise lately like the people of Laodicea? God's still wants to help you. Go to Him and ask for His forgiveness and also ask Him to help you do something that takes you in the opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'My times are in Your hand...' Psalm 31:15 NKJ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Book of Exodus, God's people were travelling through the desert. Moses was leading them to the home promised to them. Moses stopped at a mountain to talk with God, and frankly, took too long. Forty days. I mean, it was so long the only reasonable option for God's people seemed to be to just melt down a shedload of gold and make a giant golden cow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you do, right? That's how the story goes in Exodus 32. Understandably God wasn't fussed about His glittery replacement from Farmville. The man who'd let it happen, Aaron, saw the big mistake they'd all made. But he tried to explain, saying, 'You know how prone these people are to evil.' (Exodus 32:22 NIV) Like, as if they turned their attention from God for a second, they were (literally) distracted by the nearest shiny object. Is it a good excuse? When we feel like God hasn't been close recently and we stray into sin, do we think: 'Well God, You know me. I did something a bit bad, but I'm only human.' Or do we hold up our hands and say, 'I've made a huge mistake...' What if sin wasn't the natural thing to expect from ourselves, and we could hold ourselves to a higher standard? Paul wrote, 'Let us not be weary in well doing.' (Galatians 6:9 KJV) He expected that Christians could grow to be consistently, magnetically drawn to choosing good things, not bad. Do you? Because what you think impacts how you behave.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Do not be afraid of their faces, for I am with you...' Jeremiah 1:8 NKJ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremiah wrote: 'The word of the Lord came to me, saying: &quot;Before I formed you in the womb I knew you; before you were born I sanctified* you...&quot; Then said I: &quot;Ah, Lord God! Behold, I cannot speak, for I am a youth.&quot; But the Lord said to me: &quot;Do not say, 'I am a youth,' for you shall go to all to whom I send you, and whatever I command you, you shall speak. Do not be afraid of their faces, for I am with you to deliver you,&quot; says the Lord. Then the Lord put forth His hand and touched my mouth, and... said: &quot;Behold, I have put My words in your mouth.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremiah realised that God was looking at him - and had been even before he was born. At first he felt ashamed. But God showed him that His gaze was full of special attention and stupendous love. Now, He looked Jeremiah straight in the eyes, and told him, &quot;Do not be afraid.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you know that you are seen by God, the faces of those who'd look down on you, in real life or in your imagination, fade. We matter, because we're seen. No matter how much other people make out you're embarrassing, it's different with God. He's not embarrassed by you at all. Because whenever He looks at a Christian, He sees Jesus and that you are sanctified* through Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;*[which means &quot;holified&quot;? &quot;made awesomely super-amazingly godly&quot;? Eh, just google it.]&lt;/h6&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Get yourself ready!' Jeremiah 1:17 NIV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that phase when you were a kid and felt too awkward to talk to your parents' friends? Well, Jeremiah was in a similar situation: he thought he was too young to talk with God. Sometimes we think our beginnings are too humble (or broken) for God. Here's the thing though: we all came from a less-than-perfect background. So what do we do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, it's not worth giving time of day to the 'Christian' attitude of 'I'm just ordinary.' You were created by Almighty God, for good works. That's far from ordinary! And no matter where you've come from it's still true. You're never just the product of your upbringing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, however shambolic your family upbringing was, you can learn valuable lessons. You can know to avoid the mistakes of those who did it the wrong way, and follow those who did it the right way. CS Lewis reminds us that 'the real Son of God is at your side. He is beginning to turn you into the same kind of thing as Himself.' He can use those the very people you've grown up with to get your character growing towards perfection. Hope is always the last word in Christianity. You're never trapped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremiah told God that he wasn't old enough, couldn't speak well enough and was scared of the opposition. God's response was: 'Get yourself ready!' He promised to be with Jeremiah and, if you commit yourself to Him, He'll be with you too.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'The Lord...said to me, Now, I have put My words in your mouth.' Jeremiah 1:9 NIV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremiah's encounter with God shows us how God puts something new into fearful minds. Many new Christians first feel His presence as a great big wash of well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New research has shown that neglect by parent-figures can damage kids' brain development, but love, when it is consistently felt, writes out those dark, damaged spaces. ('Perfect love casts out fear,' remember that from 1 John 4:18?) Reminding yourself of the love of God can bring deep, real healing to traumatic parts of your past, so that you can get going on your new life with Him, full of new peace and joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, the Holy Spirit can kickstart new habits. He brings seemingly dry Bible facts from your head to life in your heart, where they actually blow through your being like a refreshing breeze. Like this one: 'Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.' (2 Corinthians 3:17 NIV) In the morning you can remind yourself that because He is with you, you can say, 'I actually do believe these things about myself. I am who God says I am. I can live freely!' That's right: you're not who others say you are; you're who God says you are! Be yourself; you can't be anybody else! Do what God says you can do. Just get in agreement with Him.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Press toward the goal for the prize...' Philippians 3:14 NKJ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the book of Nehemiah, God chose people to rebuild the ruined city He lived in at the time. How could they stay motivated to keep on working in crumbled remains? Well, they knew, even then, that God loved the city. They knew, while staring at debris-strewn ground, in a city far from completed, that the heart of God was for it. 'Look at that rubbish tip,' the critics cried. 'It's not a city wall, it's just a bunch of bricks in a pile!' If only they'd known what God was thinking. 'Oh yes! I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; love that wall.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The love God should have for a spotless individual is on you, today, because of Jesus. When we feel guilt in our Christian life from lack of progress, or some glaring character failure, we can find ourselves thinking, &quot;God can't love me yet. Not, like, '&lt;em&gt;love me&lt;/em&gt;' love me.&quot; There is frustrating sin clogging up our holiness. There are gates and walls still unbuilt in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proud smile of a Creator on His finished creation is on you. You are bathed in light. There is room to grow in, an expansive space of God's acceptance. Maybe it's not only about 'pressing on' but also about rejoicing, flowering, blooming... into the whole and holy person He's said you are.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'As an eagle stirs up its nest...so the Lord...led him...' Deuteronomy 32:11-12 NKJ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mother eagle knows that if she waits for her young to get out of the nest and fly on their own initiative, it'll never happen! So she pushes them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what about that comfort zone of yours then? We resist moving outside our comfort zone because we don't want to fall on our faces. And when we stay inside our comfort zones, it's the easiest thing in the world to become complacent. Imagine if you hadn't made the hard decision to brave the cold and move out of the comfy-zone of your bed this morning. You'd get sucked into that warm-bed-magnet-trap. And you'd have got absolutely nothing done today at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eager to get going but don't know how? June Munday shares about her 'friend [who] started a café for homeless people... when I asked him about this &quot;calling&quot; he said: &quot;Well, you hardly need to wait for that. There's plenty in the Bible telling you to feed the hungry.&quot;' You don't have to wait for your own dreamy vision or calling. God's dreams for the world, as seen in the Gospel stories of Jesus, give us loads to aim for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and the mother eagle? After encouraging the little ones to leave, she carries them safely onto their flying lesson. God's got you.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'...I am doing a great work...' Nehemiah 6:3 NKJ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haven't read yesterday? (Did you get to the half-yearly review bit and think, 'Hey, waaaaay too heavy,' and decide to update your Facebook status instead? Right then, no excuses. Pop back and have a read. No, not Facebook. &lt;em&gt;word4U2day&lt;/em&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back? Cool. This 'mast' business then, what's it all about? Masts aren't just for when things are rough, like storms; masts give a ship its strength when the sun is out and the wind is in its favour. God's presence doesn't just secure us in safety, it also means we can do good things - seriously good things - that we couldn't do without Him. 'The Spirit of the Lord will come powerfully upon you... and you will be changed into a different person.' (1 Samuel 10:6 NIV) When we share God with friends, pray to see people freed from sin, and pray openly for healing, we need to know that there is going to be something that will make things happen! We have to 'screw our courage to the mast' (with apologies to Shakespeare's Lady Macbeth). If God is that 'mast', then we don't have to worry about our own lack of ability or experience. A fierce life of faith doesn't mean that we must be famous Christians or big church leaders - it means only clinging to God, and trying to live in a way that only makes sense if He is real. That way we'll be 'doing a great work.'&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'God is not unjust; He will not forget your work and the love you have shown Him.' Hebrews 6:10 NIV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it's July 1st - not usually the time when we start reviewing the year. But if we wait until the normal time around end of December, there won't be an opportunity to make any useful changes. So. How's it going so far? More good than bad? A mixed bag? Some nagging stuff you'd rather not remember? With the way our brains are, we often zoom in on our bad moments. So maybe we're looking back and remembering more of our own selfish actions than the broad action of God through us. 'Where's God been so far this year? Should I have worked harder to let Him in? Will it all just happen again, whatever I do?'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But no matter what your half-yearly review looks like, the headline stubbornly remains: God's unfailing, unflapping kindness, tied to us like a sail to a mast. 'God is not unjust' - and more than that, He is so much more than fair to us that it takes a while getting used to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sailors lashed themselves to their sail masts in storms. We should lash ourselves to God's character from day to day, month to month, year to year, no matter what each brings. That way, we can remember who He is when change comes. We remember how kind He is to us in our worst times, and how He draws out all the character and growth He can from even the smallest good moments we muster up. Even those brief good moments mean the world to Him.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'... A brother is born for adversity.' Proverbs 17:17 NIV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nehemiah lived about 2400 years ago. He left a life of privilege to help rebuild the walls of ruined Jerusalem. But not everyone was happy about his efforts. A local bigwig, Sanballat, didn't want Nehemiah to succeed. 'Sanballat ...sent to me, saying, &quot;Come, let us meet together&quot;...But they thought to do me harm. So I sent messengers to them, saying, &quot;I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down. Why should the work cease while I leave it and go down to you&quot;? But they sent me this message four times, and I answered them in the same manner.' (Nehemiah 6:2-4 NKJ)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes your answer just has to be 'No!' Any time you stop the work God has given you to do, you've sent the devil a signal his strategy is working. So you can expect more of the same. Think: if God can deliver you in times of trouble, surely He can defend you in times of misunderstanding! So get back up on the wall He has called you to build and keep working. Don't get distracted. Don't listen to critical people, be cautious in dealing with cautious people but value the people who are committed to seeing God's work advance and you too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.' Recognise such people and build your life around them because they are a gift from God.&lt;/p&gt;

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'But Paul shook the snake off...' Acts 28:5 NIV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Book of Acts, Luke wrote what happened after a shipwreck: 'The islanders showed us unusual kindness. They built a fire and welcomed us all because it was raining and cold. Paul gathered a pile of brushwood and, as he put it on the fire, a viper...fastened itself on his hand. When the islanders saw the snake hanging from his hand, they said to each other, &quot;This man must be a murderer; for though he escaped from the sea, Justice has not allowed him to live.&quot; But Paul shook the snake off into the fire and suffered no ill effects. The people expected him to swell up or suddenly fall dead, but after waiting a long time and seeing nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and said he was a god.' (Acts 28:2-6 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know how fickle people are? Here's a classic case: one moment Paul is seen as an evil criminal, the next he may as well have been elevated to Heaven. But Paul shows us how to avoid both extremes: 'Shake it off!' Yup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Shake it off!&lt;/i&gt; We should beware of those who change their mind about us when our circumstances change. We need to build our lives on those who believe the best about us, and want to bring it out. Behind Paul's spectacular success in ministry you will find people who never stopped believing in him. Priscilla, Aquila, Epaphroditus, Onesiphorus and many others. Look for such people in your life; they'll bless you. And they're out there!&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'...What does my Lord say to His servant?' Joshua 5:14 NKJ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Luther wrote, 'I know whenever I have prayed earnestly that I have been amply heard, and have obtained more than I prayed for. God indeed sometimes delayed, but at last He came.' Joshua certainly learned that. He knew that the only way to conquer the Promised Land was for Jericho to fall first. Well, conveniently for Joshua, the angelic commander of the Lord's army showed up, then God gave him a very clear battle plan to take down Jericho. Weird plan, but it worked. (God's totally cool like that... His weird plans actually work when we follow them.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, the battle was God's. That doesn't mean Joshua sat on his rear and waited for God to make the walls of Jericho vanish in a cloud of smoke. It meant that, after he sought God in prayer, Joshua was given the means to win his battle. Whatever 'Jericho' is in your life today, whatever walls you need to break down, your battle belongs to the Lord too. Joshua was strong and courageous and yet even he could not defeat Jericho in his own strength. His victory came in the bending of knees. The fiercest of conflict is won in prayer.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'...Thus far the Lord has helped us.' 1 Samuel 7:12 NKJ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow we'll be half way through 2014. Did you make any New Year resolutions back on January 1? With God, you don't need to wait until a New Year to start again. Lamentations 3:22-24 NCV reminds us every day is a clean slate with God: '&lt;em&gt;The Lord&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;s love never ends;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; His mercies never stop. They are new every morning; Lord, Your loyalty is great. I say to myself, &quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lord is mine, so I hope in Him&lt;/em&gt;.&quot;' No need to 'drown your sorrows' (in the chocolate hidden at the bottom of the tin). Missed chances can be returned to you: Jonah got a second chance, so did Peter, David, Thomas, Samson... the list goes on. When it comes to epic failures, God says, 'I, I am the One who forgives all your sins, for my sake; I will not remember your sins.' (Isaiah 43:25 NCV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we mark this half-yearly milestone, make a list of God's faithfulness to you so far in life. Put it in your Bible so you can see it regularly. Whatever this year has felt like so far, God has been with you, and He is faithful for the rest of the year too. So learn from the past, but don't repeat its mistakes. It's ok to look back, but don't drive looking in the rear view mirror... because you're bound to crash.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'...God is working in you giving you the desire to obey Him and the power to do what pleases Him.' Philippians 2:13 NLT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, 'My yoke fits perfectly, and the burden I give you is light.' (Matthew 11:30 NLT) Lots of those who heard these words were farmers who used oxen to plough their fields. They understood what Jesus was saying because the yoke was one of their most important bits of equipment. It was a wooden attachment that fitted between two oxen so that their full pulling power could be released. They wouldn't dream of putting an ill-fitting yoke on their oxen that caused them to chafe, or pull the plough in a wonky line. Now, when you hear Jesus using these kinds of illustrations you mustn't go too far in examining them - Jesus doesn't think his followers are cows (sheep perhaps but not cows, lol) and don't take the 'pulling power' phrase literally! This illustration is about Jesus offering people rest for their souls (Matthew 11:29) from the heavy burden of the way they were living their lives without Him. So why do so many of us not feel an instant desire to get out there and get on with Jesus? Quite simply because we've spent so long trying to make it on our own and not being the person we were made to be. We're also not doing the things we were made to do and so the 'yoke' Jesus gives us feels totally weird at first. The only way to make it feel less weird is just to just accept God's grace and get in the groove! In no time you'll be asking yourself, 'Why didn't I get started sooner?' Obedience isn't hard work, it's what you were made for! Have you come to Jesus yet? Is He Lord of your life?&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'...God is working in you giving you the desire to obey Him and the power to do what pleases Him.' Philippians 2:13 NLT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A guy trying to win a girl will do anything for her. She'll call him and say, 'I know it's late, you're tired and it's raining, but could you come over and change my flat tyre?' 'Sure, I'll be right over,' he says. And over he comes with a smile. Now, fast forward. They've been married 10 years; he's at home with this same woman whom he once chased around everywhere like a puppy. She asks him to get up off the sofa and do something for her. She has to say it three or four times - you'd think she'd asked him to cut off his leg the way he moans and groans! Then she gets upset. What's happening? What was once a pleasure has become a pain - because the love has cooled off! Our problem isn't really obedience, it's keeping our love for Christ strong. Only love makes obedience a joy. Less obedience quite simply means less love. Lots of people allow the love to fizzle out of the Christian life, so that it just becomes a set of rules. But God has designed the Christian life around relationships, not rules. Rules without relationship lead to coldness. Jesus sent an angel to the Christians at Ephesus to say: 'I have this against you, that you have left your first love.' (Revelation 2:4 NAS) In other words, 'You don't love Me like you used to.' Then He commanded them to return to the point before they'd let their love for Him slip. Is Christ saying the same thing to you today?&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'He...ran out of the house.' Genesis 39:12 NIV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your eyes are wired to your brain, physically: the optic nerve stretches from the back of the eye right into your head. Your very own high-speed, fibre-optic, in-head broadband. Every image and word you see shoots down it like a dart to your brain, and plants itself into your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what happens when your eyes land on something that plants 'sex' in your mind?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, simply, that wrong kind of sex becomes a part of your thoughts - yep, a part of you. God crafted sex as a deeply personal way to give ourselves to someone as part of only-the-most-serious commitment. It's made to live in healthy, lifelong marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we take in mental images of sex, it takes it out of a secure, shared, equal, giving-all-of-yourself-to-each-other trust and makes it all about indulging in self-pleasing lust. Let's stop there: this isn't a telling off from &lt;em&gt;word4U2day&lt;/em&gt;. This is a warning sign for your safety. Girls. Guys. What you're taking in changes how your brain understands sex. It's God's plan for us to understand it as a celebration of a couple expressing lifelong love, but it is turned into warped expectations about a self-pleasing party. We can actually be divided from that special someone we might one day marry (which is heartbreaking). Experiencing (including 'just messing around' or 'just seeing') sex in the wrong way tears at the tissue of our spirit. Run out of the space where you're open to that. Just as Joseph did when he was tempted. See Joseph's story in Genesis 39:1-18. And don't forget to check out the reward of his faithfulness in Genesis 41:38-45.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'...Hold fast what is good.' 1 Thessalonians 5:21 NKJ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're in a society that's moved away from the ideas of absolute good and absolute evil. So having something concrete to stand for will set you apart (in a really good way).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible calls us to stick with the boundaries set by our forerunners (see Proverbs 22:28). If we stay within the age-old knowledge of God's law, we also draw on age-old power to change our world through obedience to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obedience may sound like a bit of a stuffy word (or, you know, a dog training thing), but it's the foundation of a God-centred life. The really old root of the word obedience is a mixture of 'ob', &lt;em&gt;to be near&lt;/em&gt;, and 'audio', &lt;em&gt;to hear&lt;/em&gt;. If you are close to someone, and hear an instruction from them, 'obedience' is the natural next step. If we live our lives in proximity to God, obeying His voice will be automatic upon hearing it. So, hear this from God's Word: '...hold on to what is good. Reject every kind of evil.' (1 Thessalonians 5:21-22 NIV) God is absolutely good, no question, and His way is absolutely right, so hold on to it. In a world that's all at sea, bobbing along with changing boundaries and drifting with the tide, we can anchor ourselves in a steady-as-a-rock God and show a better (and unfailingly right) way to those floating along in the current.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who made God then?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;If God exists why is there so much suffering in the world?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Christians are mostly hypocrites.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Religion is outdated and causes wars.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Christianity is a crutc&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;h for weak people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can you know what&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;s really true?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had questions and statements like these flung at you, leaving you unsure how to respond? Maybe you've gotten discouraged and been tempted to stop sharing your faith. Maybe you've even given up praying because of it. It happens to lots of Christians at school and in the workplace, and it can be quite demoralising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Galatians 1:13 NLT Paul writes; 'I violently persecuted God's church. I did my best to destroy it.' Paul had no thoughts of becoming a Christian. His intent was to destabilise the Church, and he never dreamt that one day he'd switch sides. But when God has a plan, He will do whatever it takes to fulfil it. So when Paul held the coats of Stephen's executioners, even then God was hatching a plan to make him one of the most remarkable Christians of all time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like Paul, He has plans for your friends with all their objections, tricky questions, or questionable lifestyle choices. Tougher nuts have been cracked! God's grace will win out, so hold in there, and don't lose hope!&lt;/p&gt;

<title><![CDATA[A New Approach to Obedience (1)]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[a-new-approach-to-obedience-1]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'...God is working in you giving you the desire to obey Him and the power to do what pleases Him.' Philippians 2:13 NLT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul says, '...God is working in you giving you the desire to obey Him and the power to do what pleases Him.' Most of us don't connect obedience with pleasure. We're used to obeying out of fear. Perhaps we had parents who made us obey 'just because I said so.' Now it's not wrong for parents to expect obedience from children, or teachers to expect cooperation from their class. But it's not the best definition or the highest motivation for obedience. The element that's missing is the 'want to' factor God built into each of us at the point of salvation. This takes the 'ought to/have to/better do it or else God will zap you' element out of it! It elevates obeying God to a level of an excited response because of all that He's done for you. Obedience is not something you have to manufacture it just needs to be activated because the desire is already present in you - it just needs to be activated. This will often come during a time of worship, prayer, or listening to a preacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody wants their relationship with God to be like the boy who misbehaved and was told by his mother to go and sit in the corner. After a few minutes she called to him from the other room, 'Are you still sitting down?' He replied, 'Yes, I'm sitting down on the outside, but I'm standing up on the inside.' You could call that obedience, but actually it's rebellion. Real obedience is gladly doing on the outside, what you really want to do on the inside.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'The sparrow has found a home...a place near Your altar.' Psalm 84:3 NIV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That feeling of loneliness we mentioned yesterday - remember it? For some people this is all they've known. Long-term friendlessness means deep suffering. How totally out of place is that in a good world created by a Father God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most churches are well-known for looking out for the homeless and poor; for helping society's forgotten people, and inviting them to a weekly service. For anyone who feels like an outcast, a real welcome to Church is more than just finding a spiritual home, it sometimes means feeling human for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic loneliness also includes the single mother, and the socially awkward, unemployed kid who shows up and mumbles when you say hello. And what about those with severe autism? Jesus has an especially wide welcome for all of those we think are beyond our reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He came to '...seek and to save that which was lost.' (Luke 19:10 NIV) That includes those we count as too small or too seemingly insignificant for God to go looking for. He wants to give them a home in a safe place, in close proximity to others. And He wants other Christians to be serious about welcoming them there. And that means each one of us.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'...Not one of them falls to the ground apart from your Father's will.' Matthew 10:29 NKJ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life can be wonderful. To live on a world like ours, with all its wonder and complexity and joy, is a great gift. But sometimes life doesn't seem like a gift. Sometimes it can feel like an empty, friendless place. Jesus said, 'Are not two sparrows sold for a copper coin? And not one of them falls to the ground apart from your Father's will.' God knows when we fall, and His will is to lift us up again. Perhaps you were flying high and - &lt;em&gt;boom!&lt;/em&gt; - life knocked you down, and you were left in the cold. A mistake. A secret. A betrayal. An illness. A death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life has a funny habit of stealing the wind beneath our wings. Sometimes we even feel so wing-clipped, we can't ever see ourselves in the sky again. The past plus our fear keep us on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's an expert at throwing birds back into the sky. Simon Peter's wings were clipped by sin, guilt and regret. He denied Jesus three times yet God later restored him as His disciple and Apostle. Jonah fell through disobedience. His destiny was returned when he finally obeyed God and called Nineveh to repentance. David's plunge to the ground occurred because of his wandering eye. But he was restored from the Bathsheba episode to be forever known as 'a man after God's own heart.' The battle isn't over your past, it's over your future. God isn't looking to just point the finger today; He's looking to restore your soul. He wants you to fly again.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'...Your heavenly Father feeds them...' Matthew 6:26 NKJ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Jay Adams tells the story of a guy who decided to quit worrying. When a friend noticed how chilled he looked and asked what he'd done, he said, 'It's simple; I just hired a guy to do my worrying for me.' Asked how much that cost, he replied, '$500 a day.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Where will you get the money?' his stressed friend asked. His reply? 'That's his worry, not mine!'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus tells us to hand our worries over to Him; and He won't even charge us a single cent! He understands that we're anxious about money and clothes and having what we need. So He instructs us, 'Do not worry, saying, &quot;What shall we eat?&quot;...or &quot;What shall we wear?&quot;' (Matthew 6:31 NIV) He's basically saying to you, 'Don't be a stress-head!' Instead, see how much more God's in control: 'Look at the birds...your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? ...God clothes the grass of the field... will He not much more clothe you?' (Matthew 6:26-30 NIV) God's a big God. He'll give you all you need. Stressing is for people who don't know Him, and don't have their security in Him. So today, instead of stressing about tomorrow, why don't you try focusing instead on 'His kingdom and His righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well...' (Matthew 6:33 NIV) Trust that He's got it all in control.&lt;/p&gt;

]]></introtext>
<fulltext><![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;The phrase 'God-given talent' can make people lazy. Well, yes. God did give us all talents. But they're more like seeds; they're the potential for full-grown talents. It's our job to grow them, nurture them, and ask God to direct them. We can't go on thinking God gave them to us to get us out of doing any hard work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, that shouldn't be too difficult. 'God-given talents' quite often lie within the areas that excite us. The talents that He wants us to grow normally appeal to us, and fit within our abilities. We were, after all, crafted to fulfil them. Think about cats. When they see a gecko, they come alive. All big eyes and alert ears. They really love the chase. That's because they were crafted to hunt. So when they get the opportunity to hone that skill, they jump at the chance (and at the gecko). That's all because they love to do what God created them to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you're the same. When you find the thing that you were made to do, the talent that you were built to love, you should want to jump at the chance to further it. You'll know by the excitement that it stirs up in your belly. It might not be jump-up-and-down-exciting, but you'll know deep down that you've found a passion. Just make sure that you put in the hard work to make it grow.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'A [gift] is a precious stone in the eyes of its possessor: wherever he turns, he prospers.' Proverbs 17:8 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
]]></introtext>
<fulltext><![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;Your height isn't something you were consulted about. Natural features aren't things you worked at. Both were gifts you were born with. Yes, you can develop your appearance and a surgeon could alter it (although we'd suggest that you don't let that happen...), but you're &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: line-through;&quot;&gt;stuck&lt;/span&gt; (actually, strike that, &lt;em&gt;blessed&lt;/em&gt;...) with your core you-ness for the rest of your life. Here's the upshot - you're also stuck and blessed with the 'gift of God' that's in you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can't change that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solomon said that a gift is like a jewel to those who receive it; whatever way it's looked at, it sparkles with a glint of prosperity (Proverbs 17:8). But all gemstones need regular polishing and care. By working on and using your gifts, you're adding that extra bit of value and investing in your talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So invest in your talents, even when others won't support you. Louis Armstrong auditioned for music school and was asked to sing scales. But he could only sing two notes. So they wrote him off. But he said: 'There's music in me and they can't keep it out,' and went on to sell millions of records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's God-given gifts in you, and no-one can keep them down, unless you choose. So you have no excuse to let your talents go unused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then the man said, &quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let me go, for it is daybreak.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; But Jacob replied, &quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;I will not let you go unless you bless me.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; The man asked him, &quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is your n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;ame?&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jacob,&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; he answered.Then the man said, &quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with humans and have overcome.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;' (Genesis 32:26-28)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God forced Jacob to look at his true identity. He wrestled him into a revelation of who he was - not who others said he was. His parents gave him his name and others called him by it, so he believed that's who he'd always be. But God had a different plan for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hear this: you are not who others say you are. Why should they label you? Determine who you are before God. Let Him determine the level of your success. Why should others be allowed to live at their highest potential, but not you? You are more than your past, more than your education or CV, more than the colour of your skin, more than your bank account, and more than your circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell those who talk down to you and devalue you, 'You're confusing me with somebody else. God says I am his son/daughter. And if I'm a son/daughter, then I have the right to be treated like one!' You ask, 'But is that true?' Yes, the Bible says that when you walk with God, you are part of his family (John 1:12) You are part of a royal priesthood (1 Peter 2:9). You are an overcomer (1 John 2:13-14). So dry your tears, lift your head, square your shoulders and begin walking in your God-given identity.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'...Do not fear therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows.' Luke 12:7 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
]]></introtext>
<fulltext><![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mmm... processed beefy stuff on a sesame seed bun. Mmm... deep-fried pieces of something sorta chickeny. Back up two thousand years with your 'mmm'... roasted garden-bird on a twig. Hmm?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The junk food of Jesus' day was roast sparrow on a stick. You could buy two McSparrows for one copper coin or get five for an extra coin. Jesus used this weird old snack to illustrate God's care for us:&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are not five sparrows sold for two copper coins? And not one of them is forgotten before God... Do not fear therefore; you are of more value than man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;y sparrows.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt; (Luke 12:6-7 NKJ)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was Christ's point? You are valuable in God's eyes! Do you feel like if you weren't around nobody would miss you? Many people, even high-profile ones, struggle with a sense of inferiority and inadequacy. When God called Jeremiah to be a prophet, he explained to God that he was afraid of people. So God said, 'Do not be afraid... for I am with you to deliver you.' (Jeremiah 1:8 NKJ) When you feel worthless, you conclude that others feel the same way too, so you begin to approach them fearfully, aggressively or even resentfully. What's the answer? Remembering your worth in God's eyes! There is no rejection with Him, only complete acceptance. You have a friend in high places. Jesus said, &lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;...I have called you friends...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(John 15:15 KJV) Will everybody accept you? Nope. So base your worth on God's love and acceptance, not on what you think others think.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'I am like...a sparrow alone on the housetop.' Psalm 102:6-7 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
]]></introtext>
<fulltext><![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The writer of Psalm 102 wrote, 'I am like...a sparrow alone on the housetop.' To be honest, we probably all know that feeling. We've sat there while our group of friends talks about something we don't get. We've gone somewhere new alone. We've awkwardly perched on the sidelines of a party/youth group, even if only once or twice. We all have our own tailored experience of loneliness. And it hurts. But it feels painful because we were built for more. The Bible opens with God playing matchmaker for Adam with Eve, and the final letters in the Bible are written from one group of friends to another. In the pages between, God pursues His people, but again and again they reject Him - that pretty much sums up the Old Testament. And then there's Jesus with His twelve best mates. One by one they turn their backs on him. Clearly we are not built to 'go it alone'. In Jesus, God has known the pain of loneliness. He died so you could be friends with Him. If you need them, He will bring other friends to you. If you need to, ask Him for company! Know that it's a big part of what He's made you for. Remember: Jesus spent a lot of time with the twentysomethings of his world. (The Apostle John is believed to have been in his teens when he first met Jesus.) So, look out for the person who's pushed to the side today, someone who gets ignored or excluded. Go ask them how their day's going (no matter how hard it is to pull yourself away from your own great convos).&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'I will pour out water to quench your thirst...' Isaiah 44:3 NLT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Swedish company claims to have designed a device that recharges phones using just water. Yes, good old H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. The device allows ten hours of phone life per tablespoon. Imagine that - a few drops of the clear stuff and you can talk on and on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David prayed: 'My soul longs for you, as a parched land... Teach me the way in which I should walk.' (Psalm 143:6-8 NAS) Circumstances were dry for David and his soul was thirsty. (Would his prayer have been different if he was living in luxury surrounded by servants, do you think?) Not knowing where his next meal was coming from and sleeping outside every night radically changed his perspective. When life goes well, we can start to think that we're self-sufficient and forget God. But when we're running on empty, our souls cry out in thirsty desperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prayer, the Church, Bible study, singing praise, meditation and reflection - they're all designed by God to recharge our spirit. God uses them to pour the soul-quenching Water of Himself into our aching spirits. If we starve ourselves of the charge-up time, we risk a spiritual and emotional (maybe even physical) blow out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the time to replenish yourself in God is vital.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'...Your face, Lord, I will seek.' Psalm 27:8 NKJ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Alexander Maclaren was a great Scottish preacher. He believed the power of his preaching came from a regular habit: spending an hour each day alone with God. Sometimes he allowed others into his study, but they were never allowed to speak. Dr Maclaren would sit in a well-worn armchair with his Bible lying across his knees. Sometimes he'd read its pages, but mostly he'd just sit with his hand over his face. If he did read the Bible during that hour, he wouldn't read it as a student, or study it for sermons; during those times, 'he read it as a child would read a letter from an absent father, or your heart would drink in the words of a loved one from far away', so an observer noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How long do you spend with God? You can't expect to build a relationship with God in the five minutes you might give Him before your head hits the pillow. He deserves more of your time than that, and knows that none of our human-brains can process His wisdom and guidance in that timeframe and in our sleepy-headedness. Psalm 27:8 says, 'When You said, &quot;Seek My face,&quot; my heart said to You, &quot;Your face, Lord, I will seek.&quot;' Seeking takes patience and, guess what, time. Time when your brain's on top form. Sometimes, God wants that period of silent waiting before He speaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, open your Bible and spend some time praying and listening to God with and open heart. If you can't find the time, perhaps you need to head back to May 26 and reconsider that social media fast once more.&lt;/p&gt;

<fulltext><![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to get anything great built if you're determined to go it alone. We all need a team around us to achieve anything. However, it's impossible to work well with others if you can't give good, clear direction. Ed Rowell once said, 'A dream is a better future in need of an architect who will show others how to make it a reality,' which hits the nail on the head. Dreams and plans are great (when they're from God), but they're of no use if you can't explain them out of your head and into the ears of others. That's why you need to be an architect. You need to be under God's direction and to be able to take your vision and draw it out, clearly, in order for others to understand it. If you can only communicate to those helping you in a wishy-washy way, you'll get wishy-washy support. People don't give their best to something they can't figure out. If people don't have an in-focus goal to stare at, they'll wander off-course. 1 Corinthians 14:40 NKJ instructs us about our spiritual gifts: 'Let all things be done decently and in order.' That means that God wants us to be ordered and clear in our approach to making these dreams and visions reality. So, not only will people help you more, God will be behind you, helping you towards the goal.&lt;/p&gt;

<fulltext><![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An evangelist tells a story about a time he met a young person in church for the first time. The boy was fixed on the image of Jesus dying on a cross. The evangelist watched the boy. His gaze didn't move. The boy's mouth was gaping. The evangelist watched. The boy scrunched up his eyebrow and then relaxed. The evangelist watched some more. The boy scrunched then relaxed again. The evangelist sensed an opportunity. He walked over to the boy. Scrunch. He stood shoulder to shoulder with him. Relax. The boy remained fixated. The evangelist sensed the right moment. And then the boy asked, 'Who is it?' The evangelist wondered what he meant. 'The guy stretched out on that thing,' the boy said. 'Who is he? What's he doing?'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boy had lived all of his thirteen years and he'd never seen a picture of Jesus. He'd heard the word before but only as a swear word. How can somebody in this country, in this day and age never have come across Jesus? What did he think Christmas was for? Or Easter? Hadn't he heard why people wear silver crosses around their neck?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simple answer is also a simple question: how could he hear unless somebody told him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there someone you know like this boy? Perhaps it's time for you to follow Jesus' example and befriend someone who doesn't know God. And, as a start, to let them know who the Christ of Christmas is and why there's a cross on churches all across Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jerusalem two thousand years ago was no stranger to infection. Leprosy was highly infectious. In order to prevent the disease spreading, the community created certain rules: lepers were ordered to wear a sign, ring a bell (like a cow - yeah, just a bit demeaning), keep their distance. This way, they thought, the threat of catching and passing on the illness could be contained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerusalem two thousand years ago also knew the dangers of moral corruption. Or teachings from another faith. Or other people's worldviews. So they had other rules too. Avoid mixing with non-Jewish types. Don't eat with a tax collector. Don't trade ideas with a Roman. Avoid the sinner (like you would a leper). This way a good Jewish boy could remain a good Jewish boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then Jesus came. He lunched with tax collectors. He hung about with prostitutes. He touched lepers. Actually touched them. He seemed to be a law unto himself. Jesus hung out with the outcasts. Instead of being infected himself, He cured others. He cured the forgotten with dignity and humanity. He cured those who'd lost hope with second chances. He cured sinful people with holiness. Who are the forgotten in your circles? Who are the urban lepers? Reach out today to someone and tell them of the cure that only Jesus can offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exodus 17:10-13 NIV goes: 'So Joshua fought the Amalekites ... and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went to the top of the hill. As long as Moses held up his hands, the Israelites were winning, but whenever he lowered his hands, the Amalekites were winning. When Moses' hands grew tired... Aaron and Hur held his hands up... So Joshua overcame the Amalekite army...'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story is about intercessory prayer. What's an 'intercessor'? Job said, 'My intercessor is my friend... on behalf of a man he pleads with God as a man pleads for his friend.' (Job 16:20-21 NIV) So, someone who prays to God for other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who knows what went on at the top of that hill? Perhaps, as Moses prayed, God gave the Israelites battle strategies? Perhaps prayer caused confusion and disunity in the Amalekites' camp? Perhaps, the spiritual realms changed through prayer, allowing goodness to overcome evil? Ehh, truth is, we don't know exactly how prayer won out that day. We only know it did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the same for you. God wants you to pray for others because it matters. God wants you to intercede because it will win. God wants you to pick up and put on His mind and perspective. Perhaps that's why Jesus told us to pray for our enemies. Prayer reveals to us what God believes for them. Prayer matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever life has taken from you, God can restore. He may not give you exactly what you want, but He will give you what's best. And even when you fall under His corrective hand through disobedience, if you repent, He will reinstate you to a place of blessing. 'But what about the time I've wasted, the opportunities I've squandered, and the mess I've made of my life? Sometimes I wonder if I've fallen so low that even God cannot reach me.' No, there's hope for you. The Bible says, 'Behold, the Lord's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; nor His ear heavy, that it cannot hear.' (Isaiah 59:1 NKJV) After wasting all that he'd inherited from his father, the Prodigal Son returned home, penniless and embarrassed. All he wanted was three square meals and a job in the servants' quarters. But the moment he confessed his sin, his father called for the best robe, the fattest cow, the newest shoes, and a ring of sonship restoring him to his rightful place as a member of the family. Even under the crushing weight of the Old Testament Law, with demands that no one could live up to, God said, 'If a man steals an ox or a sheep...he shall restore five oxen for an ox and four sheep for a sheep.' (Exodus 22:1 NKJV) Now if God would do that for those who lived under the Law, how much more will He do for those He has redeemed? So you can go to Him today with confidence, knowing He's a God of restoration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before David became king, he returned to his hometown one day to find it burned to the ground. The Amalekites had come raiding and kidnapped all the people as slaves. His men were stunned and, in their despair at losing their families and needing to find someone to blame, they talked about stoning David. David found a quiet place and poured his heart out to God. And then God answered: 'Pursue, for you shall surely overtake them and without fail recover all.' (1 Samuel 30:8 NKJ) The Lord was about to return what was taken and more. Are you ashamed of the years you've wasted? Talk to God about them. Ask Him what to do. Remember this: whatever you've lost in the past, God can restore it. He promised the nation of Israel: 'I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten... You shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, and praise the name of the Lord your God, who has dealt wondrously with you; and my people shall never be put to shame.' (Joel 2:25-26 NKJ) He wants to restore us as a people too. He promises to restore our souls and to prepare a table for us in the presence of our enemies. (Psalm 23) Ever since Adam and Eve 'blew it' in Eden, God's desire and plan has been to restore to us what we have lost - our right relationship with Him. So come to Him today and let the restoration begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bible has a running theme of ruin and restoration. Adam and Eve mess up - and the rest of the story is God restoring what was lost in Eden. The world grows into a cesspit of sin and flood waters destroy it; God restores the earth through Noah. Abraham is on track to be a forgotten name in pre-recorded history; God gives him a child and restores him as the father of nations. Joseph is trafficked into slavery; God elevates him to a place of governmental power and restores his family to him. The Israelites are strangers in a strange land; God leads them to a Promised Land and restores their inheritance. The Philistines tower over the Israelites; God restores the balance of power through David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Old Testament is jam-packed with stories of God's restoring hand. And then Jesus arrives. God's own Son is abandoned to a cross. Three days later a restoring power like none ever seen in history before or since is unleashed. Resurrection runs as a theme through the New Testament. The power of life over death is still refreshing and revitalising the world today. Whatever mess we find ourselves in, God's hand of restoration is reaching in. When situations look dead and buried, God's resurrection power speaks life. And life abundantly.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Your God will come with ... recompense [restoration].' Isaiah 35:4 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'&lt;i&gt;Blessed are those who recognise they are spiritually helpless. The Kingdom of Heaven belongs to them&lt;/i&gt;.' (Matthew 5:3 GWT) It may not feel like a blessing to be spiritually helpless, but God has an excellent track record of giving blessings in those times. With your best intentions exhausted, it's perfect for God's best intentions to come into the picture. When you've run out of your own strength, God can more easily point you to His. Are you all out of steam today? Read this: 'Strengthen the weak hands, and make firm the feeble knees. Say to those who are fearful-hearted, &quot;Be strong, do not fear! Behold, your God will come with vengeance, with the recompense [restoration]...He will come and save you.&quot;' (Isaiah 35:3-4 NKJ)If you've got little to show for your best efforts, God will elevate you at the right time. If everything has just come crashing to the ground, God will re-attach wings to your hopes and throw them back into flight. He will give birth to new hope. He says in 1 Peter 1:3 ESV, 'Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great mercy, he has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.' Take heart: God is the God of restoration. The moment that you become empty of your own power, He'll remind you that His is much greater.&lt;/p&gt;

<fulltext><![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What's spiritual warfare then? *wheel out blackboard*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The things of this world around us are caused and affected by angels, demons and God's people, as part of a cosmic fight. It's big. It might sound... peculiar... but when we've accepted 'God' as one Spirit living in a realm beyond our sight, it follows that there may well be other spirits (small 's') to be aware of, in our real life...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's brush up on our battle plans: &lt;em&gt;Know your enemy&lt;/em&gt;. It's not as simple as 'God vs devil'. 'The accuser' (which is what 'Satan' means in the original Hebrew) isn't God's equal. God created everything, including the devil (the story is that Satan was a good angel before he rebelled against God), and God has ultimate power over everything. God allows Satan to exist and to act (Job 1:12), for reasons that we can trust are best in the long run. However, if Satan tried to take on God directly, there'd be no contest (check Revelation 12:7-9). So, his 'indirect' attacks on God = attacks on His precious children. Yep, us. Satan's out to destroy the things of God, and His people too. But. Whilst it's true that this needs to be taken seriously - GOD IS STRONGER.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In war, clever lies are more valuable than face-to-face fights. Don't be surprised if, in your situation, it seems like Satan's far more powerful. It's not true: it's a powerful lie of his strategy. The oldest known Christian creed is simply: '&lt;em&gt;Jesus is Lo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;rd&lt;/em&gt;'. In every place of fear or despair you find yourself in, remind yourself of that truth over and over, speak it out into the darkness. In our struggle against spiritual forces, we need to increase our faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right, enemy identified. Now there's good news coming...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) &lt;em&gt;Know the battlefield&lt;/em&gt;. It's you. God loves you, and wants you to know it. Satan wants to separate you from Him. The battle is over you. Your actions (which Satan can use to claim you) are based in your words, your words in your thoughts. This is one reason why praising God is so powerful: you're focusing on Him in your mind AND you're welcoming Him into your mind. That's an impenetrable cloud of beauty, that you were made for, and Satan can't get near.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) &lt;em&gt;Know your protection&lt;/em&gt;. The biggest and best protection you have is, simply, JESUS. When you've said 'yes' to Jesus, He's set you free from any claim by Satan that you sinned and now he owns you! You're not in his power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're not in his kingdom. You're in Christ, with all the freedom, the love, the peace of mind and the deepest joy that the 'armour of God' provides. This isn't a blueprint for you to charge into Satan's kingdom, SAS style, and rescue hostages. Except... Remember how the battlefield is you? By getting your relationship with God sorted, choosing against sin, and by wanting to see other people come to know that Jesus is for them (Romans 8:31), you're storming the most important of enemy-held territory. Ephesians 6:12-18 is a famous passage on the armour Jesus has provided for you. As you read about it, pray to re-position yourself into that armour every day this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, bad things happen and, despite how it looks, you're not actually under attack. You may be working through the consequences of some sinful mess you've made. (That happens. It doesn't mean God hasn't forgiven you. Forgiveness and consequences aren't the same thing. Dad might forgive you for crashing his car but it still has to get fixed.) God has a great plan for you. It may be He wants to build your strength in Him, or increase 'discipline' in you, to grow you, '...so that the proven genuineness of your faith - of greater worth than gold, which perishes even though refined by fire - may result in praise, glory and honour when Jesus Christ is revealed.' (1 Peter 1:6-7 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So: (1) &lt;em&gt;Be very careful what you blame on Satan!&lt;/em&gt; It could be the case that God is growing you. How to tell? Pray. Ask God for His protection. Turn away from anything that could give Satan a claim over you (in other words: 'repenting'). Declare, and act, that Jesus is Lord over your life. It doesn't matter what the cause of 'bad things happening' is, submitting yourself to Jesus is the way to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) &lt;em&gt;Discip&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;line is an aspect of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spiritual Warfare&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'.&lt;/em&gt; If you're living for God, keeping yourself from temptation, stepping out with Jesus when He prompts you to and lining up your priorities with His, then you're getting yourself further into His protection! And at the same time, you're arming yourself with the tools to help set other captives free! Like the army trains its soldiers, don't underestimate the warfare value of discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TV drip-feeds all sorts of things into your brain. Like ads. They're there to convince you your life could be better if only you had [&lt;em&gt;insert name of sweet new product here&lt;/em&gt;]. Before long, you'll find yourself thoroughly discontented, forgetting the truth of Philippians 4:19 that, &lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;God will provide all [your] needs&lt;/em&gt;.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or like sexy, sexy... sex. TV turns bodies into a spectacle all the time. Even in camera angles and scenes that linger on the desirability of other people, they're telling you how to focus your gaze. Don't be surprised if you find it much harder to, '&lt;em&gt;Fix your thoughts on what is true, and honourable, and right, and pure, and lovely, and admirable&lt;/em&gt;.' (Philippians 4:8 NLT) When we stop enjoying the goodness of life as God intended and instead see only products or bodies, our life shrinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success lies in daily routine. So, get to know God better through His Word and prayer. Make up your mind to be of service to somebody every day. Tackle a problem bigger than you. Encourage everyone you meet. Take the first step toward overcoming a bad habit. Do something for somebody who can't repay you. Be thankful for what you have. Ask for help when you need it. Give God the best of your day. And, one day, if you do not give up, you will harvest a multiplied blessing of what you have planted.&lt;/p&gt;

<fulltext><![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;Strap yourselves in. This might be a rough one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having the 'best of both worlds' sounds like a great life policy, but it depends on the 'worlds' we're talking about. God's really clear on certain 'worlds' not mixing: '...you cannot have a part in both the Lord's table and the table of demons.' (1 Corinthians 10:21 NIV) The thing is, our God is a jealous God. Not 'jealous' in the way that means God thinks, 'Ohh, I wish I had Mr. Smith's car,' but 'jealous' in the sense He doesn't want us flirting with evil - He wants us to devote ourselves totally to good and to Him. He deserves nothing less. And note, He wants it, at least in part, because He also knows that's the best possible situation for us. If we give space in our hearts to His enemy (the very force that's our real enemy too), He becomes jealous for that piece of our heart that should be His - for His glory, and for our protection...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time we give our best to something that is not of Him, we compromise - we compromise our love, compromise our holiness, and compromise our relationship with Him. And why should He stand for that? For God, compromising His love for us is not an option. He would never go there. The least we owe Him is our commitment to live our lives for Him, and only Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this means that, if there's a certain sin that you know you need to leave behind, do it. Today. Each time it rears its head pray out loud: 'God, I choose You and Your ways.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'I guide you in the way of wisdom and lead you along straight paths.' (Proverbs 4:11 NIV) Does the straight path mentioned here feel more like a straitjacket to you? The world jangles and hypnotises us with a bunch of keys that God doesn't want us to grab. And that's what the straight path is - avoiding the shiny, empty things of this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God wants us to walk that path because it's the way leading to a full life in Him. Living for the sparkly things of the world will damage your soul and rob you of that full life. And as Matthew 16:26 NLT says: 'What do you benefit if you gain the whole world but lose your own soul? Is anything worth more than your soul?'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a 'you're either with me or against me' deal with God. That's not because He's a cling-on - it's because what this world offers is a cling-on. And He's come to save us from it. The rich and famous don't have the answer. The people who say, 'Anything goes as long as it makes me happy' don't have the answer, either. Only God can satisfy your soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can get a clear sense in God of where you are, what you know, and what you want, you're well on your way to understanding and embracing the thing He put you on earth to do. Moses spent the first two-thirds of his life working out what God wanted him to do, trying to do things his own way, only to fail. But he had a heart for God, and a vision from God, and eventually he succeeded. So can you, if you keep on that straight path.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'But if you remain in Me and My words remain in you, you may ask for anything you want, and it will be granted.' John 15:7 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
]]></introtext>
<fulltext><![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;Amazing, eh! &lt;em&gt;...ask &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;for anything you want, and it will be granted...&lt;/em&gt; It makes God sound like a genie who will grant every wish. However let's not forget the key words that begin this verse: &lt;em&gt;...if you remain in Me...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a big condition. And there's more: &lt;em&gt;...if My words rem&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;ain in you...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact is, if you remain in God, your desires and prayers will become increasingly geared towards wanting more of His good, flourishing growth in your life and in the lives of those around you. God promises to provide all our needs; so, if you really do need something, believe God will provide. That's not as nice as it might sound. Think about it. If you really really need something, God will provide it. If you really need that top-of-the-range fresh-out pro-computer, God will make sure you receive it. But if you don't, if all you really need is a pen and paper, that may just be what you get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You've got to live knowing that whatever you get from God is the best for you at that time. Learn to rejoice in being given (only) what you need. His hand will reach to you, and sort out your provisions. But always seek to look for His face first, and His hand second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, now's the moment for a tough question: what do you want most in your life right now? Out with it. Now: does that line up with what you've read today? And, if not, what are you going to do about it?&lt;/p&gt;

]]></introtext>
<fulltext><![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;Very often if you're force-fed certain food growing up (broccoli, for instance), you will always have a gag reflex to that particular food (it's broccoli, isn't it?) If people just experience judgment from Christians and feel Bible-bashed in every conversation, it's hardly likely to make them want to 'taste and see that the Lord is good.' (Good, as in probably unlike broccoli). They'll avoid you like you're the plague (or even broccoli... ok, we'll stop going on about it now).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too often we make the mistake of presenting the Gospel without the love of God. The Bible's clear we should take the message to the world, but we're called to do that as real people, not as pop-up Christians. One really good way of pairing love and the Gospel is in your relationships. That provides a ready-primed basis of love for the seeds of salvation to grow in. We're called to love others. If God's in the life and love we share, we can't help but share Him too. That way it's all natural. When we're led by the Holy Spirit and we ask Him for opportunities to speak about God, everyday conversations are opened up to bigger opportunities than we can imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However sometimes we're called to share God's Gospel in a louder, bolder, non-relationship based way. If you're feeling that, pray, check with Scripture, make sure it's love-based and do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been said that all of human life is in the Psalms. Every emotion, every need that can be brought before God, every cry from the heart. Every kind of prayer that every human being could ever want to pray is here. They provide us with a means for being honest before God about whatever we're feeling. One of the most common prayers in the Psalms is an impatient question: 'How long, O Lord?'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all go through difficult times. Genuinely difficult times bring out genuinely difficult emotions. If a member of your family were seriously ill and you tried walking around with a fixed grin on your face, you'd be lying to yourself and hurting your family too - dealing with hard stuff doesn't mean we need to put on a tough exterior of 'everything's ok.' Not at all. It's important not to hide our emotions but ask God to help us handle them. The Psalms are our fall-back, our guide to the 'how' of expressing them. But more than this, the Psalms give us hope. Hope that someone else has been here before - and came out the other side. Hope that God is listening, and is big enough to take the worst you've got to throw at Him. Prayer turns negative energy into a powerful force for good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you're faced with a difficult problem, appreciate the chance to learn. Solomon said, '...the diligent make use of everything...' (Proverbs 12:27 NLT) Learn from your experience regardless of how hard it is, and remember, some of the world's greatest discoveries and breakthroughs resulted from a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we like to imagine we're superheroes. We picture ourselves charging in on a white horse to save our friends/city/world, while we fly God's banner and throw lavish gifts to the poor. We all want to hear from God, but when we don't, the temptation can be to run off on our own terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we feel like God has put us on hold, then the key is patience in prayer plus persistence in reading through his Word. These keys unlock the door to where we should all want to be: closer to Him. With visions or dreams, or even our own discipleship-process, we can be lured into gazing into ourselves. Instead of focusing on God, we can enjoy our own life's narrative and our epic plans. We can be tempted into thinking what heroes we are as we watch our character traits unfold like the facets of a jewel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When God takes His place at the centre of our lives, as the Highest King and the only jewel worth gazing at, everything falls into place healthily - we know we're not the Saviour, we're just blessed being helpers and privileged to be guides for those around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being enthusiastic isn't an issue, neither are our own ideas. The problem comes when we stop being sacrificial, stop being God-centred as well as others-centred and instead start making our own vision, dream or entrepreneurial spirit the centre of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

<fulltext><![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to prayer, God isn't moved by the quality or the quantity of your words. He's moved by a heart that spills the burdens of the day across the altar, exposing every worry to His power. Your confidence in prayer is not based on your 'can' - on your ability to speak, for instance, but rather on God's 'can' - His ability to hear and understand. He knows what you are trying to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old hymn goes: '&lt;em&gt;In seasons of d&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;istress and grief, my soul has often found relief. And oft escaped the tempter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;s snare, by thy return, sweet hour of prayer&lt;/em&gt;.' If you want that sort of comfort and control over yourself, give your 'distress and grief' up to God. Because whatever you give to God, He handles. What you keep, you burn yourself out trying to handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prayer gives you back the strength, energy to cope and right focus that everyday life takes away. When you pray, you're saying, 'Lord, I believe You're more competent to deal with this than I am, and I trust You to do it.' God will intervene on your behalf, just stay committed to Him. '&lt;em&gt;Commit your way to the Lord, trust also in Him, and He shall bring it to pass.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt; (Psalm 37:5 NKJ)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today step outside of routine, of the unhelpful bits of 'religion' that hold you back from naturally spending time with God. 'Pray as you can, not as you can't.'&lt;/p&gt;

<fulltext><![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today's verse makes it sound like God is hemming us in, locking us off, sealing us tight away from the world. One of the more literal Bible versions even says that God is 'besieging' us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can that be right? &lt;em&gt;Hmm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;m... yes&lt;/em&gt;. That is just what He's doing. There are two parts to this verse, and it's best really to hear them both as one. When we make a commitment not to sin, when we repent and say, 'God, I reject evil and choose your path,' we begin an agreement with Him. For the rest of our lives (for better or worse, richer or poorer, and so on...) His part of the agreement is to help us fight off sin and lift us up to live a better life. He's going to help us bat away wrong thoughts. He's going to give us a way of escape when temptation hits (so there's no excuse ever for saying, 'I couldn't help myself.') He's going to put safeguards around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't mean it's going to be a cruise. It's going to be tough sometimes. If we start down a route with dodgy thoughts or actions that He won't like - too right He's going to put up fences to shut us off. It is never to oppress us or abuse us - only ever for our good and for our proper freedom. Of course we can still ignore the fences but, if we're wise, we'll thank Him for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hand that holds you up is the same Hand that keeps you out of destruction's path - be careful when you teeter on its edge and don't ignore the prompt to head away from danger.&lt;/p&gt;

<fulltext><![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;God doesn't lie to us. God doesn't pretend that we're never going to have trouble in our life. In fact He even uses the word '&lt;i&gt;when&lt;/i&gt;', not '&lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt;': 'When a storm strikes...' (Proverbs 10:25), 'When you meet trials of various kinds...' (James 1:2 ESV), 'When we run into problems and trials...' (Romans 5:3 NLT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That might not sound like much comfort to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But coming right up behind it is some good news. God doesn't lie about Himself either. 'The name of the Lord is a fortified tower; the righteous run to it and are safe.' (Proverbs 18:10 NIV) God's 'name' speaks of His character, His reliability and His faithfulness. People without God are forced to be their own god (and that's a pretty terrifying thought, on many levels), relying on their own strength and wingspan to get them through life's turbulence. Those who love God can say, 'God is...always ready to help in times of trouble. And so, we won't be afraid! Let the earth tremble and the mountains tumble into the deepest sea. Let the ocean roar and...its raging waves shake the mountains.' (Psalm 46:1-3 CEV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If God won't lie about who He is (a safe place to hide), then He definitely isn't going to hold back who He is (YOUR safe place to hide) when you need Him.&lt;/p&gt;

]]></introtext>
<fulltext><![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;Christianity isn't just for sunny days. In fact, your faith shines all the brighter in the middle of a storm. God is like a rock-hard barrier; He's tougher than the storms that surround you. God's Word tells us in Psalm 18:2 ESV,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer... in whom I take refug&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;e...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;So trust in God and His Word and you'll be able to out-weather the nastiest downpour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at Job. He went through the wildest storms, and his only conversation with God kept him standing. He said: &lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;...I have treasured the words of His mouth more t&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;han my necessary food&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt; (Job 23:12 NKJ), which quite conveniently brings us onto the topic of fasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food-fasting is a biggie of an issue, and we're not going there today. However, fasting means much more than the odd dinnerless day. The history of the word shows that it really comes from 'to hold yourself in firm control', 'to hold fast' - an ability that we can gain by fasting from habits and activities just as much from fasting from food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scrolling down our newsfeeds whilst instagramming our breakfast can become just as 'necessary' to our lives as eating that breakfast (bringing to mind the age-old question: if you didn't Instagram it, did you really eat it?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Challenge: wouldn't that Facebooking-Tweeting-Instagramming-time be better spent checking-in with God and building self-discipline? Here's a fast of a different kind: Log out of all your social media accounts. Stay logged out for a day, a week, or even a month. Whenever you crave logging back in, use the time to pray. A social media fast may be just the thing to storm-proof yourself in prayer.&lt;/p&gt;

<fulltext><![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter how bad we feel, God is the great redeemer. Being overly self-focused on our mistakes can be our greatest weakness; a flaw in our make-up that sends us tripping up over our every self-doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you've felt it on your worst days: a string of nervy thoughts that keep you looking inward. 'Oh, what have I done wrong now...?'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the court's adjourned, God's judgment has come in. Paul the apostle wrote: &lt;i&gt;'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;I care very little if I am judged by you or by any human court; indeed, I do not even judge myself. My conscience is clear, but that &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;does not make me innocent. It is the Lord who judges me.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;'&lt;/i&gt; (1 Corinthians 4: 3-4 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Jesus we are seen as though we have His total spotlessness, God's judgment on us is, 'These are all good. I've got them. I'm for them.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul knew it, so he didn't even judge himself when he messed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn't mean ignoring our problems, or that there won't be consequences if we're constantly acting out a sin we know we shouldn't. But when we make mistakes and start a little internal storm, feel deserted by others or judged by them, we can say with Paul that &lt;i&gt;'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;... the Lord stood with me and gave me strength ... All glory to God forever and ever!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;(2 Timothy 4:18 NLT)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody likes to feel burdened by others, but check this out - God actually wants to be burdened by you. &lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Give your burdens to the Lord, and He will take care of you. He will not permit the godly to slip and fall.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(Psalm 55:22 NLT) We need to use one of our biggest assets: worship. Whatever the situation, make the stone-cold rock-hard choice to rejoice and be glad. Choose to worship God, who has given you the ultimate Guide (to life, the universe and everything) that will help you through your day. &lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt; (Philippians 4:6 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practical tip: Music as a form of worship can really help with squashing worry (BTW: Did you know there's far more to worship music than secular music... but let's discuss that another day...) One of the best ways to get to know another country's language is to learn songs in that language (think primary school Italian or Mandarin.) It's the same with learning not to worry. If you fill your head with songs that focus on Godly values, you'll learn His language of comfort and freedom. Not in a metaphorical way, but in a literal mind-renewing kind of way. It's worth having a favourite worship song on standby in your brain, for every time you start to feel majorly anxious. Even repeating it silently to yourself in your mind can help to bring calm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'&lt;em&gt;Mountaintop moments&lt;/em&gt;.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you've heard the phrase? Maybe you've even experienced them yourself - those epiphany moments when everything makes sense; when God feels close and your destiny seems clear. The Bible gives us plenty of evidence that God does spectacular things for His people on mountaintops. On Mount Moriah, He met with Abraham and Isaac. On Mount Horeb, He spoke to Moses through a burning bush. On Mount Sinai, He gave the Ten Commandments. On Mount Carmel, He sent down fire from heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after one such mountaintop experience, Moses showed the people that God isn't only to be found when you're feeling 'on top of the world'. Addressing the nation of Israel for the last time, Moses told them, 'There is no one like the God of Israel. He rides across the Heavens to help you... The eternal God is your refuge, and His everlasting arms are under you...' (Deuteronomy 33:26-27 NLT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's presence is always there for you when you look down. No matter how steep the valley you have to walk, no matter how sharp the descent, God's presence is deeper. Underneath you are His everlasting arms. The truth is: He's not just Lord at the top, He's also Lord at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

]]></introtext>
<fulltext><![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Do not forget to do good and to share...' (Hebrews 13:16 NLT) So what does 'doing good' mean, in these verses? A little giving to charity or a bit of schoolyard-style swap: 'You can have a piece of my chewing gum because you gave me a crisp yesterday'? There's that. Those things are ok, but not as the upper limits of what it means to 'do good to all.' It's easy giving when people give to you and taking when other people take. Then there's the life of Jesus - what we're called to be like. We must, often, choose between the world's 'good' and God's good (this choice happens everyday, not just in Sunday school lessons...) Francis of Assisi summed up what he thought living out God's 'good' looked like, in this prayer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lord, make me an instrument of your peace,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where there is hatred, let me sow love;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where there is injury, pardon;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where there is doubt, faith;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where there is despair, hope;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where there is darkness, light;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where there is sadness, joy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's different. It's difficult. But with God's life in you, you start to realise, and let out, your natural compassionate side. Living it out is when you are most truly yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Not ashamed&lt;/i&gt;. As a follower of Christ, that should be your testimony. Because you have placed your trust in Him you are able to say, 'I am not ashamed' of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) &lt;i&gt;His birth&lt;/i&gt;. Mary was His mother, but God was His Father. So He had no inherited sin or practised sin, so He met all of God's requirements to be our Saviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) &lt;i&gt;His miracles&lt;/i&gt;. He never demanded money in exchange for a miracle. Not one supernatural act was performed for selfish or showy purposes, but only to meet people's needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3) &lt;i&gt;His preaching&lt;/i&gt;. Even His enemies had to admit, '...No man ever spoke like this Man!' (John 7:46 NKJ) His words transform us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(4) &lt;i&gt;His claims&lt;/i&gt;. He said, '...He who has seen Me has seen the Father...' (John 14:9 NKJ) You see who God is by looking at Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(5) &lt;i&gt;His death&lt;/i&gt;. He bore your shame. You were morally and spiritually bankrupt. But He satisfied all of God's claims against you at the cross, writing 'Paid in full' across your account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(6) &lt;i&gt;His resurrection&lt;/i&gt;. His promise is, '...Because I live, you will live also.' (John 14:19 NKJ)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(7) &lt;i&gt;His mediator&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;-&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;ship&lt;/i&gt;. Picture this: when you fail, He stands before God on your behalf, offering His blood as atonement for your sin. If you saw Him now would you say, 'I am not ashamed of Jesus'?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Not ashamed&lt;/i&gt;. 'I am not ashamed of the Gospel, because it is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes...' (Romans 1:16 NKJ) Huge, right? Paul had a massive reputation for being a religious fanatic. But, you know what, he didn't let that stop him being true to what he believed. More than that, it didn't stop him stamping his foot and shouting out loud, 'I am not ashamed.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stuck with his faith in God, and his calling to share the Gospel, without even slightly diminishing in his enthusiasm. If anything, the insults made that fire burn brighter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's a good lesson to learn. No matter how you share your faith, you'll probably come up against someone who calls you a fanatic at some point. The only thing to do in that situation is to own it. Step up and say, 'Yeah, I'm a Christian. And &quot;I am not ashamed&quot; of it.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, take a sec to think about the last bit of that verse. 'The Gospel... is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes.' Well, that's too massive a thing to allow your own shyness to get in the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no room to be ashamed when people's very souls are on the line. Shout out for the sake of the Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is your big hope for the future? Do you hope to be famous one day? Or rich?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim Carrey said, 'I wish that everybody could get rich and famous and everything they ever dreamed of - so that they could see that's not the answer.' And he's one of Hollywood's richest and most famous actors! Fame is a hope that will ultimately disappoint. Wealth will disappoint too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Christians, our 'big hope' is this: 'Your Kingdom come' (Matthew 6:10) - a Kingdom where people are loved just as they are; a Kingdom where the cleaner is as honoured as the movie star; a Kingdom where the young aren't patronised and the old aren't ignored; where the grieving are comforted; where the lonely are befriended; a Kingdom where the thief and the victim are restored by justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God promises us that the 'big hope' of seeing that 'Kingdom come' is one that we can count on. And that, friends of &lt;em&gt;word4U2day&lt;/em&gt;, is why we don't need to be ashamed. Our hope is absolutely assured. It's shout-it-out-without-fear-of-ever-being-wrong guaranteed. So step up and claim it.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['... He will show you a way out...' 1 Corinthians 10:13 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Feeling lost isn’t new to the society we’re in. It’s the result of ‘doing our own thing’, which human beings have done at every point in history. Giving in to temptation ends up leaving you dejected and fed up. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;But: everyone gets tempted. Others have resisted; and so can you. God, your God, will show you a way out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Great&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;! But what does that help look like? The first practical tip is recognising which people and situations can cause you to fail badly. Be honest. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Secondly, get–outta–there. Turn over the channel and choose not to give in to your feelings. Make a phone call. Get accountable. Pray. Whatever you do, don’t just sit there and attempt to fight it with your own willpower. Maybe turning to someone outside of yourself feels the same as giving up. But the first thing Christianity teaches us that every one of us, on our own, will fail when left to our own devices. It’s totally valid—and a much better option—to look outside yourself and turn to God, even when all you feel is the desire to sin. Look to God, because He’s bigger than our own drive to do wrong. Turn to friends who you trust and who love you and will stand with you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;And, when you see one of these exit routes, take it. Ways out can be here one second and gone the next. Don’t miss out on stepping out of temptation, and into God’s better life. Telling another person you’re struggling with something can be hard, but worth its weight in gold (Check out James 5:16!) Pray for courage, and then make the move to connect.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Jer 25-27, Matt 25:14-23, Ps 31, Pro 8:34-36&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59292&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

Not by a hidden camera at the bottom of your street ... but by other people. And especially by God, ‘For the eyes of the Lord range throughout the earth...’ (2 Chronicles 16:9 NIV)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Footballers, celebrities and sadly even politicians provide society with shaky role models. Even though they’re shot into the limelight, it doesn’t take much scratching to discover all sorts of not–so–glamorous history lurking beneath the surface. When things are falling apart, it’s the church’s chance to offer an alternative. So the question you need to ask is—‘what are you modelling’?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;There are heaps of ways to bless people around you. Are your friends going through a tough patch? Take them out for a coffee and encourage them. Are your mates counting every cent? Give them a generous treat. Has your church leader asked you to serve tea and coffee? Go the extra mile: clean the kitchen while you’re at it. Darkness might be all around but your good deeds can penetrate any gloom. A little love goes a long way, ‘For all creation is waiting eagerly for that future day when God will reveal who His children really are.’ (Romans 8:19 NLT)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['You've been given... the privilege of suffering for Him.' Philippians 1:29 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may not be the kind of message that will see your non–church mates sprinting into a Sunday service, but Jesus never hid uncomfortable truth. ‘Taking up your cross’ wasn’t just poetic language. It meant something very visible for the people of the early church, and they knew it wasn’t nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was this kind of preaching that made the disciples question Jesus’ choice of message, but He didn’t shy away from it. The Bible seems to ask the impossible when it tells us to think of times of suffering as opportunities for punching the air in joy. It seems to have a different outcome in mind to the rest of us; ‘When your faith is tested, your endurance has a chance to grow… When your endurance is fully developed, you will be perfect and complete, needing nothing.’ (James 1:3 NLT) We want to be happy. But God wants us to see things from His point of view, leading to holiness. Then, our happiness isn’t based on shaky foundations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;As Dr Robert Pickles said: ‘Joy depends on Jesus, happiness depends on happenings.’ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secret? He saw things from God’s point of view, not his own. He had God’s perspective, right priorities and knew the best source of Power.&lt;strong style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;How’re you doing today? Take a look at whether you’re chasing ‘happiness’ or ‘joy’. Is contentment in your life dependent on happiness or Jesus?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Jer 31-32, Matt 25:31-46, Ps 72:12-20, Pro 9:7-9&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59297&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Then Moses said to the Lord...' Exodus 33:12 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Sound is important to our daily lives. But noise isn’t. Noise is classically defined as ‘unwanted sound’, and it’s a bigger problem today than ever before. How do we filter out the unwanted and keep the wanted? Maybe it’s the same with our Christian faith. Never before have we had as many resources, sermons, podcasts, e–books etc. How do we decide which to listen to or read? Even &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;word4U2day&lt;/em&gt; is a daily choice in all these resources.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;But does this make it easier? Not necessarily. With all this noise, God’s voice can be even harder to hear. Track back to Paul’s day and there was a similar problem: ‘Even though you have ten thousand guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the Gospel.’ (1 Corinthians 4:15 NIV) There were lots of people with helpful advice, but few people to be a ‘spiritual father’ (the type of really wise, holy individual who’d devote themselves to your growth). Track back another couple of thousand years and even Job had his own form of noise pollution: the world–famous ‘Job’s comforters’. It seemed like they were saying the right thing—after all, they loved Job. But in the end, they turned out to be just a bunch of nosey, noisy neighbours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning to hear God’s voice above all the others is vital. It takes dedication and practice to listen for Him, but (obviously), it’s the most worthwhile Voice you’ll ever hear.&lt;strong style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;So if you&lt;strong style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;feel you’re in a one–sided relationship, where God never speaks to you, talk to a Christian you reckon can help and ask how you can change that. It’s so worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Jer 33:1-36:26, Matt 26:1-13, Ps 32, Pro 9:10-16&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59298&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['... but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.' John 16:33 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bible is surprisingly full of people having really tough times. It seems that after thousands of years of getting to know God, mankind still hasn’t been able to get its collective head around our good, loving God allowing us to face ‘times of trial’. It’s a tough question in theory, but it’s much harder again when you’re living the tough times in reality. Bad things happening in life is a sad reality of living in a fallen world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not–so–‘news’–flash: following Jesus is not a ticket for a life free from pain. Jesus wasn’t lying when He said, ‘Here on earth you will have many trials and sorrows.’ (John 16:33 NLT) But He doesn’t stop there. He goes on to say, ‘But take heart, because I have overcome the world.’ This is the good news in a nutshell. Not only did God so love the world that He gave us Jesus, but we can overcome trials and sorrows with Him. It’s all to do with how you respond. Apparently, if you break a bone in your leg, the bone will actually heal stronger than it ever was originally; the break will heal, then another layer of bone will grow over the area, reinforcing it. That’s cool. For our hearts, being broken could be the start of finding your strength in God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Gal 5:22, 2 Pet 3:3-15, Matt 5:39, 1 Sam 25:1-42 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59300&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['... God intended it all for good...' Genesis 50:20 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Sometimes bad things happen even to those we’d call ‘good people’. Knowing a Sovereign God who could command a whole legion of angels to meet your every whim, but for some reason doesn’t, might be frustrating at times. So why doesn’t God sort out all our problems? It’s not that God isn’t bothered by your pain. A big part of the reason is that God wants to bring us closer to Himself. He wants us to have good qualities that reflect Him; He wants character, perseverance and hope.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Instead of gift–wrapping those qualities and handing them to us on a plate, He puts us in situations where we have to develop them. Those situations are not usually ‘fun’. God’s using your exact situation to discipline you: to &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;disciple &lt;/em&gt;you. ‘No discipline is enjoyable while it is happening—it’s painful! But afterward there will be a peaceful harvest of right living for those who are trained in this way.’ (Hebrews 12:11 NLT)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;When you pray for blessings, you might be thinking of achievements, money, or that special someone stepping right into your life. But there’s more to be gained in this life than those things: God sees the bigger picture of your character development. The Beatitudes in Matthew 5 give an alternative definition of ‘blessed’. Special mentions go to the poor in spirit and the persecuted. When we do eventually leave this life, and meet God face to face, what will we actually get to take with us? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Jer 36:27-40:16, Matt 26:14-25, Ps 25:1-7, Pro 9:17-18&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59301&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...My grace is sufficient for you...' 2 Corinthians 12:9 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;The story of Joseph (you know, the guy with the rainbow–coloured dreamcoat) is a classic. But what makes the story worthy of being made into a musical production that played on New York’s Broadway and London’s West End theatres? Maybe it’s because the hero doesn’t sail into his destiny without a bumpy ride along the way. Kidnapping, enforced slavery, false accusations and prison all spring up as road–blocks in the life of the man who had been promised greatness. Circumstances went from bad to worse, then to worse still, as he rode his personal ancient–Egyptian rollercoaster. But there was one key recurring truth: ‘The Lord was with Joseph.’ (Genesis 39:2 NIV)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Joseph might have wanted things simple and easy. He might have revelled in watching his brothers bow down to him in awe—without any of the hard stuff on the way. But God had a bigger plan for him, one that focused on Joseph becoming the man God wanted him to be: someone capable of leading a nation. He wouldn’t have been that way without the challenges. He also wouldn’t have had the opportunity to experience God’s presence along the way. Over the thirteen years of suffering, God was growing Joseph. He was teaching Him a spiritual paradox that says it’s when you’re weak that you can fully allow God to be God. As God said to Paul, ‘My grace is all you need. My power works best in weakness.’ (2 Corinthians 12:9 NLT)&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes;&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;So don’t pray for tasks that match your gifting, but for gifting that will match your tasks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Jer 41-44, Matt 26:26-46, Ps 25:8-15, Pro 10:1-3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59302&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['They nominated... Barsabbas...and Matthias.' Acts 1:23 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;The early Church was full on, packed with faithful disciples, ready to lay down their lives for God! They were totally in tune with God, right? Right! (Well, one or two exceptions—but even they were examples for the rest.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;But yet, despite being ‘in tune’ with Him, God was unpredictable. His Holy Spirit ‘blows wherever it pleases’ (John 3:8). Which means even your pastor or minister or chaplain hasn’t got Him figured out! You see, sometimes, we might go the way &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; think right, but God will steer us somewhere else.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Case study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;. The disciples weren’t sure what to do. Judas was gone; the team of apostles was a man short. A quick replacement was in order, so ‘Barsabbas and Matthias’ were nominated (two leadership hotshots). To decide who’d get the role, they use an ancient method of voting. As a result, Matthias got chosen. Who was he? Um, no idea (he’s never mentioned again)! But Barsabbas, the man who didn’t win the vote, went on to be a pioneer in teaching.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Did the disciples get it wrong? Was Matthias the right man for the job? Whether they got it right or wrong actually isn’t so important. Matthias might have gone on to do great, unrecorded, things. What matters is the fact they were seeking Him, and God honours that. Are you after God? Whether or not you hear His voice or feel His nudge, you’ll still see His Lordship. So write down three things you’d like God to change in you. Pray about them, and look back in a couple of months to see how He’s answered! (It might not be the way you expected, but that doesn’t matter!) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Jer 45-48, Matt 26:47-56, Ps 25:16-22, Pro 10:4-7&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59303&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Blessed are the poor in spirit...' Matthew 5:3 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Ok, sometimes our relationships aren’t perfect. We’re definitely not just talking about that guy/girl you like, your parents, or your friends or class/work–mates. We’re talking about&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt; anyone &lt;/em&gt;who has an influence in your life. What can we do to build good relationships: how can we be totally sure others can confidently build trust and ‘Do Life’ with us?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;A clash of personalities or testing circumstances can seem to put real strain on relationships. Although we’re talking about a broad range of people you know today, we think Jesus covered a lot of ground with the ‘Beatitudes’. If you aren’t familiar with them, have a read of Matthew 5. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;How about four key points to blessed relationships? (1)&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt; Be humble&lt;/em&gt;. Self–promoting and always demanding &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;your &lt;/em&gt;rights brings misery, while humility, self–denial and considering others’ needs bring happiness. (2) &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Be meek (restraining your power).&lt;/em&gt; Maybe even hold back those harsh words that contain a bit of truth? (3) &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Be merciful.&lt;/em&gt; You know when you’ve been hurt and left out? Don’t seek revenge from that. Instead, contribute to an atmosphere of forgiveness. (4) &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Be a peacemaker.&lt;/em&gt; During the week, if your brilliantly–genius ideas get ignored, don’t sweat. The ability to let go of our pride and not ‘win’ approval decreases the chance of conflict. Jesus was pretty good at that sort of stuff, being God and all. There’s definitely some stuff we can apply here to make the most of our time with others. Is there something you need to let go of in a relationship? Holding grudges is a killer—face up to the challenge of making peace today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Jer 49-50, Matt 26:57-68, Ps 50:1-15, Pro 10:8-10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59304&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Boils, bankruptcy, bereavement. What kept Job going? Even his wife had lost faith, ‘Are you still holding on to your integrity? Curse God and die!’ (Job 2:9 NIV) Yes, he was holding on. Job demonstrates a grit, determination and trust in God unparalleled in the rest of the Old Testament. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Was Job cold–hearted to be able to struggle on when his family were killed? Not a bit (flip to Job 1:20). Instead, Job knew that God was good, faithful and powerful. And even if he didn’t know exactly what was going on, no worldly thing was going to distract him from that, even when his world was crumbling down around him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;‘I came naked from my mother’s womb, and I will be naked when I leave. The Lord gave me what I had, and the Lord has taken it away. Praise the name of the Lord!’ (Job 1:21 NLT) &lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Now &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;that’s&lt;/em&gt; real God–perspective.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Even when it looked like God had walked away, gone on holiday and turned off the phone, Job chose God, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;‘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;For I know &lt;span style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; my Redeemer lives, and He shall stand at last on the earth; and after my skin is destroyed, this &lt;em&gt;I know,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;that in my flesh I shall see God…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;’ (Job 19:25–26 NKJ) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Job didn’t have a fake smile fixed to his face but, deep in his heart, he chose to trust God.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Thousands of years later, that Redeemer was born and His name was (and is) Jesus.

<introtext><![CDATA['I will see God.' Job 19:26 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Death is a fact of life. Your attitude towards it, however, is where your Christian faith could come into its own. When you fully understand that this life is not all there is, you’re free from the fear of whether or not there’s an ‘afterlife’. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Peter describes the Christians he’s writing to as ‘temporary residents and foreigners.’ (1 Peter 2:11 NLT) He was reminding them that they didn’t really belong to this world anyway. Their real home was with God. No matter what it says on your passport, your true citizenship is Heaven. That means our loyalty should be to God’s truth, His way of life and to His people. That should put your hissy fit about not being able to watch the TV programme you want into perspective. When you put ‘set apart–ness’ (or ‘consecration’) into practice, you probably will feel like an alien in a foreign land. ‘Not fitting in’ is par for the course if you want to be a true disciple.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;But death isn’t the end of the matter. Christ offers us eternal never–ending life. ‘Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is your victory? O death where is your sting?’ (1 Corinthians 15:54–55 NLT) Jesus won the biggest battle ever waged because He took your place for you to win eternal life for you. That’s worth living, and dying, for. Check out the whole of 1 Corinthians 15 to get a fuller idea of what the Bible says about death and resurrection.

<introtext><![CDATA['...Well informed, quick to understand... qualified to serve...' Daniel 1:4 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;We all want to be a good witness. Or at least, we &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; want to be. You’ll probably have opportunities to share your faith with people at school or uni or work or anywhere else you find yourself. But what better way to shine than by the example you set? Aiming to be the best for others speaks a thousand words. It shows your faith has meaning and that you’ve got deep roots.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Daniel was the kind of person who had made up his mind not to conform to the pattern of the world around him, but to be changed by the renewing of his mind to discern God’s will for him (check out Romans 12:2). God favoured him, and was working on his behalf, but Daniel had to play his part too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;In a strange new place, he worked hard to adapt to a new culture. Culture alone wasn’t the enemy; his first battleground was compromise. He didn’t use his God–given commission as an excuse to not put any work in. He was polite, determined and steadfast in doing right. Daniel knew who he was, because he understood &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Whose&lt;/em&gt; he was. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;More tests came along Daniel’s path (including his friends being thrown into a fiery furnace and some hungry lions), but his faithfulness in the small decisions prepared him for the life–changing stories that we read about today. Hard work is worth it. Give some thought to this question: has there been any unhealthy compromise in your life recently? How can you change this?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood Palm Sunday: Matt 21:1-16, Ps 118:19-29 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59307&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['We love because He first loved us.' 1 John 4:19 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Richard Wurmbrand was kidnapped, imprisoned and tortured for 14 years under Communist Romanian rule. He tells a story about the torture of a fellow Christian: ‘A minister I had heard of in Romania had been horribly beaten and was thrown back into the cell with the other prisoners. He was half–dead, with blood streaming from his face and body. As some of the prisoners washed him, others cursed the communists. Groaning, the minister said, “Please, don’t curse them! Keep silent! I wish to pray for them.”‘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Those who tortured the minister had not asked for forgiveness. Nor had they shown remorse. And they would continue to beat him the next day. Yet the minister summoned up the ability to pray for them. He asked God to bless rather than curse his enemies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;It’s one thing to agree with Jesus’ teachings; it is another to carry them out whilst blood seeps from your head. So maybe you’ve not been physically tortured, but perhaps emotionally you have. Maybe your heart feels black and blue. Maybe the last thing you want to do is pray rather than curse. Ask God for the courage to love your enemies—if you hate them, they have already defeated you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;This &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; mean, by the way, that if someone is hurting you, it’s ok to let it keep happening. Forgiveness isn’t about putting yourself in harm’s way. Talk to someone about the problem and get help.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Acts 1:1-3:10, Matt 27:11-18, Ps 43, Pro 10:17-18&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59308&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['... Forgiving each other, just as... God forgave you.' Ephesians 4:32 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Forgiving isn’t easy. It takes hard work, and determination, and the bigger the wound, the harder it is to forgive. So how about some practical ‘How–To–Forgive’ tips to help you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;(1)&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt; Deciding to ‘re–forgive’ every time old thoughts of unforgiveness pop into your head.&lt;/em&gt; It’s a question of your will deciding to forgive, and forgive and forgive. Ask yourself if you have really forgiven them? Ask God to help you with those difficult memories, and decide to make peace with them until you feel the Holy Spirit doing its work in your heart. (2) &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Release poisoned relationships&lt;/em&gt;—if you break free of a situation, keep a watch for people trying to drag you back. They may not even realise they’re doing it, but it’ll block your moving on. (3) &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Don’t be discouraged that it’s not instantly fixed. &lt;/em&gt;Just as your salvation was immediate but you have to walk out your sanctification, so the release of your forgiveness is immediate but you have to walk out your healing. (4) &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Living free from the burden of resentment and the toxicity of unforgiveness is a choice followed by a series of choices&lt;/em&gt;. It’s a step–by–step thing, but with every step, it gets easier, and your feet get lighter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Finally, ‘It is for freedom that Christ has set us free…’ (Galatians 5:1 NIV) God is in the business of freedom, and when you free someone or something that’s been a burden on you, the freedom you receive from Him for yourself overflows. So take whatever hurtful situation springs to mind as you pray today and use these tips to walk out your release.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood Passover: Exo 12:1-14, 1 Cor 11:23-29, Ps 69:7-21, Deut 21:22-23 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59309&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will serve before kings...' Proverbs 22:29 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Irritating, isn’t it? Clearly you’ve got the voice that should be heard by millions on iTunes, and yet nobody has given you the opportunity. Or maybe you look at the stars of the screen and know you could do a better job if opportunity would throw you a lucky break. And maybe, just maybe, you’ve snored your way through one too many Sunday sermons, so you just know you could lead this church better than the current guy does. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;So why are you Billy Nobody when you could clearly run the world far more effectively given the chance? Why isn’t God promoting you to Vice President of the Universe? Could the answer lie in the Luke 16:10? ‘If you are faithful in little things, you will be faithful in large ones...’ In other words, ‘you’ve got to start somewhere!’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;So before you lead millions in worship on CD, think about singing honestly to God alone in your bedroom. Or joining the choir. Before you start planning to lead a world–renowned church, try volunteering to clean your current church toilets. If you are faithful with a toilet brush now, you might just be faithful serving a large church in the future. In God’s eyes, it’s not about glam jobs, only faithful servants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...The curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom...' Matthew 27:51 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Brief history lesson: Long ago there was a time when the high priest would go through the temple curtain to enter the ‘Holy of Holies’ (where God’s presence was) once a year. Once. And the only thing that qualified him to be there was the blood of a sacrificed lamb—nobody can physically come before God by themselves without purification. The blood was placed above the Ark of the Covenant. What’s that? Well, it contained God’s perfect standards, the ten commandments (and yes, we’ve all broken them). Now fast–forward to the moment when Jesus died on the cross. The blood of the ‘lamb’ was shed again, for us. The Bible states that the temple curtain, separating man from God, was torn in two (Matthew 27:51). And this is nothing less than wonderful news for us: when we reach out for God, when we seek God with honest hearts, He &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;will &lt;/em&gt;reach back for us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Which means that factually, without a doubt, no matter how you’re feeling today, you &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; ‘come boldly to the throne of our gracious God.’ (Hebrews 4:16 NLT) Even if you feel undeserving (and we all are), it doesn’t affect how much God longs for you to reach for Him. God doesn’t reside behind a curtain, He’s in us. HINT: ‘Your body is a temple.’ (1 Corinthians 6:19) So come boldly to the throne and ask God for what’s on your heart.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Acts 6-7, Mt 27:26-32, Ps 75, Prov 10:22-23&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59311&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...&quot;Lord, remember me when You come into Your Kingdom.&quot;...Jesus said... &quot;Today you will be with Me in Paradise.&quot;' Luke 23:42-43 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;‘Good Friday’ always seems a strange way to refer to Jesus’ death. The ‘Good’ part is what Jesus dying on a cross achieves: that, through faith in Jesus anybody—&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;absolutely anybody&lt;/em&gt;—can stand before Father God and be declared righteous. All because Jesus gave His life for you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;So, to take a closer look at that today, we’re looking at the criminal on the next cross over. What better demonstration of God’s grace to us as undeserving humanity than seeing a guy who actually &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;deserved&lt;/em&gt; his punishment being told he’ll be in Heaven with Jesus later that day? No action required. Not even a weeping confession. Just this: recognition of who Jesus was, and one request: ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;...remember&lt;/em&gt; me?’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;Here’s why this is important to you: are you like that guy on the cross, all hope gone, and somehow deserving what you got? Turn your head to the side and look at Jesus taking everything you deserve. He’s offering you paradise.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;Or do you know someone that’s ‘too far gone’ to ever be saved? The criminal was, literally, at the end of his life. He was a thief who’d made some ‘not exactly wise’ decisions and, if he had any friends or rellys who cared about what happened to him, you’d have understood if they’d given up hope... and yet... ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;...remember&lt;/em&gt; me?’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;It’s not too late. For you, or someone you’re praying for. Keep praying. In fact, pray today as you read through the Gospel story of Jesus’ crucifixion (John 17–19), remembering what He has done to make it possible for you to be part of God’s family. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood Good Friday: Gen 22:1-18, Mt 27:33-56, Ps 22, Is 53&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59313&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

It’s not the start of a joke, it’s a true story. Last year, an electronics store actually made applicants dance for each other as part of their interviews for sales jobs. ‘I just felt so embarrassed and uncomfortable,’ said Alan, one of the job hopefuls. ‘I ended up dancing and doing rubbish robotics in my suit in front of a group of strangers.’ Ouch.&lt;br /&gt; Poor Alan experienced the way shame makes us feel: alone, exposed, powerless. He said he felt like a fool and wished the ground would swallow him up. Who would willingly choose to feel shame in that way? Who, if they had the power, wouldn’t say ‘Stop! Enough!’?&lt;br /&gt; Jesus, that’s who. Isaiah writes, ‘He was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and…he did not open his mouth.’ On the cross, in the face of all that shame, of brutal torture and gut–wrenching anguish, Jesus could have defended Himself. He could have appealed to legions of angels to rescue Him. All it would have taken was a word. But He chose not to. He instead chose to empty Himself of His power (Philippians 2:7-8) to fulfil the perfect plans of His Father. He did it for you.&lt;br /&gt; So, take some time now to thank Jesus for His willingness to humble himself so that we could know freedom. What does His example mean for you in your life?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Acts 8-9, Mt 27:57-66, Ps 130, Prov 10:24-26&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59314&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He made a public spectacle of them...' Colossians 2:15 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;Can you imagine the victory laps Satan and his cronies were doing the day Jesus was crucified? They really thought that they had wrecked the greatest mission in history. They were convinced they had snuffed out the salvation plan of the Father. Lying in a cold dark tomb was their evidence—God’s only Son, broken, bruised, beaten.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;But the deceiver was deceived. As Philip Yancey writes in &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;The Jesus I Never Knew&lt;/em&gt;, ‘In the most ironic twist of all history, what Satan meant for evil, God meant for good. Jesus’ death bridged the gap between a perfect God and a fatally–flawed humanity. On Good Friday God defeated sin, routed death, triumphed over Satan, and got His family back… He took the worst deed of history and turned it into the greatest victory… Between the cross and the empty tomb hovers the promise of history: hope for the world, and hope for each of us who lives in it.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;&gt;At the cross, Paul writes in Colossians 2, Jesus cancelled the record of wrongs against us, nailing them up. And He disarmed the devil and all the spiritual rulers and authorities at his command, nailing them down. He comprehensively triumphed over Satan. So, as you celebrate with God’s people today, keep Jesus’ victory over your sin and over Satan at the front of your mind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood Easter Sunday: 1 Cor 15, Mt 28:1-10, Lk 24:1-12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59315&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['And at midnight a cry was heard...' Matthew 25:6 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus told a parable (that you might find isn’t mentioned all too often) about some bridesmaids waiting for the groom to arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five of them were wise, and five of them were foolish. Having a burning lamp was a requirement for taking part in the wedding feast in those days, yet the foolish bridesmaids didn’t have enough oil, so they tried to grab some from the wise ones. They replied ‘‘We don’t have enough for all of us... buy some for yourselves’ (v9). So the foolish bridesmaids had to trot off for oil. But while they were gone, the wedding got underway and the door was locked and bolted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s four lessons from the foolish bridesmaids: (1) &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;It’s wrong to depend on others&lt;/em&gt;. The fact your mum and dad / church family are Christians won’t on its own make you a believer. You need to seek God for yourself. (2) &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;It’s stoopid to be last–minute about important things.&lt;/em&gt; Are you putting off saying a full ‘yes’ to Jesus until you’re a bit older or you know more? (3)&lt;strong style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;God’s judgment is final&lt;/em&gt;. ‘..the door was shut… “Open the door for us!” But He replied, “I tell you the truth, I don’t know you.”’ (Matthew 25:10–12 NIV) (4) &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Morality alone won’t get you into Heaven.&lt;/em&gt; ‘God saved you by His grace when you believed. And you can’t take credit for this; it is a gift from God.’ (Ephesians 2:8 NLT) Being generally nice unfortunately doesn’t make up for the wrong we’ve done; Jesus does. Are you fully trusting in God, or is your oil half–empty?... Meaning: are you not fully committed? Are you like someone trying to walk around with your feet pointing in different directions? See how easy it is (not!) and ask yourself, ‘Do I need to sort out my relationship with God?&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['While the bridegroom was delayed, they all slumbered...' Matthew 25:5 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Let’s look a bit more into the story that Jesus told about the wise and foolish bridesmaids. In verse 5 it says this, ‘The bridegroom was a long time in coming, and they all became drowsy and fell asleep.’ So we’re all on the same page, the bridegroom in this story represents Jesus. Your average wedding service tends to involve us waiting anxiously for the bride to walk down the aisle, yet here, the bride (representing the true church) is waiting for the groom. Jesus, the person we’ve been waiting for, whom we depend on, is coming soon (Romans 13:11), yet we’re fast asleep.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;What do you think Jesus is getting at here? In 1 Thessalonians 5:6–8 it says, ‘...let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober... putting on faith and love.’ Are we preparing ourselves, actively seeking God on earth, or chasing after what will ultimately not count for much? (The answer’s probably found in the way you spend your time).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;‘At midnight a cry was heard: Behold, the bridegroom is coming; go out to meet him!’ (Matthew 25:6 NKJ) Midnight? Eh? There’s no time God excludes (or is excluded from). Seeking after Him needs to be a whole–of–life endeavour—there’s never a ‘time–out’. So get wise today! Wake up and be prepared for Jesus by tucking into His Word.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Acts 12-13, Mk 1:1-13, Ps 103:13-22, Prov 10:30-32&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59319&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['These things happened to them as examples...for us...' 1 Corinthians 10:11 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Over the next two days we’re comparing and contrasting two Bible characters, with a view to draw out some juicy wisdom. First, Mr. Samson. He was the product of a miracle (see Judges 13), brought up by godly parents and most famous for his supernatural strength. If he was the beefy, all–round superman of a guy that we often see depicted, he’d probably be all over your Twitter feed (#strongmansamson). Yet he ended up failing miserably (see Judges 16). Why? He didn’t pray. Most of the time, he relied on his own strength and wisdom rather than God’s. The only time there’s a mention about Samson praying was when he was in trouble. Ring a bell? We can’t be surprised if we live according to our will only, then wonder why we’re in a mess!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;There’s another big decision–making lesson we can learn from him. Rather than being led by God’s Word, he was led by his feelings to marry the wrong woman, who eventually betrayed him. Being led by your emotions before checking in with God might feel ‘right’ for a short while, but never turns out too well. Samson sought revenge, but Joseph prayed for those who hurt him. He was motivated by greed, whereas Joseph worked hard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Why mention these things? If it can happen to Samson, it can happen to us! Samson’s story is a good pointer to keep our God–given strengths in check... and check–in with God instead. What do people say you’re good at? Today make time to thank God for that, and devote it to glorifying Him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Acts 14-15, Mk 1:14-22, Ps 16, Prov 11:1-2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59333&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

He wasn’t perfect, but we can certainly learn from the way he dealt with misfortune and rejection (compared to Samson’s set up in life), temptation (compared to Samson’s head–firstness), and his attitude.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;If you’re at all familiar with their stories, you’ll have noticed that Samson had everything going for him, while Joseph... well, didn’t. He didn’t get off to a great start; his brothers didn’t like the favour God had for him at all and they sold him into slavery. But Joseph forgave them (that’s massive), acted in faith that God was with him (&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Flashback to April 15&lt;/em&gt;) and ended up helping his family out big time during famine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He lived with determination to stay on track with God (Genesis 39:9). Yet it was because of this rejection that the married woman falsely accused him—and it was this that landed him in prison... where he became one of the leaders! (God was with this boy). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Comparison time: Samson has a position of authority... Joseph ends up in prison. Samson goes for the girl his lust tells him to (and it ends badly)... Joseph resists temptation, and through his hard–times never turns his back on God... Who had it planned for Joseph to end up as Prime Minister. Samson lived out of his own strength, turning to God when times got hard. Joseph lived, trusting in God despite his situations, with massively different results.&lt;strong style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The Joseph story (Genesis 37–46) is about staying true.

<introtext><![CDATA['...Father...Take this cup away from Me...' Mark 14:36 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;How do we pray when we don’t feel in any way holy? Nobody feels incredibly devout 24/7. Motivation is important—we can’t always ride off the back of a wave of intense spiritual emotion. Sometimes, it’s clear and sunny outside, and you know you still have to fit in your morning’s fifteen minutes with God. Sometimes, the last thing you’ll want to do is listen to your depressed friend and quietly ask God to help them (while you could be happily zoning out to your favourite playlist.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;CS Lewis said, ‘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt; must say my prayers today whether I feel devout or not; but that is only as I must learn my grammar if I am ever to read the poets.’ Yeah, poetry was the thing that got Lewis’s tastebuds tingling, but feel free to replace that with your own activity of choice... The point is that the ‘drudge’ of learning grammar (or lifting weights, or learning guitar chords) changes you. Not just in patience. You grow closer to an experience that is beyond flat, normal, just-getting-by human life. You start to change inside. This is especially true with prayer. Even when it looks like practice, speaking words to an empty room, you will be opening your life to God. And God, because He is good, will come along and meet you, because you have tried. Maybe you’re thinking: ‘Don’t believe the hype.’ Well, the core of prayer &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; very exciting—conversation with the Creator!—but in reality it doesn’t always feel like a life–changing experience. That’s ok. What’s your usual prayer routine? Go do that, even if it feels quiet. Don’t have one? Have a look at Greg Laurie’s &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Becoming a Person of Prayer&lt;/em&gt; at ucbdirect.com.au &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Does the clay dispute with the one who shapes it, saying, 'Stop, You're doing it wrong!' Isaiah 45:9 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Ok, sensitive topic time. We don’t &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; exactly enjoy what we see in the mirror. Let’s face it, despite anything we might be taught in church about self–acceptance, it’s not easy to suddenly appreciate all your God–given features. Whatever you’ve inherited, there are some spiritual truths worth your time: (1) &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Truly resenting your looks puts you at odds with God the Creator&lt;/em&gt;. The Bible says, ‘You have no right to argue with your Creator. You are…a clay pot shaped by a potter. The clay doesn’t ask, “Why did you make me this way?”’ (Isaiah 45:9 NIV) God intends us to carry His presence, as clay containers. We’re not designed to just be a fancy ornament on display.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;(2) Comparing your outtakes to someone’s highlight reel will never give you a true perspective on...well… humankind. Just look to the famous people who seem to be dropping like flies; we ALL desperately need God to truly live. And, although it can be hard, let’s make sure that our conception of a ‘good’ appearance isn’t decided by what we see on our screens and billboards. An airbrushed model isn’t a role model. ‘…They are only comparing themselves with each other, using themselves as the standard of measurement. How ignorant!’ (2 Corinthians 10:12 NLT) Be careful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;So, if we aren’t to compare ourselves to others, what option is left? Only one—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;God!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt; ‘…look only to Jesus, the One who began our faith and who makes it perfect…’ (Hebrews 12:2 NCV) When we’re focussed on Him, the rat–race for popularity and good image will grow ‘strangely dim in the light of His glory and grace’. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;&lt;br style=&quot;color: windowtext;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Psalm 139:14 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Ten truths about God to really get today:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Above and behind all Creation, behind all its ingenious design and mind–blowing beauty, is the God of my Bible./ My God has the sort of character that cares about every sparrow, every hair on a head, and every single person, personally. / My God planned me, loved me before He’d even made me, and delighted in hand–crafting me, every single bit of me. (see Psalm 139:13–15) / I was created with such generous joy for a specific purpose, that He knew would be only for me, in my time and place. / He created me &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;knowing&lt;/em&gt; I’d screw it all up. And knowing my sin in advance, He &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; chose me, and chose to love me, to create me, and to save me. (see Revelation 13:8) / God is the ONLY one who has the right information and the power to judge me, my abilities, my value and my appearance. / He judges me worthy of His &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; (1 John 4:19–21), worthy of dying for me so that I could know His love, here and in Heaven. / God loves me. Actually. God loves me. / All this is true fact, not a list of nice thoughts, daydream escapism or cheap self–help. All this is fact about God, not opinion about me, and because of this, its truth is more real than any words or feelings that come against me. / Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. And if God is for me, who can be against me? (Romans 8:31)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Gal 5:22 Lk 10:25-37 Eph 4:31-32 Gen 50:15-21&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59326&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Make every minute count.' Ephesians 5:16 CEV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;The Bible tells us that there is a ‘time for everything.’ (Ecclesiastes 1:3 NCV) What are you going to do with the time given to you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;In the third stage of its life, a caterpillar forms a chrysalis and, inside, mushes all its body parts into gross bug goo (yeah, don’t google ‘inside a chrysalis’...) When it’s strong enough, it pushes its way out of the shell as a butterfly and uses its wings for the first time. Rush this process, try to help the butterfly out by opening the chrysalis early, and you’ll be releasing an underdeveloped bug hybrid with teeny wings. Also you’ll be killing its chances of surviving out in the wild. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;We must be wise with our time. It’s tempting to take shortcuts even when you sense a chance to grow, but rather than try to rush through everything, play the long game. Put the slow work into character–forming and you’ll make something great out of your life. All of the ingredients we get in our life are given to us by Him. Some learning experiences we choose, and others, both good and bad, are thrust upon us. The story of who you are is written in your scars as well as your good experiences. They’re not coincidences. God is crafting and making you and building into you the ability to fly. So don’t shrink back into the goo, make something wonderful out of it all. Yes, God has ‘...made everything beautiful in its time.’ (Ecclesiastes 1:9 NLT) Think: have you even considered this might already be &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Acts 22-23, Mk 2:13-22, Ps 144:9-15, Prov 11:12-13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59328&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The tongue that brings healing is a tree of life, but a deceitful tongue crushes the spirit.' Proverbs 15:4 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;We each say around ten thousand words every single day. Give or take. Words that can cheer up and bless, or divide and put down. They can start wars or heal hearts. Just look at soap operas, where many of the plots are based around the loving or wounding words of broken humanity. Chances are, of those ten thousand words you speak each day, one or two may not be very well thought through. At least.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;The Bible says, ‘If you claim to be religious but don’t control your tongue, you are fooling yourself, and your religion is worthless.’ (James 1:26 NLT) Oops. So, how can you get a bit more control over your mouth?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;(1) &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Encourage&lt;/em&gt;: Encouragers are God’s frontline against lies of the enemy which rid others of hope and joy. Use your words to lift the mood. (2) &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Ask for wisdom&lt;/em&gt;: ‘Take control of what I say, O Lord, and guard my lips.’ (Psalm 141:3 NLT) Be quick to listen and slow to speak, asking God to guide you when choosing your words—including those you speak about yourself. (3) &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Speak truth and life&lt;/em&gt;: Jesus is ‘...the way, the truth and the life.’ (John 14:6 NLT) As His family and followers, our speech should reflect this. Talk truthfully and you’ll speak words which, like a ‘...life–giving fountain’ (Proverbs 13:14 NLT), point others to God.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Acts 24-26, Mk 2:23-28, Ps 94:1-11, Prov 11:14-15&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59329&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

&lt;p&gt;About 61% of Aussies claimed to be ‘Christian’ on the last census. But you wouldn’t know it by the number of people in church of a Sunday. Australians are also, according to a recent &lt;em&gt;Credit Suisse Global Wealth&lt;/em&gt; report, the richest people on earth. How long can God’s favour last? It’s just like how things were in ancient Israel in Hezekiah’s time. In spite of all God’s blessings, many of the people there had turned their backs on Him. So as believers, how can we play our part in restoring God’s values in times like these? In Old Testament times, King Hezekiah set his heart on restoring God to His rightful position of leadership in the land and this is what he did:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) &lt;em&gt;He put God’s Word first&lt;/em&gt; (2 Chronicles 31:4 NLT);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2)&lt;em&gt; He challenged corruption&lt;/em&gt; (2 Chronicles 29:5 NLT);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3) He called the people to return to the Lord (2 Chronicles 30:6 NLT) and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(4) &lt;em&gt;He called people to worship God&lt;/em&gt; (2 Chronicles 29:28 NLT). Most importantly: ‘In everything that he undertook…he sought his God and worked wholeheartedly. And so he prospered.’ (2 Chronicles 31:21 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result? Israel was transformed. We need to play our part. As you watch or listen to the news today, find a story that you can pray about or act on. Ask your mates to pray too and to join with you in putting God first.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'A great...door has opened to me.' 1 Corinthians 16:9 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
]]></introtext>
<fulltext><![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;Paul writes, '&lt;i&gt;For a great and effective door has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.&lt;/i&gt;' So, what are you focusing on? The open door or the adversaries - the opportunities or the obstacles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Story time: In 1866, a newbie geologist (a rock geek) noticed some South African children playing with a shiny rock. He asked the kids' mother if he could purchase it. Thinking it was worthless, she gave it to him. Later, when he examined it, he discovered it was a premium 21 carat diamond. When word got out, a Scottish mineralogist (a mineral geek) named James Gregory was sent to investigate. He reported back that South Africa wasn't suitable for finding diamonds. He guestimated that the previous discoveries had resulted from ostriches, of all things, eating the gems in far-away lands and plopping them in South Africa by their poop. So gross! A few days after Gregory's report was made public, an 83 carat diamond was found in the area he had visited. It is now known as &lt;i&gt;The Star of South Africa&lt;/i&gt;, and it began the region's first mining operation in what is today the world's largest producer of diamonds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, what about Gregory? His name lives on, but not as he might have wished. In the diamond industry, when someone exhibits bad judgment, it's called '&lt;i&gt;pulling a Gregory&lt;/i&gt;'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So don't '&lt;i&gt;pull a Gregory&lt;/i&gt;'; ask the God who opens doors to how you what you need to see. Remember, if Jesus could turn water into wine and feed five thousand people with a boy's lunch, think what He can do through you. The question is: what do you see? The open door or the obstacles?&lt;/p&gt;

]]></introtext>
<fulltext><![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;Life in late 18th century England was horrific: kids as young as five were sent to work twelve hour days in dangerous conditions; public hangings were common and the conditions of prisons were unspeakable. When the jails threatened to overflow anyway, they shipped the prisoners half way around the world to a place called... yep, Australia. And then there was slavery - hundreds of thousands of human lives traded annually for money, money, money. Shockingly, most 18th century English people thought this was all perfectly jolly (or, at least, not changeable). There were even lots of church people who believed if you were born poor or black, the gutter was your lot in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would anyone take on that mountainous mess? Especially if you were well-educated, wealthy and insulated from the world around you? Well, thankfully, somebody did. God gave William Wilberforce a 'measure of faith' that came from his deep understanding of grace. Faith that his life could count. Faith that things could change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this measure of faith did in Wilberforce was cause him to use what he had, in the place where he was, to change the world. Jesus said: &lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;I tell you the truth, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, &quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Move from here to there&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt; (Matthew 17:20 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mustard seed is a bit bigger than the size of the full-stop at the end of this sentence. Whenever you think you don't have what it takes to change a situation for good, think again. It doesn't need much when you trust in Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Martin wrote about a missionary friend in Palestine: 'Sister Margaret was in the crowded village market one day when an angry man accosted her. Taking out his apparent frustration at Western military interference in the region, he began cursing her. He cursed... everything he could think of. She felt the eyes of the entire village watching. As he hurled abuse at her, she quietly prayed for wisdom. When he was finally done, Margaret responded, &quot;I am so sorry I hurt you. I never had any intention of hurting you. God loves you, and I love you. He loves this village and He wants to bless you. When you get over being angry, will you remember I'm still your friend?&quot; Perplexed, he turned and walked away. In words that are forever etched on my soul, Margaret said, &quot;Satan doesn't know how to respond to the gentleness of God's Spirit.&quot;'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The Spirit of God, who raised Jesus from the dead lives in you...' (Romans 8:11 NLT) How do you live out that resurrected-difference when you're with your friends? When you get unfairly bad-mouthed? To respond in love very often means not just mimicking the way that the world reacts to things, but standing solidly and being a gentle, positive opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the rest of the world is too busy to care for individuals, do you choose to have an opposite spirit? Simple things - actually offering prayer for a friend with a headache or telling that mate who owes you ten bucks it's a gift - will set you apart.&lt;/p&gt;

]]></introtext>
<fulltext><![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever find yourself saying the wrong thing, at just the wrong time? Never fun, is it? Peter had a tendency to spill exactly what was on his mind. This meant sometimes he was spot on with what he said and sometimes he was way off. There were occasions when physically putting his foot in his mouth would actually have been more constructive than carrying on the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Matthew's Gospel, Jesus praised Peter and said he was blessed for recognising Him as the Messiah. Then, just a few verses on, Peter put his foot in it (again) and Jesus rebuked him with the remark,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get behind me, Satan!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt; (Matthew 16:23 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us have these ups and downs, right? Striding along confidently for God one minute, then falling over our own feet the next. Well, next up in the story, God gave Peter some pretty good advice that could help us all. Jesus took Peter, James and John up the mountain to pray, and while there, the disciples saw the glory of Jesus displayed as he met with Moses and Elijah. Peter, totally stunned, spoke impulsively, comparing Jesus and the Old Testament prophets as being equals. While still mid-sentence God interrupted him, saying, &lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is my Son, whom I have chosen; listen to Him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt; (Luke 9:35 NIV) They were all afraid and speechless after hearing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can all use a bit of correction sometimes. To refocus and 'listen to Jesus' can be a make-or-break thing. The more you pay attention to what God has said, the less you'll say things that He wouldn't want you to say. So, if you find yourself in a situation where you think you might say something a bit brainless, take a breath, and pray for God's wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;

<fulltext><![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recognise this situation? You're lacking sleep. It's late, maybe around midnight. And your thoughts go a bit... well, dark. This is a top time for doubt (over real life issues or God's goodness or sudden fear) to come out in full force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does that ever happen to you? Do you ever wonder why it happens? Don't worry. You're definitely not alone. It happened to the disciples in a night-time thunderstorm. '...He got into a boat with His disciples. And He said to them, &quot;Let us cross over to the other side of the lake.&quot; And they launched out. But as they sailed, He fell asleep. And a storm came down...and they...were in jeopardy. And they...awoke Him, saying, &quot;Master, Master, we are perishing!&quot;' (Luke 8:22-24 NKJ)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the disciples, in the moment, doubt and fear felt like all there was to reality. Here's the thing though: these sorts of doubts don't sum you up and they're not the full measure of you. You can be aware of dangerous, not-from-God thoughts trying to get at you, but you don't have to be scared. 'Then [Jesus] arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water... But He said to them, &quot;Where is your faith?&quot; And they were afraid, and marvelled, saying to one another, &quot;Who can this be? For He commands even the winds and water, and they obey Him!&quot;'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever the storms of life, Jesus can calm them. No matter how deep your doubt or your fear, turn to Him and put your trust in Him. For He is the One with the power to command even the winds of fear and the waves of doubt to obey Him.&lt;/p&gt;

]]></introtext>
<fulltext><![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus suddenly stops in a marketplace and says 'Who touched Me?' No one owns up. Peter, in an almost You-can't-be-serious tone, pipes up, 'Master, the people are crowding and pressing against You.' But Jesus said, 'Someone touched Me; I know that power has gone out from Me.' (Luke 8:45-46 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus knew the difference between the clumsy bump of a passerby and a deliberate faith-filled grasp. Peter was led by his human senses, Jesus was led by a more supernatural sense. He knew in His spirit that someone had touched the tassels on His cloak that symbolised prayer. With that touch, someone had prayed in faith and received an answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of her illness, the woman who'd done it held back from revealing herself. She was seen as cursed by the people. Now this same woman, made whole, dropped at Jesus' feet, trembling. Because Jesus called her, she could respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's vital to our growth as Christians that we start to get in touch with Jesus too. Faith draws on His power and brings results! Notice, this woman touched the 'hem' of Jesus' garment, the prayer tassels. The last thing a tailor does when making a garment is to sew up the hem. So the hem represents 'the finished work'. The same back of Jesus that bore the cross to take away your sins, also bore the stripes which take away sickness. '...And by His stripes we are healed.' (Isaiah 53:5 NKJ) What do you need today? Forgiveness of sins? Healing for your body or mind? Reach out in faith and touch Jesus, and you too will be made whole.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'A dispute arose among them as to which of them would be greatest.' Luke 9:46 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
]]></introtext>
<fulltext><![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;Do you remember being little and having those 'my dad's the best' arguments? Then, we got older and it stopped being about mum and dad. Instead it became all about us. We don't often say it out loud (at least not in church), but in reality, our hearts can often drift towards a judgemental, self-promoting spirit, bigging ourselves up, assuming we're better than other people. It makes us feel secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good to know it's not a new thing, then. Jesus discovered His disciples were arguing about the oh-so-mature topic of... 'Who will be the greatest?' Have you noticed, a lot about 'living for God' is living in opposites? Like loving your enemies instead of hating them? Forgiving people instead of making them pay? Putting others first, rather than ourselves? Well, when Jesus had a few words with His disciples about this argument over greatness, He didn't quote a great philosopher to make His point. Instead, He pointed at a child. 'Whoever welcomes this little child in My name welcomes Me; and whoever welcomes Me welcomes the One who sent Me. For he who is least among you all-he is the greatest.' (Luke 9:48 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as your motive for serving is to make yourself look good, you'll never enjoy God's approval. And His 'well done' is the only thing that counts. So, if you've been bigging yourself up lately, take note of what Jesus said here and become teachable, trusting and tender-hearted, just like a young child.&lt;/p&gt;

]]></introtext>
<fulltext><![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shame has got a few classic by-lines. Like: 'You're a pathetic excuse for a Christian,' 'Seriously, are you still trying to kick that filthy habit?' In some ways, shame can be really good at getting us moving - but often in the wrong direction: 'Hey, I'm so awful, I'd better keep my head down.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is, when we take in the message of shame, our lives get smaller as we shrink into ourselves. We mark off our world and create a space for ourselves far smaller than the one God has planned. If you've ever been embarrassed or shamed by others in church - then, know this: love is the main way to grow healthily. God's way is release. Conviction (His wake-up call to sin) leads that way. Condemnation (wallowing in fear, guilt, embarrassment or humiliation) doesn't. It loops you back into yourself. God only calls you out on sin so you won't have it get in your way. God is the one who'll fix you up, so come closer to Him in love. Shame isn't His tool to force you to bow down to Him. If you feel yourself being convicted of sin, deal with it, be turned from it and walk in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you are a person who shames, rather than is ashamed, remember what Jesus said to the disciples who wanted to incinerate a village for not showing the right respect. He said, 'You do not know what manner of spirit you are of. For the Son of Man did not come to destroy men's lives but to save them...' (Luke 9:54-56 NKJ)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember too: 'You shall love your neighbour as yourself.' (Matthew 19:19 NKJ)&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'...Elisha went to Shunem, where there was a notable woman...' 2 Kings 4:8 NKJ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, meet a woman who redefined the meaning of the idea of going 'beyond the call of duty'. She knew Elisha was doing God's work and all she wanted was to serve him - starting with feeding him. Then she took it further. She organised a room to be built for him from scratch, complete with home comforts. She met all these needs, despite having some pretty massive needs of her own. We learn through the story she was absolutely desperate for a child but, for whatever reason, she was missing out. That hole in her life didn't stop her serving and filling someone else's needs - she simply got on with loving God and reaching out to others. You might think that she had every reason to be bitter. But this woman refused to live a life of sour lemons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elisha, grateful for her serving heart and the room she made specially for him, wanted to give back to her. And he wanted to fill her heart with joy. So God enabled him to prophesy the arrival of a baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus says, 'Seek the Kingdom of God above all else, and live righteously, and He will give you everything you need.' (Matthew 6:33 NLT) Even though she actually lived hundreds of years before these words were spoken, the woman of Shunem instinctively knew this was true and gave us a powerful example to follow. So, if there's something you're doing that has a bitter edge to it, ask God for the grace to do it gladly.&lt;/p&gt;

]]></introtext>
<fulltext><![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;We all have our battlegrounds; in some cases we surrendered to things years ago that now lurk in our innermost thoughts. That's why the Scriptures warn, 'Keep your heart with all diligence, for out of it spring the issues of life.' (Proverbs 4:23 NKJ) Max Lucado writes: 'I'm...far from home. The voices that encourage are distant; the voices that entice are near. A placard... on top of the TV promises late-night movies that will &quot;make all my fantasies come true&quot;. In the phone book several columns of escort services offer &quot;Love away from home&quot;. Voices! Some for pleasure, some for power. The world hammers at your door; Jesus taps. The world promises fleshly pleasure; Jesus promises us a quiet dinner...with Him: &quot;...I will come in and eat with him, and he with Me.&quot; (Revelation 3:20 NIV)'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which voice will you obey? So, how should you handle tempting situations? In two ways: First, &lt;em&gt;by filling your mind with Scripture&lt;/em&gt; so that your first response is always, 'It is written.' Second, &lt;em&gt;by keeping your eyes on Jesus&lt;/em&gt;. Lesley Durkin writes, 'My father used to put a bit of meat on the floor near his dog and say, &quot;No!&quot; The dog never touched it. But he never looked at it either, because if he did the temptation to disobey would have been too great. He just kept looking at my father's face.' Keep your eyes on Jesus. '...God is faithful. He will not allow the temptation to be more than you can stand...'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's face it, work was never designed to be easy. It was designed to get necessary things done. Sometimes we're fortunate enough to do work that we love, but often it's a drag-our-heels job. Colossians 3:23 tells us to put our whole heart into everything, really devote ourselves to it, just like we were doing our work for God. It's difficult. When we put our whole heart into all our work, with the idea that our boss, teacher, coach or manager is Jesus (which should make us work better...), we stand out as a great Christian and we also grow character. Our greatest progress comes from our greatest pain; hence God doesn't save us from problems, but strengthens us in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pull your weight beyond what is asked of you; offer new perspectives and ideas; be positive even when times seem totally tough; be an encourager of those you work with; nail those obstacles. If you act like that then you will undoubtedly please your boss, teacher, coach or manager. The more the people over you who are not Christian see you acting with integrity, the more your walk of faith will attract them. We also need to learn to endure. James writes, '...See how the farmer waits for the land to yield its valuable crop and how patient he is for the autumn and spring rains. You too, be patient and stand firm...' (James 5:7-8 NIV) You can't shorten the seasons or hurry the harvest, so be patient. While you're waiting, God is on the job too. As we work, God is at work in us, making sure that, if we do not give up, the trials and problems will work out for His glory.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'What does the Lord require of you ?...to love kindness...' Micah 6:8 NAS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
]]></introtext>
<fulltext><![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;'Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.' (That's Martin Luther King Jr.) When we're actively looking for ways to show love to others, not just holding it as an 'idea' in our heads, it can shift atmosphere, perspective and feelings all for the better. Often it starts with a practical act of the love that we bear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When King David showed kindness to a man called Mephibosheth who was disabled in both legs (2 Samuel 9), he let him sit at his table and eat with him. Today it's rightly considered to be wrong to discriminate against anyone who's physically impaired. Back then, it was the opposite. But when David let Mephibosheth sit at his table he was making a point - with his legs hidden under the King's table, he appeared just as David actually knew he was: equal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are countless people like Mephibosheth who think they don't deserve to be shown any respect or kindness - people who perhaps only know crumbs of love at best, swept off the table and underfoot. Yet by showing them the love of Jesus, we can break the pattern of who they think they are. They can become free to know who they are in Christ, deeply moulded to His image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Every day we miss opportunities to be kind in order to save a few seconds&lt;/em&gt;. But what if next time you feel a surge of compassion towards someone, you consider that as a prompt from God to perform a random act of kindness. It wouldn't just change the other person's life, it will change yours too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Deut 28-29, Mk 6:1-13, Ps 44:17-26, Prov 12:12-14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp;amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia. 2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;amp;track=61698&amp;amp;www=blog&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]></fulltext>

<introtext><![CDATA['If my people... will humble themselves and pray... I will hear.' 2 Chronicles 7:14 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;In 1984, US President Ronald Reagan spoke at a national prayer breakfast: ‘We poison our society when we remove its theological underpinnings. We court corruption when we leave it bereft of belief... Those who believe must be free to speak of and act on their belief, to apply moral teaching to public questions… without God, there is no virtue, because there’s no prompting of the conscience. Without God, we’re mired in the material, that flat world that tells us only what the senses perceive... And without God, democracy will not and cannot long endure.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Praying for our nation, leaders and communities matters big time (see 1 Timothy 2:1–4). When Abraham prayed on behalf of the doomed city Sodom and Gomorrah, God agreed to let them off if only fifty righteous people could be found. Sadly, Abraham couldn’t even find ten.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;But there’s hope in this story—a righteous minority can be used by God (even used to allow Him to move in their city), bring revival to the church, and change the course of our nation. ‘If My people who are called by My name will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from Heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Let’s love Australia, shall we? Pray for our nation, and encourage those around you to do the same today. #Pray4Australia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Rev 5-9, Matt 18:21-35, Ps 77, Pro 6:29&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58972&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let the redeemed of the Lord tell their story...' Psalm 107:2 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;If you’ve been a Christian for more than five minutes, the chances are that speaking out, being real, telling your mates what Jesus has done for you is so scary that perhaps you start avoiding it where you can. It’s hard enough explaining why &lt;em&gt;you don’t want to go to those wild parties anymore&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;you don’t want to talk about people behind their backs anymore&lt;/em&gt;, without going all out and sharing your testimony. By speaking out, however ‘cool’ you play it, some people will always think you’re a bit weird. Jesus knows this. He faced enough of it Himself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, Psalm 107:2 says, ‘Let the redeemed of the Lord tell their story…’ Why? Because your story is incredibly valuable (and even mentioning that you go to church or believe in God can be sufficient at times to get people intrigued enough to start with). People can argue over the historical evidence for Jesus, or struggle to take the Bible at face value. But it’s more of a stretch to deny what God has done for you personally. For some of your mates, you are the best proof of God’s existence and power. And if you struggle to express this, you certainly aren’t alone. If it is hard for you to tell your story of how Jesus has changed your life, ask God for His help and His courage. Maybe ‘practise’ initially by telling people you trust or speaking to someone you know who is already searching for God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Rev 10-14, Matt 19:1-12, Ps 136:1-12, Pro 6:30-31&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58973&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Your wages disappear... in pockets filled with holes!' Haggai 1:6 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Haggai, a prophet in the Old Testament, lived at a time when the Israelites had become so obsessed with getting rich, they’d forgotten about God. Haggai prophetically chastised them about how they’d spent everything investing in their own ‘panelled houses’ while God’s house lay in ruins.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;He was right, of course: if we belong to Him, and all we have has come from and belongs to Him, then what right have we to decide how our money is used? After all, if someone came along and randomly stuck $100 in your hand, the first thing you would ask is: ‘What’s this for’?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how about this for an even more radical principle: each time you receive any money, be it wages or anything else, ask &lt;em&gt;God&lt;/em&gt;: ‘What’s this for?’ and figure out what He might want. Life will certainly get a whole lot more interesting! A lot of Christians stick to a principle called the ‘tithe’—in other words, setting aside the first 10 per cent of everything you earn and giving it to God. That puts Him first, it shows that we’re not forgetting Him and that His plans for healing this broken world are important to us too. Try out the ‘what’s this for?’ principle. Next time you receive ‘unassigned’ money (e.g. you’ve not been told by your mum ‘this is for new shoes’), don’t do anything with it until you’ve asked God precisely what it’s for. (Oh, and remember, this is still the God who wants YOU to be looked after, too!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Rev 15-18, Matt 19:13-19, Ps 136:13-26, Pro 6:32-35&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58975&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<title><![CDATA[Four Kinds Of Giving (2) -- Give Away The Little]]></title>

<introtext><![CDATA['...the jar of flour will not be used up...' 1 Kings 17:14 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Three thousand years ago, give or take a hundred. Devastating famine has swept the land. Wiped out a widow’s livestock. Destroyed all she relied on. And then Elijah, a major prophet, turns up—God has sent him her way. &lt;em&gt;I can’t put him up for the night unless I split this one portion of food I have left. Alright God, thank You for this opportunity. I really doubt what I have is anywhere near enough. But I want to trust You with my life—so I’m going to use the little I have to feed him too. Amen...? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Most of us have times that we feel what we have is simply not enough. Often, however much we cut back, our cash outgoings always slightly exceed our income. In these moments, after that bill has finally been paid, the thought of giving away what little we have left seems simply insane. And if you haven’t reached that stage where you’re paying bills, firstly, enjoy this stage while it lasts! Also, remember this reading; it might turn out pretty important later on. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;In the meantime, with what money you are given, we reckon the same lessons apply. God hasn’t changed in the last three thousand years: when we give away the little we have, the door is left wide open for a miracle. For the woman at the beginning of the reading, she faced her fear and fed Elijah, and the flour inexplicably just kept on coming. We’re called by God to manage what we’ve got to the best of our ability and that means trusting God with it &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt;, rather than clinging on anxiously to the bit that’s left.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;You can also ‘tithe’ your time if not your cash. Think of ways to help out others in your community or church—sometimes the most important thing you can give others is your time. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Exo 20:17, 2 Kings 5:1-27, Ecc 5:10, Luke 12:13-34 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59016&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...the disciples picked up twelve baskets.' Mark 6:43 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Most of us know the story of the little boy with five rolls, a couple of fish and 5,000 hungry men (to say nothing of the women and children). Jesus multiplied that simple meal and fed the whole crowd. It’s been said the reason there were twelve baskets of bread left over was because everyone actually whipped out their own packed lunches and tucked in. Some people, in other words, think of it as a lesson in sharing rather than an example of generous giving topped up with superpower faith. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;But, let’s set aside this secular worldview! Instead in our faith in Christ as Lord, we see a God who both gives us a reason to be generous and then, out of His goodness and great power, multiplies a thousand–fold what little we are able to give. Jesus, after all, only does what He sees God doing. ‘So Jesus answered them, “I tell you the truth: the Son can do nothing on His own; He does only what He sees His Father doing. What the Father does, the Son also does.”’ (John 5:19 GNT) The truth is, God provides bread for us by multiplying grain each year in fields across the world. One seed in the earth results in a head of grain with hundreds of seeds. It’s the same sort of miracle as Jesus performed with the loaves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;It comes down to this: God owns it all anyway. If we give back to Him, like a farmer planting seed, He’ll watch over the harvest for us. It’s about your heart, about sacrificial giving and about saying, ‘Here’s all I have Lord,’ and watching Him multiply that gift, however small.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Rev 19-22, Matt 19:20-30, Ps 106:1-23, Pro 7:1-2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59030&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Joseph opened up the storehouses and distributed grain...' Genesis 41:56 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;During Joseph’s time as second–in–charge of the land of Egypt, the people were starving. Crops hadn’t grown, so trading stopped and a once–wealthy nation was brought to its knees. Sound familiar? Much of the western world is in a time of crisis right now. Recession, unemployment and prices are rising and benefit payments are failing to keep up. Sadly, you don’t have to look far to find good people struggling to feed their families for reasons beyond their control.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;As a young man Joseph was downright foolish at times, but he loved God and worked hard. His life was a rollercoaster of ups and downs. Through it all he remained faithful to God, learned his lessons and used his gifts. Ultimately God blessed him and the whole of Egypt as well as his own family through him. God gave him wisdom to see the problems coming and a plan to save the country.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God wants to use you too. Greed has brought the world to its knees and we need an antidote. God is calling young people like us to model a new way of living, a new way of working, a new way of doing business and a new way of taking care of the lost, the last and the least. If you’re coming out of a family or community hit hard by hopelessness, don’t lose sight of God. He hasn’t lost sight of you, and hasn’t abandoned His hope for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Kings 1:1-4:17, Matt 20:1-16, Ps 106:24-48, Pro 7:3-5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59022&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['The Lord forbid that I should give you the inheritance of my ancestors.' 1 Kings 21:3 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Integrity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt; As Christians, we shouldn’t ‘sell out’ to something that compromises what God really wants for us. Read on, this is important. A few of the Christian guidelines that the world bins as ‘boring’ are the ones God has given us to lead to true freedom and life. For example, He taught us to prioritise other people, to check our anger, envy and gossip, and to recognise the spiritual and psychological damage that sex outside of a marital relationship can do to us. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;So, standing your ground when other influences hit is going to be essential. In 1 Kings 21:3 NIV, Naboth had inherited land that happened to be right next to the King’s palace. The King wasn’t too happy about it, and even offered Naboth good money. Yet Naboth had integrity; he stood by what was appointed for him. He said, ‘The Lord forbid that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to you!’ Well done! Unfortunately, this decision did cost him heavily (read the whole story in 1 Kings 21:1–11).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Yes, it’s an extreme example, but Christian principles are always being attacked, in different ways in every generation, from the smallest compromise to the biggest. Will you stand up? It can seem ‘bigger and better’ to give in (‘&lt;em&gt;that out–of–date, restrictive religion of yours doesn’t work in our modern world…’&lt;/em&gt;). We know it’s hard, but God wants to hear you being honest. He will help you live right, and to stand up for what is right in the world. Is there an area of your life where compromise is rearing its ugly head? Pray and ask God for His help and His wisdom. Take a stand in your heart and make the right decision—you won’t regret it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Kings 4:18-6:33, Matt 20:17-23, Ps 112, Pro 7:6-9&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59024&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Take care of your own business, and do your own work...' 1 Thessalonians 4:11 NCV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;If you’ve seen ‘&lt;em&gt;Celebrity Apprentice&lt;/em&gt;’ you’ve witnessed a cleverly edited programme about a group of often driven and difficult people telling entrepreneur Mark Bouris they’re really hard workers and how much money they’re going to make. Pretty extreme, but there are people like that out there. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;At the other end of the spectrum is the stereotype of the workshy sponging–off–parents people, half asleep on the sofa. Calling in ‘sick’ to classes or not very interested in finding a job. This might not be &lt;em&gt;your &lt;/em&gt;style, but we have to be wary—laziness is something that will catch you out if you let it (check out Proverbs 13:4). Are we condemning you? No, we just want you to make the most of the time on your hands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;In Acts 18 we read about Paul. Even as he travelled around, in between preaching and teaching, he made tents to provide for himself, not always relying on people to provide for him. Tents? It was a profitable trade at that time. He worked with dedication and persistence in something that wasn’t the important, central part of his life’s mission, in order to allow it to go on. So wherever life is taking you, work hard as if you were doing it for the Lord Himself. Make a list of all the things you spend time doing in a week and estimate the hours of time spent on each. Is your balance right, or does something need to change?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Kings 7-9, Matt 20:24-34, Ps 27, Pro 7:10-20&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59026&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let God transform... by changing the way you think.' Romans 12:2 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Are there things in your life that are winding you up at the moment? A situation, a person, your church? The Bible is pretty clear on the way change comes about—no matter what the problem is, it begins with us. By ‘the renewing of your mind’ (Romans 12:2 NIV), we automatically become more understanding, more patient and far wiser about how to deal with it. Sounds easy, doesn’t it? Here are a few ways that you might help to continually change your attitude:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;(a) &lt;em&gt;Apologise&lt;/em&gt;. You know that person you think you may have upset? You probably did. Don’t wait around, be honest about whatever mistake(s) you’ve made. (b) &lt;em&gt;View setbacks as detours&lt;/em&gt;, not dead ends and see what there is to learn for next time. (c) &lt;em&gt;Think about who you’re listening to&lt;/em&gt;; keep the positive godly influences and tune out the negative. (d) &lt;em&gt;Choose not to complain&lt;/em&gt;; work on figuring out more productive solutions and approaches. Above all, (e) &lt;em&gt;Self–control—&lt;/em&gt;have some! Frustration easily leads to saying things that aren’t helpful, tweeting or Facebooking things you shouldn’t, slating people in authority and making on–the–spot–not–thought–out decisions. If you’re angry, take a walk, deep breaths, calm yourself down. Don’t act until you’re calm!&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Apologising is your first stop here. Ask God to remind you of those outstanding apologies you need to make.

<introtext><![CDATA['Let there be no strife between you and me...' Genesis 13:8 NAS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;'So Abram, his wife, and Lot left Egypt, taking everything they owned, and traveled to southern Canaan. Abram was very rich in cattle, silver, and gold... Lot also had flocks, herds, and tents. Abram and Lot had so many animals that the land could not support both of them together, so Abram’s herdsmen and Lot’s herdsmen began to argue.’ (Genesis 13:1–7 NLT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram was wise and suggested they part ways, and he gave Lot first choice. Lot picked the very fertile area around the town of Sodom as his choice of farmland. Abram chose to build an altar to God as his first action. Same genes; different values. Lot saw it as a get–rich–quick scheme. But what ‘Sodom’ really offered was about as far from Godly principles as was possible. Abram revealed his true colours by building himself a reminder of who God is. In effect, he says ‘my life’s wealth and security is dependent on God and nothing else’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard when your values clash with your family’s. If you feel pressured into&lt;em&gt; have&lt;/em&gt;–to win–arguments–at–&lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt;–cost, then take a lesson from Abram and turn to God first. He has you and your family’s best interests at heart. In keeping eyes on Him and not winning petty faith debates, you’re letting Him steer your witness. Exodus 20:12 says, ‘Honour your father and mother.’ What if your family values differ from Biblical ones? Ponder on how it is possible to respect your parents and (if it’s a potential problem) not to betray your faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59041&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let there be no strife between you and me... for we are brothers.' Genesis 13:8 NAS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;So in Genesis 13, we have a story that shows one family with two outlooks. Abram, driven by faith, is a giver; Lot, driven by security, is a taker. Out of respect, Lot should have looked after his aging uncle’s welfare rather than putting his own first. Unfortunately he looked out for ‘number one’ instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abram could have assumed top–dog status and ensured that this scrap of a nephew knew his rightful place. He didn’t; he showed grace. Read on further in the Bible passage and you’ll see that Lot’s denial of Abram lands him right in the middle of 24/7 party island, where anything goes—including sexual depravity, idol worship and violence. In the space of just six chapters, everything Lot took was destroyed. &lt;em&gt;Good deal?&lt;/em&gt; Abram, on the other hand, (who has through all this stuck stubbornly to his child–like faith in God) becomes a ‘father to nations’. As God promises him, ‘Look… northward and southward and eastward and westward… all the land which you see, I will give it to you and to your descendants forever.’ (Genesis 13:14–15 NAS) &lt;em&gt;Christian Life 101&lt;/em&gt;: it pays to stick to your Godly values. Ask yourself the tough question: Which do you value most—security or faith? If you’re brave enough, ask God to take away your comfort in order to lean more on Him. If you’re not brave enough, ask God to bring you into deeper faith with Him so you can lean more on Him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Gal 5:22, 1 Cor 13, Eph 3:14-21, John 15:1-17 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59042&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['... I have set before you life and death... choose life...' Deuteronomy 30:19 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever noticed this: in just about every film you will see, the action only really starts happening once the main character has some epiphany or sudden personal revelation? Doesn’t matter if it’s Tony Stark, James T Kirk, Clark Kent or Mia Thermopolis in &lt;em&gt;The Princess Diaries—&lt;/em&gt;it’s only when the character in question gets to the end of their tether, seriously mucks things up or finds themselves alone that they actively choose to get things together and sort their lives out so that things actually change. Characters are defined by their choices. So are you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what choices have you made? Do you find yourself all–too–often choosing the easy option? Or do you decide to decide later?... The life you have been given is too precious to spend just assuming things will turn out all right if you just coast along. It doesn’t matter if you never match Clark Kent’s latest heroic adventure, what does matter is that the choices you make bring you closer to God and help you rather than hinder you in your journey with Him. Choosing to spend a few minutes with God and to say &lt;em&gt;yes&lt;/em&gt; to Him when you come up against decisions can have a far more positively profound impact than you may realise! Choosing to say &lt;em&gt;yes&lt;/em&gt; to following Jesus can often seem like the hardest thing on the planet, but the rewards are out of this world. Consider the choices you made yesterday—did they bring you closer to God, or did they just leave you sitting still or, worse, did they push you away from Jesus? Do you need to make a change today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59043&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['You must build... according to the pattern I will show you.'  Exodus 25:9 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;If you want to build tall, you need to go deep. The most important part of any building is what you don’t see, the foundations under the surface. That’s why whatever you’re trying to build—a relationship, a family, a church/ministry, or your own walk with God—strong foundation is vital.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;When he was the leader of God’s people, Moses spent over a month waiting in God’s presence for direction: ‘Then Moses disappeared into the cloud as he climbed higher up the mountain. He remained on the mountain forty days and forty nights.’ (Exodus 24:17–18 NLT) Why? Because he knew that what he was building had to meet the needs of God’s people for generations. God told Moses to go to Him for the plan, and he obeyed. This was more than just checking in with God and then toddling off to get on with his plan—God was the centre stone, the beginning and end, the Source of it all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;It’s the same for us. His promise is, ‘If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God…and it will be given to him.’ (James 1:5 NIV) Want to build a solid, strong life? God knows what’s up ahead for you, and He knows how to guide you. Focus on one thing you want to build in your life—an amazing marriage, maybe, or your dream career. Maybe it’s as fundamental as you being a strong man/woman of God. Ask Him: am I laying the right foundations at the moment? If not, what do I need to change?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Kings 18:17-20:21, Matt 21:33-46, Ps 115, Pro 8:1-3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59044&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...they did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death.' Revelation 12:11 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;History is chockful of stories of men and women—ordinary men and women like us—who saw their lives as a gift to be given back to God. They would go boldly, to the ends of the earth, if necessary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;CT Studd (1860–1931) was one. He was a wealthy Englishman who, following a successful career as a cricketer, sold everything he had to take the Gospel to the nations. Though his family did all they could to persuade him not to go, he went anyway—first to China, then India, then Africa, putting his life at risk countless times for the sake of the Good News of Jesus. He died on the mission field, aged 70.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Just before he died, Studd wrote the following powerful words: ‘The time for waiting is past! … Should such men as we fear? Before the whole world… before the sleepy, lukewarm, faithless, namby–pamby Christian world, we will dare to trust our God… We will a thousand times sooner die trusting only in our God than live trusting in man.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Is the time for waiting over for you? Do you know and trust Him enough to respond to His call, knowing He’ll be there for you to bring all your efforts to good? Are we ready to live boldly for God—or do we ‘love our lives too much’ to dare?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Everyone is called into mission. ‘So, what can I do?’ ’Mission’ does not mean selling everything and going to rural India, it could mean being part of your church’s children’s ministry because you ‘just love kids!’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Kings 21-23, Matt 22:1-14, Ps 11, Pro 8:4-5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59045&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us.' Acts 15:28 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Classic songs, ad campaigns—what is it about ‘coming together’ that strikes such a chord with us? Why is it that when a bunch of people get together to work on something good, or just to share a happy experience, that things seem right?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Maybe there’s something in Jesus’ idea that ‘I and the Father are one’ and that ‘all of them [&lt;em&gt;that’s us, by the way&lt;/em&gt;] may be one’. That strange sense of something special that comes at a gig, or a party (or, surprise surprise, a church service...) is a reflection of this core truth about reality—unity tells us something special about God. For Christians, it’s more than just recognising that we share similarities. We actually share in Jesus’ being, just as Jesus shares in His Father’s; all one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;So, agreement in the Church is a precious thing, worth protecting. There’s a great example of a serious argument in the early Church in Acts 15 (about circumcision, too—a fairly delicate subject...) The believers stuck through the argument, even when it got to the teeth–baring, claws–out stage, because they knew the main thing was that they were already in this together. That deep connection of brother–and–sisterhood–in–Christ was what they were working from and aiming for—it’s why the word ‘brother’ gets thrown around so much in the New Testament. The result of their stubborn striving for unity? ‘There was great joy throughout the church that day.’ (Acts 15:31 NLT)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Kings 24-25, Matt 22:15-22, Ps 19, Pro 8:6-7&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59046&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God' Romans 10:17 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;What’s the worst life–scenario you can imagine..? Give this a try: you’re born into poverty in the mid–1800s, in an area of Britain where poverty is rife. Not a great start. On top of that, you can’t read. &lt;em&gt;And &lt;/em&gt;you’ve been picking turnips just to get by since an early age. Sad story... But a true one. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;But Smith Wigglesworth is said to have seen 23 people raised from the dead when he came to Australia! A woman is said to have held her own cancer in her hand after a faith–healing encounter with him. Sight was given to the sightless, the voiceless found speech and the deaf could hear again. Crazy. Who would have guessed that, despite his background, he’d turn out to be a hugely influential part of God’s Kingdom? &lt;em&gt;(Pssst: actually anyone can be used by God.)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;So what was Smith Wigglesworth’s secret? This legend of a guy (look him up!) had faith that came from reading one hardback only: the Bible. Smith learned to break through the illiteracy of his youth by reading it. He coined the motto—‘Fear looks; faith jumps.’ He had the cheek to take God &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; by His Word—you know, living out the promises about joy, healing, and fulfilment, that kind of stuff. Imagine if you didn’t just read what God had to say, but truly &lt;em&gt;believed&lt;/em&gt; it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;There are plenty of Bible reading plans out there (there’s even one in this devotional—see SoulFood just below this reading to take you through the Bible in a year) so what are you waiting for? Get stuck in and dare to take God at His Word.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Hosea 1-5, Matt 22:23-33, Ps 116:1-11, Pro 8:8-9&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59047&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['You are not your own.' 1 Corinthians 6:19 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Two people rock up outside a house. One says, ‘This is my house.’ The other replies, ‘How come?’ The first one says, ‘For three reasons. I built it. I paid for it. I live in it.’ For the next three days, we’re looking at three claims God has on your life. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The first claim: &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Creation&lt;/em&gt; (‘I built it’). We usually think of this from the point of view that, if God made you, it means you’re designed, you’re hand–crafted into a beautiful, gifted, valuable child of His. That’s right, but today we’re looking at it from a different angle... If God made you, that means you belong to Him. So…?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;God cares for you! And not because of some shiny, glossy goodness of your own making, but because He made the shine that is you (Gen 1:26). You belong to Him, in a way that should both empower you, and also make you stop and think, ‘What am I doing for Him?’ Even before we look at Jesus’ sacrifice for you (tune in tomorrow), the very fact that He created you means that ‘you are not your own... therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God’s.’ (1 Corinthians 6:19–20 NKJ) Don’t get us wrong, this is no guilt–trip. We’re saying: if God made you, and God called you His, then He knows best what you’re for. He knows the plans, the purposes and the abilities that He gave to you. He knows the problems that you’ll have to face. If you know that you belong to God, you have value, and you have purpose. What difference does knowing that ‘you are not your own’ make to the way you will act today? Think about it as you go about your day. See what happens in your interactions?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Hosea 6-10, Matt 22:34-46, Ps 116:12-19, Pro 8:10-13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59274&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...you were bought at a price...' 1 Corinthians 6:20 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;God’s second claim on your life is Calvary. There’s a story about two friends who went to law school. One became a judge; the other became a law-breaker and ended up in court. Guess who was sitting in the judge’s seat? His friend. So how could the judge be merciful, yet still be just? Taking off the black robes of justice, he walked over to the dock where the prisoner stood and said, ‘Not only am I this man’s friend, today I’m his saviour. I will stand chargeable with all his debts.’ At the cross, God took all your sin and put it on Christ’s account, and took all Christ’s righteousness and put it on your account. And the moment you trust Christ as your Saviour you’re no longer under the sentence of death. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The value of something is determined by the price a buyer is willing to pay for it. At Calvary God said, ‘This is how much I love you!’ Your Creator became your Redeemer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;‘Amazing love! how can it be that You, my God, should die for me?’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;To fulfil His purposes in the earth, God always had a man. To deliver the Israelites from Egypt, He used Moses. To challenge the prophets of Baal, He used Elijah. But when it came to your salvation, God ‘saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor; therefore His own arm brought salvation...’ (Isaiah 59:16 NKJ) The good news is: When God could not find a man, He Himself became a man; that we who are the sons of men, might become the sons of God. Awesome! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Gal 5:22, Isa 61, Heb 12:2, Jas 1:2-3 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59275&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.' 1 Corinthians 6:20 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;The third claim that God has on you is a word you might not be familiar with: ‘&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Consecrate&lt;/em&gt;’. This means to be ‘set apart’. Being declared different, for and by God. Does this mean we need to be perfect? No, you can’t make yourself perfect, only God can and will do that someday (in Heaven). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;The step &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; have to take is the willingness to be consecrated: God is looking for people that are up for it. What does being ‘set apart’ look like? One example could be: ‘My parents want me to go to Bible College and be a minister.’ Well, there’s good news and bad. The good news is that Bible College can deepen your devotion to Christ and give you insights into His Word. The bad news is that your parents can’t ‘call’ you; only God can! ‘…no man takes this honour to himself, but he who is called by God…’ (Hebrews 5:4 NKJ)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;So, ‘How do I know where I’m meant to be?’ Basically, when God calls you, you’ll know. That nervous excitement when you know you really should join that mission? Or that sense of righteous anger that drives you to give time and/or money to a specific cause? Whatever the calling, big or small, He will open the doors, make the connections, and provide the resources. All He asks of you is that you ‘consecrate’ yourself to doing His will.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;What do you feel ‘called’ to? While you’re praying today, imagine holding that up, in your hands, to God and giving it over to Him. Now take your hands back into your chest, and receive your life back as a gift, set apart for God.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['... Let us keep in step with the Spirit.' Galatians 5:25 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;You know &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Singing in the Rain&lt;/em&gt;, the musical with the umbrella twirling, puddle splashing routine Gene Kelly bit? Effortless and gliding with grace, you’d never guess Kelly was actually down with flu when he filmed it. You’d never guess the rain was shrinking his costume. Despite these odds, Gene Kelly danced into celluloid history because of the years of practice he’d put in behind the scenes. He instinctively knew the steps.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;It’s the same with our ‘routine’ with God. Every day is an opportunity to practice going toe–to–toe with Him, learning His guidance. Galatians 5:25 tells us to ‘keep in step with the Spirit.’ Put in the practice now. Spiritual guidance is learned—one step at a time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;You might dream of making an impact in an overseas mission trip; but it’s worth remembering that God can equally move you to do ‘mission’ in &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;your own &lt;/em&gt;town. In fact, He probably will. He has a big heart for it, because it boils down to simply living in God’s ways, wherever you are—nothing glamorous, just living for Him and for others. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;So, how can we learn God’s ‘steps’? Well, the Bible is ‘... a lamp to guide my feet and a light for my path’ (Psalm 119:105 NLT). When we draw Godly inspiration from it, it’ll change our lives. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['The fruit of righteousness will be... confidence.' Isaiah 32:17 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Apple launches a new television, confident that brand will sell. Tony Lockett would step up for a kick, confident he could get the ball through those posts. The opposition party is always confident they can run the country more successfully than the current government. The confidence that connects these three examples is self–confidence—confidence in your own reputation, abilities and bright ideas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Isaiah is talking about a different confidence. &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;A confidence in God&lt;/em&gt;. It doesn’t take much to shake our self–confidence—a dip in sales, a missed kick, a lost election. But ‘God confidence’ is unshakeable because God is unshakeable. It’s in His hands. If the Israelites had put their confidence in Moses, they’d never have walked through the Red Sea—only God can create corridors in seas. If Daniel had placed confidence in himself, he’d have never escaped the lion’s special recipe bargain bucket—only God can shut mouths of lions. The Bible’s packed with these amazing accounts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Self–confidence has its limits, and it’s often the root of pride. But God is limitless. And not only will you see God’s will done through you, but it means we can’t boast about anything except Him (which helps on the pride front; we &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; struggle with it). ‘Far better to take refuge in God than trust in people.’ (Psalm 118:8 NIV)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Before you start your day (or tomorrow if you’re reading this before bed), take the time to ask God to give you opportunities to display your faith, with Godly confidence that He’s with you. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Jer 4-6, Matt 23:29-39, Ps 55:12-23, Pro 8:19-21&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59278&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<title><![CDATA[Naked Lies]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[naked-lies]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['... Who told you... you were naked?' Genesis 3:11 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Just how naked were Adam and Eve the moment they ate the fruit? A little bit naked? Just enough to know things weren’t quite as they used to be? One moment they were unconscious of themselves and the next they were self–conscious, embarrassed and ashamed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;The nakedness in the story seems to point to something other than ‘in all your bath–time glory’. Adam and Eve are hiding from God. Deep shame is on display here. When they mutter from the bushes about their state of undress, God doesn’t blush or look away in awkwardness. He asks them, ‘Who told you... you were naked?’ In other words, ‘Who told you there was something wrong with you?’ or ‘What’s made you ashamed to be you?’ or ‘What’s made you self-conscious?’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Self-conscious is focus on self, not on God. When He calls you, He doesn’t want you hiding because you’re too shy (read: self-conscious) to come out and keep your eyes on Him to get the job done. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Get this: God’s saying to you today, ‘Who told you… you don’t have what it takes… that you’re not clever enough… that you’re not attractive enough… or talented enough?’ Like Adam and Eve, we can believe the slithery lies of the bully or the media or even those close to us. It doesn’t matter what anybody else says or thinks about you. God’s approval is what you need.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;What are the things that make you want to run for the bushes and hide? Ask God to replace the lies you’ve believed with His truth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Jer 7-9, Matt 24:1-14, Ps 38:1-12, Pro 8:22-23&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59280&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['... Run to win!' 1 Corinthians 9:24 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;What motivates you? When you &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;know &lt;/em&gt;you’re motivated, you’ll be willing to step out of your comfort zone, put overtime in and generally do the best you possibly can. Maybe it’s for that that relationship turnaround &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; exam you have to pass &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;or &lt;/em&gt;sibling to know God’s love &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; friend to find self–worth &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; youth group to grow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Now, if you think you know where this is going, read on, we urge you. We know that it’s not possible to always be motivated to the extreme to do all of the above in your Christian walk; it can be a long–haul that can require perseverance. But when we find ourselves lacking motivation to step out for the Gospel, we have to do something super–important: a self–review.&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Is there something hindering me from actually being (or feeling) free to move forward?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;You know the ‘…the sin that so easily entangles’ verse (Hebrews 12:1 NIV)? Put it into practice. Take a look at your life and figure out what’s stopping you in body, mind or spirit. Letting go of these things gives us God–given freedom. That’s motivation, right?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Make a shortlist of things you know deep down you aren’t great at (We all have them! Sharing your faith might be a starting point for a lot of us). What do you hang onto that needs to go? God will bless you if you let Him; it’s time to open up and pray for God to move in you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Jer 10-13, Matt 24:15-28, Ps 38:13-22, Pro 8:24-26&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59282&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<title><![CDATA[When We Hurt Ourselves]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[when-we-hurt-ourselves]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['... Clothed and in his right mind.' Mark 5:15 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;You might have read about Jesus healing a man controlled by evil spirits. ‘His dwelling [was] among the tombs; and no one could bind him, not even with chains… neither could anyone tame him… always, night and day, he was… crying out and cutting himself with stones.’ (Mark 5:3–5 NKJ) As creepy as this sounds, there are things we can relate to here. Really? Yes—four major things:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;(1) &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;He kept hurting himself.&lt;/em&gt; He used stones to do it, but some of us use drugs, porn/sex, alcohol, overwork or negativity. What do you keep doing that hurts you? Don’t be complacent with what’s destroying you. (2) &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;He was preoccupied with death.&lt;/em&gt; The guy lived in a graveyard. Ok, that might be something you’d never do, but mentally, where are you? Living without purpose needs to be addressed—a troubled mind can bring you to the place where you lose even your desire to live. (3) &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;He had no peace, day or night.&lt;/em&gt; The downside of godless living is restlessness, irritability and discontent. Nothing satisfies or is ever enough. (4) &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;He lived in isolation.&lt;/em&gt; Satan’s job is made easier when you don’t have a spiritual support system. Getting linked with other believers (that’s church, btw!) wrecks his plans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Right, then what? Well, Jesus showed up. When Jesus shows up, things change, things we thought way beyond our ability to change. He healed him back to his ‘right mind’. This guy went from one end of the scale to another, just from an encounter with Jesus. Don’t put off your appointment with Him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Be totally honest about how you hurt yourself. Ask Jesus for release and get care or professional help if you need to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Jer 14-17, Matt 24:29-36, Ps 69:1-18, Pro 8:27-29&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59290&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['When you come, bring...my scrolls...' 2 Timothy 4:13 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;The Apostle Paul was on another level. He finds himself locked up in prison, about to meet His maker; but instead of counting down the time till he meets Jesus face to face, he’s arranging private Bible studies: ‘When you come bring my scrolls.’ (2 Timothy 4:13) Paul understood the importance of knowing God. He wasn’t satisfied with the memories and adventures of the past, he was hungry for God till the very end. For Paul, growing and learning were a continual journey, not a destination.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Chances are you’ve sat an exam or ten. You might think they’re so stressful you’ve decided to avoid anything that resembles an exam paper for the rest of your life. But life–long learning is a reality you can’t escape if you’re going to move into everything God has for you. Staying as you are isn’t a viable option. Imagine a 30–year–old man still drinking milk from a baby’s bottle (Hebrews 5:12). It doesn’t matter where you are or who you are, the point remains: God wants you to grow, to flourish, to get better.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

When we kid ourselves into thinking we don’t need to learn any more about God, we lose a sense of wonder about the possibilities of what we can become in God.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Let the wise listen and add to their learning...' Proverbs 1:5 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Here’s something to think about: growing as a Christian &lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; involve walking away from things that might look good and feel good, but aren’t actually ‘good’ in God’s eyes. Ignoring that warning God’s giving you will lead to a bitter aftertaste of disappointment, distraction or complacency. Has your focus ever shifted from living God’s ways? It happens to all of us. How can we ‘grow on’?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Well, some of the most important things God wants to teach us go way beyond any knowledge we can learn and repeat exam–style. Our God–given passions and talents can often only be learned through experiencing tough times head–on. But would you rather experience triumph over those things that hold you back from God, or let things ‘blow over’ (which is often an excuse for letting complacency control you)?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;Choosing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt; to learn from them these experiences is important here. We all have talents, but unless you work on those God–given gifts, you’ll never know what could have been. Paul encouraged a young Timothy to ‘fan into flames the spiritual gift God gave you.’ (1 Timothy 1:6 NLT) It wasn’t the time for asking for fresh revelations (see verse 13); it was time to stick on with what he’d already learnt. It’s time to work with the most of what we’ve got, and where we are.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has given you spiritual gifts through the Holy Spirit, in addition to your natural talents. So work on developing all the good stuff you’ve been entrusted with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Jer 18-21, Matt 24:37-51, Ps 69:19-36, Pro 8:30-31&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=59288&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'The more you grow like this, the more productive and useful you will be.' 2 Peter 1:8 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;Capability without character is a lethal concoction. Just look to some of the celebrities who are ruined by drugs, money or pride. When your time on Planet Earth is up, it’s not your career but your character that goes with you. Christ–like character is what God wants you to grow in most of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;But what does character actually look like? You could say it’s doing the right thing when nobody’s looking. Let’s face it: a pat on the back from people is fine, but watch out that you’re not riding the wave of people–approval. You never know when the compliments could come to a crashing halt. Obviously, the best example of character is found in the life of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;But how do we make character part of our lives? Peter fleshes it out for us like this: ‘Make every effort to respond to God’s promises. Supplement your faith with a generous provision of moral excellence, and moral excellence with knowledge, and knowledge with self–control, and self–control with patient endurance, and patient endurance with godliness, and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love for everyone.’ (2 Peter 1:5–8 NLT) Your faith in Christ has to be more than belief in certain facts; it needs to result in action and growth, otherwise it could begin to wither. So think about the best spiritual food plan listed in 2 Peter 1:5–8. Make a note of what’s missing from your diet, then pray about how you can add it in.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['My Presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.' Exodus 33:14 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;'I need a holiday!' usually means somebody's had enough and is about to blow their top. They're at the end of their tether. Holidays give you the rest you need to be able to function again. What difference would it make, then, to have regular 'holy days'? God shows us an example in the creation story, back in Genesis. Obviously He wasn't tired by the seventh day. He was showing us the importance of rhythm and rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the middle of cramming for an exam? Got flatmates, siblings or parents gearing up for World War III downstairs? On the harsh end of unfair treatment? God calmly says, 'Be still and know that I am God.' (Psalm 46:10 NIV) Trust in Him. Turn the volume down on life (and the TV too if you need to), and just be with God. He knows your need, and He's got your back. He wants to share His Presence with you. So take a holy day with Him! He says, 'My Presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How are you doing at taking a day off? One day a week with no work, just time to relax and 'recreate'? Trust that God will give you a boost for the week by following His command to take a day off!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Is 8-11, John 6:1-24, Ps 126, Pr 27:17-19&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56462&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He will not forget how hard you have worked for Him...' Hebrews 6:10 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real character is about doing the right thing when nobody's watching. Letting everyone know how hard you've been working for the Lord will bring you down on par with the Pharisees. Jesus wasn't impressed with them one bit. 'Beware of doing your good deeds conspicuously to catch men's eyes or you will miss the reward of your Heavenly Father. So, when you do good to other people, don't hire a trumpeter to go in front of you - like...actors...who make sure that men admire them. Believe Me, they have had all the reward they are going to get!' (Matthew 6:1-4 PHPS)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God knows exactly what you're like inside. Doing good stuff just to please others might wind you up in knots if you don't believe God's recognition is enough and He will reward you when the time is right. Do everything as if for an audience of One. You might never hear the fanfare of recognition from people but, 'your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.' (Matthew 6:18 NIV) Can your soul imagine a warmer glow than to hear Almighty God look at you and hear Him say: 'Well done, good and faithful servant'? So, choose for yourself how you'll live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Ex 36-38, John 4:39-54, Ps 87, Pr 27:4-6&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56456&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Above all...guard your heart... it is the wellspring of life.' Proverbs 4:23 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the enemy has backed away for a time, it doesn't mean he's backed off. He could be creating space for a battering ram. If he could penetrate your outer walls of your mind, he'll gain access to your heart and so he can occupy it and take over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're in a battle. It rages every day whether you choose to participate or not. There is an enemy who wants free access to your heart, to intoxicate it and produce all sorts of vile thoughts, attitudes and behaviours. Whatever the situation, the heart of the problem is the problem of the heart. So guarding its health is a top priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go through an average day and chances are you'll get shot down once or twice. Disappointment, discouragement and disillusionment are always on the prowl. (Maybe it isn't a coincidence that 'Dis' is another name for the Greek god of hell, Hades. His family also includes disease, disaster, disapproval, discontent and so on. They too are always on the prowl.) But with God, you can be wise to these assaults. The best way to do that is to make sure your heart is filled with God. Jesus wasn't just reciting poetry when He said, 'Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.' (Matthew 5:8 NIV) Knowing God is so important because it shapes everything that we become. Jesus offers you life in its fullest sense, so don't settle for anything less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Acts 13:21-22, 1 Sam 16, 1 Sam 17:32-51, 1 Sam 24:1-17&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56457&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I consider everything a loss...compared to...' Philippians 3:8 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belonging to God doesn't mean you'll be able to waltz through life, a red carpet unrolling in front of you. Becoming a Christian comes with a cost, a call and a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commitment doesn't mean just popping #TeamJesus on your twitter bio, handy as it might be. The truth is, lots of people are standing at the sidelines of Christianity, looking in and thinking how nice Jesus is. Occasionally they give God the odd shoutout out Facebook. But when it gets down to living life out-and-out for Jesus, suddenly they're reduced to a mumble about 'not being a crazy Biblebasher' or 'but I'm one of the normal ones', or even: 'when I'm older'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people, when they decide to give Christianity a proper look, see Jesus stands with His arms open wide, offering friendship, offering strength, offering real change. Even fewer still decide to take Him by the hand, and stick with Him for life. But for the ones that do, life becomes a huge adventure. Everything is set on fire by the breath of our fiercely good God, and power fills them to the brim. Are you completely won to Christ, committed to the call and having counted the cost? Or - are you still at the sidelines?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are enough Christians in the world to win it all for God. How many of them are worth the name, though? Think: is your faith just about trying to be good or giving your all in friendship with Jesus?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Ex 39-40, John 5:1-15, Ps 41, Pr 27:7-9&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56459&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I have worked...been in prison...been flogged.' 2 Corinthians 11:23 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus didn't even get a glorious heroic kind of death, but one of ridicule and mockery. Even as He was nailed to the cross, naked and abandoned by His closest friends, the people around about were having a go at Him. Even one of the thieves who was crucified with Him joined in. Good thing then, Jesus didn't come to earth for the banter. He came to live &lt;em&gt;for us, &lt;/em&gt;and then to die &lt;em&gt;for us&lt;/em&gt;. From washing filthy feet to dying the worst possible death, Jesus' life was an ongoing example of sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the call goes out from the cross, to us, today, 'Will you come with Me? Will you follow Me? Will you give up everything for God, loving others enough to show them the way to Me?' The decision to follow Christ isn't one where we tick a box. It is to make Christ the absolute purpose of our lives, to make Him the thread that every action and word hangs off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It comes with power. It makes your life an entire whole, rather than lots of little parts. It gives you meaning and value. But it's a serious thing. Every aspiration, every dream, every hope is shattered and reshaped by the call of Jesus, and becomes something new in Him. Is it time for you to take up the challenge? If it is, turn to the inside back cover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Is 1-3, John 5:16-30, Ps 15, Pr 27:10-12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56460&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I have suffered the loss of all things.' Philippians 3:8 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who is Jesus? A great teacher who spoke with an authority like no one else? Yes, of course! The sick healed and hungry stomachs filled? Sign me up! Jesus' radiance and joy drew great masses of people to Him. The crowds loved Him. But then He started talking about 'taking up your cross'. Not once, but &lt;em&gt;daily&lt;/em&gt;. Their faces dropped to pale grey. 'Give up your life,' He said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn't about loving Him in a vague sort of way anymore. It was time to be wholly taken up in His mission, to make Him the out-and-out purpose of their lives. He got excuses - 'Pardon me while I straighten things out at home first' - but He didn't cut anyone any slack: 'Anyone who starts...and then keeps looking back is of no use for the Kingdom of God.' (Luke 9:62 GNT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't make excuses. If you don't go for it, it will be your loss, not God's. He'll just invite someone else on the adventure that could have been yours. Don't settle for second best. Fullness of life requires sacrifices. Some will be big and some might be small. But all of them will be worth it. Our tip? Don't fix your eyes on what you're being asked to give up, look at the One who asks - He is faithful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Is 4-7, John 5:31-47, Ps 5, Pr 27:13-16&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56461&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I try to find common ground...' 1 Corinthians 9:22 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth isn't always cool. Sometimes people just don't want to hear it. But there are times when you've got to stand up and be counted, and wade in for justice, for the good of people who are being mistreated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But be careful. Hypocrisy can be sniffed out a continent away, and you won't find anyone taking you seriously if there's a whiff of it on you. Think of the famous pastors caught red-handed in immorality, having spent every Sunday decrying sin from the pulpit. The other thing you've got to be aware of is your audience. Have you fully understood both the situation and the people involved? Make sure you're honestly trying to help for the good of others, not just fingerpointing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you balance the truth with grace? If a challenging conversation stems out of a relationship based on love and respect, you'll have loads more influence. The truth is a powerful thing, but unless you harness it in a loving heart, you might make people run and hide. Tactfulness is more than saying or doing the right things at the right time, it's avoiding saying or doing the wrong things at any time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Is 12-16, John 6:25-34, Ps 85, Pr 27:20-22&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56463&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Lazy people want much but get little, but those who work hard will prosper.' Proverbs 13:4 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laziness is treated pretty seriously throughout the Scriptures. Maybe you talk the talk more than you walk the walk - or simply have a habit of putting things off. The (shocking?) truth is that laziness is a sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's true that 'it is by grace you have been saved' (Ephesians 2:8 NIV), but this isn't an excuse to kick back and sleep through life. The very next verse explains that we're saved for a reason: to &lt;em&gt;live &lt;/em&gt;for God. To be transformed. To boldly show others the way to Him. It's all well and good to say, 'Phew, God airlifted me right out of that mess,' but remember that it was God who jumped into this world's mess, because He loves us, and wants to transform us rather than dump us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's not kid ourselves that God wants us to chill out and just watch Him work: sure, Christianity is full of big blessings for us, but our love for God should see us hungry to join in!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that being a Christian is having a relationship with God - and that He wants you to take an active part in His plan: Operation '&lt;em&gt;Kingdom Come On Earth&lt;/em&gt;'. So, get active in your devotion to your Heavenly Dad! Become a formidable force for the King of Creation, become someone to be reckoned with! Take a deep breath and get stuck in. Great reward waits for you if you do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Is 17-21, John 6:35-51, Ps 98, Pr 27:23-24&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56464&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['... He knew what was in a man.' John 2:25 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus put in hours of prayer, effort and time loving His disciples, and for what? When His hour of need came, they were nowhere to be seen. But despite Peter's denial and an en masse letdown by His mates, Jesus didn't regret His effort Nor did He retaliate in anger or distance Himself from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus took his friends just as they were and that always meant there was potential for hurt and disappointment. But this wasn't a deciding factor for Him. He loved them from the start to the end. And that meant having reasonable expectations of them, knowing what we humans are like (prone to getting it badly, badly wrong!) So He didn't lose the plot, even when they did. At the same time, He didn't lower His own high standards. Jesus loved without conditions or pressure. You can do it too. That may be easier to say than do, especially when someone's doing your head in. The perfect relationship, the perfect job, the perfect boss, the perfect church, the perfect neighbourhood, the perfect school, the perfect friend - none of them exist! God knows that and He never commands you to do something without giving you the ability to carry it out. Through the process of loving others, He promises you'll become more like Him. Is there someone in your life you need to be more gracious towards? Be real with God and allow Him to lighten your load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Ruth 1:8-18, Ruth 2:5-12, Ruth 3:1-6, Ruth 4:9-13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56465&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['... He knew what was in a man.' John 2:25 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we looked at how the disciples were all works-in-progress, just like you and me. Now we're looking up - and seeing who Jesus really is. He's not a work-in-process, but the uncreated totally amazing complete God of all. In Revelation 4:15:14, there's a stunning description of Him in Heaven. Before you dwell on your own struggles, challenges and frustrations, take the time to look at God, and put Him first place in your mind and life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest temptation we all face is to put ourselves on the throne within our hearts. It's human nature for God and others to slip down to second place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the feeling that life is treating us unfairly is really a loss of perspective. Romans 12:3 NIV tells us, 'Don't think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgement.' It's clear God doesn't want you wallowing in a pity party, looking inwards. But what does He want? He wants to catapult you into place as a son or a daughter of the King described in Revelation 4 &amp; 5. The Sovereign King of the Universe is your heavenly Dad. What a perspective to have on your life, looking outwards and upwards, not inwards in self-interested pity. And what a God to look up to! Do you have it and know it? If not, look up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read and familiarise yourself with Revelation 4 &amp; 5. Try to get a picture of the greatness and goodness of God in your head. Then, ask Him to lock it in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Is 22-25, John 6:52-71, Ps 127, Pr 27:25-27&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56467&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He has scattered abroad His gifts to the poor...' 2 Corinthians 9:9 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giving, particularly when you're young, can be tough to do. As little kids we don't need to give, we just demand everything we want or need and most of the time we get it. But where's that changeover point? At what age do we stop demanding our rights from our parents and start to think about what we can give to others? It's interesting that the Bible doesn't seem to think it is an age thing. It simply tells us we should give; especially to the poorest of the poor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'He has scattered abroad His gifts to the poor; His righteousness endures forever.' At first you may wonder what on earth that's about. A lot! God is totally committed to loving and healing a hurting world, and the most exciting part is He's got a part for us to play in that plan. God's concerned about the poor and making sure everyone gets a chance to hear the amazing news of the Gospel. And He has chosen you to be a part of His strategy to take care of this messed-up world! What an opportunity! Can you really believe God doesn't want to just do it all Himself, He wants to partner with you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So think today about what part God wants you to play. Think you have no cash? How about running a sponsored event to do what you can. There are a thousand great causes to give to - there's one where He especially wants your partnership. Just ask Him which it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Is 26-29, John 7:1-13, Ps 114, Pr 28:1-4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57470&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Lord Himself goes before you and will be with you...' Deuteronomy 31:8 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surely God would only send those He could trust into enemy territory. Understand this: God cares about where you are. He has selected you for your school, college or work environment. He is currently equipping you or already has. Your parents shouldn't think of sending you off on a school camp without getting you everything you need while you're away. And God definitely wouldn't! Sometimes nasty environments can be overwhelming but by God's grace we can thrive in them! If you'll take God with you and keep your identity in one piece, the enemy will lose ground. Don't let him keep you focused on everything that's doing your head in: gossip, peer pressure, being bullied, friends falling out, incorrect homework, a nasty teacher or boss. The danger is that you'll focus on the discomfort of the moment and miss the blessings that lie beyond it. While you're praying for God to change your circumstances and take away your problems, He's saying, 'If only you knew what was waiting for you. Your purpose and destiny are only moments away and, though they're not wrapped in shiny paper, they contain all you'll ever need to reach your goal and bring Me glory.' God understands us so well. He knows all about our desire to stay in one place when things become so comfortable that we just don't want to move! Often He has to trouble the waters so that we'll reach out to Him in desperation and as a result, tap into strength and success we never knew possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Is 30-33, John 7:14-24, Ps 104:1-23, Pr 28:5-8&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57472&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['They drove out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them.' Mark 6:13 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shops are full of masks, costumes, blood and other 'fun' items to help little kids enjoy Halloween. Some Christians have meetings to declare 'victory over the darkness' but others take their kids out to take part in 'trick or treat'. Whatever you think about Halloween, there's no question it's a night of celebration for Satan and behind the 'fun', it's a very important night for those involved with witchcraft and the occult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halloween is not a night to be feared. How about seeing it as a wonderful opportunity to introduce people to Jesus? It's the one night of the year that everyone wants to believe in the supernatural so rather than slam the door in little kid's faces, let's show them the power we have! How about door-knocking and asking if the neighbours would like prayer instead of saying 'trick or treat'? How about a party to celebrate Jesus where the kids are dressed as things from the Bible (an ark, a whale, a dove, a fish and so on)? Let's not teach people what we're against without showing them what we have - a magnificent, glorious and beautiful God that has totally beaten Satan already! Instead of a few magic tricks our God can heal the sick, cast out demons, raise the dead to life and give us eternal life - plus He's alive and with us right now! Why would you settle for a moment of 'fun' when He can give you a full and awesome life, if only you turn to Him?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood (All Saints' Eve): Deut 18:9-18, Dan 2, Isa 47:5-15, Acts 16:16-34&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57473&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Forgiving each other, just as...God forgave you.' Ephesians 4:32 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's this raging river you need to cross. The water is a thundering torrent like Niagara Falls, but fortunately there's a bridge to take you to the other side. It's so high and massive you won't even have to turn on your windscreen wipers to remove the spray. Then you press that button on your dash labeled 'Fire Nuclear Missile' and the bridge explodes in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who in their right mind would destroy the very thing they needed to get across the river? Yet people act like this every day when they refuse to forgive. A clergyman once said, 'He who cannot forgive others, breaks the bridge over which he must pass himself.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power of forgiveness is an awesome thing. No relationship can survive without it. Forgiveness sets both sides free and takes a missile out of Satan's hands. It opens the way for God to go to work in the situation so you can be where He wants you to be. Forgiveness needs to start with family. It's easier to forgive an enemy you don't see often than someone you live with every day. Paul writes: '...Clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. Bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances you may have against one another. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. And over all these virtues put on love...' (Colossians 3:12-14 NIV) As for anger: '...Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry, and do not give the devil a foothold.' (Ephesians 4:26-27 NIV) In other words, forgive when you are hurt, and don't take your resentments to bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Is 34-37, Jn 7:25-44, Ps 104:24-35, Prov 28:9-12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57474&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Forgive whatever grievances...' Colossians 3:13 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Christian walk isn't easy. So many of us keep going with a slight spiritual limp, a pocketful of guilt and a backpack of unworthiness and yesterday's sins. 'And I will remember your sins no more,' we read in the Bible. But have you ever heard the little ghost whispering from the cupboard? &lt;em&gt;'Ah, yes, but what about that time you exploded in anger? You embarrassed God that time...'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;'As far is the east is from the west, so He has removed our transgressions from us,' we might sing in worship time. But the ghost sitting in the row behind us bends forward to say, &lt;em&gt;'He removes other people's sins. But He shouldn't have to with you. He really expects more of you. You should know better...'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we're asked to share something up the front, we hear a whisper accusing us of hypocrisy. And if we ever think of becoming a missionary, the ghost seems to choke on its caramel latté: &lt;em&gt;'You! A missionary?!' &lt;/em&gt;It's as though we kinda believe God forgives us and remembers our sins no more, and we kinda don't. The waspish voice of the whispering ghost seems true, too. This is a sure-fire way to lead a life of keeping your head down, and never rising above your failures and doubts. If the message of the Cross seems a little too far-fetched at times - grace for &lt;em&gt;you, &lt;/em&gt;yes&lt;em&gt; you!&lt;/em&gt; - then confess your mess to God. Now try praying as if God really has no memory of it. Start praising, praying and living like you really have nothing to worry about!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Is 38-41, Jn 7:45-53, Ps 9, Prov 28:13-16&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57475&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The boat was now in the middle of the sea, tossed by the waves...' Matthew 14:24 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disciples were out in a boat on the Sea of Galilee. They knew its moods well - they'd been fishermen on its shores and even been out one time with Jesus when the mother of all storms had hit. He'd calmed the wind and waves with just a single command. But this time was different - He wasn't there. He was up on a hill praying. The winds were so wild it seemed to the disciples like the grandmother of all storms had hit. They knew from past experience the lake could be churned up like a blender for a couple of days. Knowing they were unlikely to survive this one, their fear turned to terror when they saw what they thought was a ghost. Do you feel like you're in the middle of a 'perfect storm' like this? Are you tossed by the waves of worry, terrorised by the spectre of the past? Jesus can calm it all. And His first question will be the same as that He asked the disciples as He arrived so unexpectedly: 'Why did you doubt?' (Matthew 14:31 NAS) Jesus' complete confidence in God's protection is something He wants us to get hold of for ourselves... Whatever is happening in your life at the moment - whether your boat's going under because of worry, you've got a storm over money, a job, a test or a friend - well, the man walking on the water towards you is Jesus. Not a ghost. Jesus is walking towards you telling you to 'take courage'. Take your eyes off the waves and fix them on Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Acts 9:1-19, 2 Cor 11:21-33, 2 Cor 12:7-10, Phil 3:4-14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57477&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Jesus...went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil.' Acts 10:38 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The storm was still flinging the waves around in fury when Peter said to Jesus: 'Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water.' And Jesus said, 'Come.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a minute, as Peter climbed from the boat he must have forgotten the bullying waves. He must have forgotten the boisterous wind. He must have forgotten there was nothing beneath his feet except 43 metres of water.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;But there must have been a moment when it all came rushing back and he thought, 'Thank you, laws of nature, for serving up a dangerous reminder. Thank you, wobbling balance. Thank you, logic and reason. Thank you, scary sea, for strangling the life out of me.'&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;After that thought, it got pretty hairy pretty quickly. He must have wondered why on earth Jesus invited him out of the boat in the first place. 'Lord, save me!' he cried, as he started to sink. And Jesus reached out His hand and caught Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would have all been fine if only he'd kept his eyes on Jesus. So here's the super simple lesson for you and me: &lt;em&gt;Superglue your eyes towards Jesus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The storms of life will come. Keeping your head above water depends on where you fix your eyes. When you are staring into the face of loneliness, or disability, or anxiety, the waves seem ferocious. Keeping your mind fixed on Jesus will be the difference between floating and drowning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So start your day reminding yourself God is always with you. Finish it that way too. And keep it in mind at every moment in between.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Is 42-44, Jn 8:1-20, Ps 96, Prov 28:17-20&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57478&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['You will also declare a thing, and it will be established for you...' Job 22:28 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We talk to ourselves. All the time. Not so much in the crazy-muttering-to-self kind of way but in the self-fulfilling prophecy kind of way. We cast judgments on ourselves, telling ourselves how fat or ugly we look, how croaky or stupid we sound - and sometimes how much better we are than other people. These words would be sad, but they would also be no real problem if they didn't have real-world consequences. Unfortunately sooner or later we discover that, 'Death and life are in the power of the tongue...' (Proverbs 18:21 NKJV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-belief isn't an exclusively Christian thing (and come to think of it, self-doubt certainly isn't either.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference for us who know there is a God - a God of love who created us, and who also created a sacrifice system, which He then fed Himself into in order to reclaim us (yes, that means you, too!) - is that we have a serious stamp on our self-worth. Relationships, Education, Career: this God-approval of you is meant to flow into every area of who we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, make an active choice to agree with God's statement of how worthy you are. Give up casting judgments on yourself (or on others) and change your life by first beginning to change your thoughts. Remember what Job says: 'You will...declare a thing, and it will be established for you.' So, starting today, serve an eviction notice to every negative thought that's holding you back. Instead, begin feeding your mind with God's Word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Is 45-48, Jn 8:21-30, Ps 86, Prov 28:21-24&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57479&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['... from one degree of glory to another...' 2 Corinthians 3:18 AMP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want it &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;? Instant glamour, instant muscle growth, instant weight loss, instant... hey, it doesn't matter what you want, someone out there in internet-land will promise you pretty much anything instantly. So what about instant faithfulness and godliness? Well, that's a different story. We're so used to getting things without working for them, but how can we possibly hope to become a shining reflection of God's glory, a beacon of Spirit-inspired faithfulness for His kingdom?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can't see how to make the giant leap - as if from the earth to the moon - it's because you're not meant to. Our journey is meant to be step by step, authentically ours, worked out by God's Spirit in us. It's not a fast track ticket - it's from one degree of glory to another, growing all the time - sometimes so slowly it's hardly visible and other times with a sudden spurt. And while we're not meant to work for it (and can't anyway, because it's all about the work of the Spirit in us), the rate of glory-growth is directly connected to our intake of God's Word. As we allow His Word to direct our decisions in life, the great news is that God does the hard work for us. We are &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; transformed 'from glory to glory' (2 Corinthians 3:18 ASV) - our part to play is to be up for it! It's to choose God and His glory at every opportunity. Don't be put off by the 'step by step' thing, it's God's strong plan for you to shine solidly with Him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Is 49-52, Jn 8:31-41, Ps 30, Prov 28:25-28&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57480&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...They gather gossip, and...spread it...' Psalm 41:6 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a famous Greek philosopher (philosophy = 'the love of wisdom'... &lt;em&gt;cooooool&lt;/em&gt;!) called Socrates. The story goes that a man approached Socrates one day to share some gossip. The wise philosopher asked, 'First, are you certain it's true? Second, is it something good? Third, is it something useful?' The man said, 'Not really.' So Socrates replied, 'Well, if it's not true, good or useful, why talk about it?'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Socrates knew that talking about someone else brings unnecessary nastiness. This principle is covered in the Bible too. David said, 'They visit...as if they were my friends, but...they gather gossip, and...spread it...' (Psalm 41:6 NLT) Solomon said, 'Gossip separates...best...friends' (Proverbs 16:28 NLT), and it can cause you to lose 'your good reputation.' (Proverbs 25:10 NLT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone comes to you to confide in you, or if you come by someone's secret story, how do you respond? Even before you've finished hearing it, are you already working out who you can share it with? Or is your heart breaking for them, and you're already inviting God into the situation within your heart? A rule for breaking confidentiality is this: you can't keep a secret if somebody (&lt;em&gt;including&lt;/em&gt; the person telling you) is at any risk of being harmed. Even if they ask you to. But, if that's not the case, what are you gaining by passing the secret on? Does that person actually need your prayers, and your encouragement? A test for you next time you get some juicy info: imagine whispering it to Jesus. What would He say to you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Is 53-57, Jn 8:42-59, Ps 123, Prov 29:1-3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57481&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['... Along unfamiliar paths I will guide them...' Isaiah 42:16 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is simple: so many of us confuse the Bible's teaching of 'God is love,' with a sentimental chocolate-box understanding that translates into 'God is soft-centred.' The love of God isn't like gooey fudge. The love of God is sometimes hard, like nails driven into a wooden cross. So when we find ourselves in trying times, God doesn't always lift us out of it on a sweet-scented breeze. Sometimes, out of love, God lets us endure the situation, in order that we might overcome our greatest fears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul puts it better in Romans 2:4 NIV - 'Do you make fun of God's great kindness and favour? Do you make fun of God when He is patient with you? Don't you realise that God's kindness is meant to turn you away from your sins?'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be a Christian means to want to be like Christ. Jesus didn't run away from pain. Whenever you're tempted to, you should work out why first. Sometimes, God allows us pain as part of our glory-growth and character-cultivating. Sometimes, God allows us to go through pain because He wants us to repent and come back to Him: this is the most loving thing He could ever do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know those times when you're waiting to get to sleep at night and can't stop mulling over the day? Tonight, think back to what you were like before you met God. Think about how God has brought change in your life and character. Be encouraged - the path ahead might be unfamiliar, but it's the same God leading you along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Is 58-62, John 9:1-12, Ps 15, Pr 29:4-6&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57482&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Can two walk together, unless they are agreed?' Amos 3:3 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps marriage seems a long way off to you today. That means you're in the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; place to start chewing these ideas over, while you've got loads of time to put them into practice...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;njoy&lt;/em&gt;. Really simple starter: do you enjoy the same things? &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Agreement on boundaries, children, how to manage your money, life-dreams, and your relationship with God are make-or-break issues. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ccessibility&lt;/em&gt;. Are you both emotionally accessible, or is one of you the strong silent type who doesn't communicate - or understand the other's need to? &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ove&lt;/em&gt;. Not the Disney Princess version but the kind that overlooks faults and failings, and shows itself through a naturally bubbling-up kindness? &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;U&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;nderstanding&lt;/em&gt;. Can you understand and handle each other's differences? &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;ppreciation&lt;/em&gt;. Your partner can't read your mind. It's not just nice, it's necessary to tell them you appreciate them. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;emperament&lt;/em&gt;. If your default mood is 'go' and theirs is 'hold back', it'll come back to bite in you in less patient moments... &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;nvironment&lt;/em&gt;. If you're from different backgrounds, have you talked through how you'll solve the pull of those different cultures?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't worry, we're not suggesting you go out hunting right now... Most of us are still trying to work out who we are, let alone how we relate well to that special someone. But this is some practical commitment advice for when you need it. So, if you want a happy marriage, E-V-A-L-U-A-T-E these things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Is 63-66, John 9:13-23, Ps 115, Pr 29:7-10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57483&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Given to hospitality.' Romans 12:13 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcoming people and making them feel loved and valued is an important aspect of being a follower of Jesus (John 13:34-35). God's Word tells us to practise 'hospitality'. But do we know what it means? (No, it's not about first aid or doing a hospital run.) If you are a warm person, chances are you'll be good at this welcoming hospitality thingie. If kindness is top of your priorities, again you're probably practising hospitality without even knowing you're doing it. And if you can't stand it when somebody new comes along to your church service and they're left alone sipping weak coffee in a quiet corner, well, hospitality is clearly what floats your boat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galatians 6:10 NKJ suggests that Christians are part of 'the household of faith.' What kind of 'household' do you most like visiting - one where you're kept at the door in the freezing rain or one where you can kick your shoes off and have a good natter over coffee and tim-tams? 'Hospitality' is choosing to welcome folk into our fold. 'Hospitality' walks over to the quiet corner to chat to the church visitor. 'Hospitality' invites the loner out to the cinema with the rest of your mates. 'Hospitality' always puts the kettle on, no matter who is knocking on your door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Job 1, Job 2:7-10, Job 40:1-5, Job 42:7-17&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57484&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['No matter how fast you run, you won't escape. No matter how strong you are, you will lose your strength...' Amos 2:14 CEV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever had that dream where you're running away from someone but you just can't lose them? Scary, isn't it? Well, what about when you live your life like that? Are you trying to outrun a problem but are never quite able to shake it off?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's verse warns us to face up to our problems because running away from them will only tire us out. Kristin Armstrong says something similar: 'We become...adept at running... We try to flee from our pain, our past and our issues. The problem is, we can't run or hide or push things away forever. Eventually we'll tire...and have to slow down. And when we do, all our junk will come rolling behind...headed straight for us at top speed. All the time we've been fleeing, our junk has been snowballing...picking up size and momentum. If we aren't brave enough to face it when it's small, it'll run us over later. Now's the time to...deal with it... as fast and as strong as you are, you can't keep this up much longer.' Whether your problem is physical, mental, financial or spiritual, it's better to confront it now rather than be bulldozed by it later. So, if you need to, admit you have a problem. Your next step should be to get help. Share your problem with someone you respect and trust. And bring God into the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Rom 1:1-3:20, John 9:24-41, Ps 99, Pr 29:11-14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57485&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The believers met together in the Temple every day...' Acts 2:46 NCV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Question&lt;/em&gt;: Do you get itchy if the meeting goes over an hour, or the preacher takes an extra 10 minutes? Is one meeting per week your limit? And think about it: does this attitude look anything remotely like the Church that the book of Acts glows on about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those discipley guys and gals met together in the temple &lt;em&gt;every day&lt;/em&gt;. 'They spent their time learning the apostles' teaching, sharing, breaking bread, and praying together.' (Acts 2:43 NCV) Church group wasn't a hobby, or a part-time commitment. So what was the secret? What drew these faithful fellowship-fans? Was it their cutting-edge media presentations on plasma screens? No, perhaps it was their awesome youth group programme, with teaching you could also get on an app. Of course not! So was it their brandname? Ah, maybe it was that their lives were easier, and they were just kicking about with nothing else to do? Nope. Everything about their lives was harder, took longer, and was less convenient. (Try looking up the ancient Hebrew word for 'dishwasher').&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet their encounter with Jesus had transformed their priorities so much they hungered to gather in the presence of God. They rejoiced in His promise: 'That they may all be one, just as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be in us, so that the world may believe that you have sent me.' (John 17:21 ESV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking God seriously means spending time with Him. Meeting other Christians, hearing His Word together, and encouraging one another (Hebrews 10:25). It's a time thing. And it's a together thing. Make this time-and-together thing a priority for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Rom 3:21-6:23, John 10:1-10, Ps 133, Pr 29:15-18 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57486&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The believers met together...and shared everything...' Acts 2:44 NLT &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first Christians took fellowship seriously. It wasn't like an after-school netball team or a facebook fan page for pizza. The world may not understand, may not see anything in the Church except people meeting together who share an interest in spiritual matters. However, 'Church' is a trillion times more than that. Church is family - &lt;em&gt;blood family&lt;/em&gt;. The cross made it so. The blood of Jesus that saves you also connects you to every other believer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And those early disciples really valued that relationship. It was more than singing hymns together. How about this: They 'met together...shared everything they had...sold their property and possessions and shared the money with those in need.' (Acts 2:44-45 NLT) What? That was Church?! Does this look like your experience of it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early Church survived incredible persecution and achieved amazing things. Why? Because they understood the need to value each other, and to sacrifice personal interest for the sake of the whole. As isolated, self-reliant, self-promoting individuals they would have been destroyed by the overwhelming force of their enemies. As a believer, you may survive apart from the church, but you can't thrive. Your God-given potential will never be realised until you commit wholeheartedly to a local fellowship and invest yourself in serving God's vision for that church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Rom 7:1-9:16, John 10:11-21, Ps 83:1-8, Pr 29:19-22 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57487&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['All the believers devoted themselves to...prayer.' Acts 2:42 NLT &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If all the believers devoted themselves to prayer, what exactly did they do with the other 23 hours and 55 minutes of the day? Or wait! Actually five minutes of prayer before they went to sleep probably wasn't the way to establish a church that has lasted over two thousand years...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This word, '&lt;em&gt;devoted&lt;/em&gt;', seems to imply they were &lt;em&gt;dedicated&lt;/em&gt; to prayer. It wasn't an afterthought or just something to humour God with every now and again. Prayer was a treasured part of being a Christian. Prayer meetings attracted huge groups of people. There must have been something exciting about it to become such an important part of the first church. Do you find it too hard to imagine what it must be like to give up everything we have and share it with others? Well, that's because we can't imagine praying hours upon hours every day. Prayer changes something in us for the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consistent prayer lifts us to a higher, positive place where we learn how to achieve more while at the same time experiencing deep peace of heart and soul. Jesus said: 'Come to Me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.' (Matthew 11:28-30 NIV) What are you waiting for?&lt;strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Let us not give up meeting together...' Hebrews 10:25 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;They took God's Word seriously. 'They spent their time learning the apostles' teaching...' (Acts 2:42 NCV) Researchers tell us that, today, personal Bible reading is less common among Christians than prayer. We've tagged-out a word from God that empowers us for the challenges of the day, and tagged-in 'going to the gym' and 'energy drink' or 'cappuccino'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For too many of us our only Bible input is our pastor's Sunday sermon (or the title verse of a &lt;em&gt;word4U2day&lt;/em&gt; reading). Compare that to the early disciples, in a world where being able to read was rare, and a Scripture scroll of just one book would cost the same comparatively as a luxury car today... The early disciples were so committed to the Word that they spent [invested, paid the price with] their time, learning [studying to understand and master] the apostles' teaching. That meant that not only did it build them up to face everyday challenges, but when persecution made them fugitives, they took the Word with them to new churches they planted around the world (Acts 8:4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jesus started His earthly ministry and began revealing what God is like, He didn't pull out a guitar or put on a course in miracles. He read from a Bible scroll (Luke 4:14-22). You want to know God? You want to understand the big picture? Read your Bible. Start with today's SoulFood reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

<title><![CDATA[A Fixed Point in Time]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[a-fixed-point-in-time]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...My unfailing love for you will not be shaken...' Isaiah 54:10 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today open your Bible, get God's opinion of you and build your life on it. 'Though the mountains be shaken and the hills be removed, yet My unfailing love for you will not be shaken...says the Lord.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world around you, the one made up of things as solid-seeming as mountains, hills, and Saturday afternoon job shifts, will dissolve away one day. It's true. But long after the universe-as-we-know-it winds up for good, this verse tells us something will stand unshaken and very real - a force standing firm to be reckoned with. A 'fixed point in time', if you will, &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who &lt;/em&gt;fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That fixed point, that long beam of light that shines through your life from one end to the other, is God's kindness. He's locked up that kindness in a trustable, 'future-proof' covenant with you. This means He won't go back on it, even if the world were to fall apart (which, uh, it will, at some point). &lt;em&gt;This &lt;/em&gt;is the answer to the anxieties and niggles that keep you up at night. If you've ever been bothered by fears of death, &lt;em&gt;this &lt;/em&gt;is the secure comfort your Father has given you: the assurance His love comes from somewhere deeper than this reality, and long outlasts your earthly 'best-before' stamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Rom 15-16, John 11:17-27, Ps 8, Pr 30:5-6 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57490&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I bear him witness that he has a great zeal...' Colossians 4:13 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where are you at today? If your interest in church and Christianity is waning, this one's especially for you. Are you finding the idea of living an independent life off your own bat much more appealing? Are worship and Bible-reading starting to feel more like a 'blah' than a blessing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good way to begin a change is to let God know. Really! God's all about honesty. If you're thinking about checking out completely on this Christian gig, consider asking God to persuade you otherwise. It's a win-win! Sincerity goes a long way with Him. Chances are He'd love to show you that solid happiness is found in living His way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also: learning to come at your faith from a different angle is not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, trading in church-ianity for the real, rich depths of knowing God &lt;em&gt;can't&lt;/em&gt; be a bad thing. When you get real with God, He may well awaken a hunger for Himself in you, and begin a desire in you to eagerly search for Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So don't give up on your Church life, if you have one (far from it! God longs to know you through the other Christians you hang out with) but build on it! Add in friends, the beauty of nature, a good piece of music: these are great places to experience God too. He is always speaking to you, and always seeking for you.&lt;/p&gt;

<alias><![CDATA[are-you-in-the-wilderness]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['He...guided them in the wilderness...' Psalm 78:52 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a wilderness it's a struggle to move, water is scarce, and you plod on with no end in sight. Your average Duke of Edinburgh trip is a handy Scriptural metaphor for spiritually miserable times. Yet you can have a wilderness experience anywhere: at a graveside, at the Job Centre, or in a particularly messy breakup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a wilderness you can feel like an actor who's forgotten the right lines. 'A Christian should act in a certain way, speak in a certain way, pray in a certain way... but I just can't do it right now!' But it's there, as you're standing frozen on-stage, that God reminds you from the prompter's box: 'Remember Me. Remember what I've done in the past. Remember how I've dealt with you. Hasn't it all been for your good?'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After clinging to His Father in a doubly-real wilderness, Jesus burst back out of the desert clothed in the power of God's Spirit, ready to launch His power onto an unsuspecting world. And God can turn your life around like that too. 'He...guided them in the wilderness...He led them on safely, so that they did not fear...' (Psalm 78:52-53 NKJ) If your life is a whole lot of wild nothingness right now, stand on His promise: That if you love God, He will work all things together for your good (Romans 8:28). So, remember God's Word in the sidelines of your life (this could be especially in the moments when you're feeling most low) and He will give you strength (Psalm 119:28).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...Do not be afraid...I am with you...' Acts 18:9-10 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you out yourself as a Christian, it's the rejection of friends and family that hurts the most. It can put a fog over your faith. And in the middle of that fog the last thing you want to do is keep telling others about what a huge part of your life Jesus is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Paul tried to share his new faith with his old friends, 'They opposed him.' (Acts 18:6 NKJ) It seems like Paul was so stung by their rejection God had to encourage him, saying, 'Do not be afraid...I am with you, and no one is going to...harm you.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BUT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, BUT...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something fairly amazing happens when we get serious opposition. In Psalm 23:5 NLT, David said, 'You prepare a feast for me in the presence of my enemies. You honour me by anointing my head with oil. My cup overflows with blessings.' What's he saying? That when enemy fire reached point-blank range, God set up an all-you-can-eat buffet bar. Uh... what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the times when we feel ourselves most under fire, God doesn't just reassure us, He gives us a double-whammy of His presence and His blessings. And He describes it as a 'feast'. The very time you feel you want to give up could be the time you most need to wait on God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Ecc 5-8, John 11:38-57, Ps 81, Pr 30:11-14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57495&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The world and all that is in it is mine...' Psalm 50:12 NRS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;'...God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being.' (Genesis 2:7 NKJ) The bottom line is: We're God's. We're owned by Him as part of His creation, with the gift of His creative spark breathed into us. But, as CS Lewis writes in &lt;em&gt;The Problem of Pain,&lt;/em&gt; fallen human beings always 'want some corner in the universe of which they could say to God, &quot;This is our business, not yours.&quot; But there is no such corner.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with that is that when you decide to leave God's territory, there's nowhere else to go! 'Independence' sounds ideal to a sin-smeared humanity eager to get out of the blaze of God's sight. But we often confuse rebellion with independence. True independence is a bilateral agreement whereas rebellion is a unilateral declaration. So the sort of 'independence' that means walking away from the One who breathed life into you is really rebellion that leads to a dead-end brick wall. The only territory is God's. Any other 'territory' - anywhere where human beings say, 'I'm the king of this jungle' - is an illusion. And as creatures, not Creators, the only right way to live is stitched back into the one who first breathed life into us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the stamp of His ownership over everything in your life, as He designed it to be? Where are you saying, even quietly, 'This bit is my business' to God? Today is the day to turn it over to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Ecc 9-12, John 12:1-11, Ps 76, Pr 30:15-17&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57503&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<title><![CDATA[Tap Into Your Creativity]]></title>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['God created man in His own image...' Genesis 1:27 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creativity is simply doing something well - in the best way that &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; would do it. But isn't it funny how little we tap into that God-given creativity? Think about all the jobs left half-done, all the imaginations left alone since childhood. Other people might be more educated and experienced, but they don't have a monopoly on creativity. No one does - only God. And He has freely created people in His image. That means you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creativity is a gift of our God-reflecting identity. It's a shame when this gift gets shunted aside. Maybe you feel called to paint, preach, play a piano, build a business, nurse, farm... or whatever. Make the leap and do it. Don't think about doing it, don't plan to do it... just take a step! If you wait until you can do it perfectly or without criticism, you'll never do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking on water begins with one step of faith. Doing what God's designed you to do also brings you closer to Jesus. You see, Jesus wasn't in the boat during the storm. He was out on the water, saying to His disciples, 'Come.' (Matthew 14:29 NKJ) Only one of them did: Peter. And though he did it imperfectly, it changed his life. Creativity is like that. So don't be afraid, tap into your creativity and watch what happens!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Gen 1-3, John 12:12-19, Ps 102:1-11, Pr 30:18-20&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57504&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Enthusiasm without knowledge is no good; haste makes mistakes.' Proverbs 19:2 NLT &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motives matter. Enthusiasm on its own means nothing. If you're rushing into Christian habits without knowing God, then you'll plant your face in failure. You'll keep tripping up over what seems to come naturally to the Christians around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a mistake to rush into a faith life without first knowing God. In fact, it could do more damage to your soul than good. But don't despair! This is a 'redirect-your-sights' message. Acquaint yourself with Christ before making any attempt at 'trying to be a Christian' - otherwise it'll be like trying to play the drums without a sense of rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your soul was made to be at rest in God. So get yourself settled with Him first. Let your soul become close and familiar with Him. Would you rather have the strain and stress of developing all the highest evangelism skills, prayer teams and missionary giftings in the world - or the sort of life where these things come naturally to you because you're consumed with God and delighted to be with Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is calling you - but He wants you to know Him first of all, before you work for Him. How are you responding to that call right now? Are your priorities right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Gen 4-6, John 12:20-36, Ps 102:12-17, Pr 30:21-23&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57505&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<alias><![CDATA[who-are-you-trying-to-please]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Let my words and...thoughts be pleasing to You, Lord...' Psalm 19:14 CEV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did you wake up today ready to live for other people? Good. Did you wake up worried about pleasing other people? Hold on a sec before you head out the door...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They might sound like similar things, but they're really not. The Bible says, 'Fearing people is a dangerous trap...' (Proverbs 29:25 NLT) Always being worried about what other people think about you, and trying to please them in case they secretly hate you - that comes from fearing people. If you find yourself unable to say 'no', even when your friends are exploiting you - that comes from fearing people. If you find yourself being way too 'loyal' or reliant on a boyfriend or girlfriend just to get some validation - that comes from fearing people. If you're always wanting to get a laugh because you're worried people don't like you - yep, that too comes from fearing people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember what Paul says, 'When I was a child...I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me.' (1 Corinthians 13:11 NIV) A mature Christian will want to live for other people. But only when they've got their priorities sorted - the first thing they'll be concerned about is making sure that their 'words and...thoughts' please God. Confidence in God's love for you will lift you above all the miserable anxiety that comes with fearing people. Ever heard of people long ago who were described a 'God-fearing'? Sounds like they were more concerned about God's rules than His love, doesn't it? But all you have to do to live a 'God-fearing' life is to be more bothered about what God thinks than what people do.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

<title><![CDATA[Try a Bit of Thankfulness]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[try-a-bit-of-thankfulness]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['In everything give thanks...' 1 Thessalonians 5:18 NKJV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, try to start a habit of saying 'thank you' (out loud, if you can) for as many things as you can manage. People who fill their lives with gratitude for the ordinary things of life become dispensers of serious joy. Not just the words 'thank you' - the words aren't magic. But making space and time to offer God little, sincere 'thank yous' in your day will change you; it will make you slow down, and take time to notice the way the world really is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why 'in &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt;thing give thanks?' The best things in life are those God gives us the most of-the quiet things that make up the fullness of ordinary life. (Isn't breakfast wonderful?! It's supercalifragilistically seriously scrumptious! And yet, most every day we battle through it bleary-eyed...) God gives us lives generally made up of relationships, sleeping, eating and getting on with work. We take them for granted, and forget they're supposed to be rewarding in themselves. It's worth being reminded that even the most basic things in life are from God, and if they're from God, they must be &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;. Thankfulness does that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wondering how to get a bit of life in your faith? Maybe, simply, try being thankful. Remember, '...the joy of the Lord is your strength.' (Nehemiah 8:10 NIV) When you take joy in all of the little things He's given you, your life lights up, and you get legs for your faith. So, have a shot at thanking our Father God for as much as you can, right now. See how it goes!&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...You will not grieve like people who have no hope.' 1 Thessalonians 4:13 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Death. Even reading the word can set your emotions running. And when it comes to the subject, it's easy for Christians to dodge the bullet and escape into wishy-washy, irrelevant-sounding talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But God doesn't do that. Listen - these are His words: 'Dear brothers and sisters, we want you to know what will happen to the believers who have died, so you will not grieve like people who have no hope.' The Bible is direct and concrete on this subject. From God's perspective, it is still a tragic thing, and a horrible thing, for His children to go through here on earth. He knows it. It's not part of His original plan for humanity. But hope is always the final word: God says, 'Write: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on. Yes, says the Spirit, they will rest from their labour, for their deeds will follow them.' (Revelation 14:13 NIV) In Jesus, there's far more to death than just tragedy, it's a triumphal entry into Heaven. Death will open the door for Him to enjoy perfect friendship with each of His precious ones, forever. God gets it that, when we lose a loved one, we can forget: '...whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord.' (Romans 14:8 NIV) It doesn't take away from how hard it is, but we can trust that our Lord takes good care of what belongs to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And remember: hope is God's final word over death. The resurrection of Jesus is His promise for us. Jesus didn't cheat death, He conquered it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...God will bring back with [Jesus] the believers who have died.' 1 Thessalonians 4:14 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;God says there'll be a day when He'll wipe away all tears (Revelation 21:4). He's given us that promise because, frankly, tears are a given with life on earth, and He wants to remind us that He didn't mean it ever to be that way. So even in the worst pain, we can know that no silent tear is wasted, no gut-wrenching heartbreak goes unnoticed, and no sighs of despair are ever without hope. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) '&lt;em&gt;We believe that Jesus died and was raised to life again.&lt;/em&gt;' (Thessalonians 4:14 NLT) All hope begins here: the fact that He died and lives again. And we follow in our Master's footsteps! So it makes sense that when we die, there'll be a day when we stand up on our feet again. We will live again too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) &lt;em&gt;Since we believe this, we also believe that, well... Jesus returns!&lt;/em&gt; He's alive now, so it's not the end of the story. His return to earth, in an actual physical body just like first time around, gives us confidence that 'God will bring back with Him the believers who have died.' God will put us back in actual bodies, just like Jesus (Romans 8:11). It won't be re-incarnation: our spirits going to different bodies. We get our own back-perfected! 'He will take our weak mortal bodies and change them into glorious bodies like his own...' (Philippians 3:21 NLT) Imagine that! It almost sounds too good to be true. All the old things-pain, crying, death-will pass away. You'll stand up on your feet again, and you'll be at home at last, in God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['We tell you this directly from the Lord...' 1 Thessalonians 4:15 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years back, comedy actor Ricky Gervais starred in the film &lt;em&gt;The Invention of Lying&lt;/em&gt;. The storyline of the movie is that there's a place everyone tells the absolute truth all the time - until one day, Ricky's character realises he can say something that's not true. Later on, his dying mum asks what happens when you die. To comfort her, he makes up a story about Heaven and God. As the concept of lying doesn't exist in this place, she and everyone else believes this story wholeheartedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sad message behind this movie is that the writers genuinely 'know' Heaven's just a lie made up to make people feel better about dying. It's a fairytale - in real life, so they tell us, there are no happily-ever-evers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all we had was the &lt;em&gt;idea&lt;/em&gt; of Heaven, we might be tempted to doubt its actuality too... But our belief in it is locked into a far more trustworthy experience of God's reality. When Paul wrote today's passage about death, he heard straight from the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those in relationship with Jesus, death is nothing to fear and Heaven is a certainty. And in fact, death is just the beginning! This truth should give us the confidence to live without fear of the end, as well as be motivated to share the truth with those who don't know Him. So, pray for someone you know who has yet to put their trust in Jesus and for an opportunity to talk about God with them. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Gen 17-19, John 13:31-38, Ps 118:1-9, Pr 31:6-9&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57979&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...To go and be with Christ, which would be far better...' Philippians 1:23 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most well known quotes of the apostle Paul is 'for to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.' (Philippians 1:21 NIV) But what does it mean? Let's be honest, few of us really want to die. There may be moments when life seems particularly woeful and dying genuinely feels like it wouldn't be so bad. But most of the time, we're quite happy to live and go on living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if living is Christ, what does that mean or look like? For Paul, it quite simply meant all of his life decisions were made 'for Christ', rather than for his own benefit. He lived as much like Christ as he possibly could. He did his best to love people and live generously. He delighted to share the Good News of God's grace with as many people as possible as often as possible - despite the consequences, abuse and imprisonment he faced. He encouraged, corrected, learned, taught, and never ever put himself first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul lived the way he did by imitating Christ, and that's precisely what we should do too. Copy Jesus. If you're not sure what to pray, then pray as He did. If you want to see miracles, pray for the sick. Love people. Feed the hungry. Build relationships. Spend time with the Father. Give generously. Learn as much as you can and live to serve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Gen 20-23, John 14:1-14, Ps 118:10-18, Pr 31:10-13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57980&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['... see that you also excel in this grace of giving.' 2 Corinthians 8:7 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2 Corinthians, Paul challenges the Christians with the example of the Church in Macedonia: 'the midst of a very severe trial, their overflowing joy and their extreme poverty welled up in rich generosity. I testify that they gave...even beyond their ability. Entirely on their own, they urgently pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing in this service to the Lord's people...They gave themselves first of all to the Lord, and then by the will of God also to us.' (2 Corinthians 8:1-5 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When was the last time you saw a bunch of Christians fighting over giving to the offering plate? On the contrary: many a Christian has a reputation as someone who never tips, someone who buys a drink for themselves without offering to bless others and someone who ignores the homeless 'because they're bound to waste any money on drugs'! Paul saw Christ in the Macedonian church because they knew full well that all they had was by God's grace and they couldn't wait to be 'God's wallet on earth', distributing money the way He wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What reputation do you have with your friends, especially non-Christian ones? Generous or stingy? (If you're unsure, ask them!) What does this say about Jesus? Does anything need to change?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['... see that you also excel in this grace of giving.' 2 Corinthians 8:7 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our giving should spring from gratitude for what Christ has done for us. Paul writes: '...though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, so that you through His poverty might become rich.' (2 Corinthians 8:9 NIV) Understanding how generous God is to us is important, because some of us give Him our leftovers. If anything remains after we've paid the bills and done everything we want, we'll give. But even a million dollars, if it's out of our leftovers, is hardly our best. Some people are 're-givers'. Re-givers receive a present they don't want, then wrap it up and give it to someone else. That's how some of us approach giving to God - and it's an insult! In the New Testament you don't see preachers begging, selling stuff or using gimmicks to raise money for God's work. What you see is people like the Macedonians responding to God's grace because they understood and loved the God they served. Everything God created was meant to give. He created the sun to give light during the day and the moon and stars during the night. He created flowers to give seeds. God Himself is a giver: 'For God so loved the world, that He &lt;em&gt;gave&lt;/em&gt;...' (John 3:16 KJV) When you understand grace, your situation takes a back seat. Your giving is not determined by your spend-to-income ratio. No, it's motivated by God's grace!&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Children are a blessing.' Psalm 127:3 CEV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our families can be seemingly endless, tremendously complex or virtually non-existent. Every single person is a product of their own upbringing and unique experiences. This can make people incredibly talented in their particular roles or it alternatively lead to the feeling they fall very much short. Good or bad, we're still supposed to love 'em.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Matthew's Gospel, Jesus' mother Mary and her other sons came looking for Him. When He was told, Jesus said He was already with His family: 'Anyone who does the will of My Father in Heaven is My brother and sister and mother!' (Matthew 12:50 NLT) Jesus wasn't being mean and He hadn't fallen out with His family either. He was showing us that, when we choose to make God our Father, we get a new family and we are related - by His blood! Just like your earthly family, your spiritual family will have people you love and people that drive you up the wall. However, just like an irritating big brother or mean cousin, we're called to have patience, understanding and love for them anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know some Christians who are just driving you nuts? It's time for some action. Practise praying blessing on them... you will soon discover how you feel begins to mysteriously change!&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...the words of the wise bring healing.' Proverbs 12:18 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colossians 4:6 NKJ says that our words should be '&lt;em&gt;seasoned with salt&lt;/em&gt;'. Salt has two primary purposes: it preserves and it adds flavour. This means that our speech should preserve and bring health to all who hear it. It should bring life to the soul, not destroy, harm or upset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is very hard to do if what's in your heart is negative, bitter, angry or jealous. James says, '&lt;em&gt;You can't draw fresh water from a salty spring&lt;/em&gt;.' (James 3:12 NLT) In other words, you can't fake what's in your heart. It's not just a question of learning to say the right things; it's about that right attitude going all the way down to the core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Words are powerful. A single person can impact someone's entire life with a throwaway comment such as: 'You don't know what you're talking about.' If we have a low opinion of ourselves, it's easy to feel our words have no effect - that no one listens. But in truth, whatever you think about yourself, your words will have an impact on others. Watch your words carefully! Keep a mental check of the words you speak today, and whether they're spoken thinking about other people's best interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...Be careful to do what is right...' Romans 12:17 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeremiah writes, '&lt;em&gt;Like a partridge that hatches eggs it did not lay is the man who gains riches by unjust means... in the end he will prove to be a fool&lt;/em&gt;.' (Jeremiah 17:11 NIV) It's easy to think that it's ok to do whatever you like as long as it's small and no one notices. Whether you steal a dollar or a million, you're still sinning against someone, and against your heavenly Father. Each little sin chips away at your integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And integrity is costly. If you want to be someone who's got it, you need to act with it... from this point onwards, if you haven't done so before. You also need to deal with baggage you've built up for yourself in your past. If you don't, then you can almost guarantee that, as pressure increases in the future, these hidden things will come to a head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some ways to act with integrity: (1)&lt;em&gt; Keep your promises&lt;/em&gt;. (2) &lt;em&gt;Acknowledge your mistakes.&lt;/em&gt; When your decisions don't turn out the way you intended, you owe people an explanation. (3) &lt;em&gt;Apologise and try to make amends&lt;/em&gt;. When your actions hurt others, you need to admit that what you did was wrong and say you're sorry. It's virtually impossible to move on, if you don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's time to be honest about your honesty. What hidden mistakes do you carry - those that make you feel sick when you remember them? Confess and put things right so that you can move into integrity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Gen 30:25-31:55, John 15:18-27, Ps 65, Pr 31:25-27&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57985&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve.' Joshua 24:15 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The ‘Great Commission’ is probably one of the most misquoted passages in the Bible. Before He ascended to Heaven, Jesus didn’t instruct the onlookers to go and preach the Gospel but to go and ‘...make disciples of all the nations…’ (Matthew 28:19 NLT) There’s a difference! God &lt;em&gt;can &lt;/em&gt;still work wonders in someone’s life, if you dump the Gospel on them and run. However, His instruction to you is to walk with others through solid long-term discipleship, investment and teaching (which is so much more rewarding anyway!)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Some feel called to ‘evangelism’ and others to ‘discipleship’, but the truth is we’re all called to both. A gift of evangelism is not a cop-out for avoiding the long hard road of discipleship. A gift of discipleship is no excuse to step back from sharing the good news with people who need to hear it. Youth and inexperience isn’t an excuse because however little you may feel you know, &lt;em&gt;there are people who need to hear it from &lt;/em&gt;YOU.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Are you being discipled? Jesus’ ministry was all about investing in a few who, in turn, invested in a few and so on. It’s so vital that, if we’re to grow as Christians, we have someone mentoring, challenging and investing in us. It’s through this that we learn, grow and have a safe space to discover God’s purpose for our lives. The challenge today is to look at your own discipleship both as a learner and a teacher.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...don't follow the path of evildoers.' Proverbs 4:14 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Every path you take in life leads somewhere. The Bible says, ‘&lt;em&gt;Don’t do as the wicked do, and don’t follow the path of evildoers. Don’t even think about it; don’t go that way. Turn away and keep moving&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Proverbs 4:14-15 NLT) It takes so little for evil to take a grip on our lives, it’s really quite alarming! All that is needed is a small foot in the door, a lapse of concentration, a silly decision made in a mad moment and we’re skidding down slippery slopes at a serious pace.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;It’s supposed to take twenty one days to form a habit. But have you ever noticed how much easier it is to slip into habits that are bad for us? A prime example would be porn. It’s part of everyday life in school, TV and all over the internet. For many people it’s much harder to avoid than find. With the sexualisation of advertising plus the exploitation so rife in our culture, it seems impossible not to become habitual watchers for many people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;But it’s a path that leads nowhere good as anyone who got hooked will tell you. God’s warning about these paths is clear and wise - step off and walk away. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;If you are struggling with such an addiction, http://www.&lt;strong&gt;x3watch&lt;/strong&gt;.com/&lt;strong&gt;x3watchfree&lt;/strong&gt;.html is a site providing a good starting point for support.

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['We have fellowship with each other, and the blood of Jesus...cleanses us from all sin.' 1 John 1:7 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bible says, '&lt;em&gt;a nearby neighbour can help you more than relatives who are far away&lt;/em&gt;.' (Proverbs 27:10 GNT) One of the problems we face in our modern society is the disposable nature of relationships. Even the relationships that should be permanent are easily undone. Some children have a conveyor belt of 'fathers'. It seems easier to get a divorce than change your broadband service provider. For some people friendships sit at the bottom of the relationship loyalty scale, just below your mobile phone supplier and doctor, with no commitment required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet there are examples throughout the Bible of covenant friendships - relationships where unbreakable promises were made to one another. These are God-given, beautiful and life-giving relationships. David and Jonathan were friends who swore they would care for and protect each other always. Naomi promised Ruth she would follow her and never leave her alone... and she never ever did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children easily promise to be 'BFFs', but as we get older, life usually moves us on. Maybe as we grow up, we need to look out for a BFF or two. Choose wisely, and when the moment is right make a verbal commitment - a covenant: an agreement with no get-out clause. Give it to God and see how He uses that united friendship to do together what you could never have achieved alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Gen 37-39, John 17:1-26, Ps 147:1-11, Ecc 3:5-8&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57988&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Being fully convinced that what He had promised He was also able to perform.' Romans 4:21 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few of us tend to go automatically to God when we're disappointed. Instead of prayer as our default mode, our knee-jerk reaction, we tend to wait until the disappointment fades a bit and we're able to lick our wounds ourselves. Maybe deep down inside, we aren't fully convinced He wants to help us, or maybe we just think He can't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you think He can? Even the most devoted Christians can still lack faith when disappointment strikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tend to outfit God in human qualities that are just plain wrong. We expect Him to be annoyed or get tired of us. We think we ask Him for too much. Fight the doubt with truth: the fact of the matter is that God &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; able to help. He &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; bigger than our problems. He &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; understand. God &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt;to help us. '&lt;em&gt;Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us.&lt;/em&gt;' (Ephesians 3:20 NKJ) God calls you a friend. You don't annoy Him. He &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; you to depend on Him, to ask Him for help. He cherishes you. He adores you. Why is that so hard to believe? Wait on Him - it's so worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['We are God's masterpiece...' Ephesians 2:10 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before life happened, before we started to worry about what we looked like, before we began to measure ourselves up, before we were hurt, before we felt like we had to prove something... wasn't it nice to be a kid?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you believe in Christ, you are God's own child. There is nothing you can do to be in this &lt;em&gt;Kid-of-God Club&lt;/em&gt;, you just are! When you say you aren't good enough, or you are willing to compromise what you believe to fit in, you're disagreeing with God, second-guessing His taste. You are telling Him - God, the Master of the universe - that what He did is not good enough. Because Jesus died on the cross for your sins, God sees you as innocent once again, like the child you once were (better, even!) Because you matter to Him, and there's nothing you can do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got a mirror? Look at yourself. What does God see in you? He sees His child. If you have one of those crayons that works on glass (or a dry-wipe marker), write on the mirror: 'I matter, because God loves me.' Say it out loud. You matter. Because God loves you. #Score.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...You have promised these good things to your servant.' 2 Samuel 7:28 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;What if there came a time when you stopped talking to your best friend? No calls, no texts, no talking, nothing. They wouldn’t be your best friend much longer. Your relationship would probably be over pretty quick.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;And what if you then just talked about them like you were still close? Telling stories of what it used to be like? That’s no relationship at all. Your friendship with your best friend is what a relationship with Jesus is supposed to look like - alive, caring, talking. It’s a friendship. He knows you. He has seen the best and worst things you’ve done and thought. And He still loves you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Being a Christian is not about hearing stories about Jesus, or talking about how we are supposed to act. Being a Christian is about having a relationship with Jesus. This is a relationship where you talk to Him, and listen to Him. And He loves it. He loves being close to you. He loves hearing you tell Him your deepest thoughts and hurts (yep, &lt;em&gt;even though&lt;/em&gt; He already knows them). And what do we get out of it? He has promised ‘good things’ to those who believe Him for them! He came to give us life, and life worth getting out of bed for. An amazing adventure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Think about your relationship with Christ. What kind of friend are you to Jesus? Are you spending as much time with Him as you should be?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Gen 42-43, John 18:19-40, Ps 148:1-6, Ecc 5:1-3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57991&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Love covers over a multitude of sins.' 1 Peter 4:8 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Ok, &lt;em&gt;word4U2day&lt;/em&gt; has been thumping the point about getting older, wiser mentors in your life for while now. But guiding and helping isn’t a task that’s only for mentors. As Christians, we can all call each other out - so long as it’s done with grace and wisdom - point each other to God, and teach each other things we’ve learned. And bonus points: teaching others helps that same good advice to sink in to you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Here are some prime pointers for teaching others (which will bat blessings back to you, btw):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;(1) &lt;em&gt;Love imperfect people&lt;/em&gt;. Learning to love people is hard to do, especially since people can be pretty nasty at times. So, teach others that loving is a risk worth taking. A good way to do this is, well, by loving them when they’re imperfect...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;(2) &lt;em&gt;The future can be better than the past.&lt;/em&gt; If you can bounce back from hard times, other people will be encouraged that it’s possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;(3) &lt;em&gt;Adapt to change.&lt;/em&gt; Life is constantly changing. If you don’t like that, you’ll find things pretty hard. You have a choice and can get over mistakes. (God actively wants to help you with this, btw. Chat with Him about it.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Today would be a good day to thank the people who raised you: parents, carers, grandparents. Teaching kids isn’t easy. And if you were raised by a single parent, be a little extra grateful today. Your parent has a bigger job: taking care of you &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;their own life can be a little heavy. Remember that, and find some practical way of showing your thanks.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Gen 44-46, John 19:1-24, Ps 148:7-14, Ecc 5:4-9	&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57992&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The Lord is my helper, I will not be afraid...' Hebrews 13:6 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Worry' can be a real troll. Give it a centimetre and it'll take half the galaxy. Give it five minutes, and BOOM! Meet your mind's new tenant. And is it loud! First thing in the morning, last thing at night, it's drumming right in the forefront of your thoughts, squelching your peace and robbing you of all joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a follower of Christ, you have the authority to serve worry an eviction notice and it must leave. The only thing that enables it to stay is your ignorance of that truth. When your mind is occupied with God's Word, worry sees a 'no vacancy' sign and moves on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul says, 'For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh. For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds, casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ.' (2 Corinthians 10:3-5 NKJ) The weapons God has given you to fight with are greater than the fears you face. But you must know your weapons, keep them in good repair, and be able to use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God wants us to have peaceful minds. Filter your thoughts like your words. Do they bring life or death? If the thoughts bring worry, reject them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Lev 26-27, Mt 7:1-12, Ps 74:12-23, Prov 2:7-8&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56905&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Trying to become perfect by your own human effort?' Galatians 3:3 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were raised on Disney films. Whatever we want to be, we can be. Right? Shrug. Maybe. Hopes and dreams need more than a vague sense the world owes us some sort of destiny. But we also can't run ourselves dry chasing after them. There has to be somewhere between the 'Let's-take-on-the-wooorld!!!' and the 'I'm-gonna-slump-on-the-couch-and-eat-a-sanger' approach to life. Let's see...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) &lt;em&gt;Short and sweet&lt;/em&gt; - give it all up to God. Then He'll kick back any dreams He doesn't see as worth your time or His glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) &lt;em&gt;Live today, as it is &lt;/em&gt;- not as you think it should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3) &lt;em&gt;Set small realistic goals&lt;/em&gt; that can be reached, but don't be afraid if they require you to stretch a little further than normal. Maybe you'll surprise yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(4) &lt;em&gt;Don't spend forever trying to get one little thing of your life perfect&lt;/em&gt;. It's about healthy living, not obsession. And finally, what about - -?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(5) &lt;em&gt;When you mess up&lt;/em&gt;: Oh, wait, you aren't perfect? Well, surprise. Neither is anyone else. It's ok. Promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(6) &lt;em&gt;When you give up&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Find your worth in God - not what you can do, or how you look, or what things you have, or what other people say. Never forget that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Gen 47-49, John 19:25-42, Ps 150, Ecc 5:10-12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57993&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

Romans 12:6 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Peter Brock was one of Australia’s best known and most successful motor racing drivers. During his career ‘Brocky’ won Bathurst nine times and was crowned Australian Touring Car (now V8 Supercars) Champion on three occasions. Because of his success and driving skill he earned the nickname ‘Peter Perfect’. Despite his immense driving skill, tragically a motor racing accident took his life in 2006. Brocky was definitely a gifted driver but he’d be the first to admit he wasn’t perfect.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;‘We [all] have different gifts’ - so what are you doing with yours? You may never win a motor race but we all should work hard at developing and extending the gifts God has given to us. However the Bible also clearly warns us against ‘trying to become perfect by your own human effort.’ (Galatians 3:3 NLT) It’s not going to happen! ‘We have different gifts, according to the grace given us.’ When you strive to be somebody other than the person God intended, you end up feeling angry, inadequate and frustrated. God purposely gifted us all in different areas. Once you realise that, you can start to minister from your particular area of giftedness. Remember, every one of us is a work-in-progress, so cut yourself some slack. Instead of trying to become perfect, begin to thank God for making you one-of-a-kind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Gen 50, Haggai 1-2, John 20:1-18, Ps 105:1-7, Ecc 5:13-16&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57994&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I will set before my eyes no vile thing...' Psalm 101:3 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Story time. One day the Queen needed a new chauffeur. The first guy she tried out did pretty well in the interview, so she let him take her out for a spin in her Audi. Driving up a windy mountain road, she told him to drive as close to the edge as he could. Thinking he was hot stuff, he went about 30 cm from the edge. He was proud of himself, but the Queen wasn’t satisfied. A second bloke came in for the job, she asked him to do the same thing. This guy got even closer - 10 cm - to the edge. But the Queen kept looking. A third driver was interviewed, and she once again told him to drive close to the cliff. ‘With respect, Ma’am, no way,’ he said. ‘To keep you safe, I’m staying as far away from it as I can!’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;He got the job.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Ta&lt;em&gt;daaaaa&lt;/em&gt;. We should think like that third driver: don’t even go there. Stay away. Don’t play at the edge of sin. Keep messing up? Get out of there! Do you struggle with porn? Don’t go on the internet alone - don’t make it easy to look at what you shouldn’t. Do you struggle with drinking? Don’t touch the stuff - stay away. Because when you play on the edge of sin, you &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; fall off. Guar-an-teed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Come clean.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;What is that one thing that just keeps coming back up over and over? What would it take to get rid of it? Ask a friend to keep you accountable, and take the steps to get there. Today. Like, right now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['A hard worker has plenty of food...' Proverbs 28:19 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Ever think something like, ‘Why do I have to work for this? Wouldn’t it be nice if things - like money, food, clothes and stuff - just showed up? So what’s the point, why bother? I’d rather go back to the couch and eat another sanger.’ Ok, there’s a point to hard work. Really.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;(1) &lt;em&gt;God made us to work hard&lt;/em&gt; - He says it’s a blessing. God created paradise, then He created us. THEN, He put us to work. Don’t believe it? Genesis 2:15 says that God put man in the Garden to work it. That was before the Fall - God made man to work even before man had sinned! Whatever you’re doing - whether it be school, uni, work - you are doing it for Him. So ace it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;(2) &lt;em&gt;Make God your source&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Sometimes, we’re just tired. We’re ready to be done with working, studying, just - life. We all know that feeling. But the good news is there’s hope. You have a God who gives strength, and who keeps you going. Work hard, but make sure you are doing it for God and not men.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Have you taken time today to meet with God? Go somewhere where you can talk to Him alone. Ask Him about why He wants us to work hard. (Take a Bible - He often answers us by showing us a verse in it). Take a few minutes to think about why you work and who you work for.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Esther 5-10, John 21:1-25, Ps 18:1-29, Pr 26:24-27&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57996&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Get wisdom...get understanding.' Proverbs 4:7 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Think you have to be supersmart to get somewhere? Think again. There are many things that get us places, not just smarts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;One of the things that can get us places is &lt;em&gt;Confidence&lt;/em&gt;. When you trust the talents God has given you, you’ve got more confidence you can do all things through Him. And confidence is attractive. People notice! A second thing is &lt;em&gt;Curiosity&lt;/em&gt;. This just in: &lt;em&gt;you don’t know everything&lt;/em&gt;. Yup. We know. But, when you don’t know something - ask questions. If there looks like a problem can’t be fixed, don’t give up. Keep going - find a way. Curiosity is eagerness to know, learn and understand more. The third thing is &lt;em&gt;Decisiveness&lt;/em&gt;. The Bible said God didn’t make you to be a squeaky little mouse. (Well, ok, alright, it doesn’t say &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; that... but that’s what it means.) He did not give you a spirit of fear. He didn’t make you to be afraid. Of people. Of circumstances. Of life. He has given you Power. He has given you Love. And He has given you a Sound Mind. So use them! Fear makes us pull back and run away from tough situations. But with God, we can lean forwards into them with confidence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Speaking of being curious, what interests you? Is there something that excites you, but you haven’t explored it yet? It could be painting, or running or astrophysics? Do yourself a favour, and do something about it. Go for it. Ask questions. Don’t be afraid to try new things. God has gifted you and given you interests because He wants to use them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Luke 1:26-56, Luke 2:1-52, John 2:1-12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57997&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience.' Colossians 3:12 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Success. Ahhh, feels good. But how do we get it? A few little hints for school, uni or work: (1) &lt;em&gt;Empathy&lt;/em&gt;: Take a second to think about others. Want to succeed? Always show consideration for other people’s situation, needs, feelings and perceptions. This not only helps you, it helps them. Imagine how it would look if we all genuinely looked out for each other? Well, it starts with you. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Yes, &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;You - the one reading your little smartphone, looking at &lt;em&gt;word4U2day&lt;/em&gt;’s website or holding this devotional in a magazine. Stop looking to other people, and start with yourself. (2) &lt;em&gt;Flexibility&lt;/em&gt;: Can you touch your toes? Congratulations. But that’s not what we are talking about. If you want to succeed, sometimes you’ll have to roll with the punches, float with the tide, drift with the wood. Weren’t expecting that thing to happen? Flexible people will go farther in life than those who break when they are bent. (3) &lt;em&gt;Humour&lt;/em&gt;: Hey, find yourself worked up too easily? It’s ok to laugh. Ok, there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a time and a place to laugh - there always has to be a balance between seriousness and fun. Look for the humour hidden in life’s serious moments and you’ll find it. People who are dispensers of misery are like a wet blanket - not fun. Oh yeah, and smile. When you learn how to laugh, it makes life, just, better. And here’s an extra tip about how to get far in life: remember people’s names. Someone’s name is one of the biggest things that assigns them honour as a person. Maybe you’re a bit forgetful about names. It takes work, but if you remember someone’s name, it shows you care.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Job 1-4, Luke 1:1-25, Ps 105:23-36, Ecc 7:5-8&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=57998&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

A lot of people felt that God was like some bitter psycho traffic warden: if you didn’t keep His hard and fast rules, He’d slap a penalty ticket on your windscreen. Actually, if you talk to your atheist mates today, not much has changed in the thinking of people who don’t know Him... &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even if&lt;/em&gt; that money ends up blown on women and drugs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Or end up on the worst wing of the worst prison. Or hospitalised. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A Dad who proudly shouts that His-blood-in-you is thicker than the law. A Dad who sees His own flesh and blood through the needle-marked arms of the addict.

<introtext><![CDATA['Work as if you were doing it for the Lord, not for people.' Colossians 3:23 NCV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Gap years are great for many things, including experiencing new cultures, understanding other worldviews, and gaining hands-on practice and wisdom for your future. A common misconception is the view it’s a ‘year out’ to do ‘Christian work’.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;‘Christian work’ is wherever God has placed us for a particular time. Yes, working in an orphanage in Cambodia would be Christian work. But then so also is clocking on for a 2-10pm shift at your local fast food joint. The thing that makes the work Christian is &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;! Cleaning an orphan baby’s nappy, while you curse your project leader in your head over and over again, is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; Christian work. Serving a burger, while lending your colleague a shoulder to cry on, and praying for each of your customers, &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; Christian work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;It’s not the geography or the employer that put the Christianity in the workplace - it’s you! ‘&lt;em&gt;Whatever you do or say, do it as a representative of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks through Him to God the Father&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Colossians 3:17 NLT) Maybe you feel stuck in a meaningless job. Chances are you won’t be in this place forever. But for now, try and find meaning in it. Ask God to help you express your faith in a meaningful way in your workplace. So, whether you feel stuck in school, a dead end job or out of work, start viewing your time as a missionary. Will there be times today when you can demonstrate the love of God?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Job 8-10, Luke 1:39-56, Ps 57, Ecc 7:13-18&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58000&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

Isaiah 43:4 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;In the movie &lt;em&gt;Hook&lt;/em&gt;, Peter Pan has grown up and gotten pudgy. In Never-Never Land nobody recognises him anymore. A slanging match ensues as all the boys shout, ‘This is not Peter Pan!’ Amidst all the noise, a young, blind boy takes Peter by the hand and pulls him down to his level. Placing his tiny hands on Peter’s face, he touches the skin on his face and, for a second, glimpses the boy he once knew. ‘There you are, Peter!’ he says. For a moment, the years of worry are gone. And Peter Pan is found once again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Perhaps you’re not that old or overweight but you’re not the person people once knew. Maybe there was a time when you couldn’t keep quiet about your faith, but now nobody even knows you’re a Christian. Maybe you used to love ‘being there’ for people but now you’re far too busy with your own issues. Maybe you used to have a spring in your step but nowadays you walk tired, bogged down with life’s worries. If this is you, God wants to take your face in His hands and say to you, ‘There you are!’ Draw close and He’ll pull back the stresses from your life. Check in with God and you’ll be able to look in the mirror again saying, ‘There you are!’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Proverbs 29:11 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The #justsayin rule means that as long as you start your sarcastic remark with, ‘Not being funny, but I’m just sayin…’ you can pretty much say what you like. ‘I’m just saying, you look like microwaved poop today.’ Or, the other one: ‘You know me, I tell it like it is!’ which translates as, ‘I can be completely and utterly rude if I’m in a bad mood and get a cheap laugh at your expense!’ And what about this gem: ‘I hear what you’re saying but…’ which basically means, ‘What you just said was stupid and now I’m going to tell you why.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Today’s proverb hints at that. We’ve all got a friend who doesn’t care who they upset. Well, &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; be that friend! The book of Proverbs has good advice on being a friend: ‘&lt;span class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;The sweet smell of perfume and oils is pleasant, and so is good advice from a friend.&lt;/span&gt;’ (Proverbs 27:9 NCV) ‘As iron sharpens iron, so a friend sharpens a friend.’ (Proverbs 27:17 NLT) Do you ever show your friends how much you value them? How? What’s a practical way you can honour your friends today?

All this encouragement about going out on the edge for Jesus, taking risks and ignoring what the ‘world’ (which probably means our friends or class/workmates) thinks of us ‘crazy Christians’ is great. But it’s not that easy, right? Just who has the confidence to live like that?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The writer of Hebrews wanted to prove a point to his readers. All their favourite heroes were people of &lt;em&gt;faith &lt;/em&gt;who, like us, sometimes have trouble&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes;&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;just obeying God. Whatever the people of the first century had thought of these Scriptural SuperStars previously, it was probably a bit of a shock to find that now they were being commended for their &lt;em&gt;faith&lt;/em&gt;. ‘Interesting... maybe this faith thing is worth looking at?’ you might have heard them wonder and ponder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;You may be respected amongst your mates and peers for skills, for intelligence, for your dazzling good looks. However, they may not realise what faith you have (even you, ‘Mustard Seed’!) Whether others have faith or not, they can be inspired, encouraged, or challenged within themselves by watching as you live your life loving The Lord. So. Are you ‘known for your faith’?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Look after...widows...' James 1:27 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;James 1:27 NLT writes this: ‘&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;...genuine religion in the sight of God the Father means caring for orphans and widows in their distress&lt;/span&gt;…&lt;/em&gt;’ Orphans and widows are people who’ve lost someone precious and irreplaceable. So, James is suggesting, if you’re looking for where God’s heart is, it’s with those who are mourning a loss. Jesus also teaches that God’s heart is turned in favour to those grieving: ‘&lt;span class=&quot;woj&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;God blesses those who mourn, for they will be comforted&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;’ (Matthew 5:4 NLT)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

(And breaking up from a serious relationship is a kind of grieving too - today’s reading may be more relevant to you and your mates than you first think...) Nothing you can say will bring the loved one back. Nothing you say will stop the grieving. So maybe words aren’t something you need to offer. Maybe you just simply need to be there. Silently, ‘&lt;em&gt;weeping with those who weep&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Romans 12:15 NLT) Explanations and cold theology aren’t what the broken-hearted need: ‘&lt;em&gt;How can your empty clichés comfort me?&lt;/em&gt;’ (Job 21:34 NLT) But your love, your sympathy, your presence can speak a thousand words your mouth never could.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: John 14:6-11, Acts 4:8-12, Acts 16:22-34, Matt 1:18-21&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58005&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

He spoke, and beauty and perfection sprung up all across the star-sprinkled universe. On the third planet from the sun, the rivers teemed with life, the sky threw out creatures of the air, the ground raised up living beings. And then God clasped His hands and set about His prize jewel. ‘I’m going to make My masterpiece.’ He smiled, as He dreamt up human beings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;And then… because He loved us, He gave us an incomparable gift - free will. We can choose to follow Him or defy Him. Despite the fact we’ve all rebelled, made a pretty ugly mess of the world - God still loves us so much He came to save us from the ultimate consequences of sin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Fact is: if we’ve given our lives to Jesus, we are God’s restored masterpieces. &lt;span class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;‘For we are God’s masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so we can do the good things He planned for us long ago.’ (Ephesians 2:10 NLT) &lt;/span&gt;Stop believing the lies about your image. Stop looking in magazines or ads and comparing yourself to the airbrushed, photoshopped models in them. Instead remember: you were made in the image of the perfect God. How good is that? Do you struggle with how you see yourself? Why is that? Ask God to show you how He sees you. (And do it with your Bible nearby... y’know: in case He answers you through it.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Job 21-23, Luke 2:1-7, Ps 128, Ecc 10:5-9&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58007&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

Matthew 2:2 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;Body1&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt; tab-stops: 36.0pt right 432.0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;And on that first Christmas, the three wise men were pushed from stall to stall through Jerusalem. They tried to make themselves heard amidst the noise and the hustle and the bustle of market traders and shop owners. ‘Where is He who has been born king of the Jews?’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Body1&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt; tab-stops: 36.0pt right 432.0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Children ran through the streets in excitement; parents looked overwhelmed with last minute preparations and festival arrangements. Food was flying off the shelves and out of the market place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Body1&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt; tab-stops: 36.0pt right 432.0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The wise men tried again. ‘Where is He who has been born king of the Jews?’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And the opportunity. They could have been part of the Christmas story but they were too busy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Body1&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt; tab-stops: 36.0pt right 432.0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;‘We have seen His star in the East and have come to worship Him...’ the wise men said. Stall after stall, they asked after a child born in the area recently. Eventually they came to the notice of Herod. In the busyness of the season and the extra business due to the census called by Augustus Caesar, no one had remembered - until too late - the prophecy that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Body1&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt; tab-stops: 36.0pt right 432.0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;God had entered the world as a baby and people missed it, simply because they were too busy. And as the cash registers ring today, nothing has really changed, has it?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Body1&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt; tab-stops: 36.0pt right 432.0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Don’t miss the WOW of Christmas: God in infant disguise.

<introtext><![CDATA['Good news...for all the people.' Luke 2:10 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri Medium Regular'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Calibri Medium Regular';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The life of a shepherd in first century Israel was not to be envied. It was a thankless task - people looked down their noses at ‘agricultural specialists’ like these. They were poorly paid - so perhaps it won’t be a surprise to know they weren’t all men. Lots of women looked after sheep in the cold fields, guarding them overnight from predators. So, when God chose to be born in the stench of a cattle-shed, it’s no wonder the angels bypassed the universities and theological colleges and churches to announce their good news to these lonely figures on a hillside. Men and women who probably felt forgotten suddenly discover that God has offered them a supreme honour: for thousands of years, so many Israelites had wanted to be the first to hear the Messiah had come. No one suspected a bunch of smelly shepherds would be the chosen ones.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri Medium Regular'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Calibri Medium Regular';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;God is down-to-earth in more ways than one. The text tells us God is with us, whoever we are. Today God isn’t in the tinsel and trappings. He is with the homeless man on the streets. He is with the lonely pensioner in her flat. He is with the drunk on the park bench. He is near the addict too. He is in the midst of all of us but, wherever there is a forgotten figure on a spiritual ‘hillside’, God’s heart is particularly there. And this Christmas we could be His messenger of good news. The pair of socks we buy for the homeless guy tells him God is with us. The visit to the lone pensioner tells her God is with us. Joy to the world. Emmanuel. God is with us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood Christmas Day: Isaiah 7:14, Isaiah 9:6-7, Matt 1:18-25, Micah 5:2-5a&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58010&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

John 1:14 NCV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;Body1&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt; tab-stops: 36.0pt right 432.0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;‘&lt;em&gt;It’s the most wonderful time of the year&lt;/em&gt;’ so the Christmas seasonal song goes. But shouldn’t it go, ‘&lt;em&gt;It’s the most wonderfully weird time of the year&lt;/em&gt;’? Just what is going on?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Body1&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt; tab-stops: 36.0pt right 432.0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Heaven opens up and an untouched teenage Jewish girl becomes pregnant with God. Modern science screams at us: &lt;em&gt;impossible&lt;/em&gt;. And then God chooses to grow fingernails and soft elbows in amniotic fluid. Common sense tells us: &lt;em&gt;unlikely&lt;/em&gt;. And angels watched on as &lt;em&gt;God&lt;/em&gt; had His soiled nappy changed. Reverence says: &lt;em&gt;Not on my shift&lt;/em&gt;. And middle-eastern astrologers spend months crossing deserts on the promise of a light in the sky. Conservatism says: &lt;em&gt;all sounds a bit new age-y to me&lt;/em&gt;. A few sheep and their guardians hear about it, but the rest of Bethlehem have no idea. Logic whispers: &lt;em&gt;far-fetched&lt;/em&gt;. And within thirty years He’s stretched upon a cross for the things you and I will do wrong in a few thousand years time. How on earth are we expected to buy a tale like this?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Body1&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt; tab-stops: 36.0pt right 432.0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;And yet look around at any other world religion. Is there any other that tells a story about a loving Father God willing to enter into the mess and do whatever it takes to put it right? Whatever it takes. So long as the ‘whatever’ has nothing to do with violence but is all about love, mercy, grace, justice, truth and peace. Peace on earth. That’s His message. Not so much ‘Merry Christmas’ as peace on earth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Job 29-31, Luke 2:8-20, Ps 117, Ecc 10:15-19&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58012&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

Faith isn’t just for the William Wilberforces and Mother Teresas of this world; it’s for ordinary you too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt; tab-stops: right 333.0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;You use faith every day. You go shopping on the internet - you pay online. Do you get what you ordered right away? Nope, you get a receipt emailed to you. The receipt is your proof you’ve bought it while you wait for the item to arrive in the mail.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt; tab-stops: right 333.0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Faith is the same. You pray your prayer and God gives you a word or assurance in your spirit. You might not have received what you asked for yet, but you know Heaven’s postal system is on the job. Your faith is the receipt or the substance you hold onto while you wait. Faith is also evidence. How do you know the online shop is going to honour your purchase? Because you trust. You’ve seen other customers receive their orders. You have evidence that this isn’t some scam.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Think of them as an image for &lt;em&gt;guilt&lt;/em&gt;. We all make mistakes and do stuff we later regret. Guilt is the yapping dog that blocks our path and barks at our feet. Guilt knows that while it’s whipping around in figure-eights through our feet, we’ll find it hard to walk with God.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

God doesn’t operate that way. He didn’t have Jesus’ arm behind His back in order to be born in a manger. Jesus didn’t give the blind sight and the deaf hearing because He felt guilty if he didn’t. God didn’t guilt-trip His Son into dying for you. So if you’re feeling a ten-tonne weight of guilt around your neck, it hasn’t come from God. The kind of ‘sorry’ God is interested in doesn’t come from self-pity and browbeating. A ‘God-sorry’ is about spotting and stopping behaviour, not just for your own good but for everybody’s. Technically, this ‘God-sorry’ is called &lt;em&gt;repentance&lt;/em&gt;. It means turning away from wrong-doing. It’s the ‘sorry’ that lifts your chin up again to carry on with life. Jesus said, ‘&lt;em&gt;Go, and sin no more&lt;/em&gt;.’ (John 8:11 NLT)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

You’re not impressing anybody, or doing yourself any favours. Say ‘sorry’ and enjoy God’s work in your life. Now take seriously God’s instruction to change that bit of your life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Job 35-37, Matt 2:9-15, Ps 139:1-12, Ecc 11:4-6&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58017&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

Song of Songs 2:7 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt; tab-stops: right 333.0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;You’ve loved, you’ve lost, you’ve considered becoming a nun or a monk (for two seconds) and then &lt;em&gt;bang&lt;/em&gt;! You’re in love again! But are you really? If you’re head-over-heels before you’ve even deleted the ‘you’re dumped’ text, chances are you’ve found the perfect rebound relationship. Know what? Rebounds are often a dangerous way to prolong a hurting situation and create an innocent victim. The person you’ve got your eye on now could be more of an elastoplast than a soul-mate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt; tab-stops: right 333.0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Jumping into your next relationship too quickly is sure to spell trouble. A toddler doesn’t go from crawling to driving overnight, nor should you go from heartbreak to wedded bliss overnight. Sure it’s nice to feel ‘wanted’ again, but at what cost? Repeating the same mistakes as last time? Using another person’s emotions to flatter your own ego? Using intimacy to feel desirable? You shouldn’t rush your own feelings nor try to force God’s hand. Solomon writes, ‘&lt;em&gt;Promise me... not to awaken love until the time is right.&lt;/em&gt;’ Don’t be in such a hurry to take the edge off your pain that you run ahead of God. It takes time for Him to make you into the person He wants you to become. While He’s working on you, He’s preparing the heart of the right partner to show up at the right time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

John 4:14 CEV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; text-align: left;&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;2dropcap&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; color: black;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; color: black;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;e all want to be loved and appreciated for who we are. And when it doesn’t happen on our timetable, it’s tempting to rush into another relationship hoping it’ll make everything better. The last couple to ‘live happily ever after’ may have been Snow White and Prince Charming! The real failure is not in falling down but in staying there when you have fallen. Jesus told His disciples to shake the dust from their failures and move on. It’s good advice. Don’t become caught up in your failures. Don’t become condemned to repeat the past. Learn from your mistakes and move on. Paul said the same thing in Philippians: ‘&lt;em&gt;Forgetting what is behind… I press on&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Philippians 3:13-14 NIV)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; text-align: left;&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; color: black;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;One day Jesus stopped at a well and met a woman who’d been married five times. You might think she would have got the picture by that stage but she was pursuing yet another relationship. Jesus laid it on the line for her: her need was not another man, but a relationship with God. He said, ‘&lt;em&gt;No one who drinks the water I give will ever be thirsty again&lt;/em&gt;.’ (John 4:14 CEV) Jesus saw beyond her sin to her real need, and restored her sense of self-worth. Bottom line: only the water &lt;span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-ansi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; color: black; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Jesus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; gives will quench your soul’s thirst.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Job 38-39, Matt 2:16-23, Ps 139:13-24, Ecc 11:7-10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58021&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Your sins are forgiven.' Matthew 9:2 NAS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;How do you know when something is wrong for you? Because it makes you want to run and hide in the bushes from God. When you’re about to do something you’re not sure is &lt;em&gt;totally&lt;/em&gt; right (but you’re not sure is all that wrong either) there may come an uneasy feeling, or a nudge within you. Understanding that is very important, especially in those morally-grey moments that start to stack up as you grow older. Sometimes it may be God prompting you, other times just your conscience. Maybe sometimes it will be neither.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Whether you’re convinced it’s The Lord or not, the best course of action is always to go to His Word. God will always be chuffed with a Christian who’s first reaction is to see what He has said, especially when they’re unsure. As you grow in understanding, God’s Word will continually direct you in how to respond to all of life’s icky situations (Psalm 119:105). A layer of temptation that comes with sin is to hide yourself, Adam-and-Eve style, in the nearest foliage, or tuck yourself away in a corner far from His gaze. Though you’ll find grace even in that corner, don’t let it get that far. That ‘spidey-sense’ for sin will save you many a shameful moment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Don’t worry, we’re not actually asking you to develop superpowers. God’s moral law isn’t an alien thing to the human race (consciences come in handy for that) and even less so for His children. If you’re anxious about ‘accidentally’ sinning, chances are you’re already on the right page. Simply be like David and say: ‘&lt;span class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Y&lt;em&gt;ou are kind, God! Please have pity on me. You are always merciful! Please wipe away my sins&lt;/em&gt;.’ (Psalm 51:1 CEV)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Job 40-42, Matt 3:1-12, Ps 116, Ecc 12:13-14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58023&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

Hebrews 3:7-8 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Have you ever watched somebody trying to help an injured animal? In its pain, the animal doesn’t realise the person is attempting to rescue them and often strikes out at the hands offering help. Sometimes when we’re in pain, our reactions to God and others around us are not so different. Two things can keep us backed into a corner, hurting, yet reluctant to reach out or receive a helping hand:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;(1) &lt;em&gt;Trust&lt;/em&gt;. Sometimes things hurt so much you stop trusting anybody, including God. You stop reading the Bible, avoid those who want to help and refuse to let anyone pray for you. Yet God’s Word says that when we trust in Him we will be saved. When we call we will be rescued and ‘...not disappointed.’ (Psalm 22:5 NCV)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;(2) &lt;em&gt;Pride&lt;/em&gt;. It’s not so easy to ask for help when you have an image to maintain or you believe others will think less of you if you ask for support. Pride can be dangerous. It can keep us from receiving help for days - or even years - putting our spiritual lives at risk because we ‘will not turn back to the Lord...or look to Him for help in this.’ (Hosea 7:10 NCV) As this New Year starts, make a simple resolution: &lt;em&gt;Don’t harden your heart against God or strike out at others when they offer help.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;And, if trust or pride is holding you back, send a text now to arrange to talk to a friend who can support you in it. Go on. Before you forget.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood New Year's Day: 2 Cor 5:11-2, Eph 4:17-32 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58107&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

We can struggle with feelings of unworthiness when we are dearly loved. We can even receive Jesus as our Saviour, then doubt our salvation. The truth is our feelings are often rooted in our deepest fears: that the sin we committed was just too big for God; that we’re not loveable; that we won’t get to Heaven when we die. We don’t feel secure in our faith because we are living in fear, not in love.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;1 John 4:18 NIV says ‘Perfect love drives out fear.’ If God loved you with an imperfect love you’d have cause to worry, but His love is the complete opposite. His love casts out your fear because it casts out your sin. The moment you place your trust in Christ you are forgiven, made righteous, and assured of eternal life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;When your feelings come in to conflict with the truth about God and the promises of the Bible - &lt;em&gt;doubt your feelings instead of doubting God&lt;/em&gt;. God gave you emotions for a reason, but the bottom line is that the Bible says, ‘Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding.’ (Proverbs 3:5 NIV)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Th 1-5, Mt 3:13-17, Ps 90:1-6, Prov 1:1-4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58056&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Yet you don't have...because you don't ask God for it.' James 4:2 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The Bible is a book of prayers - and answers. Prayer isn’t about trying to persuade a reluctant God to act; it’s about aligning ourselves with Him and taking hold of His willingness to be involved in life’s situations - both big and small. Yet sometimes the thing that gets in the way is us. Here are the two ways in which we can hinder our own prayers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;(1) &lt;em&gt;Failure to pray&lt;/em&gt;. The first problem is, whilst we spend a lot of time talking about prayer, we often fail to get down to the business of praying! Elizabeth George said, ‘Prayer... releases the energies of God,’ and until you learn to pray in faith and wait on God for the answer, you’ll get nowhere. We ‘&lt;em&gt;do not have because we do not ask...&lt;/em&gt;’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;(2) &lt;em&gt;Unconfessed sin&lt;/em&gt;. ‘Your sins have hidden God’s face from you, so that He will not hear.’ (Isaiah 59:2 NIV) Your first prayer should always be wanting to make sure you and God are ok - clearing the air by cleansing your heart. If you’ve got sin you haven’t brought to Him and said ‘sorry’ for, then get on that, pronto. And fact is: you and I are dripping in sins we don’t even realise we’ve committed. Seeking His forgiveness for them is a big part of asking to be realigned with His heart. If you’re not aligned with God, your prayers won’t be either.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;So, don’t delay. Move the hindrances out of the way. Let the first thing you ask for be forgiveness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Th 1-3, Mt 4:1-11, Ps 90:7-17, Prov 1:5-9&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58058&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Treat her as you should so your prayers will not be hindered.' 1 Peter 3:7 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Prayer is not just about asking God to change things - it is about being changed and shaped by God in the process. Sometimes we ask God to change others yet often we are the ones with the greater need to be changed. Prayer is a very powerful weapon, yet it can be hindered by our motives and our actions. Here are two more things that can get in the way of our prayers. (Read yesterday for the &lt;em&gt;Previously in word4U2day&lt;/em&gt; summary.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;(1) &lt;em&gt;Unresolved conflict&lt;/em&gt;. The Bible says, ‘If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone.’ (Romans 12:18 NIV) Honouring God’s instructions in life readies us for prayer, so we should address disagreements and seek to make amends. He knows, by the way, if you’ve been trying honestly and wholeheartedly, and the other person doesn’t budge. He won’t let that block your relationship with Him (but He’ll know if you try to use that as an excuse, yeah?)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;(2) &lt;em&gt;Self-centred living&lt;/em&gt;. When the Israelites complained God was not answering their prayers He told them, ‘Stop oppressing those who work for you and treat them fairly... share your food with the hungry... clothe those who are cold and don’t hide from those who need your help. If you do these things...the Lord will answer.’ (Isaiah 58:6-9 TLB) Failure to care can also affect your prayers. How are you treating others?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Ask God to reveal any ways in which you may not be honouring Him in your motives or your actions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...let us run with endurance the race God has set before us.' Hebrews 12:1 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The 2012 London Olympics brought some incredible running stories to light. Bryshon Nellum was shot in the legs in 2008, yet took home a silver medal as part of the USA men’s 4x400 relay and Manteo Mitchell kept running for 200 metres on a broken leg, rather than let his team, who went on to win a silver medal, down. They each had a dream, a vision of what they wanted to achieve and took action despite their circumstances to realise it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Joel A. Barker said, ‘Vision with action can change the world.’ As Christians, we have all been called to ‘run the race’. We have been given a vision (John 3:16), pointers for action (Matthew 28:18-20), an example to follow (1 Corinthians 11:1) and a prize - eternity with God (1 John 5:13).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;There’s no doubt that in this race there will be setbacks and obstacles. But keep your vision before you at all times ‘that he may run who reads it.’ (Habakkuk 2:2 NKJ) Your Christian vision is the road map for your life. Write it down and read it regularly from the Bible so that you can join with Paul, saying: ‘I run straight toward the goal to win the prize that God’s heavenly call offers in Christ Jesus.’ (Philippians 3:14 GWT)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Ex 20:1-3, Deut 6:1-9, Mk 12:28-34, Rev 2:1-7&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58066&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

Philippians 4:13 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;When you watch or take part in a long-distance race, you might notice that the sprint tends to take the glory. It is often seen as the most exciting part, where the runner’s adrenaline kicks in and the wind rushes past them in the final push towards the finish line. But the truth is that the real work of the race was done out in the slow jog covering the kilometres beforehand. It was during the slow plod that the runner’s stamina, training and commitment were tested.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;‘Running the race’ set before you (Hebrews 12:1-2 NIV) will not always be easy, but that doesn’t mean you can’t do it. An illness, an issue in the family or an unexpected exam result can cause us to question our strength for the journey ahead, or even the worth of continuing. But the Bible says, ‘We can rejoice...when we run into problems and trials, for...they help us develop endurance. And endurance develops strength of character, and character strengthens our confident hope of salvation.’ (Romans 5:3-4 NLT) What a race was set before Jesus - His starting blocks a stable, and His finishing line a cross. Yet it was because ‘of the joy awaiting Him’ (Hebrews 12:2 NLT) that He endured the pain and punishment that bought us peace - and now we no longer face our race alone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Lev 5-7, Mt 5:1-12, Ps 10:12-18, Prov 1:17-19&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58109&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I am innocent... It is your responsibility!' Matthew 27:24 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Have you ever noticed people are quicker to shift the blame than take the blame? There’s something in our nature that kicks out at the thought of taking responsibility, isn’t there? Shifting the ‘R’ word may help with your guilt, but it’s toxic rather than medicinal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Check out Pilate. In sentencing Jesus to die, he washed his hands in front of the crowd and said, ‘I am innocent of this man’s blood… It is your responsibility!’ Someone should have said, ‘Err, Mr Pilate? Hello?! You’re the boss, Pontius old buddy! Top dog, even! You can’t just blame the Jews!’ He was there to choose whether to crucify a criminal or an innocent man but he cast off any responsibility because he feared the consequences of the decision. Saving Jesus? Crucifying Him? Either way, he wanted out of the responsibility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;You can fool yourself but you can’t fool God. The Bible says God holds you responsible for your decisions and actions: ‘He will judge everyone according to what they have done.’ (Romans 2:6 NIV) How do you deal with conflict and bad circumstances? Do you wash your hands of the part you’ve played and just focus on other people’s dirt? Or do you think: ‘How would God want me to respond to this situation and to the people involved?’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Galatians 6:7 NLT tells us: ‘You cannot mock the justice of God. You will always harvest what you plant.’ What conclusions do you draw? What does it make you think about wrong actions done to you by other people? And by you towards others?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Lev 8-10, Mt 5:13-26, Ps 42:1-5, Prov 1:20-23&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58146&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

Genesis 3:12 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Just look at Adam go! After ignoring God by eating from the tree he was told not to, he turned it around on God! ‘The woman &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; put here with me - she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it.’ (Genesis 3:16 NIV) In other words, ‘It’s your fault, God, you gave me this woman in the first place! I was fine naming animals! Aardvarks, axolotl, tamarin, blobfish aren’t a problem... woman, ahh, different matter.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Eve didn’t take responsibility either. She shifted the blame entirely onto the snake. She left out the fact she’d chomped on a piece of fruit for a promised chunk of God’s own knowledge. Sin had changed everything, especially how they related to God. They blamed everything but their own choices. They couldn’t take responsibility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Don’t play the blame game in your life. Why? (1) &lt;em&gt;It makes you a victim&lt;/em&gt;. When you make someone else responsible for your circumstances it transfers to them the power to change it. (2) &lt;em&gt;You’ll make yourself miserable!&lt;/em&gt; Using ‘But they hurt me!’ as your life anthem will only hurt you time and time again. Hanging on to the pain just leaves you stuck in it. Make a choice to forgive, take your life back and choose to be led by God instead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Lev 11:1-13:37, Mt 5:27-37, Ps 42:6-11, Prov 1:24-28&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58147&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...if you refuse to forgive others, your Father will not forgive your sins.' Matthew 6:15 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Blaming can become addictive. Once you get the cheap victory of feeling like the ‘innocent bystander’ (or worse, ‘the victim’), and palming off all that bad decision-making onto the fall-guy you’ve chosen, you can get a taste for this sort of twisted glory.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Ever found yourself secretly preferring a good moan rather than looking to solve the problem? It’s a first class ticket to losing friends, credibility, and your life-coping skills. It’s also pretty pathetic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;But there’s worse - blaming can completely get in the way of forgiveness. While you’re judging and resenting that person, there’s no room in your thinking for giving them grace. You might say, ‘That’s just the way I feel’ or ‘not my problem’ but you should know that way of thinking comes at a massive price. It &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;your problem: ‘...if you do not forgive men their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.’ (Matthew 6:15 NIV) Forgiving others is a condition God gives you on His forgiving you. That’s huge. No forgiving others = no forgiveness from God for &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; sins. Sort of puts the blame-game and its moaning into perspective, right?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Practical action time. Who haven’t you forgiven? Think of actual events, people around you every day. If you’re not over something that’s been done to you, it’s time to decide to forgive, with God’s help (and boy do we need that help!) If you’re really struggling with this, that’s ok, but do something about it: speak to a church leader, or a Christian counsellor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Lev 13:38-14:57, Mt 5:38-48, Ps 3, Prov 1:29-31&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58148&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

They were surrounded by people seduced by crazy cults and trusting in the occult. Isaiah wanted them instead to be bold examples of God’s goodness in a global melting pot of serious spiritual darkness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;When you know you’ve got God’s approval, the fiercest dogs that the world set after you stop being intimidating. There’s no threat in the world that can get behind the shelter provided for you by your heavenly Father. He’s placed a thumping-great-big-sized wall of protection between you and anything that would try to take you out of His arms. Ever wondered why the great prophets and warriors of the Old Testament could walk into a terror-filled situation with uncanny confidence? It’s because so many of them had been pulled into the throne room of God and all but met Him face-to-face. When you’ve trembled before that Almighty King whose presence awes the angels, nothing on earth has quite the same fear factor. That’s not to say we’re supposed to be hiding in terror from God - quite the opposite. The immensity of His love for us should inspire reverence! Yet when you know He’s on your side, ‘fear of man’ doesn’t have quite the same ring any more... So now, get yourself into the Throne Room of God! Old Testament prophets had to be dragged, resisting all the way, into the Throne Room of God, but you come pre-installed, hidden in Christ who sits there with the Father. As a Christ-follower, you’re already an installation in Heaven!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Lev 15-17, Mt 6:1-8, Ps 46, Prov 1:32-33&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58149&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Your sincere faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice...' 2 Timothy 1:5 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Paul was a big fan of Timothy. He was his co-worker on the mission field, preaching and living out the Gospel. Paul wrote to him after he was put in prison for the second time and he knew he was about to die. His letter was all about persevering in God in spite of suffering. Penning letters from prison, essentially on ‘death row’ for preaching Jesus Christ... &lt;em&gt;There&lt;/em&gt; was a man who had ‘a faith to live for / a faith to die for.’ Paul was hardcore for the Gospel and he felt really connected to Timothy because he had hardcore faith. Timothy shared a lot of the hard times with Paul when others had abandoned him. Paul said, ‘I was reminded of your sincere faith.’ Faith really shines out of you when you stick with God when times get tough.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Would he be with the same people every day watching the same outsiders get lonelier and lonelier? No, Jesus would love the people you see being rejected. Take the time to get to know the people around you. However they look or whatever comes out of their mouths. Try sincerely asking God how you can best love that person and what He sees in them. God could really surprise you. He could give you words that could really speak into their lives and, before you know it, you could be introducing them to Jesus! When you said ‘yes’ to God, you were saying ‘no’ to the old you too. Put on love with Christ, rather than what’s hot with the in-group! ‘Let the Spirit renew your thoughts and attitudes. Put on your new nature, created to be like God - truly righteous and holy.’ (Ephesians 4:23-24 NLT)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Ex 20:4-6, Deut 7:17-8:2, Is 40:18-31, Col 3:5-10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58151&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

Acts 27:25 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Two years ago today, an Italian captain tragically put on a new spin on the phrase ‘showboating’. For whatever reason, he altered course so the &lt;em&gt;Costa Concordia&lt;/em&gt; cruise ship could sail closer to a nearby island. The giant ship hit rocks, took on water and tipped onto its side. The he jumped ship, escaping to safety in a lifeboat. In the meantime, hundreds of the 4200 passengers were left fearing for their lives. In all, 32 people died.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Who you have captaining your ship matters. The &lt;em&gt;Concordia&lt;/em&gt;’s problems began when it went off course. The captain wanted to honour the passing scenery more than a safe arrival. The scale of the &lt;em&gt;Concordia&lt;/em&gt; disaster makes it easy to lay blame at the captain’s door. But are we any different? The Bible says, ‘We all, like sheep, have gone astray.’ (Isaiah 53:6 NIV) Have you gone off course from what you know is right? If so, ask why that is.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But the difference was that Paul was able to restore hope and bring peace: ‘I believe God! It will be just as He said!’ (Acts 27:25 TLB) Paul listened to God and his wisdom saved the lives of 276 people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It’s the only thing.’ &lt;/em&gt;Or:&lt;em&gt; ‘Nice guys finish last.’ &lt;/em&gt;Seeking to ‘win’ while lacking an attitude that’s locked into God will lead to sin. Cain’s a pretty good (or, is it bad?) example of this - his competitive streak ended with him murdering his brother, Abel. (Genesis 4:1-8)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;There’s nothing wrong with doing your best. The Bible says, ‘Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for men.’ (Colossians 3:23 NIV) Be like the disciplined runner: ‘Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the prize? Run in such a way as to get the prize. Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training. They do it to get a crown that will not last; but we do it to get a crown that will last forever.’ (1 Corinthians 9:24-25 NIV) Running the race well for God isn’t about you staying ahead of other people, it’s about letting God set the pace for you. That way He can reign and His Kingdom can advance. Check your motivations with God. Have you been looking to do your best or simply beat the rest?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Lev 23:26-25:55, Mt 6:25-34, Ps 74:1-11, Prov 2:6&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58153&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['If you know these things...do them.' John 13:17 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your decisions and actions are based on what you believe. If you look at some of the people in the Gospels, their actions reveal big faith: they sacrificed everything to get a bit of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Luke 17:12-14 NIV it says, 'As He was going into a village, ten men who had leprosy met Him. They stood at a distance and called out in a loud voice, &quot;Jesus, Master, have pity on us!&quot; When He saw them, He said, &quot;Go, show yourselves to the priests.&quot;' According to Jewish law, you couldn't go the temple if you had leprosy. You were unclean, and the punishment was being stoned to death. Yet 'as they went, they were cleansed' (Luke 17:14 NIV) - when Jesus said 'go' they risked their lives. Because they believed, they were healed. A haemorrhaging woman, repulsive to society, made her way through the crowds just to make a grab at Jesus' cloak. She knew in her heart that was enough. Because she believed, she was healed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can yell 'Hallelujah!' and 'Amen!' and testify when you hear those stories in church. But do you show off God's glory &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; of church by the way you live and treat people? Put your faith into action. 'You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit - fruit that will last.' (John 15:16 NIV) These guys stepped out and Jesus gave them more than they'd dared hope for. What practical thing can you do, outside of a church building, to step out with Jesus?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Phil 1-4, Mt 7:13-23, Ps 79, Prov 2:9-10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58163&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['We will stand in Your presence...cry out to You...and You will hear us and save us.' 2 Chronicles 20:9 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A young man asked his wise friend, 'Do you ever feel down?' 'Sure,' he responded. 'What do you do about it?' the young man enquired. 'I get up again. Being down isn't my problem - staying down is. I'm either up, or I'm getting up. I've learned not to park in between.' We all feel down from time to time, and scientists tell us there are two main causes: &lt;em&gt;fear&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;fatigue&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, let's talk about . When Edomite armies marched against Israel's king, fear gripped him and his nation. Feeling powerless, they feared losing their God-given land and possessions. But the king turned to God and prayed: 'Whenever we are faced with any calamity...we can...stand in your presence... We can cry out to you... and you will hear us and rescue us.' (2 Chronicles 20:9 NLT) Don't let fear cause you to abandon your hope and your vision. Instead, stand in God's presence, cry out to Him, and watch Him rescue you. Throughout the Old Testament, God reminded Israel of His track record of goodness. He wanted them to remember it and take courage. So, remember Who's in control of your circumstances today. Stand in His presence, cry out to Him, and watch Him rescue you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Dan 1-2, Mt 7:24-29, Ps 81, Prov 2:11-15&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58164&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Let us not grow weary while doing good...' Galatians 6:9 NKJV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now let's look at the other main cause of feeling down: fatigue. Plain and simple tiredness. Every time a new invention comes along - email, microwaves, mobile phones - people have predicted it would mean we'd all have to work less and could relax more. You know how this ends, right? We scurry around even faster than before trying to fit more stuff in to our already jammed weeks. Fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We forget that God designed us to need one work-free day a week for rest and spiritual renewal (Exodus 20:8-11). As a result, fatigue saps our creative energy, distorts our outlook, diminishes our joy, erodes our confidence, weakens our grace and patience reserves, makes us far more likely to lash out, and generally drains us spiritually. Elijah is a great example of this. Single-handedly he defeated the prophets of Baal (1 Kings 18). In answer to his prayer God sent fire from Heaven that consumed an altar and turned Israel back to God. It was a spectacular victory, yet on the heels of it he got so down he actually asked God to take his life. Now that's reaching an all-time low! So what did God do? Like any good doctor, He diagnosed the man's problem and prescribed three things: proper diet, help in the form of Elisha, and... rest!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have a Sabbath? One day a week for nothing other than rest and refreshment?

<introtext><![CDATA['Why should we sit here waiting to die?' 2 Kings 7:3 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christians can get a bit of a reputation for being boring, or playing it too safe. It's no bad thing to apply wisdom to our everyday decisions (even when our mates don't necessarily understand it), but there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a place in the Christian life for taking certain risks...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four lepers sat outside a city under siege. They weren't allowed into the city (they were lepers, after all), and they weren't likely to survive a stroll to the enemy camp. The surrounded city was starving, and these four guys worked out their odds of survival were slim and getting slimmer. Their choice: sit and die slowly, or stand up and go knock on the enemy's tent doors, and see if they've got a spare sanger or two. Off they went, only to discover the enemy camp was deserted. Read the story in 2 Kings 7. (It's a good twist, worth your time.) So what's the moral of the story? If things are looking grim, God can bring you a wilder delivery than you might ever dare hope for. However, you need to choose to walk in bold faith to see the fruit of it. Run it past God first (that means praying about it and checking the Bible) but sometimes, take a risk with Him and see how it pans out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pray for courage and boldness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Ex 20:7, Is 29:22-24, Mt 6:9, Phil 2:5-11&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58166&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Death and life are in the power of the tongue...' Proverbs 18:21 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;'&lt;em&gt;Word&lt;/em&gt;.' It's quite a useful...um...word. Microsoft have made a bit of a name for themselves with it, and even we at UCB have made use of it (check the title banner, hmm?) But not every 'word' is worth paying attention to. Whether it's culture or experiences, the media or politicians, we can find it difficult to accept and trust every 'word' as equal or as truth. Maybe you've been hurt by someone's word not matching their behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God uses '&lt;em&gt;The Word&lt;/em&gt;' as a carefully chosen title for Jesus: He is God's message to us, He comes forth from the Father like a word from a mouth, and because He's from Father God, He's completely trustworthy. In fact, He is Absolute Truth Himself. (John 1:1 makes a brilliant reference to Gen 1:1 to tell us about Jesus... go compare!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our culture pushes a curious lie: that absolute truth doesn't exist. You'll hear sentences like: 'You can believe that, I'll believe this - we can both be right.' If 'this' and 'that' are different, the logic is just plain...wrong. For thousands of years though, God's Word (we call it 'the Bible') has given a trustworthy, logical rock to stand on. More than that, 'Blessed is the man...[whose] ...delight is in the law of the Lord, and on His law he meditates day and night... In all that he does, he prospers.' (Psalm 1:1-3 NRS)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep. Honour the Word with the truth of your words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Dan 5-7, Mt 8:10-17, Ps 89:1-14 Prov 2:20&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58169&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Discipline your children...' Proverbs 29:17 NRS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're feeling a bit got at, it could be that God's taking you through a period of correction. But that's ok. Parents, teachers, pastors, difficult mates and even-more-difficult colleagues can all be used as part of God's cosmic plan to discipline you. You might roll your eyeballs when some of them turn round to you saying, 'It's for your own good,' but the reality is that it is. You may not want to hear this, but it's actually pretty impressive that God arranges those difficult times or people into your life for you to learn lessons that actually make you holier...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God knows though, yeah? Hebrews 12:11 NLT admits that, '&lt;em&gt;no discipline is enjoyable when it's happening - it's painful!&lt;/em&gt;' The light at the end of the tunnel is the end product: you'll be closer to God, with a more mature relationship, and better equipped to deal with the dodgy stuff of the world. (A stronger &lt;em&gt;Up&lt;/em&gt; and a better &lt;em&gt;Out&lt;/em&gt;.) A warning: being disciplined does NOT mean being punished. God hasn't gone off you. If you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; feeling that way, check that you're not being convicted of sin and get real with Him. However, once you've done that, stand tall securely in His forgiveness and love for you. When you know God isn't standing against you through your trials, you can know that He's standing &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; you. And, if that's the case (to paraphrase Romans 8:31), &lt;em&gt;bring it on&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Dan 8-10, Mt 8:18-27, Ps 89:15-37, Prov 2:21-22&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58711&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

Proverbs 15:32 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;God’s only interested in accurate reflections. And it’s what’s inside that matters to Him. So today, be brave enough to let God’s mirror reflect what’s inside you. Even if you look fine to everyone else, that doesn’t mean everything is in full working order underneath.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;First, how are your faith’s core muscles? That’s things like small group attendance, personal time with God and serving others. Are you healthy on the inside? Sounds blatantly obvious - but marathon runners don’t have muffin tops. So the first step to staying faith-trim is to ‘not give up meeting together.’ (Hebrews 10:25 NIV) God’s not interested in church attendance for a pat on the back (in fact He’s totally against fake religion); the aim is to put fresh courage in to you. And everyone needs encouragement! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;normal&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: .0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Secondly, flex those muscles. How are you doing about sharing your faith with your friends who don’t know Jesus? We all know the difference between planning to do things and actually doing them. Sometimes our plans to put things right with God get put off and off. If you know you’ve let things slip, choose today to be deliberate about sitting down with God and asking Him to show you the state of your heart.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Dan 11-12, Mt 8:28-34, Ps 89:38-52, Prov 3:1-2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58712&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The Lord...has given rest to His people...' 1 Kings 8:56 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you think of a moment in your life when you knew everything was going to turn out all right? Like a big blanket of calm falling over your mind, emotions and soul. It comes often at the start of something: at the start of a relationship, at the start of the Christmas holidays, at the start of a good book... You feel like you can settle down and give yourself up to whatever life's got for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That '&lt;em&gt;whoosh&lt;/em&gt;' of peace that comes with these moments is from God (when we come across any good feeling in its natural, designed-for habitat, it usually is!) And, actually, His plan is for us to get a regular dose of it. Weekly. When we 'Sabbath' (that is, take a Sunday or other day off for God), we stop, take account of how our week's gone, and make more-than-usual space to look at life and live in the day conscious of God's presence. On a Sabbath, you can hear and feel your Saviour's invitation afresh: 'Come to Me, all you who are weary and carry heavy burdens, and I will give you rest.' (Matthew 11:28 NLT) Then you settle down for the week ahead, and &lt;em&gt;feel ready &lt;/em&gt;to give yourself over to whatever He has for you...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever day you're free to work with (Sunday's good, mainly because it comes at the start of the week), sleep a good amount the night before and get up early. Have a quiet, leisurely breakfast with God, and enjoy His presence. Just see how much better a start to the week it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Jas 1-2, Mt 9:1-13, Ps 91, Prov 3:3-4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58713&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['This, then, is how you should pray...' Matthew 6:9 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever felt uneasy while praying? Praying can tap into all sorts of insecurities making you feel like you're on a first date with the Lord Almighty. Am I praying properly? Too long? Too short? Will He like what I say? Is it the right stuff but in the wrong order...?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Matthew 6:5-8, Jesus straightened out prayer for some prayer-a-phobic disciples. Top priority was God's name, because God is holy. What 'holiness' means is a fairly big topic, but to summarise it here, you could read: 'Something that we recognise as separate to us, not 'of us' or anything we could do or make. Something that is either the perfection of God Himself, or carries the image or the feel of Him.' God wants you to realise who you're talking to, and He wants &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; to become holy (Whoa! Yes - &lt;em&gt;holy&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, it's about God's Kingdom. His plan, His way of doing things, His priorities, His rulership. These are good things. Things worth giving up &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; priority list for. Thirdly, desiring God's will to be done. He practised what He preached, even staring death in the eyes. (Check Luke 22:42.) Only after you recognise these things and bow to them is it right for you to put your requests in. Jesus was strict about not worrying about food and frocks (Matthew 6:28-33); He wants us looking in gratefulness to the most generous Provider (not the things He provides).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Jas 3-5, Mt 9:14-26, Ps 96, Prov 3:5-6&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58714&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...when the time arrives...' Hosea 13:13 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;'When God, &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt;?' If you've ever asked God for anything, you've probably grumbled out the '&lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt;' question. Waiting can be hard. The career, the breakthrough, the bus... they all require waiting. How we act before we see an answer says lots about our levels of trust for God. Frustrated? Bored? Disappointed? These are indicators that you probably aren't fully giving the situation to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's ok to want things to be better. It's ok to question God about when He'll do that thing you want. But God wants us to grow in patience, too. That can mean actively waiting on God, even for good things He wants to give you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patience doesn't come naturally. It's a product of living in Jesus (look at Galatians 5:22). It's no mistake that patience is the first characteristic mentioned in Paul's famous '&lt;em&gt;love is&lt;/em&gt;...' passage in 1 Corinthians 13. God is patient with you; choosing patience in your response to Him (and to others) is not always easy, granted, but is a great discipline to get yourself into. Patience is different from waiting - it's more than just tapping your fingers. It's trusting He has your best in mind and is not playing games with your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust can need you to be strong, though. There will be some things and times you just can't figure out. Ask God for peace about them. And watch you don't get yourself so tied up in knots you forget God's character. Finally, remember, '&lt;em&gt;When your faith is tested your endurance has a chance to grow. So let it grow, for when your endurance is fully developed, you will be perfect and complete, needing nothing&lt;/em&gt;.'

<introtext><![CDATA['But God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us...' 2 Corinthians 7:6 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;God longs to 'comfort you and strengthen you.' (2 Thessalonians 2:17 NLT) And judging by the average Monday morning Facebook newsfeed, a fair number of us long to be comforted and strengthened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it's much harder for Him to do that if you're not being real with Him. He knows that the state of your heart long-term is what's important, not just an easy fix of comfort. And actually, real happiness comes from the long-term work of your heart being properly at peace with God, others and yourself. If you know in your heart everything's not quite right between you and Him, that might mean a bit of repentance too. God longs to comfort you, but you have to want Him to: you have to want more than just a good feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spiritual and the everyday are deeply linked. If you haven't put a grudge to rights with a friend, family member - or enemy - God's not going to keep giving you spiritual highs. Nothing floats free and totally independent of God's reality. Are you feeling downcast and haven't sorted out a problem with a friend? Or haven't told God about that one thing you really should have? Get it sorted. And then, as today's verse says, He'll be there for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood Australia Day: Ex 20:8-11, Is 58:13-14, Lk 4:16, Heb 10:19-25&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58716&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Stop being bitter and angry and mad at others...' Ephesians 4:31 CEV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snakes and spiders terrify a lot of people. Not a big surprise, is it? Not when you consider their habit for biting people with life-threatening poison and all... People can bite too. Not with their teeth (we hope) but definitely with their words. But we're not called to fear people. The Bible says, 'We can say with confidence, &quot;The Lord is my helper, so I will have no fear. What can mere people do to me?&quot;' (Hebrews 13:6 NLT) If you've had words spoken over you that hurt, bring them to your Dad in Heaven. If they go against what God says about you, reject them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God says, 'Stop being bitter and angry and mad at others.' If God says &lt;em&gt;stop&lt;/em&gt;, you can be sure He won't give you that command unless He'll also give you the grace to help you. Words can bite and, just like venom, get into our system. Then bitterness, rather than love for God and for others, can pump through our veins. Focus on who God's called you to be, so you can move forward in the opposite spirit. Take a contrary attitude to bitterness! Pray for the people who hurt you to be blessed instead and watch God flourish your life. Have peace that 'in all things God works for the good of those who love Him.' (Romans 8:28 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God cares about justice. Free yourself and let Him judge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Num 3:1-4:33, Mt 10:1-10, Ps 104:1-23, Prov 3:9-10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58717&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['The disciples were in trouble far away from land.' Matthew 14:24 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonah, James, John, Jeremiah, Jesus... Ok, so your name doesn't have to begin with a 'J' to be caught up in a storm - you might be in one right now. The thing about extreme weather is... it's &lt;em&gt;extreme&lt;/em&gt;! Storms don't email you their schedule. They're brutal, relentless and can leave you a quivering wreck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is a lifeline. When the waves of life smash you in the face, you can cling on to the words of Jeremiah: 'The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases, His mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness. &quot;The Lord is my portion,&quot; says my soul, &quot;therefore I will hope in Him.&quot;' (Lamentations 3:21-24 NRS)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are five key truths that can give you the breath you need: (1) There's no end to God's love for you. (2) His mercies keep coming; you just need to see them! (3) In fact, He's stacked up a load of 'new mercy' for you today! It comes in fresh each morning. (4) He's more committed to you than anyone ever could be. (5) The Lord God Himself is the One who meets your needs. God is sovereign and He's looking at your life from a much greater perspective than any satellite. Allow your current circumstances to build your trust in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take comfort from Jeremiah's words in Lamentations. Write them out and put them near where you sleep so they're close at hand when you feel most vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Num 4:34-6:27, Mt 10:11-20, Ps 104:24-35, Prov 3:11-12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58719&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['There is in store for me the crown...' 2 Timothy 4:8 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's the reason for untapped potential? Maybe part of the answer is attitude. Thinking you've made it before you've even started can be the beginning of the end. Your Christian life's no different. Over the next few days, we're going to look at becoming all that you're meant to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first pitfall is &lt;em&gt;selfishness&lt;/em&gt;. Yes, it's an obvious one - and yes, you'll have heard it before, but there's a reason why the middle letter of sin is 'I'. Stephen Kendrick said, 'Almost every sinful action ever committed can be traced back to a selfish motive. It is a trait we hate in other people but justify in ourselves.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you became a Christian, you were probably aware of your sin and selfishness. So you committed to living for God instead, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What changed? Did something slide? God hasn't changed His goal for you, that you can stand tall in Him and declare 'I do not live anymore - Christ lives in me.' (Galatians 2:20 NCV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He's still calling you onwards...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Num 7, Mt 10:21-31, Ps 107:1-9, Prov 3:13-18&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58105&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['That...day...God will reveal who His children really are.' Romans 8:19 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the gates of Heaven, once God has smiled His grace on all of His children, some will hear an extra, 'Well done, good and faithful servant.' Others will look on, wondering what they could have become, if only they'd listened to that still small voice. Is that still small voice speaking to you today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting your eyes fixed on Jesus is all well and good in theory, but actually doing it is costly. Paul got a fair bruising for his faithfulness to God's call. He was beaten almost to death eight times. He faced danger from both foe and friend. He lived through nakedness, sleeplessness, starvation and thirst (2 Corinthians 11:23-29). Did he get fed up? Yes. Did he then give up? No. 'I am well content with weaknesses, with insults, with distresses, with persecutions, with difficulties, for Christ's sake...' (2 Corinthians 12:10 NAS) Did he pray for a break? Of course. Three times he asked the Lord to take away his suffering. When God replied, 'My grace is all you need. My power works best in weakness' (2 Corinthians 12:9 NLT), Paul learned to 'take pleasure in...insults, hardships, persecutions, and troubles' (2 Corinthians 12:10 NLT), leaning on God for strength. Where did he find such joy? Through 'the infinite value of knowing Christ.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul didn't have it easy, but he'd nailed what it meant to really put Jesus first. Once he'd got that, he accepted the tough stuff that came his way, even took pleasure in it, knowing that God was using it for &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Num 8-10, Mt 10:32-42, Ps 107:10-16, Prov 3:19-20&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58063&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I press on to...receive the heavenly prize.' Philippians 3:14 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Play... Pause. Skip back. Play... Pause. Skip back... Do you find yourself dwelling on past hurts? Do the 'what if's' and 'maybes' never really leave you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're told to 'fight the good fight of faith.' (1 Timothy 6:12 NIV) That means that our faith sometimes needs willpower to get moving. You'll find yourself in a situation where you have to choose to trust that God will get you through and be true to His promises. You are in a battle, whether you realise it or not, and your spirit needs to be strong. So make sure you prepare yourself for the fear, criticism or pull of things around you that will try to shake your focus. (And the enemy has no better ammo than something you feel was a failure - he'll throw that one at you as much as he can. Pssst. God can blot &lt;em&gt;that &lt;/em&gt;mistake out of your past, and give you the shield to defeat &lt;em&gt;that &lt;/em&gt;every time - decide to give it to Jesus. He is faithful.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're going to be all that God made you to be, clear direction is a must. Make Paul's words your warcry: 'I focus on this one thing: Forgetting the past and looking forward to what lies ahead, I press on to reach the end of the race and receive the heavenly prize for which God...is calling.' (Philippians 3:13-14 NLT)Here's your battleplan: print it out and put it someplace you'll see it often:&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['The simple believes every word, but the prudent [wise] considers well his steps.' Proverbs 14:15 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Wise people take careful action, think in great detail about what they do before they do it, and make steady steps forward. They don’t jump blindly into any situation or crash through life, out of control. Does this sound&lt;em&gt; bor..rring&lt;/em&gt;? Like a recipe for a seriously dull life? No. Wise people listen for God’s sure words, instead of following every whim of the world.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Is this for or against God’s ways? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Jesus always talked about motivations and the heart of the matter, not just the action. For wise people, it’s not just about the consequences of their actions. It’s also about whether the whole situation might be stained with sin from start to finish, or blessed with the breath of God. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Sometimes living day–to–day in God’s ways is a mix of practised instinct with a learned knowledge of the way He is and the way He works (look for this in the Bible...)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;And sometimes God talks straight to you. This happened to Joshua when he had to lead Israel across a river to the Promised Land. God had promised that when the feet of the priests carrying the ark stepped into the river it would roll back. Here, God’s ‘sure words’ went directly against the rules of nature. But to reach his destiny Joshua had to step into the water. Faith dared where reason faltered. This wasn’t about jumping blindly—it was about a sure, God–spoken adventure. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Take the time to really study God’s power to move the obstacles in your life, and His character to move them daily in His Word. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Num 14-15, Matt 11:10-19, Ps 107:23-32, Pro 3:25-26&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58323&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The eternal God is your refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms.' Deuteronomy 33:27 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Are you a child of God too frightened to take the plunge into living full–on for Him? Is your faith always on the edge of the pool but never actually in it? Are all the things that were ever said to you, or said about you, holding you back? Is every critical comment you’ve taken into yourself and allowed to become a part of you, or every story the world has told you... like being chained to the starting block?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Your Father in Heaven won’t call you onto the diving board only to let you sink while He has a good laugh at your expense. Far from it; as you leap, however unsteadily, into the unknown, ‘underneath are the everlasting arms’, ready to catch and help you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Deuteronomy 31:6 NIV might help you unlock the chain and even cast your inflatable armbands aside: ‘Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified… for the Lord your God goes with you; He will never leave you nor forsake you.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;There is no one on earth who has better help, or who is better provided for and looked after, than a child of God. When you’re too nervous to look down, then know in your same unsteady self that underneath you are the arms of God. Then, arise. Go. Be strong.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;When it’s time to take a leap of faith, don’t hesitate about plunging into living full–out for God. He’s always there to help you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Exo 20:12, Jer 35:1-19, Pro 1:8, John 19:25-26&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58325&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['But his sons did not walk in his ways...' 1 Samuel 8:3 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Cain and Abel are a good example of how a godly household &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; operate. Ever felt like your older/younger brother/sister (delete as appropriate... the words, that is, not the siblings) was always the favourite? Could never ever do anything wrong? Cain felt like that, and he took it badly. He made an offering to God, but his brother Abel outdid him. Rather than talking it over with God, Cain let his anger rule him, and before you know it, he actually did hit “delete” on his brother’s life. (Full story in Genesis 4:1–13).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Is this another ‘Now play nice, Christians...’ lesson? Not quite. Yes, family life will sometimes go your way, sometimes it won’t. Think: debates over who gets to use the bathroom; who has to wash the dog; petty little things. Sometimes you need to rise above your own reaction when you look at your brother/sister (in the home, or the church) and all you feel is jealousy or hatred.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here’s the meat of this message: it’s in the ‘petty‘ friction of a closely knit group of people that godly character is built. It’s in those untimely opportunities to sacrifice that Christ appears beside us, and beckons us to pick up our own cross alongside Him. Cain could have learnt about the importance of ‘dying’ to his selfish feelings and caught a glimpse of that heavenly, new life of sacrifice—and been a better person for it. But he didn’t. Bad attitudes fester. Is there something you need to make right with your family before any more damage is done? This may not mean big, grand gestures—it could be as simple as choosing something your parents do for you (like making the tea), and doing it for them today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Num 16-18, Matt 11:20-30, Ps 107:33-43, Pro 3:27-28&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58327&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['His Spirit joins with our spirit to affirm that we are God's children.' Romans 8:16 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Adopting kids means paperwork, meetings, social worker visits—all sorts of complications, not to mention the possibility of heartbreak along the way. But the parent never gives up, because the joy of being a parent outweighs the frustrations of the process.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Whenever you live your life separate from God (whether it’s for years or even just for a few moments when you turn your back on Him) it brought Him much pain. But He signed your adoption papers using Christ’s blood. Today’s verse says: ‘His Spirit joins with our spirit to affirm that we are God’s children.’ We’ve come into God’s family—a royal family in which we are joint–heirs with Jesus to God’s Kingdom. God loves us enough to adopt us! Your baby–steps in awkward, clumsy prayers were priceless for Him. The first time you made that decision to try to put God over your own desires was a beautiful moment. With God’s adoption, you really are in the family home. (Yes, there may be bickering with your brothers and sisters, but you’re a family that looks out for one another.) God adopts you because He wants to love and raise you in the family.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Do you have that assurance of ‘God’s Spirit joined with yours’? It’s not a feeling you can just conjure up. Ask God to show you how much He loves you and how much joy you bring Him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Num 19-21, Matt 12:1-14, Ps 111, Pro 3:29-30&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58328&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The poles... are not to be removed.' Exodus 25:15 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;In our efforts to make God seem accessible, some of us have created our own ‘my mate God’ theology: God the personal trainer with extra genie powers. Yes, Jesus has made it possible for us to be friends with God. But our friendship should grow out of profound awe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;2 Samuel 6 is an unsettling story for anyone who thinks of God as ‘my mate down the road’. David was bringing the Ark of the Covenant* back home to Jerusalem. The Ark was the most sacred symbol of God’s actual holy presence, so nobody was supposed to touch it directly. As the Ark was paraded, it began to slide off the cart carrying it. A well–meaning bystander went to stop it from falling—a nice motive. Except this wasn’t just any old church–box, this was God’s presence on earth at the time. It was not to be touched. It wasn’t supposed to be carried on a cart, either. The man who reached out to grab it hadn’t understood all this, and it cost him his life. (&lt;em&gt;Woah!&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The story reminds us that God isn’t ‘my little buddy’. His presence is holy; this is &lt;em&gt;God&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;So where’s His presence now? &lt;em&gt;‘Don’t you realise that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit?’&lt;/em&gt; (1 Corinthians 6:19 NLT) If we are going to carry His presence, we have to do it His way. So enough of the ‘My mate the genie God’ theology. Grasp the seriousness of being a friend of God. If you usually pray with a shopping list, why not ditch it today? Instead ask Him how He wants you to respect His holiness. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; text-align: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;*(What’s the Ark of the Covenant? Read about it in Exodus 25:10–22, Exodus 16:33–34 and Numbers 17:10–11)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Num 22-24, Matt 12:15-21, Ps 108, Pro 3:31-32&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58329&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I am the Lord your God...who directs you...' Isaiah 48:17 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The Field Marshall laid out the battleplan carefully and strategically. Each soldier was talked through their particular role in the combat. Each was directed to a special position. Finally came the masterstroke: leading each battalion, an &lt;em&gt;unarmed priest&lt;/em&gt; would walk into the crossfire. Yep, unarmed. No armour, no weapon. He’d drag a wooden box in front of the entire army and leave it alone on the ground. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;This would ensure the battle would be won.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Doesn’t sound a winning strategy, does it? Imagine trying it in a war–torn country today. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Yet this unlikely course of action was the principal tactic of war again and again in the Bible. Priests would go before the armies and lay the Ark of the Covenant out the front. The message being sent to the opposing army: &lt;em&gt;God, the Warrior King and Creator of all things, has got our back. And if you dare stand against Him, it’s Him you’re taking on, not just us&lt;/em&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The same is true for you today: God is stronger than your most serious trouble. Trust the presence of God which you carry, and which goes before you to protect you. This is about well–placed confidence in the God shown right throughout the Bible. God may not take the whole battle away from you but He promises, when you’re upset, when you’re criticised, or running at 50% capacity, or just ‘getting by‘ with life, He will always have your back. So talk to Him about standing between you and your ‘enemies’.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Num 25-26, Matt 12:22-37, Ps 120, Pro 3:33-35&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58330&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['... So He is first in everything.' Colossians 1:18 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;This week, we’ve seen how the Ark of the Covenant symbolised God’s presence, His strength, and His holy friendship. All of this circles around the key teaching of our faith: &lt;em&gt;always put God first.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Deuteronomy 10:12–13 NLT puts it like this: ‘What does the Lord God require of you? He requires only that you fear the Lord your God, and live in a way that pleases Him, and love Him and serve Him with all your heart and soul. And you must always obey the Lord’s commands’. In short, if you’ve got a war on your hands—put God in front of you. If you’ve got a choice to make—put God in front of you. Facing confusion— put God in front of you! As G.K. Chesterton noted, it was through looking after the Ark that the people of God found out how to look after themselves. It was through the purity rules for His Temple that they learnt cleanliness. It was through keeping God’s Sabbath that they themselves learnt how to rest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The Ark of the Covenant reminds us that a full life is the afterglow of putting God first: ‘...do not depend on your own understanding. Seek His will in all you do, and He will show you which path to take.’ (Proverbs 3:5–6 NLT) Or in Jesus’ words, ‘seek first His [God’s] kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things [that you worry about] will be given to you as well.’ (Matthew 6:33 NIV)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The Ark of the Covenant is a topic that could broaden your understanding of God. Check out Exodus 25, Numbers 10, Joshua 3 and Revelation 11 for a fuller picture.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Num 27-29, Matt 12:38-50, Ps 67, Pro 4:1-2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58331&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Can all your worries add a single moment to your life?' Matthew 6:27 NLT &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;What worries you right now? If you’re a student, mounting debts and shrinking job markets might be getting you down. If you’re post–exams–not–gone–to–plan / post–school / post–job–I–just–left, you might have just as much reason to dread your prospects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;But God has worked in greater recessions than today. Try a forty year recession in a desert—didn’t God provide from the sky? Yes, He did. Try a starvation recession—didn’t God sustain a widow for months using herlast bit of oil and flour? Yes, He did. Didn’t God feed over 5,000 people using just a boy’s lunch? Yes. He did.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;There’s no recession in Heaven. Your prospects may look crushing, the job market slim, but now is the time to recall that famous David quote: ‘The Lord is my shepherd; I have all that I need.’ (Psalm 23:1 NLT). This instance of your life is barely a centimetre in God’s unravelling plan for you. Watch it as it rolls out—see if He doesn’t look after you. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;If you’re at a stage in life where your future keeps you up at night worrying, the last ten verses of Matthew 6 are Jesus’ specific message for you right now. God wants to and can look after your life—seek Him first and see what happens.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Num 30:1-32:24, Matt 13:1-9, Ps 125, Pro 4:3-4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58333&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let the Spirit renew your... attitudes.' Ephesians 4:23 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Cleaning your room or your place: it would be nice, just once, to have everything in its right place, not just stuffed under your bed or in one big pile on your desk. But here’s some good news: tidying up your physical space is not as important as some other things (sorry, reader’s mum). The bad news? Cleaning up your mind is what’s more important and it takes a lot more effort than your room. Paul writes, ‘throw off your… former way of life… let the Spirit renew your thoughts and attitudes.’ (Ephesians 4:22–23 NLT) We need to give our ‘stuff’ to God.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What kind of stuff? Well, as we hope you know by now, certain things clog your relationship with God. Trying to please everybody, feeling insecure, needing everybody to like you, jumping to wrong conclusions, always needing to be ‘right’, recording all the times you messed up, wanting to know how it all turns out, needing to have all the answers... sound familiar? They’re a result of not being honest with God (and not seeing who He is, over your situation). If you need some work, you should probably let Him know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being honest with yourself can be difficult, especially if you’re not so comfortable with opening up. But it’s extremely useful to move on with God and clean up. So take a few minutes to enter a list of things you know that are impure in you onto your phone or a piece of paper. Today ask God to give you an opportunity that will allow Him to clean up your mess and renew your attitudes about these very things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Exo 20:13, Gen 4:8-16, Pro 18:21, Matt 5:21-22 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58336&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant.' Mark 10:43 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;It’s a strange thing: Jesus opened the doors of Heaven wide for His disciples, showed them the free wonders and mysteries of God, the wealth of really knowing Him. They seemed to get it. Until they got a taste for glory, and not in a good way. In Mark 10, the brothers James and John started to like the whole getting–honoured–by–others business, and put in a request for a couple of shiny thrones.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;‘No’, said Jesus, ‘not so among you.’ It might be the way of the world to climb an increasingly golden ladder, but with Jesus’ people, the glitter and the power only comes through the cross. With Him we are to treat other people as more worth than ourselves. Want to do something amazing in Jesus’ eyes? Give the old dear from church help with moving her old fridge. Want to bring miracles and wonders into your circle of influence? Take time to chat with the kid everyone thinks is weird. The greatest leader ever didn’t come to earth to live in a palace or win all the glory; He lived out Galatians 5:13 NLT: ‘Don’t use your freedom to satisfy your sinful nature [looking inward to you and you only]. Instead, use your freedom to serve one another in love.’ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;This isn’t just Jesus ‘teaching us a lesson’ before we get those crowns for being heirs of the King. This is the way the world works best—so God is showing us what works the very best for us. Look out for those who could do with kindness from you today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Num 32:25-33:56, Matt 13:10-23, Ps 134, Pro 4:5-13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58720&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;For those who think attitude and work ethic don’t have anything to do with their faith, Jesus said something that ought to make us all sit up and take notice: ‘To those who use well what they are given, even more will be given, and they will have an abundance. But from those who do nothing, even what little they have will be taken away.’ How does working as if God is on the job with you affect what you do—or don’t do? Procrastination. Lazy days that turn into weeks. And yes, time on Facebook (where the best minds of the generation spend hours clicking &lt;em&gt;refresh&lt;/em&gt;, starved for updates...) These things all make a difference, for good or bad. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Well, your salvation doesn’t hinge on what you do or don’t do. A day spent YouTube–browsing won’t rewrite your eternal destiny, but make a habit of it and you genuinely might be risking God’s best for your life right here on earth. There’s a whole world out there, and He has a heart and a plan for it (which may just involve you). If you slack off in the small things, God isn’t going to trust you with big things. Now, He won’t give you a task that’s bigger than what you’re capable of. But if you work as if God is on the job with you, faithful in using the gifts He’s given you, you’ll go to places only He can take you. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Have you got an accountability partner? Ask a truthful and well–meaning friend to give an honest assessment of you. What do they think needs to change in your life? What do they think you’re good at. Where could you develop?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Num 34-36, Matt 13:24-35, Ps 138, Pro 4:14-17&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58721&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I have done the Lord's work humbly...' Acts 20:19 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The authority of God&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;. It will empower you to do things you didn’t believe you could. Clich&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-bidi-language: AR-YE;&quot; lang=&quot;AR-YE&quot; dir=&quot;RTL&quot;&gt;é&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;? Good. We need to &lt;em&gt;live &lt;/em&gt;by it. Think about it—knowing that your faith in Christ has God’s seal of approval means that you can step out in faith with some confidence. The persecuted church? They know it. In fact, anything (as small as you can imagine) that you do to share God’s love to others is ‘working’ for Him. &lt;em&gt;You &lt;/em&gt;are a necessary, valued, authentic part of His Kingdom.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Sure, we know that those who work for the church in an obvious way (pastors, leaders &amp; interns, missionaries) are ‘working for God’. But actually, most of those people would probably tell you that ‘working for God’ is more about those special moments of interaction with someone. Moments where you can see God at work in the little things that you do with/for them, than about the ‘9 to 5’ bulk of the ‘job’.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;This means that alongside seeing God congratulating the church planters, the teachers and the administrators with ‘Well done good and faithful servant,’ (and He will), He will also say, ‘Well done good and faithful single parent,’ ‘Well done good and faithful house cleaner,’ ‘Well done good and faithful friend to that lonely person’, ‘Well done good and faithful saw–someone–in–need–and–stepped–out–for–them–as–if–they–were–Jesus.’ Yes, basically that. Your greatest work for God may begin in a situation you find yourself in every day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;So today, look out for people who need something. Stop and take a moment to look at them as if they are Jesus in disguise. &lt;em&gt;Now &lt;/em&gt;decide what you will do for them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Jonah 1-4, Matt 13:36-46, Ps 141, Pro 4:18-19&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58722&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['A righteous person may fall... but he gets up again.' Proverbs 24:16 GWT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Paganini is widely considered to be the greatest violinist of all time. A story goes that once, playing a concerto, he snapped a string. The audience was devastated as this meant a waste of their evening. Not to be defeated though, Paganini played on, using the three remaining strings. And such was his determination he ended up violently breaking a second string. The audience accepted that, alas, the night’s showcase was done with. But Paganini played on, and just as the piece of music was reaching a climax—the violin was reduced to one sole string. Not to be crushed, the maestro played the final bars with one string, before taking a bow and uttering the famous words, ‘Paganini... and one string!’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Everybody gets knocked down in life. You’ll have days when your strings are snapping. The question is, will you play on? Not in a grim, gritting your teeth and getting on with it way—if you’re a Christian, you can know that God has forgiven your every trip and fall—so the important thing now is simply that you get back up, brush off, and know that your Heavenly Father looks you straight in the eyes without embarrassment. The key to character is not how often you fail but how you respond to it. Do you re–centre your life around God, or cover your face in pride?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memorise this verse and apply it to your failures (we all have them): ‘My grace is all you need. My power works best in weakness.

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;For three years Simon Peter had been dragged through ups and downs, victories and failures. For what? He’d just denied his Lord Jesus three times. He’d only gone and proved to himself that, deep down, he was what he’d always suspected—a little bit shaky. Had Jesus been wrong when He’d given him the nickname Peter meaning ‘rock’ for finally realising Jesus was the Saviour of the world?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;At that moment, Jesus, his friend, was hanging halfway between Heaven and Earth, calling out with a loud voice, ‘My God, my God, why have You forsaken Me?’ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Where was Peter’s ‘rock of faith’ now? Hiding out, shaking with fear. His faith was wobbly, just as it had been that time he’d stepped out of the boat to walk on water. But this time Jesus wasn’t around, holding out a hand to strengthen his faith. This promise about his faith— ‘On this rock I will build My church...’—well, surely it had been a mistake. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;And yet. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Fast forward to the book of Acts, and we see that promise fulfilled. Peter’s faith is renewed and Christ has indeed become the Rock on which God builds His church. You see, the promise had always been true. Even when Peter was hiding out while Jesus died, God still had His eye on him for glorious things. Know what? God’s promises are true for you. And until you see that proved in your own situation, stick close to Him. He knows what’s best for you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['No...Scripture is...of one's own interpretation.' 2 Peter 1:20 NAS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;How &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to use the Bible: (1) Take a verse at random and ignore the rest of the chapter. For example, take a running jump from a twelve storey block of flats whilst explaining to the paramedics, ‘It’s ok! My vertebrae will be just fine. I can do &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; things through Christ who strengthens me!’ If you’d bother to read the whole of Philippians 4, for example, you would see that Paul is talking about his ability to get on with the job despite trials and tribulations—not claiming to be an early incarnation of Superman.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;(2) Make up your own ‘The–interpretation–I–think–suits–me–best–right–now’ translation: For example, Psalm 37 quite clearly says God will give you the desires of your heart. &lt;em&gt;Well God, if you could transfer a wad of cash into my current account, that’d be great!&lt;/em&gt; Much as you may like this translation, the Psalm is actually about bringing &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; desires in line with &lt;em&gt;His&lt;/em&gt;, not the other way around. (And if you stop to think about it, you probably wouldn’t have it any other way, right?...) How about a passion for justice, a streak of creativity, a holy anger, a forgiving spirit? God’s promises usually end with blessing others, not just yourself. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Are you struggling to understand what God has promised you personally? Be brave, spend time with Him to ask what He wants of you. You might find yourself with opportunities that you wouldn’t have thought of.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Heb 1-4, Matt 14:1-12, Ps 145:14-21, Pro 4:23-24&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58725&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['You have been taught the holy Scriptures from childhood.' 2 Timothy 3:15 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have ever felt like your parents don’t understand what it was like to be you, well, on some levels, you’re probably right. Never before has a generation been as ‘connected’ as we are. How much of our lives, our friendships, our romances and our disagreements go onto the worlds of Facebook and Twitter? This completely changes how we understand ‘relationships’, compared to the way our parents did when they were our age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s only the beginning—the stuff that can find its way onto our screens has changed drastically too. Years ago, if someone wanted to look at explicit pictures, it meant walking to a special shop, or else having an awkward conversation at the newsagent and paying for it. Today, as you know, Google can take you straight there (and all too easily).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are we giving you argument–ammo for your next fall–out with an ‘intrusive’ parent? No. Despite all of the changes to how we see the world, we have more in common with our elders than we sometimes think. Despite their own distractions, they worked out how to do life. So, in a world of temptations and trying times, tapping into some well–earned wisdom is probably worth consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what now? Ever struggled with the ‘duty’ of ‘respecting your elders’? This week, make time to spend quality time with someone older. Get to know how they see God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Exo 20:14, Pro 6:23-35, Matt 5:27-30, 1 Cor 6:9-20 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58727&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<title><![CDATA[It's A Family Affair 2 -- Dad]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[its-a-family-affair-2-dad]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Our Father in Heaven, hallowed be Your name...' Matthew 6:9 ESV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Dad’. What does the word mean to you? If it brings about memories of a reliable, hard–working, generally good ‘all–round’ guy, topped off with a dose of healthy discipline, then great. But, unfortunately, some of us don’t get the whole package. Maybe the word ‘Dad’ isn’t a good one for any number of reasons; past hurts and rejection can be really difficult to deal with. Or, if the word ‘Dad’ isn’t a word that you’ve ever really had to use, then we’ve prayed for you as we wrote this. We think the transforming power of Father God is worth knowing about, whatever your own experience of ‘Dad’ might be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not absolutely clear what kind of experience Jesus had of His earthly Dad. Joseph was a committed guy, to his family and to God, but there isn’t too much to read about him. One thing we do know is that Jesus clearly had no issues seeing God as His Dad—He got up early and stayed out late just to spend as much time with Him as He could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is impossible for us to get a handle on the massive picture of God’s Fatherhood, but we can all discover what TRUE fatherhood looks like. His Word (the Bible) tells us these things about it: He’ll never stop being available for you, supporting you, providing for your every need, sending His angels to protect you, pulling you through any difficulty, and giving His life just to be with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what now? Today, make time with your Heavenly Father.

<introtext><![CDATA['... Bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord.' Ephesians 6:4 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bible’s pretty clear on the way God wants families to work: ‘Honour your father and mother.’ (Exodus 20:12 NLT) We know that in pretty much every area of life, the ideal doesn’t match God’s standards—and parenting is one of those areas. Parenting is hard work; it means living for someone else, serious self–sacrifice, and constantly stepping out of your comfort zone. Today’s verse doesn’t make it any easier—God doesn’t just want children to survive, but to know true life in Him. That’s a big ask of already hard–working parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents can be really valuable in teaching life–lessons, yet our dads and mums can fall far short of perfection; as does everyone, by the way. So today, we’re talking about being big. If they do something wrong and you do something to get back at them, does that make you any better? Grace—‘unmerited favour’—is what God has given to you so you can pass it on. Sometimes the best way to ‘honour’ your parents is to forgive them, to give them grace for their mistakes, even if they may not genuinely deserve it. (But if we’re honest with ourselves, we’ve probably messed up big–time at some point too). Grace is the picture of God’s forgiveness of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some, taking this step of grace means just talking to your parents, clearing the air, and forgiving them. For others, it may mean the start of a longer deeper journey—we’d encourage you to get trusted support as you start it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Heb 9:1-11:16, Matt 14:22-36, Ps 5, Pro 5:1-2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58730&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled...' Matthew 26:56 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;‘Why do you seek the living among the dead?’ The angels asked the disciples at Jesus’ tomb. A lot of people ask the same today: ‘Can’t you just leave Jesus as a “good teacher” story? Isn’t the resurrection better off as a nice metaphor, written by confused first century peasants trying to make sense out of a seemingly meaningless death?’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;But reading the story itself, in Matthew 28, the ‘confused peasants’ don’t seem very confused. They know exactly what they’re saying. If it was all a metaphor, why does Matthew mention officials spreading rumours of Jesus’ stolen body (Matthew 28:13)? Why include the story of His return at all, why not a &lt;em&gt;spiritual&lt;/em&gt; resurrection? They were talking about an actual tomb, an actual body. And an actual Saviour God embodied in Jesus (told by prophets)—why else would Philippians 2 include an early hymn about an &lt;em&gt;earthy, grounded&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt; Jesus being the same as God Himself, if it was all just a fairy tale?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Our leader, Jesus, is &lt;em&gt;alive now&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; King. He defeated our own sin by actually dying and now He’s actually here again. Christianity doesn’t rest on floaty ‘nice’ advice, or even Jesus’ own sayings, but on the real action of God in this life. The absolute best way to investigate for yourself or to answer your mates’ questions about Christianity being true is to have a good look at the Gospels’ stories about Jesus. Pick one (Mark is probably the easiest to start with) and read it front–to–back in one go. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Heb 11:17-13:25, Matt 15:1-9, Ps 28, Pro 5:3-6&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58731&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Help us for the glory of Your name...' Psalm 79:9 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘I was morbidly obese, but thanks to BellyBusters I’m now a delicious size 10!’ … ‘I smoked three packs a day, but now I’ve stubbed it out’ … ‘Drinking almost killed me, but I found the bottle to stop!’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What causes someone to finally break an addiction or habit that’s destroying their life? According to corporations all you need is a little willpower…and, of course, their trademarked product. But is it as easy as all that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of us trying to kick a secret sin or a destructive habit—pornography, eating–disorders or self–harming are biggies in this area—our own best attempts can barely dent the addiction. And the last thing we need when we’re already low is another guilt smackdown. But hey you—yes! &lt;em&gt;you!—&lt;/em&gt;are not the only one who reacts this way. And you’re not a lost cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting help from a wise Christian mentor you can trust is essential—someone who will point you to God and help you to know His power is the only one that can free you from the power of addiction. God’s very real and immense love for you is key to helping you becoming an overcomer.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;If today’s reading has touched a nerve, pluck up the courage to get a bit of help. And do it quickly. God loves you too much to leave you stuck in that place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58733&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become loaves of bread.' Matthew 4:3 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;God will allow you to face temptation. Why? For the simple reason that: the evil you’re being tempted by exists. And in order to take part in this world as a child of God, you need to have encountered it and chosen God over it. It’s a process that makes you more faithful to God, stronger to resist distractions, and more effective at pointing other people to Him in similar situations later down the line. In the spiritual war that you’ve been born–again into, you &lt;em&gt;need &lt;/em&gt;to know your enemy and, with Jesus’ help, to practice choosing God over the enemy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;And… &lt;em&gt;Jesus went through it&lt;/em&gt;. This response is not as clichéd as it may sound. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;‘…Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.’ (Matthew 4:1 NKJ) Jesus had gone to spend serious, dedicated time fasting and focusing on His Father. So when Satan offers Him a ‘helpful,’ ‘easy’ fix that would turn His back on seeking His Father’s plan, you can see that it could have been an attraction. But Jesus doesn’t take the easy way. He takes God’s way, saying, ‘No! The Scriptures say, “People do not live by bread alone, but by every Word that comes from the mouth of God.”‘ (Matthew 4:4 NLT). When you resist temptation, you trade it in for something better. The fact that you face it means you come out with riches of goodness that you can’t get anywhere else. Today, make a conscious effort to recognise when you’re tempted to stray from God. Refuse to give in at those times, and look hard at what God is improving in your life as you stay firm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Kings 3-5, Matt 15:21-28, Ps 33:13-22, Pro 5:15-20&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58756&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Then the devil...had him stand on the highest point of the temple.' Matthew 4:5 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;In the second of Jesus’ temptations, Satan takes Him to the highest place in the region and tells Him to throw Himself down. Satan suggests to Jesus that God will just click His fingers and order ‘His angels to protect You.’ (Matthew 4:6 NLT) Here Satan, a true legalist, quotes Psalm 91, a poem of faith in God. He turns what God wants to be a simple matter of trust into a twisted test.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Surprise! &lt;em&gt;Jesus knows better&lt;/em&gt;. His Father isn’t there to be toyed with. So He answers, ‘The Scriptures also say, “You must not test the Lord your God.’ (Matthew 4:7 NLT) Jesus isn’t denying God &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; or even &lt;em&gt;would &lt;/em&gt;save Him, but He knows God’s bigger picture.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;This story reminds us we need to look at who God is (and what He is promising us) from the top—knowing that God is King with a higher purpose for us, not our personal superhero who is instantly available to get us out of tight corners. First and foremost He is the Lord our God, who exists above His creation. In a beautiful, baffling way, He decides to come down to the level of allowing us to choose whether or not to trust Him with even the smallest areas of our lives. It would be a mistake, which would play right into Satan’s claws, for us to take one promise out of context and forget (or never learn) all the other Scriptures about who God is. The answer to this devilish threat is to know more of your Bible. Flip to Psalm 91 and read the original Scripture that Satan misquoted. What &lt;em&gt;overall&lt;/em&gt; picture of God does the Psalm give us? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Kings 6-7, Matt 15:29-39, Ps 36, Pro 5:21-23&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58757&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I will give it all to You,' he said, 'if You will kneel down and worship me.' Matthew 4:9 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Satan shows Jesus everything that would one day be His: ‘all the kingdoms of the world and their glory’ (Matthew 4:8 NLT). Then he offers Him a way to get them all &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;without &lt;/em&gt;going through everything He would have to face in His life: mockery, misunderstanding and, of course, the agony of the cross. It’s the biggest short–cut of all time. Jesus knew that if He took Satan’s ‘cheat’ option over the Cross, humanity would lose any chance of being reunited with God. Dodging His own pain would have been disaster for you and me. He &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;Lord, and all kingdoms and glory &lt;em&gt;are &lt;/em&gt;His, but the Trinity’s plan was His sacrifice for us. Through that sacrifice, Jesus was glorified not only as our God, but as our Saviour.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;If we live to take things for ourselves only—whether it’s power, sex, another human being, or sometimes even too much of good experiences and things like food—those things will turn to ash in our mouths. Comfort is never comfort, really, when it’s grasped at the expense of something else important. And if you’re going after selfish comfort, and going against God’s good plans, you’ll end up causing pain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Back in the wilderness, Jesus was steps ahead of this. ‘“Get out of here, Satan,” Jesus told him.’ (Matthew 4:10 NLT) Can you say the same when you’re offered attractive, short–cut temptations?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Think about the ways in which you could be tempted to settle for an easy life—instead of a life of faith. Go to God with them today and offer them to Him to dispose of. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Exo 20:15, Josh 7:1-26, Mal 3:8-11, Eph 4:28 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58758&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...have your sandals on and your walking stick in your hand...' Exodus 12:11 NCV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Good or bad, change comes to us in lots of different ways. If we handle change, out of fear or selfishness, we’re likely to change our minds if we sense the situation’s not going our way. This stunts commitments and relationships. But, when God’s properly in charge, change means only one thing. Growth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Is there something you’re shying away from doing? Maybe it’s a mission trip, going to church, striking out with a friendship group, or looking for a different workplace/uni/college/future ‘whatever’. It could be anything. The point is that when God prompts you to change something, there is no time for mucking around. Fear will hold you back from some of your best opportunities to grow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;So, what to do? Well, maybe it’s time to solemnly raise a three–fingered ‘Scout’s Honour’ salute and ‘Be Prepared’. God instructed His people to have their ‘sandals and walking sticks’ at the ready. Just in case you weren’t aware, God’s Spirit &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; move unexpectedly! He might even ask you to take that terrifying step for Him… today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;And what about unwanted change that’s not from God? If everything’s spiralling out of your control, then it’s time to look up and pray. God does not change. His opinion about you, His perfect plans and His promise of eternal life do not change!&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes;&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;So meet up with an older, wiser Christian, and ask how they responded to changes that God brought about for them. You might be able to learn what you need for the situation you’re tackling today!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Kings 8-9, Matt 16:1-12, Ps 40:1-8, Pro 6:1-5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58759&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['They that wait upon the Lord...' Isaiah 40:31 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Patience isn’t the most appealing of topics. We aren’t used to waiting around. Everyday things like social media and texting are set up for you to have immediate control. But if we aren’t careful, we could forget the importance of something vital—&lt;em&gt;waiting.&lt;/em&gt; Waiting… in the supermarket queue, for the bus, for sex within marriage, for God Himself—will always be a challenge if we’re expecting everything to happen ‘when I want it to’.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;You see, often God requires us to make time for Him, just to wait for Him to move in us. His timing is better than ours. Not convinced? Try it. Spending time in prayer and Bible reading might bring about some very important changes: (1) &lt;em&gt;You might toughen up.&lt;/em&gt; Have you ever felt like you’re a bit too weak, soft or shy for what God’s got in store? The Psalmist knew what the real deal was—waiting for God is like being charged up: ‘Wait on the Lord… and He shall strengthen your heart…’ (2) &lt;em&gt;God will pull you through.&lt;/em&gt; If you feel trapped, abandoned, left out, or under pressure, you’re not alone. ‘I…waited for the Lord… He lifted me out of the pit…’ says Psalm 40:1–2. ‘Going through’ a situation and taking it head–on is helpful, but only with God’s direction and power. Otherwise, we’re all prone to making things worse for ourselves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;When you’re queuing, maybe for a bus or your lunch, let other people in first—it’s a simple exercise that reminds you to slow your pace of life (and you’ll probably bless a random stranger too &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Wingdings; mso-bidi-font-family: Wingdings;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;:) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Kings 10-11, Matt 16:13-20, Ps 40:9-17, Pro 6:6-8&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58760&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I...am the Lord, and besides Me there is no Saviour.' Isaiah 43:11 NKJ &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;We are a reflection of God. But we more often than not get that truth twisted. We’re prone to make God fit our image of what He should look like. An extreme example: The ancient Greeks had a truckload of their own gods; just buckets of them. They encouraged worship through prostitution and permitted human sacrifice, direct from the imaginations of whoever invented the perversion. You might think: ‘Glad we don’t live like that!’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;But have you ever kept God ‘in His place’ until you need Him? No? What about that time you never sought His will in that relationship/job/university that didn’t work out? God is so much higher than we are. The problem with making God our ‘last–minute–lifesaving–superhero’ is He has His own plans, which may not coincide with your plans. He is His own Person.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;And besides, out there in the world, a balanced representation of who God truly is can be hard to find. You may have been introduced to the ‘Jesus is my Boyfriend’ God on your Facebook timeline, with some cutesy Bible verse pictures. Isn’t He so nice? Or perhaps you’ve seen the like–this–page–or–go–to–hell Jesus? Isn’t He threatening? We must get to grips with who God &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; is. How can we do that? Well, there’s a whole book that is very specific about His purpose, character and promises and purposes, inspired by Him. You’ve got it… the Bible! How can we get the whole picture? Open that Book. SoulFood is a good place to start.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Kings 12-13, Matt 16:21-28, Ps 53, Pro 6:9-11&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58761&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom...' Proverbs 9:10 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;When Jesus was on earth, His attitudes and behaviour were so different to society’s and individual’s expectations. They called Him a revolutionary, but He paid taxes. They came to see His miracles, but He refused to entertain them. In a male–dominated society, He recruited females. He didn’t do things the way He was expected to. They couldn’t control Him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Is that still the way He works? Yes, those characteristics will still come into play in His relationship with us. In fact, we reckon that if you’re a Christian you’ve probably been given a spiritual ‘poke’ to change your mind/ways/habits. It’s hard to confidently hand things over to God when He prompts you, especially when they’re bad habits that you probably feel comfortable with. But here’s the truth: if God’s going to change you (which is hopefully what you want!), then you can’t be in control of it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Yet, avoiding that constant heart–battle is fairly simple—&lt;em&gt;accept that He is God&lt;/em&gt;. If God is God, and you are a human, why&lt;em&gt; should&lt;/em&gt; you hang on to unhelpful habits? They need to be yielded to God. This is commonly known as ‘fearing’ Him— in other words, accepting that He knows better and is totally in control of any situation, in the best possible way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Kings 14-15, Matt 17:1-9, Ps 58, Pro 6:12-15&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58762&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...&quot;This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Hear Him!&quot;' Matthew 17:5 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;This ‘fear of God’ talk. Pretty serious stuff, isn’t it? Think about it. Jesus is actually the same God who saved the people of Israel but left Pharaoh’s armies at the bottom of the Red Sea. The same God who has all power over the universe. The same God who keeps us breathing. So, should we be &lt;em&gt;scared &lt;/em&gt;of Jesus? Of course not. But to know that He is far and above us is a good starting point. In Proverbs 1:7 we learn that ‘The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge’.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The disciples were shown this. One day, Jesus and Peter, James and John were up a high mountain. Right in front of the disciples’ eyes, Jesus was joined by Moses and Elijah, great Godly heroes from the past. Elijah had disappeared about eight hundred years previously and Moses had died over a thousand years back. Peter, despite being completely stunned, suggested erecting three tabernacles to honour each one. Immediately a bright light appeared and God proclaimed, ‘This is My Son, whom I love; with Him I am well pleased. Listen to Him!’ The disciples fell to the ground and were afraid. They were reminded that although Moses and Elijah were great men of God, no one is equal to Jesus.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes;&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;It’s a good idea to grasp how high–up the scale Jesus is. He is actually God. He is bigger than life itself but, amazingly, He is also interested in our lives.Try this&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;humbleness exercise: look up at the stars tonight… now count them. Just kidding. You can’t. And God flung them all out! Got the idea yet?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Kings 16:1-18:15, Matt 17:10-17, Ps 61, Pro 6:16-19&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58958&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let all that I am praise the Lord...' Psalm 103:2 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;So, as we’ve gathered, God is pretty massive. He threw the stars into space. Breathed life into your lungs. Healed that friend you prayed for. When you start to get to know God and His power, like, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; get your head around it, it’s totally mind–boggling. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The Bible refers to Him as ‘light’. Darkness cannot touch Him. So… does that mean that we’ll be so dazzled by His blinding presence we can’t even get close? We might get so caught up thinking about His power that we miss the point. So, how should we approach God? Not cowering in a corner, in a special ‘holy’ place, or on a prayer mat. But Jesus taught us to pray like this—‘Our Father in Heaven, hallowed be Your name…’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The word ‘hallowed’ basically means ‘holy’, which in context is: ‘be held in the highest honour’ or ‘awesome’. We can pray to Him in our own hearts. What? Yes—you know the verse ‘your body is a temple’ (1 Corinthians 6:19 ESV)? Well, your heart literally is a mobile throne for God. Jesus did all the necessities to remove any blockade, difficulty (or temple curtain) that stops us accessing God. Awesome. And because of that, He most likely really cares about you (like a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; a lot). You can approach the Highest, in confidence, in any given moment. Are there places or times you just don’t usually consider praying to God? Maybe in the supermarket, or in a friend’s house while you’re watching TV, or during a conversation with a teacher/lecturer/boss? His throne (His power) is mobile and you can invite it into any or all places.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Kings 18:16-20:43, Matt 17:18-27, Ps 66:1-12, Pro 6:20-22&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58967&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear?...' Psalm 27:1 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;How long have you been following God for? A week? Month? Ten years? Cool. Now, think about this: how much have you developed? It might be a good idea to take a minute to write down two or three things that God has changed in you. In fact, it is a very good idea. Jot them down now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Done? Now then, we’d like to put a theory forward: the longer you serve God, the bigger &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; understanding of Him–in–your–life definitely should be. For instance, when you first became a Christian, you might have struggled with a swearing habit. But what about two years in? If that habit has been kicked, good on you! Or, are you still struggling with some of the same old stuff, turning a blind–eye to God’s promptings to change? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Remember the God we’ve learned about in the last couple of days? The tremendous, all–powerful God? He cares enough to accept you just the way you are but He also cares enough not to leave you just the way you are. It’s not about being perfect. It’s about allowing God to take charge (His role) and putting effort in (your role) to give up those habits so that you can reach better things. Hard work on your character now will pay off later. No kidding! When you begin to really give everything over to God, you’ll appreciate this ‘life–to–the–full’ business even more. Think about what God has done to bring you through for the better. Tell someone about how God has changed your life. Or go to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;word4U2day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;’s Facebook page (www.facebook.com/word4U2day) and comment on today’s reading online.

<introtext><![CDATA['I have brought You glory on earth...' John 17:4 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;At the end of His life Jesus was able to look back and know He was successful in bringing glory to the Father—He had finished well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Do we spend time thinking about what ‘success’ is going to look like in our lives? To most people, success means certain things—career, relationship, kids, money—all going to plan. The problem is that life rarely goes according to &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; plan, and if you happen to pray, ‘Your will not mine’, it’s certain to go down a path quite different to the one you expect. To Jesus, success meant the path His Father laid out. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Following His path means living for something far greater than the world’s scoring system—more glory for Him and more joy for you. Living in tune with your Designer means you’ll be living as you were designed, in the best way. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Author Scot McKnight writes, ‘God’s will…and what you dream about in your deepest dreams line up so well, you can usually chase your dreams and you will more often than not find God’s will.’ Get your heart lined up with God’s (&lt;em&gt;spend more time&lt;/em&gt; with Him), forget the world’s expectations about your future, and those deep heart–dreams of yours will likely be &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; God!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Up for it? When it’s all over, will you feel like you’ve finished well? To arrive at the end of your life thoroughly used up, totally spent, ready without regret for a life of eternity at Home... how good does that sound?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Kings 21-22, Matt 18:1-9, Ps 66:13-20, Pro 6:23-25 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58969&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<title><![CDATA[Sticking It Out]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[sticking-it-out]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Blessed is the man who perseveres...' James 1:12 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Perseverance. A real toughie. Where do you start? Well, we’ve all been through hard times. It’s not easy to keep on keeping on, doing the right thing, when it would be easier to give up. Generally, the world we live in doesn’t like ‘sticking it out’. Relationships, education, jobs, friendships—these can all last for as long as we can be bothered. It’s pretty obvious the attention–span of society is getting shorter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;We’ve all felt our commitment wavering, probably even in relationship with God (we can all remember that time He didn’t seem to answer our prayers). But if you always base your decisions on what seems &lt;em&gt;right at the time&lt;/em&gt; or on what makes &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; feel good, then commitment isn’t ever going to seem very attractive when things aren’t going your way. The purpose of your relationship with God is to simply put Him first, regardless. (The prospect of dying on a cross was not attractive to Jesus, but He persevered to the very end.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;You see, maybe, just maybe, God knows more than we do. If you’re following Him in order to make a difference to this world (and not just in yourself), then what He does might not always make sense to you. But having the perspective that He’s got it under control AND it’ll always work out for your ultimate good is surely worth carrying on through difficult times. Community is vital to Christian life (see John 17:20–26) but especially in tough times. If you’re not going to church or meeting regularly with other Christians, it’s time to make a change.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Rev 1-4, Matt 18:10-20, Ps 70, Pro 6:26-28&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2014 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=58970&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Positivity isn’t very funny. Not much in the world of entertainment comedy gets laughs from being relentlessly cheerful. Our ‘cool’ humour often borders on sarcastic, with negativity breeding negativity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;But sarcasm is easy—if you want to be cynical, our fallen world is your oyster. Being grounded &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; cheerful isn’t. But it’s definitely worth it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;What’s your attitude to life? Do your conversations and jokes build people up or feed an attitude of moaning and groaning? Are negative people really the sort you want to be around? Think: how much better is it to be around that rare person who makes you feel better about life? They’re so positive and they leave you walking away feeling just the same about life. It’s catchy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 120%; mso-hyphenate: none;&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Jesus said, ‘You are the light of the world.’ (Matthew 5:14 NIV) That means you should be different. Has it occurred to you that the positive person you like to be around could be you? Being refreshingly different is always good—people welcome it. There’s so much more to life than our scornful, wise–cracking culture has told us—but only when it starts and ends in Jesus. So if you find you’re tending to feel more cynical than usual, have a look at your daily habits—who are you mixing with; is the stuff you’re watching on TV and the internet doing you any good?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title><![CDATA[The Ultimate Source of Wisdom]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[the-ultimate-source-of-wisdom]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['The wisdom that is from above is...' James 3:17 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you go through life you discover there are many ways to gain wisdom, such as: (1) Writing down and reflecting on what you've learned through experience. (2) Gleaning from the collective knowledge of others. '&lt;em&gt;By pride comes nothing but strife, but with the well-advised is wisdom&lt;/em&gt;.' (Proverbs 13:10 NKJ) (3) Thinking outside the box. Statements like, 'This is the way we do things around here' warrant scrutiny when they're used to defend ways that no longer work. (4) Not rushing to closure. Growth is always a work-in-progress. Creativity is untidy and unnerving. The ability to stay focused and faith-filled in the midst of change is a hallmark of maturity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the ultimate source of wisdom is God! A young executive told his secretary he'd an important meeting and didn't want to be interrupted. But his boss needed to see him and walked in. When he found the young executive on his knees praying, he withdrew quietly and asked the secretary, 'Is this usual?' 'Yes,' she replied, 'he does it every morning.' 'No wonder I come to him for advice!' said his boss. If you need wisdom, talk to God: '&lt;em&gt;For the Lord gives wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding&lt;/em&gt;.' (Proverbs 2:6 NKJ) '&lt;em&gt;If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally...&lt;/em&gt;' (James 1:5 NKJ) '&lt;em&gt;The wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, willing to yield, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy.&lt;/em&gt;' (James 3:17 NKJ) '&lt;em&gt;I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I will guide you...&lt;/em&gt;' (Psalm 32:8 NKJ)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Chr 19:1-23:20, Luke 13:1-17, Ps 119:49-56, Pr 21:4-6&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56371&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Now get up and stand on your feet...' Acts 26:16 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saul the Christian-killer became Paul the apostle - who saw that u-turn coming? No one, of course! That is what makes his transformation story so powerful (after the Christians got over their suspicions). It was an 'only God...' kind of change. Paul told his own story of what he was like: '&lt;em&gt;I...was convinced that I ought to do all that was possible to oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth... I put many of the Lord's people in prison, and when they were put to death, I cast my vote against them... I even hunted them down in foreign cities.&lt;/em&gt;' (Acts 26:911 NIV) Only God could have taken a man whose life was so far gone, and turn him into the kind of evangelist that tries to persuade a king to meet Jesus: '&lt;em&gt;I pray God that not only you but all who are listening to me today may became what I am.&lt;/em&gt;' (Acts 26:29 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one saw Saul's conversion coming except Jesus. He knew that the ideal man to kindle the flame of the Gospel across Europe was the very same as the one who had been trying to stamp it out. All it took was a radical encounter with Him. Ridiculous - but that's what happens when an individual really meets Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So often we lack Heaven's perspective on our situations. We see problems. God sees the other side of the coin. Bring to God your most challenging problem and ask Him to show you the potential lurking behind it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Chr 23:21-26:19, Luke 13:18-35, Ps 119:57-64, Pr 21:7-9&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56372&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['People look at the outside of a person, but the Lord looks at the heart.' 1 Samuel 16:7 NCV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eyes of Heaven don't see people or situations the way we do. 'What am I doing this for?' is a good question to ask yourself often; especially when you're praying! Sometimes we can seem to be doing something good and right but the reason behind what we're doing is all wrong. You might look good making your dad a cuppa or buying him his favourite chocolate bar. However if you're doing this is because you've just received your mobile phone bill and want him to pay for it, then your reason for being kind is all wrong. In 1 Samuel 16:7 NLT, the Bible says: '&lt;em&gt;People judge by outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart&lt;/em&gt;.' You might be able to fool people that you are doing things because you are such a lovely person, but you can't fool God; He looks right through you and sees the reasons behind your actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always check your reason for praying is a good one, not a selfish one. Why are you praying for this person or situation? Is it just to make your life easier? God wants our reason for doing things to be because we love Him and because we love people. Being selfish, revengeful or manipulative will get you nowhere with God. In fact He says if we ask Him for good stuff but our motives are wrong, then forget it. We just won't get it! So, why are you doing that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Chr 26:20-29:30, Luke 14:1-14, Ps 119:65-72, Pr 21:10-13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56373&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['We...are being transformed...' 2 Corinthians 3:18 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saul's transformation into Paul wasn't all that smooth. He cut himself off from the wealth and privileges of his former life, faced opposition and confusion from his new brothers and sisters in the Lord. But transformation isn't an easy process - just ask the caterpillar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some caterpillars wrap themselves in a cocoon; others zip their skins apart to reveal a pupa underneath. Whether inside the cocoon or the hard shell of the pupa, the caterpillar is trapped. It's unable to leave the chrysalis it's made to keep itself safe. Shortly the caterpillar itself starts to dissolve into a gooey, slimy mess. But in this mess, change occurs. Eventually a butterfly will fight its way out of the chrysalis - in a miracle of transformation. If your life is a mess - if you feel stuck in a gooey, slimy trap - it may be that God is in the process of miraculously transforming your life so that you take flight, like a butterfly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We might not see clearly what's going on in our lives. To us, it just feels like we're stuck in the dark and we can't get out of the trap we've made for ourselves. But God does see clearly what will come in your future - so trust that He's creating miracles out of your mess and thank Him for the hope He gives to all of us We may not be able to get ourselves out of the mess, but He can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Chr 1-4, Luke 14:15-24, Ps 119:73-80, Pr 21:14-16&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56374&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['... If you would believe you would see the glory of God.' John 11:40 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the story of Jesus raising Lazarus from the dead, you'll notice three important principles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1)&lt;em&gt; Mary and Martha had a close relationship with Jesus before the crisis. &lt;/em&gt;When Jesus came to town, He stayed at their home and ate at their table. They already had a solid relationship with Him, and were givers, not takers. You can't refuse to give God a minute of your time, a fraction of your energy or a cent of your money and then when a crisis comes, say, 'God, where are you?'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2)&lt;em&gt; Having a relationship with Jesus doesn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;t mean you won&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;t ever have a crisis. &lt;/em&gt;But it does mean that you can go to Him with confidence when it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3) &lt;em&gt;When you bring Jesus into the crisis, He will change it. &lt;/em&gt;Lazarus was already dead and buried by the time Jesus got there. But Jesus specialises in hope for the hopeless... '&lt;em&gt;Put your hope in the Lord - now and always!&lt;/em&gt;' (Psalm 131:3 NLT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you've convinced yourself that a dream you had is dead and buried? Put your hope in the Lord! Now and always! You have resurrection power at your prayer's disposal. Welcome Jesus into the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Josh 22-24, Luke 20:27-40, Ps 27, Pr 23:16-18&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56403&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Great persecution broke out...and all...were scattered...' Acts 8:1 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes God needs to take drastic measures to get us moving. After the first church in history was filled with the Holy Spirit, things were going great. Empowered, the church was confident and growing. At this point they could have comfortably carried on doing what they'd been doing up until then in Jerusalem '&lt;em&gt;...They continued to meet together in the temple courts... praising God and enjoying the favour of all the people.&lt;/em&gt;' (Acts 2:4647 NIV) It seems that they all-too-easily lost sight of the big mission they'd been given (Acts 1:8).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the plan God had in mind was too important to allow them to stay in their comfort zone. So He gave them a wake-up call: '&lt;em&gt;Great persecution broke out against the church at Jerusalem, and... those who had been scattered preached the Word wherever they went.&lt;/em&gt;' (Acts 8:1-4 NIV) Though it surely felt painful at the time, the spread of the Good News depended on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When God has a mission for you, He will do whatever it takes to get you moving. Before He will let you miss out on His mission for you, He will permit trouble to uproot you. So start moving, so that God can start blessing. Ask the Holy Spirit to point out any areas where God might be moving you out of your comfort zone and into what He wants for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: John 4:4-26, John 7:37-41, Ex 17:1-7, Is 35: 1-7&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56375&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['But we all...are changed...by the Spirit of the Lord.' 2 Corinthians 3:18 KJV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trying to force other people to change is never a good idea. Jesus knows how prone we are to try to change other people, and puts the question to us: '&lt;em&gt;Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?&lt;/em&gt;' (Matthew 7:3 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using our own tactics to get people to change - applying pressure or manipulation - is usually pointless. Give them breathing space. People need the freedom to be loved as they are. That doesn't mean they don't need or want to change. But nobody appreciates being given the message, even subtly, that they must change in order to be loved and accepted. So, it's about giving people room to change. We're more likely to change for those who are willing to accept us with our shortcomings, than for those who demand we live by their rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prayer is the greatest agent for change, not pressure. If we truly love people we'll pray for them and allow God to work on them His way, on His schedule, and for His glory. For change to be lasting, it must come from the inside out. And only the Spirit of God can bring that kind of change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if there's someone in your life who would appreciate a bit less pressure and a bit more grace from you, begin praying for them today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Chr 5-7, Luke 14:25-35, Ps 119:81-88, Pr 21:17-19&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56377&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Who are you...?' John 1:22 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a clear idea what God wants you to do with your life is a priceless gift, for two big reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, it means you can devote yourself to it. If you're not very good at other things, you don't have to worry. Apparently Paul wasn't a particularly great speaker: 'I came to you...timid and trembling...my message and my preaching were very plain.' (1 Corinthians 2:34 NLT) But what Paul lacked as a speaker, he more than made up for as a writer. Something so powerful was released through Paul's writings that lives are still being changed today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And secondly, it frees you from worrying about what other people think. When he was asked, 'Who are you?' John the Baptist replied, 'The voice of one crying in the wilderness: Make straight the way of the Lord.' (John 1:23 NKJ) But after following John for a while, his disciples left him to follow someone else - Jesus! And John could be cool with that, because he knew he had been specially called to be a curtain-raiser for Christ. He wasn't the main act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discovering your calling is one of the most exciting, empowering things you can do in life: &lt;em&gt;don't worry if it's taking a while&lt;/em&gt;. And if you're not sure yet what God has called you to be, then it's time to take some steps towards finding out. So get started by asking God to show you - and go from there! Then, once you've discovered it, give yourself over fully to God's plans for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Chr 8-11, Luke 15:1-10, Ps 119:89-96, Pr 21:20-23&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56378&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He faced all of the same testings we do.' Hebrews 4:15 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yep, it's true - Jesus gets you. Why? Because God not only made human beings, He became one of them in order to draw us back to Himself. He lived on the same terra firma, breathed the same oxygen, basked in the same sunlight, drank the same water. It's mindbending! It should almost sound wrong to us! The Creator knew what it was like being a child, went through the same bodily changes growing up, learned a trade. He had to learn how to interact with people - His parents, His siblings, His peers, His teachers, those in authority...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus understands what you are going through today because He has been where you are. His family even thought He'd lost His mind. The Bible says He 'understands our weaknesses, for He faced all of the same testings we do... So let us come boldly to the throne of our gracious God. There we will receive mercy, and we will find grace to help us when we need it most.' (Hebrews 4:1516 NLT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True love has endured and understands all things. That means, if you're facing family problems, He understands (e.g. Mark 3:21). If you're feeling overwhelmed today, He understands (e.g. Mark 6:31). If you're feeling rejected, He understands (e.g. John 1:11). Jesus gets you, and He'd love for you to talk to Him about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Chr 12-15, Luke 15:11-32, Ps 119:97-104, Pr 21:24-27&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56379&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He faced all of the same testings we do.' Hebrews 4:15 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you get disappointed by people? Jesus understands, because those He loved and counted on let Him down too. Judas, His treasurer, sold Him out and then sealed the deal with a kiss. Even in His darkest hour, Gethsemane, His closest disciples - Peter, James and John - couldn't stay awake and pray with Him for an hour (Matthew 26:40).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever get overwhelmed by all the demands people lay on you? Jesus understands. 'A vast crowd brought to Him people who were lame, blind, crippled, those who couldn't speak, and many others. They laid them before Jesus, and He healed them all.' (Matthew 15:30 NLT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever get tired out from the basic demands of life? Jesus understands. '...Jesus, tired from the long walk, sat wearily beside the well about noontime.' (John 4:6 NLT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you been falsely accused? Jesus understands. They accused Him of being '... a glutton and a drunk...' (Matthew 11:19 GWT) Up until the time of His death they were still trying '...to find something false...so they could kill Him.' (Matthew 26:59 NCV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True love has endured and understands all things. Yes, Jesus was flesh and blood; human like us, in every experience. Jesus - &lt;em&gt;God!&lt;/em&gt; - really truly gets you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Chr 16-18, Luke 16:1-18, Ps 119:105-112, Pr 21:28-31&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56380&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<title><![CDATA[The End of Anxiety]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[the-end-of-anxiety]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Give all your worries...to God, for He cares about you.' 1 Peter 5:7 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evangelist George Müller said, 'The beginning of anxiety is the end of faith, and the beginning of true faith is the end of anxiety.' It can be the worst, most paralysing feeling in the world. Ever get like that? Where you just want to yell and thrash about, but the anxiety (over whatever issue, person, or circumstance) keeps you in place, scared to move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the things that worry you in the past or the present, statistically only about 10% will ever eventuate. Most of your worries will never happen! But if you're stuck in that horrible place of paralysis today, read these words of God: '&lt;em&gt;Fear not, for I have redeemed you; I have summoned you by name; you are Mine&lt;/em&gt;.' (Isaiah 43:1 NIV) Put your own name in it, and remind yourself of what God has already said to His children. See what it's like to put today's fears into the context of a Father who has always had your needs in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is too much for any of us to handle alone. So if you feel like you're being pulled apart in a hundred different directions, read up on the promises of God. Take your fears to Him and see if they don't shrivel and die: '&lt;em&gt;...And God's peace, which is far beyond human understanding, will keep your hearts and minds safe in union with Christ Jesus.&lt;/em&gt;' (Philippians 4:7 GNT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear thrives in the darkness. Shine light on it. Put your fears into words, then remind yourself of God's promises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Chr 19-21, Luke 16:19-31, Ps 119:113-120, Pr 22:1-3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56382&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<title><![CDATA[Kicking Out Doubt]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[kicking-out-doubt]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Lord, &quot;Increase our faith.&quot;' Luke 17:5 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like a smart salesperson offering a really enticing deal, doubt can knock at the door of our minds looking so charming and innocent that we can easily find ourselves welcoming it in. So we need to keep a careful watch on the entry to our hearts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doubt fills a vacuum - &lt;/em&gt;do you have an empty space where there are very few reminders of God's goodness and His gifts in your life? So we need to hang pictures on the walls, reminding us of where we've been and how God has been faithful to us. &lt;em&gt;Doubt often calls when there&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;s no one else at home - &lt;/em&gt;or when you've filled the house with others who enjoy his company. Make sure you spend enough time hanging out with others who know God and are able to help you see what He's up to in your life. &lt;em&gt;Doubt calls at dinnertime - &lt;/em&gt;just when we're most hungry for something to fill us up. The Bible says, '&lt;em&gt;...faith comes from hearing, that is, hearing the Good News about Christ.&lt;/em&gt;' (Romans 10:17 NLT) Regular feasting on God's Word is the best way to ensure that we don't fall vulnerable to doubt. It's good to explore questions about faith and seek answers to build us up. But doubt, that nags and tugs away at a heart given totally over to Jesus, is not to be welcomed. So, move from doubt to faith, by eliminating unscriptural words from your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Chr 22-24, Luke 17:1-10, Ps 119:121-128, Pr 22:4-7&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56383&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<alias><![CDATA[water-under-the-bridge]]></alias>

<introtext><![CDATA['Mark...is profitable to me for the ministry.' 2 Timothy 4:11 KJV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friendships - some last the course of time, some slowly drift apart after a while, and some break up in bitter arguments. The first two are fine and a part of most people's life experience. The last might be experienced by many people too, but it's not how God wants things to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See Paul (the disciple and writer of a big chunk of the New Testament) and Mark (the apostle and writer of...go on, guess...) were both big guys in the Church, but fairly unhappy&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;friends. Things first fell apart when Mark backed out of an overseas missions trip. Paul didn't like this - so much so, that he refused to let Mark accompany them on another trip to Cyprus. It got so bad it led to bickering between Paul and one of his best friends - the apostle Barnabas. People started to pick sides. Things were beginning to spiral out of control, and they ended up going their separate ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, years later, Paul had an attitude reversal. He famously commended Mark, saying, '&lt;em&gt;He is profitable to me for the ministry.&lt;/em&gt;' Mark wasn't written off in history as a loser for his missed opportunity - he went on to write part of the world's bestselling book: the Gospel with his name on it. Paul and Mark counted their disagreement as just some water under the bridge - nothing compared to serving Christ together. Do you need an attitude reversal over somebody? God hasn't given up on them, so why would you? Pray that God will show you how He views the 'Mark' in your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: John 10:1-18, Rev 7:13-17, Ps 23, Luke 15:1-7&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56384&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Approved and acceptable and in right relationship with Him.' 2 Corinthians 5:21 AMP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's a thought that should blow any Christian's mind: God loves and accepts you as much on your worst day as He does on your best day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not based on the state your life's in at any given time. It's based on the cross. How? Well, think of the cross like a trading post. There God took every wrongdoing you'd ever be doing (past, present and future) and laid it on Jesus. And the moment you place your trust in Christ and come into union with Him, God only sees Christ's goodness and godliness in you. From that point on, He sees you just one way - wrapped up in that bundle of righteousness, as if you were Christ Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In God's eyes, you got an A+. Yes, you made the team. You got the part. You don't need to do anything more to earn His approval. Jesus says, '&lt;em&gt;If you love Me, you will keep My commandments&lt;/em&gt;.' (John 14:15 ESV) That's not talking about blind obedience or acting from an insecure fear of being rejected: it's a description of what happens to us when we love Jesus - we &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to honour Him by following His commandments!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven't already placed your trust in Christ, have a serious think about it! Can you turn away from how you're living now and put your life in the hands of the Creator of the universe? Ask yourself: can you turn it all over to Him? If you can, it's time to look inside the back cover and pray the prayer there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Chr 25-28, Luke 17:11-19, Ps 119:129-136, Pr 22:8-10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56386&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Approved and acceptable and in right relationship with Him.' 2 Corinthians 5:21 AMP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world tells us that our value is in what we do. But in God, we are loved simply by 'being'. That changes everything. 'But God must care about what I &lt;em&gt;do,&lt;/em&gt;' you might reply. And you're right, He does! He wants you to be a good and whole person, holy like Him (1 Peter 1:15) and even now He's helping you get there. Your wrong behaviours won't be changed until you realise you are loved by God totally apart from anything you do. Put your self-worth in that, and you'll start to live out of real joy and contentment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus understands your personality, your struggles and even the faulty foundation upon which you might have based your self-worth before you met Him. He not only gets you, He cares about you. When you enter into that transforming friendship with Him, He peels away your pain, unveils just how valuable God thinks you are, and releases good gifts to you. Bit by bit, He restores everything the world might have stolen from you. And while all this is going on, you are positioned securely 'in Christ', where you'll remain always, forever at peace with God. If anyone you know is struggling with self-worth, remind them that God has created them to be a human &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt;, not a human &lt;em&gt;doing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Chr 29-31, Luke 17:20-37, Ps 119:137-144, Pr 22:11-13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56387&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I, Tertius, the one writing this letter for Paul, send my greetings.' Romans 16:22 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you'd like to be a good role model? You want people to notice you're different from the rest? Think you're the one to lead the way? Contrary to popular myth, leadership isn't about who can shout the most or get the job done most quickly; leadership is only properly done if you treat people like people. Like Paul. We know little about Paul's 'management style' but we do know that he wasn't about pushing others down so he could stay at the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A letter to the Roman church gives us an idea of how he wasn't afraid to give others a chance. He had a guy called Tertius on team (we know this because he's the one who wrote down Paul's thoughts in his letters to the Romans when, late in his life, Paul had gone partly blind.) Timothy, Paul's protégé, is often mentioned, not as a fellow colleague or dogsbody, but as a dear friend. And then there's Gaius, known as '[Paul's] host and...host to the whole Church.' (Romans 16:23 NLT) Paul lifted up everyone around him in order that the Church could be strengthened. Do you want to lead the way? Lesson one, then, is to think of others as much as you think of yourself. Surround yourself with people whose talents complement yours and build them up. It's the team approach that yields results. Paul used it. So did Jesus. So should you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Chr 32-34, Luke 18:1-17, Ps 119:145-160, Pr 22:14-16&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56388&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Search me, O God, and know my heart; test me...' Psalm 139:23 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our culture loves to see people fail. Think of all the headlines that revel in gossip about the fall of a pop star or footballer. The problem is that all this stinks of double-standards - of course politicians fail, and of course Hollywood's elite crash and burn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's human to fall short. The true test is how you pick up the pieces. Look at King David: following his knockdown bout with Goliath, the people elevated him to superholy celebrity status, only to see him knocked down following an affair with a married woman. To David's credit, he didn't just brush the pieces under the carpet, he faced his mess honestly, head-on. He collected his experience in a poem: '&lt;em&gt;Search me, O God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts. Point out anything in me that offends you, and lead me along the path of everlasting life&lt;/em&gt;.' (Psalm 139:23-24 NLT) If we want to be a role model to others, we must pray those words. We must be brave enough to allow God to show us our mess. It's never nice feeling vulnerable, but be brave today. God isn't interested in making you feel bad, He just wants to clean you up and get you on the right track. So ask Him to point out anything that's out of line or anything that offends Him that you need to delete from your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Chr 35-36, 2 Jn, Luke 18:18-30, Ps 119:161-168, Pr 22:17-19&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56389&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The heart of the discerning acquires knowledge; the ears of the wise seek it out.' Proverbs 18:15 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the jokes in classic comedies come from one person misunderstanding another. &lt;em&gt;Laurel &amp; Hardy&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Two Ronnies&lt;/em&gt;, even most cartoon plots have comic communication failures as the basis of the whole story. (A small boy was looking at a plaque at the front of a church. The minister explained to him that it was a memorial to all the brave men and women who had died in the service. The boy was silent a moment. 'Which service was that?' he asked. 'The nine o'clock or the ten thirty?')&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we're under pressure we sometimes fail to hear what's being communicated. But if we take our eyes off our own concerns, God can help us to grasp what other people are going through. The Bible talks of the 'gift of discernment.' It's like God gives you extra-special sensitivity for a situation or circumstance or person, where you can cut through to the heart of the matter easier because God gives you discernment. Sometimes it's as simple as just shutting up and listening to what a person is really saying; sometimes it's about God giving you a particular thought that opens up conversation and cuts to the chase. The key is to concentrate on God in every situation (even when that means taking timeout), and then concentrating on building the other person up, not elevating yourself. So ask the Holy Spirit for the gift of discernment in your life. Then pray for a chance to use it in building up another person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 3 John, Jude, Luke 18:31-43, Ps 119:169-176, Pr 22:20-23&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56390&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Listen...and I will give you some advice...' Exodus 18:19 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hypothetical scenario: You decide to put on an outreach event. But then the whole thing escalates. Now there are a thousand and one jobs to do. What do you do? Three options: (A) &lt;em&gt;Get on with them yourself&lt;/em&gt;. It was your idea to put the event on. It is your responsibility to get the jobs done. (B) &lt;em&gt;Surround yourself with a team.&lt;/em&gt; Get a group of people together and carve up what needs to be done. (C) &lt;em&gt;Scale the event down.&lt;/em&gt; You don't want to bite off more than you can chew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who answered A will likely end up sticking their fist through a wall. Those who answered C are (probably) going to be disappointed with their event. But those who answered B are modelling a Biblical principle. Jesus surrounded himself with a close team of twelve. Each one was chosen carefully, and almost all of them were ready to give up everything for Him. That group made a difference one person could not have. Moses learned it the hard way: 'Moses' father-in-law replied, &quot;What you are doing is not good. You and these people who come to you will only wear yourselves out. The work is too heavy for you; you cannot handle it alone... Select capable men from all the people...and appoint them as officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens... That will make your load lighter, because they will share it with you. If you do this...you will be able to stand the strain, and all these people will go home satisfied.&quot;' (Exodus 18:1724 NIV) Good role models follow this example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Josh 1-4, Luke 19:1-10, Ps 84, Pr 22:24-26&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56391&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Honour your father and mother.' Exodus 20:12 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;To obey or not to obey, that is the question... right? Does God really just want us as our parents' minions? Sounds more like slavery than childhood! As important as taking the bins out is, there's got to be more to the fifth commandment than cold-hearted drudgery. Is God just testing us until we're old enough to have some proper fun? Of course not!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of God's main roles is as a Father. It's reflected within the relationships of the Trinity: Father, Spirit and Son. The family unit is really where God wants His Church to start and end. Is this still important even if we're old enough to have left home? Yes! Jesus, the Son of God was also the Son of Man: He came to earth and was born into an earthly family. Luke 2:51 shows how He submitted to both. He honoured His heavenly Father in everything He did, but was every bit obedient to His earthly parents as well: '...&lt;em&gt;He was obedient to them&lt;/em&gt;.' Following Christ's example, we should honour our parents the same way we'd honour God. That means a little thing called submitting. Tomorrow we'll look at what that means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Father's Day  -  Phil 2:5-11, Rev 19:11-16, Acts 3:1-16, Matt 1:18-21&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56392&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Honour your father and mother.' Exodus 20:12 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;'&lt;em&gt;The human heart is the most deceitful of all things, and desperately wicked. Who really knows how bad it is?&lt;/em&gt;' (Jeremiah 17:9 NLT) No one knows this more than parents. In the toddler stage, children develop a taste for saying 'no'. So is honouring your parents simply about reversing the curse and saying 'yes' to everything they say? It's more than that. Washing up when you're asked is good, but God's also looking at your inner attitude. That includes comebacks like, 'I'll do it after I've finished my Facebook update!' It's not honouring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus told the parable of two sons who were asked to do a job by their Father (see Matthew 21:28-32). The first son snarled, 'I will not,' but later changed his mind. The second respectfully said, 'I will go,' but never did! It's obvious which son did what his parent asked. But Jesus was directing it at those who appeared righteous. Just because you seem to do as they ask doesn't mean it's wholly pleasing to God. Attitude matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sin is disobeying the divine authority of God. In the home, He's given your parents authority over you. That doesn't mean they're always right. If they do as He asks, they'll help you grow and provide protection for you. So resisting them can mean you're resisting Him... God's looking both for active obedience coupled with a top attitude. The difference between childlike and childish is important, no matter what your age.

<introtext><![CDATA['Choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve.' Joshua 24:15 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next few days we'll be looking at how we can grow in wisdom, and the value of our parents and guardians in helping us out. But first, '&lt;em&gt;The beginning of wisdom is this: get wisdom!&lt;/em&gt;' (Proverbs 4:7 ESV) If you want wisdom, really go for it! Get serious about it! Proverbs 2 tells us that wisdom is guaranteed to us as a gift. It's ours. &lt;em&gt;But&lt;/em&gt; only if we're serious about getting it. Are you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is wisdom? And why is it worth giving it a shot? Well, for one thing, it's not just 'being smart' or having intelligence. The Christian idea of 'wisdom' is something else altogether, and it's not something you can get from learning. It's mysterious - a gift from Heaven placed in your heart. It 'anoints' your ordinary human perception and gives it a divine boost. Suddenly you see how everything around you fits into God's great bigger picture. What before was 'just another day, just another person, just another church service' is suddenly filled with meaning. Getting wisdom is like eating fruit from a tree of life - you're filled with new insight, and transformed by the renewing of your mind. It's the bread from Heaven that gives life. It's the way of living in the future Kingdom of God, today! So, if you want wisdom, go for it! Proverbs 9: 56 ESV tells us what 'wisdom' has to say to us: 'Come, eat of my bread and drink of the wine I have mixed. Leave your simple ways, and live, and walk in the way of insight.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Josh 8:30-10:43, Luke 19:28-40, Ps 103:13-22, Pr 23:1-3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56396&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...A man reaps what he sows.' Galatians 6:7 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wisdom is not just the 'godly glasses' that we pop on every now and again to view the world differently. Wisdom is a serious change of mindset - no, even deeper, it's a change of heart and soul that lines us up with Heaven. It's walking 'in the way of insight.' (Proverbs 9:6 ESV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a spiritual attitude. But it shows itself in our real lives in the choices we make. The consequences we get are the result of our choices. So, if we want to grow in wisdom, how can we look out for it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at your parents. Maybe even ask them about how the choices (positive and negative) they've made have shaped their lives. All of us need the helping hand of a wiser, older person to point out what should have been obvious all along. Your parents could - and should - be an excellent place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you've been let down by absent or abusive parents, then that's no reason to feel you should lack wisdom. God's plans for you include a future and a hope and, despite your start in life, He wants you to become the wisest parent or friend you possibly can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earthly wisdom includes learning from others' successes and mistakes. If you can, spend time with your parents to ask them honestly about their lives. Maybe it will shed light on things that are happening for you and also give you deep wisdom for situations you'll face in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Josh 11-13, Luke 19:41-48, Ps 111, Pr 23:4-6&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56397&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[Your thoughts...are the source of true life.' Proverbs 4:23 CEV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Keep your heart with all vigilance, for from it flow the springs of life.' (Proverbs 4:23 ESV) If you've grown up in a genuinely Christian home, you might occasionally look back and wonder if you've had a 'sheltered' upbringing. It might seem you've missed out on lots of exciting parts of culture and life. Maybe you find it hard to engage with certain sorts of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that's the case, think about what your parents were actually trying to do. They've set you on a clear course in the journey of life. Others may have already steered themselves straight into the rocks, following the wrong currents and tides. Still others have meandered about in no particular direction. But, even if it sometimes felt boring, you've left the harbour of home safe and secure, and it's still the morning for you. Life waits for you, fresh, new and full of unspoilt opportunity God is by your side, as He has been from the start. That's the gift good parenting has given you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you haven't had that gift? Or, like some of us, fought against it and learned some of these lessons the hard way? Our God is a redeemer, and this is where His grace comes in. Not just to save you (praise Him for that!), but to grant you wisdom to teach others not only how to avoid mistakes like yours but also how to repair them by God's grace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood (Feast of Trumpets): Num 29:1-6, Matt 24, Rev 11:15-19, 1 Cor 15:50-58&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56398&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Does not wisdom call?' Proverbs 8:1 ESV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we've seen, the book of Proverbs talks a lot about getting wisdom. Why so much? Well, imagine if the Apple store decided that iPads were completely free from now on - you'd think they'd put effort into letting people know about it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible is clear that wisdom is a completely free gift. It's not something we can buy. Nor is it something we can master just by putting an effort into learning facts. Godly wisdom must be asked for. So if all we have to do is untie the ribbon on the giftbox, how do we do it? The answer is: we open the gift through prayer. Go hard after wisdom. Show God that you are serious about it. Solomon, in 1 Kings 3, decided that wisdom was the only thing worth asking God for. Above money, above more power, above long life, Solomon saw the real riches in wisdom. And he got it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get praying. It's simple, but if you have the right motives (and those are important), God will drop wisdom into you, as a gift from Heaven placed in your heart. James 1:17 NIV says, '&lt;em&gt;Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows.&lt;/em&gt;' It will change your ordinary human perception in a way that all the learning and intelligence on earth could never do. Suddenly you see how everything around you fits into God's bigger picture. What on earth could be better?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to sum up: Do you want wisdom? Look to learn from your earthly parents - spend time with them asking questions. But also, make time to ask your Heavenly Father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Josh 14-15, Luke 20: 1-8, Ps 142, Pr 23:7-9&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56399&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['For this child I prayed, and the Lord has granted me my petition...' 1 Samuel 1:27 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;KP Yohannan is the founder of &lt;em&gt;Gospel for Asia&lt;/em&gt;, a missionary organisation that has seen the salvation story brought to millions of people. He has crisscrossed the world and written over 200 books. His &lt;em&gt;Bridge of Hope&lt;/em&gt; programme cares for tens of thousands of children breaking free from poverty. This man knows what it means to be used by God. The beginning of his beautiful story, however, is found at the bent knees of a poor Indian woman. Every single week, without fail, KP's mother would pray that one of her children would be saved for the work of God. At the age of eight, KP experienced a conversion. By sixteen, he was crossing India's subcontinent telling all he met about Jesus Christ. Today his legacy has touched millions around the world. The prayers of a mother are powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Old Testament tells of a similar praying mum who dedicated her baby to the work of God. His name: Samuel. His legacy: a prophet who led Israel for forty years and whose life still serves as an example to Jews and Christians around the globe today. The prayers of a praying mother are powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What could you do today to thank your mum for all that she does?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Josh 16:1-19:23, Luke 20:9-19, Ps 20, Pr 23:10-12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56400&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<alias><![CDATA[nothing-but-the-truth]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['You desire truth in the inward parts...' Psalm 51:6 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul wrote a list of people who will find it hard to get in on God's rule: &lt;em&gt;Those who change bed partners without a second thought are out&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Those who make anything other than God their priority are out&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Those who take what isn't theirs are out&lt;/em&gt;. A&lt;em&gt;nd those who twist the truth to suit their own needs are out&lt;/em&gt;. You can read the full list in 1 Corinthians 6:910.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One that might surprise you: trust-twisters and story-stretchers are out. God is blunt about lies: '&lt;em&gt;No one who is dishonest will live in my house...&lt;/em&gt;' (Psalm 101:7 NCV) In God's eyes, lies are up there with sexual immorality and idolatry. So spinning a yarn about why you scratched your dad's car is the same as bowing down to a golden statue of a bull? Apparently so. Seems a bit harsh, doesn't it? Not when you consider who you were created to reflect - God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His standards are scarily high to works-in-progress like us. However He says we can reach them, and He outright calls us to do so. When Jesus calls for purity, His motive is love for us, and when we mess up, His medicine is His love for us too. There's grace for when we fail, but we should never confuse that with permission not to try. With God, truth is not a 'grey area', so if you have parts of your life that you feel fall into a 'grey area', then confess them. Only when you do will your sins be 'forgiven because of Jesus'. (1 John 2:12 NLT)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Heb 11:1-6, Matt 21:18-22, Matt 8:5-13, Mark 6:1-6&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56401&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

For forty days, he'd swaggered around like a bully, mouthing off about the wimps who were afraid to face him in battle. Then along came this teeny kid called David who wondered out loud why the wimps weren't trusting in God. It got him into two kinds of trouble: (1) his brothers were angry because Goliath was a monster whose every muscle was sprung steel and they didn't like David suggesting they were cowards. (2) the king decided, if David was the only one who wasn't afraid, then he was the obvious choice to face Goliath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You reckon David must have had second thoughts? You reckoned he must have wondered why he'd opened his big mouth? Certainly he must have felt very small in the shadow of this giant killing machine. But David's ultimate trust wasn't in feelings or reason or strength. David's trust was in the One who could deal with the Philistine bully as easily as breathing. God is always bigger. 'The Lord is my light and my salvation; I will fear no one. The Lord protects me from all danger; I will never be afraid.' (Psalm 27:1 GNT) When giants intimidate you or problems confuse you or fear shouts you down, God always one-ups the bullies. God is always bigger. With God on your side, you can look at the situation differently. Suddenly, it's you who's the giant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Josh 19:24-21:45, Luke 20:20-26, Ps 112, Pr 23:13-15&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56404&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be still, and know that I am God...' Psalm 46:10 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boring, isn't it? Waiting because you are stuck in traffic or trapped at a red light? Well, not anymore. Christian charity &lt;i&gt;Exodus Cry&lt;/i&gt; have come up with a revolutionary idea of changing the world whilst you're stuck in traffic. It's called &lt;i&gt;The Red Light Prayer&lt;/i&gt; Initiative. Red light districts around the globe are hot spots for harbouring victims of human trafficking. So the &lt;i&gt;Red Light Prayer Initiative&lt;/i&gt; asks you to pray about human trafficking and prostitution every time you stop at a traffic light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, instead of groaning or venting road rage because you're waiting around for a couple of minutes, you now have the power to loose the chains of injustice. By the time your life is over, it's estimated you will have spent six whole months stuck at traffic lights. What will you have done with those six months? Moaned and groaned or changed the world through prayer? And for those who think prayer is a copout for rolling up your sleeves and getting stuck in, you may be surprised to discover William Wilberforce prioritised prayer as his number one strategy for achieving the abolition of the African slave trade. So what are you waiting for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On your way to school/college/uni/work or on your way home, start praying at all those annoying traffic lights. Begin by asking God to end trafficking in your own city.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Judge nothing before the appointed time...' 1 Corinthians 4:5 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone once quipped, 'Every footie team could use someone who knows how to play every position, is never offside and never makes an error. The only problem getting him is: it's hard to make him put down his burger and come out of the spectator stands!' If God has given you a dream, or is working in your life, or is giving you hope for a future, don't let the scoffers ruin it. Don't allow the spectators to talk you out of it or tell you how to do it. Only take that kind of advice from people who have been there and done it! Only consider criticism when it is constructive and when you know you are valued by the person advising you - and that they will support you in a practical way, as well as giving advice. If the critics never say anything good about anyone, don't let their words alight on you. Scripture says, 'Judge nothing before the appointed time; wait till the Lord comes. He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and will expose the motives of men's hearts. At that time each will receive his praise from God.' Listen to people you trust. Don't feed the trolls. Instead, seek out a mentor you can trust to spur you on. Invite them to ask you some challenging questions, and to show you encouragement from the heart of God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Col 1-2, Luke 20:41-47, Ps 78:1-8, Pr 23:19-21&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56405&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Jesus...touched him...' Mark 1:41 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The auctioneer thought it hardly worth his while to waste much time on the battered and scarred old violin, so he held it up with a smile. 'What am I bid for this? A dollar? Who will make it two? And who'll make it three? Three dollars once, twice, going for three.' From the back of the room an old man came forward and picked up the bow. Sweeping the dust from the worn instrument, and tightening the strings, he played beautiful music. The auctioneer turned to the crowd, 'What am I bid for the old violin? A thousand dollars, and two? Two thousand, three? Three thousand once, twice, and gone.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What changed its worth? The touch of a master's hand. The one who played it so beautifully. At some point or another, we all come to a time when our lives are out of tune, battered and scarred with sin, ready to be auctioned to the thoughtless world. Then, with a touch of the Master's hand, we become God's beautiful instruments, fit to play to Heaven's tune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you feel battered, tired, worn out and worthless? Allow the Master's hand to restring your soul. Change your life to accept His ways - and become a restored child of God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Col 3-4, Philemon, Luke 21:1-11, Ps 78:9-16, Pr 23:22-25&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56406&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Teach me to do Your will, for You are my God...' Psalm 143:10 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;God's will, God's way. Sometimes it's the second part of that that's the biggest problem. Especially when time is ticking by. God had promised Abraham: &lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your children will outnumber the stars and the sands.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;But there he was, getting older in the usual way - day by day. His wife had passed childbearing age a couple of decades previously.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;It seems, as Abraham thought of God's promise, he wondered whether it actually mention his wife by name.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Maybe it was: '&lt;em&gt;Your &lt;/em&gt;children will outnumber the stars,'&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;not&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;'&lt;em&gt;Her &lt;/em&gt;children...'?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of this rationalisation, Abraham tried to force God's hand and, in doing so, he became the father of Ishmael. But Ishmael wasn't the child of promise that God had in mind. Abraham's mistake didn't cost him his promise because he eventually became the father of Isaac by his wife. However it did cost intense pain all round - pain that has lasted thousands of years and continues to the present day in the conflict between the Jews and the Arabs. There's a lesson here: taking responsibility for your actions doesn't guarantee a future free of ugly consequences. Second lesson: if God makes a promise, there is no mistake too big to stop it being fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if God has given you a promise, specific to your life, count it as a sealed deal. It may take a long time - it may seem like it will never come - but learn from Abraham's mistake and don't take any shortcuts to 'help' God fulfil His promises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Neh 1-4, Luke 21:12-24, Ps 78:17-31, Pr 23:26-28&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56407&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...walk by the Spirit...' Galatians 5:16 NAS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fritz Ridenour, a Christian author, writes: 'You want to do right, but you do wrong. You want to choose obedience, but you choose sin. Sometimes you'd almost swear you were a split personality, a regular &quot;walking civil war&quot;.' Sound familiar? Well you're not the only one! And most of us fight our civil war in the shadows, all alone. Satan whispers, 'Face it, you'll never be good enough. Why not just give up and accept the inevitable? You can't change.' But the fleshly desires that get us in to such a mess don't have to be in control. Paul writes, 'Walk by the Spirit and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh.' Did you catch that? You see God's Spirit and our flesh are like oil and water. But when we're walking in the Spirit we don't listen to the desires of the flesh. So, we're listening to the Spirit and we're under His control, or we're listening to the flesh and we're under its control. And that's a choice we must make each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though you're a new creation the old stuff that tempted you before you met Jesus is still part of the world you live in. There will still be opportunities to make those cutting remarks you used to make. Things won't always go your way and you'll feel that old temper coming on. Lustful thoughts will still invade your mind. So, in the power of the Spirit you must throw up your hands and say, 'God, this stuff is trying to infect me. I can't beat it on my own!' It's at this point that He takes over and the battle goes your way!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Lev 16, Lev 23:26-32, Heb 9:1-14, Heb 13:11-16&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56408&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be self-controlled and alert.' 1 Peter 5:8 NIV &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has stayed awake in Modern History lessons and hasn't snoozed through the section on the Second World War will know the atrocities didn't stop when victory was finally declared. There was still plenty of mess to mop up - including the liberation of concentration camps. Soldiers were shocked to find great heaps of corpses and barely alive people who looked like skeleton frames. Battles of a different kind raged on - to claim back human dignity and rescue the dying from disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something similar is going on now, in the spiritual world. Christ's death and resurrection has defeated the enemy. The war is won but the battle still rages - the battle to live in God's freedom and rescue the captives from pain and suffering. Jesus described our defeated enemy as one who still tries to 'steal, kill and destroy' (John 10:10 TLB), who 'prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.' (1 Peter 5:8 NIV) It took more than good will to overthrow the Nazis. It takes more than brawn to resist the devil. For the next few days we'll look at strategies to keep you strong on the battlefield...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Peter 5:8 says, 'Be self-controlled and alert.' How does self-control help resist the devil? If you are alert to your weaknesses and ask God to help you exercise self-control, you won't fall into the devil's snares. So start now, but asking God for that help!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood (Day of Atonement): Heb 11:23-28, Ex 3:1-22, Ex 33:7-23, Ex 34:29-35&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56409&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Submit yourselves therefore to God...' James 4:7 KJV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gallipoli campaign in the First World War was so confused that no one is sure how many soldiers died - as many as a quarter of a million on each side have been suggested. Tragically, bad orders cost lives. And that's true of the spiritual battlefield also. When we submit our minds to those who know nothing about Jesus, our life is at stake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we succumb too much to a fashion designer's current ideals, chances are we will have self-image battles down the line. If we give in to the Hollywood romcom ideal, our relationships will never match up to the false promise films offer. If we fall into the money trap, where might a recession leave us? Fashion, romance, money... none of these things are bad in themselves, but none deserve our full surrender. Jesus is the only General worthy of our full submission. Under His authority, and His alone, we'll have victory in battles: '...Not by [human] might nor by [human] power, but by My Spirit, says the Lord of hosts.' (Zechariah 4:6 NKJ) Following His orders &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; save your life. But we have to take the bold choice of accepting them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So think about what it is you struggle to give up. Pray that you can leave that thing, hands up in full surrender, at Jesus' cross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Neh 5-7, Luke 21:25-38, Ps 78:32-39, Pr 23:29-35&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56411&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Resist the devil...he will flee from you' James 4:7 KJV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refuse, refuse, &lt;i&gt;refuse&lt;/i&gt; to give in. During the Second World War, the Nazis had occupied France, but a good proportion of French citizens refused to give in to their enemy. The French Resistance were men and women who fought underground with guerrilla warfare tactics and subversive newspapers. The Allies' rapid advance through Normandy is partly thanks to them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christians are a Resistance Movement too. Our guerrilla warfare tactics are love, peace, forgiveness and grace - clinging on to the Gospel of truth. We refuse to give in to our enemy. We refuse to concede to the enemy's invitation to greed, hatred, envy, lust and lies. And our atomic bomb is the name of Jesus. At the name of Jesus the enemy is blown to smithereens. 'At the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in Heaven and on earth and under the earth.' (Philippians 2:10 NLT) When you resist the devil in the name of Jesus, he has to flee; God promises in Scripture that when you speak and act according to His will, He will speak and act through you Satan cannot break or withstand this chain of command. So join in a Resistance Movement that overcomes greed with kindness, lust with purity, bitterness with forgiveness. Add your assistance to the resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Come near to God and He will come near to you.' James 4:8 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lone soldier in enemy territory makes an easy target. When you're cut off from your battalion you are prone to attack. Know why it's vital to stay plugged into the Church? Because the Church is your battalion. Yes, God still loves you even if you don't worship Him on a Sunday, but you're not making it easy for yourself in life's battles. You're a sitting duck. Without the encouragement of other Christians it's easy to drift, easy to stagnate, easy to fall. The margins of acceptability become blurred. Without the needs of others in God's family to look out for it's just easier to become self-centred. And, without commitment to God's mission you become just another average Joe or Joe-ette. Before you know it you can't remember where you put your Bible or the last time you prayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who stay away from Church over a long period can develop a bitter taste towards other believers. To love God means to love His people. The enemy wants to drive a wedge between you and God. Don't let Church be His first stab. So, do all you can to get to Church this Sunday. Why not invite somebody who wouldn't ordinarily come along with you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Neh 11-13, Luke 22:14-23, Ps 78:56-64, Pr 24:5-10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56414&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Wash your hands, you sinners...' James 4:8 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A soldier whose wounds go untreated will develop infections or blood loss problems. It's unwise to choose to stay out in the field with no attention to the injury. There will be casualties in a war, but it's not the job of the soldier to heal himself. On the spiritual battlefield you may get hurt. Remember: it's not your job to clean yourself up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-improvement is talked up a lot these days, but in reality it's about as difficult as trying to take a bullet from your spleen while anaesthetised. Removing sin from your life is a job for a specialist - the Holy Spirit. If you leave bitterness or pride or lust untreated, your whole soul will get infected. Eventually something's got to give. So let the Holy Spirit work on your heart with His gentle surgical hands. Your heart generates and stores your beliefs, constructive and destructive. Once you form a belief, right or wrong, you begin to live it out. Faith can be eaten away by infection. The worst of this is that you know what's wrong, yet think you can get away with it. How can you overcome the enemy with a heart full of wrong beliefs and a double mind? Through 'turning over a new leaf'? You can turn over a whole forest but it won't make a difference. No, you must get down before God and say, 'Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a steadfast spirit within me.' (Psalm 51:10 NKJV) When you pray that way, God will cleanse your wounds, wrap you with power, and cause you to walk in victory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood (Feast of Tabernacles): Lev 23:33-44, Jn 7:1-40, Zech 14:16-21&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56415&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['These trials will show that your faith is genuine...' 1 Peter 1:7 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faith is like a bucket of water. You only discover how much is inside when somebody bumps into it. When life bumps you, does faith spill out? Bad news from a doctor - does faith spill out, or were you left empty? A friend betrays your trust - does forgiveness or revenge tip over the sides? Your job offer just fell through - is that trust or fear trickling out of the bucket?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can't tell how much faith somebody has by the size of the Christian fish symbol on their car. But you get a good indication by talking to them when they're in trouble. And trouble does come for Christians - it's promised in the Bible. Not so that God can embarrass you in front of your friends at church, but so you can firm up your faith. Faith is like a muscle. It needs regular exercise. Times of trouble can be a spiritual boot camp for your faith. They're not to reveal how much faith you have, but to refine it - to force out the gunk out of your life and purify it. 'These trials will show that your faith is genuine. It is being tested as fire tests and purifies gold... so when your faith remains strong through many trials, it will bring... much praise and glory...when Jesus Christ is revealed...'

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Blessed is the person who...' Psalm 1:1 GWT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian poet Boris Pasternak wrote this: 'It is not revolutions and upheavals that clear the road to new and better days but someone's soul inspired and ablaze.' The twentieth century saw its fair share of revolutions and upheavals. Pasternak's home country rose up in revolution, and by the end of the century it was left in pieces. Nazi Germany attempted a new order for the world; that ended with the Holocaust - six million Jews killed - and vulnerable groups gassed. In 1989 the world was shocked by the Tiananmen Square massacre, a horrific consequence of the Chinese Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not every upheaval automatically paves better days. Yet one soul, one person, can change the world. One Albanian nun decided to reach out to one child in poverty and by the end of her life Mother Teresa had reached out to thousands of children, one by one (not to mention all of those she has impacted and inspired just by her reputation). One Irish doctor gave a home to one poor child and two centuries later, Barnardo's continue to care for the poor. One Jewish scholar was blinded on a road to Damascus and two thousand years later his example of godliness is followed by millions across the planet. You don't need a high government position to change the world - one soul ablaze is enough to rewrite history. The key to the success of Mother Teresa, Dr Barnardo and the apostle Paul was unhurried, uninterrupted time with God. Take time to meditate on Psalm 1. Read it. Memorise it. Live it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Micah 5-7, Luke 22:39-53, Ps 24, Pr 24:15-18&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56417&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...this precious treasure...is held in perishable containers, that is, in our weak bodies...' 2 Corinthians 4:7 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;God has given you talents - they're like hidden treasure within you, a 'perishable container'. If you had a stash of jewels hidden inside perishable container like an old clay pot - which part do you think would be valued higher on &lt;em&gt;Antiques Roadshow&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This verse tells us God's treasure is hidden inside our sometimes wobbly, sometimes feeble bodies. All your talents, character, experiences, spiritual gifts are far more valuable than any part of your exterior. Not even your kindness, your wild and witty sense of humour, your loudness, your shyness or your discernment comes anywhere close to your &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; treasure: the presence of Almighty God shining out of your sometimes shabby self. He's the one who has given you those talents, knows where they're hidden and how to release them. You have so much treasure inside you, the enemy is out to steal it. Jesus said Satan comes '...to steal, kill and destroy...' (John 10:10 TLB) Think about it: you don't try to rob somebody unless they have something worth taking, right? Your talents may be raw and undeveloped, or buried under self-doubt, unconfessed sin, bad habits or despair. But God can take something that looks like nothing, and create something wonderful with it. He made the world from nothing, so it's no big deal for Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But God can't shine out of you if you don't have Him within. Have you invited Him to be Lord of your life? Not just your Saviour, the one who rescues you in time of trouble, but your Lord: the one who gave you all your talents and wants you to follow His plan for using them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Ki 17:1-6, 1 Ki 18:16-39, 1 Ki 19:9-18, 2 Ki 2:1-12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56420&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Beware of...hypocrisy...' Luke 12:1 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're pretty savvy about the media's tricks these days. If an ad gives us a hard sell on a product we know it's just hype. We expect the product to be outdated in eighteen months' time. If a poster urges us to buy some famous star's range of clothing, we know we'll never look like the airbrushed bronze on the picture. It can't live up to its promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus lived in a religiously-hyped community. The Pharisees were promising surefire plans for getting God's approval. Their hype got them a bit of respect and local celebrity but at the expense of making it impossible for anybody else to reach their standards. And if you didn't reach that standard, you couldn't get in on their monopoly on holiness. Good thing Jesus had sussed out their hype. 'Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees, because they are the hypocrites. Everything that is hidden will be shown, and everything that is secret will be made known...' (Luke 12: 2 NIV) Hypocrisy hypes us up. Jesus didn't like it then and He doesn't like it now. So choose sincerity over celebrity, principle over popularity, and honesty over hype. Take a moment for self-examination. Are there areas of 'hype' or 'hypocrisy' in your own life? Today's the day to start getting real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Tim 1-4, Luke 22:54-62, Ps 19, Pr 24:19-22&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56422&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['We will find grace to help us when we need it most.' Hebrews 4:16 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's true if you want six-pack abs. But we're talking about grace - and that's not about you putting in the crunches and the hard work! Grace is about receiving the approval of God without feeling the burn. God gives you the nod even though you haven't worked hard at being the perfect citizen. Yes, it's good to help old ladies across the road, read your Bible regularly and give some spare cash to the homeless, but none of this gives you extra credit with God - you already have credit overflowing, a bank account filled to the brim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grace can't be earned like a spiritual salary; grace is the gift under the tree already bought and wrapped for you. So, we don't have to struggle to try and put a smile on God's face. Jesus paid a hefty price for our gift, just so that we don't ever need to struggle. His cross isn't a new name for our struggle. We can let go of our independence and rest in God-dependence. 'Have you lost your senses? After starting your Christian lives in the Spirit, why are you now trying to become perfect by your own human effort?' (Galatians 3:3 NLT) No pain. Just gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(But wait. There's more. An aim to live a holy life is still important, but only as a &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;esponse&lt;/em&gt; to God's grace - not as an attempt to earn it. That's how it works!) So, learn to let go and to count on God's grace. He is more than willing to help you so long as you let go of your independent attitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Zech 1-4, Luke 22:63-71, Ps 3, Pr 24:23-25&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56426&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Stand here awhile, that I may announce to you the Word of God.' 1 Samuel 9:27 KJV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's an ancient Scripture with a modern message: 'As Saul, his servant and Samuel were getting near the edge of the city, Samuel said to Saul, &quot;Tell the servant to go on ahead of us, but you stay, because I have a message from God for you.&quot;' (1 Samuel 9:27 NCV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Saul probably had a thousand and one things to do. But nothing was more important than stopping right there and then to hear from God. Had he rushed ahead without staying, he would've missed the news that God had appointed him to be Israel's first king. Wow! I wonder what news you may have missed out on simply because you were too busy to stop and listen. Work, college, friends, music, games, shopping and endless other things are all vying for our time. And we're given the impression if we drop any of them we'll pay some sort of price. &lt;em&gt;But the real price is paid from dropping our connection to God.&lt;/em&gt; Busyness leads to empty spirituality. We become deaf to God's plans because we haven't stopped to listen. 'Never let the fire in your heart go out. Keep it alive. Serve the Lord.' (Romans 12:11 NIV) Timeout! Refuel on prayer and catch up with God's latest news. Prioritise 'listening to God' time today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Zech 5-8, Luke 23:1-12, Ps 39, Pr 24:26-28&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56428&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<title><![CDATA[Control Your Emotions (1)]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[control-your-emotions-1]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Cain, why are you angry?' Genesis 4:6 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless you learn to control your emotions you'll lose credibility, push people away and miss great opportunities. Your emotions are like a car: properly understood and directed it can take you places; out of control it can destroy you. When God asked Cain, 'Why are you angry with your brother?' He was saying: 'Listen up, Cain! Your emotions are sending you a message. If you don't get a handle on this, you'll create a mess you won't be able to live with. Yes, you'll repent and regret it, but you won't be able to undo it.' But Cain wouldn't listen. The situation seemed unfair; he felt unappreciated. He thought his brother's blessing had come at his expense. What emotions were at work here? Jealousy. Resentment. Competitiveness. Feeling like the victim. These unchecked forces caused him to murder his brother Abel and cross a line he could never undo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us have a knee-jerk reaction that isn't necessarily controlled by the rational or sensible side of our brain. It reacts to people and events, and like a sudden storm rises with strength from within, sometimes overwhelming us. The author Gordon McDonald writes: 'I used to pride myself on the fact that I kept my emotions to myself. I never saw myself as an angry person... Then I got married and my wife informed me that I had plenty of anger after all. While it rarely came out in words it showed itself in full colour in facial expressions (the &quot;gift of glare&quot;, we called it) I never knew I had. I had work to do. I had emotions that needed to be disciplined.' How about you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Zech 9-11, Luke 23:13-25, Ps 34, Pr 24:29-31&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56429&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Don't be angry or furious. Anger can lead to sin.' Psalm 37:8 CEV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike Singleterry, who played for the Chicago Bears American Football team, was a star player - and a Christian. One day, however, while they were losing, the hometown fans got really aggressive and started dissing him. He didn't like it. The TV cameras trained on Singleterry's face as he glowered at the crowd. Suddenly he lost his temper and started toward the stands, shouting back. It wasn't his finest hour. But after the game may have been. That's when he met with the press and apologised. No excuses, no blaming: just an apology. His emotions had got out of control and he took responsibility. Perhaps Singleterry had read these words: 'A man's wisdom gives him patience; it is to his glory to overlook an offence.' (Proverbs 19:11 NIV) As you go through life people will offend you. Sometimes it will be deliberate, other times they won't even realise. The question is; what are you going to do about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spiritually mature people discipline their emotions and make sure they accurately reflect reality. They can be sad, joyful, angry or elated in appropriate ways at appropriate times. They refuse to allow their emotions to determine their actions, attitude or choices. One Christian author writes: 'When I feel things going against me, when feelings of anger and resentment begin to rise it's time to stop and ask what's happening. Is this for the greater good, or not? Is God speaking to me, or isn't He? Will my flesh rule this moment, or my spirit?' That's good advice for us too!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Zech 12-14, Luke 23:26-34, Ps 52, Pr 24:32-34&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56430&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He had compassion on them and healed their sick.' Matthew 14:14 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you congratulate yourself on having your emotions in check, understand that there's another side to the coin - you can have control but no compassion - you can get worked up about human suffering but not do anything. James talks about the people who are churchgoers, who feel sorry for others but don't act. They see the pain and unmet needs of people. They have the ability to do something about it. They feel sorry but they walk away muttering about being too busy. Or they try to relieve their conscience with a token gift. James says, '...faith without works is dead.' (James 2:20 KJV) If we are not responsible, who is? If we don't do something, who will?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're only disciplining your emotions if you don't translate them into responsible action. And your 'somebody ought to do something about this' rants won't get &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; off the hook. William Barclay wrote: 'There is nothing more dangerous than the repeated experience of a fine emotion with no attempt to put it into action. It is a fact that every time a man feels a noble impulse without taking action, he becomes less likely ever to take action. In a sense it is true to say that a man has no right to feel sympathy, unless he at least tries to put that sympathy into action. An emotion is not something [to enjoy as a luxury]; it is something which at the cost of effort and of toil, of discipline and of sacrifice, must be turned into the stuff of life.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Cor 1-3, Luke 23:35-43, Ps 54, Pr 25:1-3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56432&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<title><![CDATA[Dry Bones, Listen Up!]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[dry-bones-listen-up]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Breath came into them, and they lived, and stood upon their feet.' Ezekiel 37:10 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine yourself as Ezekiel in today's passage, led by God into a valley of dry bones. Death round your ankles, you pick your way through the remains of the once-living. Not the sort of place you'd imagine learning something amazing about the purposes of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But God said to Ezekiel, 'Speak a prophetic message to these bones and say, &quot;Dry bones, listen to the word of the Lord... I am going to put breath into you and make you live again!&quot;' (Ezekiel 37:9 NLT) That's exactly what happened when Ezekiel obeyed God. He saw dry bones listen up to the voice of God, and turn into an army of living people. God literally breathed life into this deathly situation, and Ezekiel had the privilege to witness it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is God up to in our lives? And the lives of people around us? Like Ezekiel, God tells us to speak life into desperate situations and He makes it happen. When you see people changing lives with God, living like Jesus, chances are they went through a valley of real hurt, devastation and rejection of their own. And if that's where you are now, God &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; breathe on the dry bones around you, you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; see Him deliver you. 'In the day of trouble ...my head will be exalted above the enemies who surround me... I will sing...to the Lord.' (Psalm 27:5-6 NIV) That's how you give praise in bad times and are able to look back and say, 'Thank you for the experience, Lord. Without it I'd never have got to know You like I do today.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Heb 11:7, Gen 6:9-22, Gen 8:18-22, Matt 24:36-41&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56433&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['God has...given us...a sound mind.' 2 Timothy 1:7 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems to happen all the time in soccer: the losing team enters the second half and start having rather a lot of 'special injury moments'. A slight trip leads to an agonising grimace and all of a sudden the player's on the ground, massaging his leg. It's fear of losing that inspires foul play. But let's face it, all it does is make the player look 'stoopid', and he loses the respect of the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making choices, relating to people and living your life from a mindset of fear will never bring the right outcome. That's because fear isn't a feeling from God. In the Bible it says 'God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.' (2 Timothy 1:7 NKJ) We improve our lives by listening to God - every minute of listening to fear sets us back. If you really want to live differently, it has to start in your mind first, not your actions. Romans 12:2 NLT says this: 'Let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think. Then you will learn to know God's will for you, which is good and pleasing and perfect.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where does God want to take your thinking? Do you want to succeed where you've failed before? To become the person you always hoped to be? Don't start by changing your actions, start by changing your mind. Renew it daily with God's Word. Nothing you do will have as great an impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Cor 4-6, Luke 23:44-56, Ps 13, Pr 25:4-8&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56434&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['His compassions...are new every morning...' Lamentations 3:22-23 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine you're a screenwriter invited to pitch to some Christian film studio boss. You open the door to his massive office. You stand awkwardly in front of his rich mahogany desk. He's expecting an inspiring new movie about God's love. You begin your pitch for &lt;em&gt;Lamentations: The Movie&lt;/em&gt;: 'Er, it's a story about everything going wrong. A journey of people reaping bad times from all the sin they've sown. Most of them die.' Tough sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you're going through tough times do you feel like letting your non-Christian friends know? Do you think it might sound like a bad pitch for God, so you keep your mouth shut instead? Well, in the midst of harsh reality in &lt;em&gt;Lamentations&lt;/em&gt;, Jeremiah said this: 'Because of the Lord's great love we are not consumed, for His compassions never fail. They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does the pitch sound quite so bad now? While acknowledging times are tough, if we know deep in our souls God is at work, it changes everything. It's very powerful. Everyone has tough times. So be vulnerable. Don't be scared to be truthful with your friends. Your honesty in hard times could make their idea of who God is a lot more real for them. So think about a tough time where God really came through for you. Thank Him and pray for an opportunity to share your story with someone today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Cor 7-9, Luke 24:1-12, Ps 91, Pr 25:9-12   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56436&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['You shall not covet...' Exodus 20:17 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late night fridge raids are a terrible idea. So are similar things in other parts of our lives. It's like surfing the web of behaviour options, looking out for something that might make you happier than you are at the moment. When you're not satisfied with what you've got, but not sure what you do want, and are just looking to see if something grabs your attention, then you're looking for trouble. The Bible says: 'Those who are dominated by the sinful nature think about sinful things, but those who are controlled by the Holy Spirit think about things that please the Spirit.' (Romans 8:5 NLT) Setting your eyes on something you don't need or shouldn't have is just inviting danger into your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like you don't need to stuff your face when you're not really hungry, you don't need to set your mind or heart on having those things that aren't up to God's standard or measure. Remember, '...people become enemies of God when they are controlled by their human nature; for they do not obey God's law, and in fact they cannot obey it.' (Romans 8:7 GNT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you spend time with God, focus on thanking Him for all the things you do have rather than asking Him for the things you don't. An attitude of gratitude is one weapon God gives us against covetousness - so use it today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Cor 12-14, Luke 24:25-35, Ps 68:19-35, Pr 25:17-20&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56438&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['He gave them their request, but sent leanness into their soul...' Psalm 106:15 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Covetousness riles God because the heart of it is pumped by pure pride. It makes you look inside, to you. And just you. To your wants and desires only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God delivered His people from slavery in Egypt, and they were pretty happy with that. Did they stay happy? No, not for long. Like conceited celebrities used to living in a mansion of privilege, they were unhappy with God's menu. They were ready to swap their freedom for a zucchini! In addition, they wanted meat and plenty of it. It didn't matter that God had rescued them and given them everything they needed for their journey out of slavery. What did God say? '[I'll] give you meat, and you will eat it...until it comes out of your nostrils and you loathe it...' (Numbers 11:18-20 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever heard the saying, 'Be careful what you wish for'? Because the Israelites thought something else could satisfy them in a way that God couldn't, He gave them exactly what they asked for, but along with it they got an empty heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you rather have a life emptied of God or a life emptied of 'stuff'? Learn from the Israelites about recognising God's answer to prayers. Take the time to get to the place where the central desire of your life is, 'God, I just want more of You.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Cor 15-16, Luke 24:36-44, Ps 60, Pr 25:21-22&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56439&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let your conduct be without covetousness...' Hebrews 13:5 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Covetousness. A mouthful to say, and pretty hard for God to swallow. What does it mean though? Here's an (all too everyday...) example for you: There's a new iPhone out. Or car. Or bike. Or your friend has just booked the holiday you've always dreamed of. Covetousness is about anything that makes you lick your lips and start wishing you had it. [It works with people too, not just objects - the commandment to 'Not covet your neighbour's wife' (Deuteronomy 5:21) is talking about exactly the same attitude...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being so greedy for money possessions or fame, you'll do pretty much anything to get what you want is &lt;em&gt;covetousness&lt;/em&gt; in a nutshell. To recognise it in yourself when it pops up: it begins with a craving, followed by schemes of how to get it. In the book of Hebrews it says, 'Stay away from the love of money [and material things]; be satisfied with what you have. For God has said, &quot;I will never fail you. I will never forsake you.&quot;' (Hebrews 13:5 NLT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's impossible to think about a desire for any length of time without rationalising a way to get it. Covetousness maximises the desire while minimising the danger. Yielding is inevitable: just a matter of time. Change your focus! Set your mind on Jesus and ask Him about all those things you feel you can't live without. Ask Him too to set your mind on 'the things of the Spirit.' (Romans 8:5 NKJ)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Cor 10-11, Luke 24:13-24, Ps 68:1-18, Pr 25:13-16&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56437&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be content with such things as you have...' Hebrews 13:5 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're asking God for something just because someone else has got it, you're bound to be disappointed. It may feel like an entirely reasonable request - sometimes however, it can be coming from a place of resentment or envy. We can look to others and want what they have, but the Bible says this: 'No good thing will He withhold from them that walk uprightly.' (Psalm 84:11 NAS)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When God seems to be keeping things from you (like a special relationship), you need to trust Him rather than resent others. He's much too good a Dad to give you things that you're not actually ready for. It could even be that He wants you to hunger after a deeper relationship with Him, rather than a longed-for relationship that doesn't exist yet. Work with what you've got and God will bring along all you need. When you covet something and beg for what you don't have, you're asking Him to replace Himself with something you consider more important. Is your problem that you're not satisfied with God alone? Do you want God plus a great job, a perfect partner, a penthouse apartment? Then remember the words of Jesus: '...Take heed and beware of covetousness, for one's life does not consist in the abundance of the things he possesses.' (Luke 12:15 NKJ) Life is not built on things, it's built on relationships. And the first relationship that needs your attention is the one with God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Ex 1-3, Luke 24:45-53, Ps 51, Pr 25:23-25&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56440&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Grace be unto you, and peace, from God...' 1 Corinthians 1:3 KJV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peace - what do you think of? Sixties hippies and flower power? Nineties rappers leaving the stage? A handshake during the church service? 'Peace' wasn't Paul's catchphrase. For you, today, and through all history, peace actually means something very different. God's peace, '...exceeds anything we can understand. His peace will guard your hearts and minds.' (Philippians 4:7 NLT) In other words, it's that unearthly gift of resting contentedly in God, no matter what's happening around you. How good would that be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul understood you can't get peace without experiencing and living with God. Here are three things to understand about the grace of God that lets us live like that: (1)&lt;em&gt; It can&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;t be earned &lt;/em&gt;(2)&lt;em&gt; it&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;s God doing for you what you can&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;t do for yourself &lt;/em&gt;(3)&lt;em&gt; it doesn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;t kick in until you stop struggling and doing things in your own strength. &lt;/em&gt;It's about being humble. It's understanding that God is much bigger than you, and you need Him every day. It's learning to trust God by the only way possible - doing it! It's learning to wait on him to supply what you need when you need it. There will never be a day you don't need God's grace! Once you realise that, and decide to sit with Him in every moment, you'll never be in short supply of peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Heb 11:8-12, Gen 17:1-27, Gen 22:1-18, James 2:21-24&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56442&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<title><![CDATA[Healing For Your Grief]]></title>

<introtext><![CDATA['He heals the brokenhearted...' Psalms 147:3 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever dropped a mentos into a bottle of Diet Coke? Grief can do that to our emotions. One day you're fine, then suddenly you're walking around exploding inside. More than anything, you want to let go of your emotions, but you feel like you need to keep them tightly contained. And you can only do that for so long. Let it build up too much and you'll detonate. The world around you will get very messy. If it happens at the wrong time it can badly affect others around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson is clear. After a serious loss, you need to allow yourself time and space to grieve. Grief isn't self-indulgent, it's a necessary part of being human. Jesus wept with the family of a dead friend to share His feelings with them - and because He genuinely hurt, too. Let people share your loss with you by opening up when you need to. A way that might help is extending your family by confiding in friends and people who you know you can trust and care about you. If you're grieving now, know that God is for you, especially at this time. Grief is draining, so you might need to rest more than usual. It may affect your appetite - but you need to respect your body's need to eat, drink and exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romans 8:31 says you can pray without words - in fact that God prays through you without words. If you're lost for words, simply go to Him. Run to God with your pain, not away from Him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Ex 4-6, John 1:1-13, Ps 63, Pr 25:26-28&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56443&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['My people will live in peaceful dwelling places...' Isaiah 32:18 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress is pretty bad for anyone. Really bad. It not only mangles your head, it can give you some seriously nasty physical side effects too. Headaches, a rash, feeling sick, affecting your sleep, undereating, overeating, and feeling constantly on the edge of tears, all can be stress nailing your body as well as your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Newsflash! &lt;/em&gt;God doesn't want that! He wants us to walk with a sound mind and trust in Him: 'Give all your worries and cares to God, for He cares about you.' (1 Peter 5:7 NLT) Talking to God, and sharing with a friend, can make you realise you've been listening to the father of lies rather than God's truth. We can let the devil wreck havoc in our minds if we're not careful. There he is in his waiter's outfit, dishing out lies, shaking the truth into a twisted cocktail and making you see small problems as massive mountains. A lot of the time they're actually just 'one-step-at-a-time' molehills. If you have problems burdening you and you're finding it hard to cope, you may need to see a doctor or counsellor to help you unpick the way you're feeling. Be strong and courageous by speaking out. Don't suffer in silence. Also take time to rest with God. Worshipping, singing about how good God is, can take our minds off ourselves and our circumstances. In fact, many people testify to what it says in the Bible: that praising God can actually change our stressy circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Ex 7-9, John 1:14-28, Ps 92, Pr 26:1-3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56444&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Oh, that men would give thanks to the Lord...' Psalm 107:8 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Psalmist writes, 'Oh, that men would give thanks to the Lord, for His goodness...' The word 'would' is crucial. A thankful attitude is a &lt;em&gt;choice&lt;/em&gt;, especially when it has to be made in spite of the situation you are facing. You choose your attitude just like you choose the food you eat and the clothes you wear. And there's plenty to be grateful for. You might say, 'Yes, but there's plenty to complain about too.' Yeah - and there's the reason you need to make a choice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever read &lt;em&gt;Robinson Crusoe&lt;/em&gt;, a novel based on a true story of a shipwrecked castaway? Just a reminder: he spent twenty-seven years on a desert island. At one point he writes a journal entry where he contrasts all the things he has to complain about (let's call it his 'Gripe List') with all the things he has to be thankful for (his 'Gratitude List'). Here's an example (paraphrased): Gripe: 'I'm stuck on this desert island without hope.' Gratitude: 'I wasn't drowned like the rest of my ship's company.' Gripe: 'I've no clothes.' Gratitude: 'I'm in a hot climate; if I had clothes I couldn't wear them.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See what he's doing? It's powerful stuff! It isn't Disneyworld thinking to focus on the good things of life, it's wisdom! If there's something you've been complaining about recently, turn it around into gratitude. Bring God into that situation by asking Him to show you how, and see what happens!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Ex 10-12, John 1:29-42, Ps 29, Pr 26:4-6&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56445&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['That...which we have heard...seen...touched.' 1 John 1:1 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you feel like you're having a long-distance relationship with God? &lt;em&gt;Well, yeah. God&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;s in Heaven, so that&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;s pretty long-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;distance?&lt;/em&gt; No. God's everywhere, and immediately present with you right now, even as you read this! He's not off somewhere in the stratosphere chilling out with angels. Be careful that your praying doesn't come across like you're tearing God away from a harp recital in Heaven to invite Him into your room instead. He's already there. If anything, God's waiting for our awareness of Him rather than the other way round. The Bible says, 'He who watches over you will not slumber.' (Psalm 121:3 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you noticed that when you hang around with the same person a lot you start picking up on their traits and being more like them? It's the same with God. The more you hang around with Him the more you'll grow in Chris-tlike characteristics. Compassion is one of these characteristics. As a young disciple, John wanted to call fire down from heaven on a town that refused overnight accommodation to Christ and His disciples (Luke 9:54). But after a lifetime of walking with Jesus he wrote, 'Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.' (1 John 4:8 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pray to God now, thanking Him that He's with you and that you would love to hear from Him. He's a living, present God with things to say to you today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Ex 13-15, John 1:43-51, Ps 131, Pr 26:7-9&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56446&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Every morning, I tell you what I need, and I wait for your answer.' Psalm 5:3 NCV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever thought, '&lt;i&gt;Why is it easier to pray and read the Bible at youth group camp than it is at home?&lt;/i&gt;'&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;Maybe the answer is we make time for it there. Perhaps the morning session sets us up for the day. CS Lewis thought it did. He wrote: 'The moment you wake up each morning...all your wishes and hopes for the day rush at you like wild animals. And the first job each morning consists in shoving them all back; in listening to that other voice, taking that other point of view, letting that other, larger, stronger, quieter life come flowing in.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get into the swing of prayer by offering your waking thoughts to God. It could be as simple as lying in your bed and saying, 'Thank you, God, for the night's rest, and the gift of living another day. Today, I belong to You.' Or it could be that you consciously pray to invite Him to be more and more at home in your heart so you want to spend more time with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frank Laubach wrote that he would pray every two or three minutes, 'Am I in Your will, Lord? Am I pleasing You, Lord?' Why not try such an approach today? Set yourself the goal of remembering at breakfast, lunch and tea to pray a similar prayer.&lt;/p&gt;

<alias><![CDATA[the-parental-promise]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Honour your father and mother.' Exodus 20:12 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sentence following the fifth commandment makes it stand out from the rest. As Paul points out in Ephesians 6:3 NLT, 'If you honour your father and mother, things will go well with you, and you will have a long life on the earth.' That's great, but this promise isn't to be taken on the cheap. Honouring your parents is much more than thinking nice things about them. Proverbs 19:20 NIV says, 'Listen to advice and accept instruction, and in the end you will be wise.' The extent to which the promise comes true in your life is reflected in the extent to which you take godliness on board. Fulfilling your domestic duties round the house while stealing from work will still land you in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your parents aren't perfect. But God still requires you to honour them. Sometimes this may be through gratitude for the great things they've done and sometimes through forgiveness for the way they've hurt you. No doubt about it, this can sometimes be the toughest possible call! But, think for a moment, are things going well for you? And if they aren't, it may just be that it's time to connect the dots! Could it have something to do with whether or not you are honouring your parents? And if you think that honouring them is impossible, just turn to the God who makes all things possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Heb 11:22, Gen 39:1-23, Gen 45:1-11, Gen 50:15-26&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56447&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Honour your father and mother.' Exodus 20:12 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you believe in Jesus Christ as your Saviour, a plethora of blessings become yours. In addition to the happiness of sins forgiven and full access to your Heavenly Father's goodness, there's other good stuff too. For one - you instantly gain a new family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus set a few people straight about families in what was probably a pretty awkward moment. Read it in Mark 3. His biological mum and brothers came asking for a quiet word. Then came a pertinent question. 'Who is My mother...?' (Mark 3:33 NLT) He answered, 'Anyone who does God's will is My brother and sister and mother.' (Mark 3:35 NLT) There's a different perspective on family if ever there was one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wasn't about brushing His dear mum aside. He still cared deeply about her (see John 19:25-27, for instance). It was about recognising His family as those who are properly committed to what His Father wants. Jesus wouldn't have treated the older women in His life any better or worse than His own mum. In Jesus' approach to family matters, the whole of God's family mattered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there an older person in your life that you haven't been respecting quite as they deserve? How can you put that right today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Ex 22-24, John 3:1-21, Ps 89:1-14, Pr 26:17-19&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56448&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Honour your father and mother.' Exodus 20:12 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you've got Christian parents, then thank God for them. If not, don't stop praying for God to save the people who've been entrusted with your care. But also recognise the most likely way they'll come to know Jesus will be you. And there's nothing more convicting than a good example of a son or daughter of God - &lt;em&gt;you &lt;/em&gt;are what they see of &lt;em&gt;Jesus&lt;/em&gt;. How they see Him will have more to do with the way you are with them, than the words you use to describe Him. If you rave on about how much God loves them but you can't find the time to do the chores you promised, you're losing points big time. Think of the words attributed to St Francis of Assisi: 'preach the Gospel at all times and if necessary use words.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, our parents should be setting a good example for us to follow - and making it easy to happily do as they say! But in the real world, parents are just as flawed as anyone else. God's command to honour them isn't dependent on whether you think they deserve it. The test will be when they ask you to do something that doesn't fit with your commitment to God. That's when you most need His help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pray for families who aren't Christians. How brightly are you shining as a son or daughter of God, and a witness to Jesus?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Ex 25-27, John 3:22-36, Ps 89:15-37, Pr 26:20-22&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56452&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['By your patience possess your souls.' Luke 21:19 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patience reminds us that our lives work on God's schedule, not our own: 'Patient endurance is what you need now, so that you will continue to do God's will. Then you will receive all that He has promised.' (Hebrews 10:36 NLT) He works from His own divinely considered all-knowing timetable. If you think about it, expecting your own homemade timetable to fit perfectly in line with God's is pretty silly. Who's seen what's going to happen tomorrow: you or the Author of life itself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So don't panic if God seems like He's on a go-slow - it's because He's making everything just right for you. If you know God has you where He wants you, but you start to feel itchy, don't be tempted to run on ahead of Him! Your impatience will just make you and everybody around you miserable. Patient endurance can mean honouring God in a situation when you'd far rather pack up and leave. He knows what He's doing - and, if He hasn't told you, that's probably for the (&lt;em&gt;your!&lt;/em&gt;) best!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you making up reasons to ignore what God has asked you to stick with? Take the time to pray for God's clear voice on the matter and if necessary, for faith to leave all your nagging doubts behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Ex 28-29, John 4:1-12, Ps 89:38-52, Pr 26:23-26&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56453&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Anger resides in the lap of fools.' Ecclesiastes 7:9 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it's complaining about people jumping the queue at your local take-out or sounding off about your mates behind their backs, the Bible says this, 'Fools vent their anger, but the wise quietly hold it back.' (Proverbs 29:11 NLT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's ok to share your feelings with those you trust and who aren't walking targets for anger. But think wisely about what you say and who you tell, because you don't want your words to bite back. For times when you feel like a flaming Bunsen burner, here's a tip: count your blessings, particularly the fact you have God, salvation, health, family, job - whatever fits. You can also get rid of some excess adrenaline by getting active physically rather than vocally. Obviously don't get physical with people - &lt;em&gt;word4U&lt;/em&gt; HQ is definitely not advocating headkicking! More like kicking a football around or taking a good long run. It's a good time to count those blessings and also helps clear your head to think rationally and handle things in a way you won't regret afterwards. And if you're anger prone, challenge yourself to learn a couple of Scriptures to grab from your mind when you need it most. Start with Proverbs 14:17 NLT - 'Short-tempered people do foolish things...'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Ex 30-32, John 4:13-26, Ps 100, Pr 26:27-28&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=56454&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'My people have...forsaken...the...living water and...dug...broken cisterns.' Jeremiah 2:13 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The search for contentment takes us to strange places. Sometimes we even use other people as a means to find peace of mind - as strange as that sounds. You might hear yourself saying, '&lt;em&gt;Oh, I&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;d be alright if I just got a boyfriend or girlfriend&lt;/em&gt;.' Well, every relationship goes through tough times. How would you feel then? What happens when they don't call when they say they will? Relationships aren't a cruise of contentment, and they definitely aren't to be used as a tool for reaching contentment. Because if you expect someone to provide you with contentment, you're setting them up for failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is, if you're looking for contentment that lasts, it's only found in Jesus. Paul had to learn this: 'I have learned, in whatever state I am, to be content. I can do all things through Christ, who strengthens me.' (Philippians 4:11-13 NKJ) The most humbling fact is that Paul wrote these words in (a pretty grim) prison. He wasn't writing it with his arm round a loved one. He realised the true value of things and people. They come and go. Loved ones die. The friendship of God is always with you.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Epaphroditus... ministered to my need.' Philippians 2:25 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The word &lt;em&gt;encouragement&lt;/em&gt; basically means to 'put in courage'. The roads of life are bumpy and full of potholes, and can cause rips and tears and punctures in our 'tyres'. Jesus knows exactly how it is - He walked the earth and plainly stated, '&lt;em&gt;each day has enough trouble of its own&lt;/em&gt;.' (Matthew 6:34 NIV) What better way to repair the damage to the tyres than to seal the holes with some encouragement?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But everybody's wired in their own unique way and will appreciate different mixes of encouragement: words of affirmation, spending quality time, receiving gifts, acts of service (yes, that's doing the dishes, cleaning the gross fish tank) and physical touch (a pat on the back, a solid handshake, a hug for a friend) are all ways of going about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the time to find out how best to encourage those people around you, and you might find it revolutionises your relationships. Have you noticed someone make a positive change in their life? Don't keep it to yourself, affirm them - it could be the thing that keeps them heading in the right direction. Hebrews 3:13 NIV says, '&lt;em&gt;...encourage one another daily, as long as it is called &quot;Today&quot;, so that none of you may be hardened by sin's deceitfulness.&lt;/em&gt;' Take up the challenge today - look at the people you have around you and ask God to help you be a useful encouragement to them when they need it. There is no greater calling!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Sam 27-31, Luke 6:1-16, Ps 122, Pr 17:18-21&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54144&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Faith comes from hearing the message... through the Word...' Romans 10:17 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;'And you were made for movement. You were made to participate in this movement of God. This is what you were born for. You were not born to live a small ordinary life of safe boundaries, tidy fences, you were made for more... You were made to go, to journey, to become the vanguard of God's purposes in this generation. To go to the forgotten places. To go to the forsaken. To be a herald, to be a witness, to be a prophet. To be a friend...'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt Wilson's book &lt;em&gt;Concrete Faith&lt;/em&gt; describes faith that's solid because it's grounded in the concrete realities of love, relationship and sacrifice. It's natural to run off the buzz of the initial excitement of God's calling on your life, but once that's gone, what's left is the difficult daily reality of life as a Christian, a journey filled with all the challenges that this life throws at you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you run the race, make sure your faith is grounded and concrete. The book of James is full of the same gritty reality of what faith in Jesus really looks like: '&lt;em&gt;If people say they have faith, but do nothing, their faith is worth nothing. Can faith like that save them? ...In the same way, faith by itself that does nothing - is dead&lt;/em&gt;.' (James 2:14,17 NCV) So put your faith into action. It's not just about hearing the Word but by acting on it. The moment you set your wheels in motion your faith springs to life, inviting God to move on your behalf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Ezra 3-5, Luke 10:1-12, Ps 78:1-8, Pr 19:21-23&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54710&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Everything I plan will come to pass...' Isaiah 46:10 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Families, friends and life experiences can create fears and limitations that hold us back. We go about life doing the best we can in this messy mixed up world in which we live, but if we're not careful we can allow these fears to take over. We can live by the labels put on us by others: 'not good enough, not up to the task, never make it, won't succeed'. Or we label ourselves: 'useless, worthless, a mistake'. These labels can cause us to live believing we don't matter, our life is irrelevant, and unimportant, and even that we are unwanted. Nothing could be further from the truth. God doesn't make mistakes. You're not here by accident! You &lt;em&gt;'are God'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;s masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so we can do the good things He planned for us long ago.'&lt;/em&gt; (Ephesians 2:10 NLT) '&lt;em&gt;I know the plans I have for you,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; says the Lord. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;They are plans for good and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope.&lt;/em&gt;'&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(Jeremiah 29:11 NLT) Don't live a life of fear! Instead, receive God's confident guaranteed hope for your life! He promises &lt;em&gt;'Everything I plan will come to pass...'&lt;/em&gt; Take off your labels. God is building a solid foundation under you so that you'll be able to handle the pressures that accompany His blessing, and go through the storms of life without being moved or shaken. Anything that's made well and worth having is made slowly and worth fighting for. Jesus gave His life for you - that's how much He thought of you. Why should you think less?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Ezra 6-8, Luke 10:13-24, Ps 78:9-16, Pr 19:24-26&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54711&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<title><![CDATA[Don't Be an Older Brother]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[dont-be-an-older-brother]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['... Son...all that I have is yours.' Luke 15:31 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;'&lt;em&gt;All these years I've worked hard for you and never once refused to do a single thing you told me to; and in all that time you never gave me even one young goat for a feast with my friends. Yet when this son of yours comes back after spending your money on prostitutes, you celebrate by killing the finest calf we have on the place.&lt;/em&gt;' (Luke 15:29-30 TLB)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This parable is part of a collection of lost items in Luke 15, in this case a lost son who comes back home, but it's the only one that doesn't get a happily-ever-after Hollywood ending. Instead, we're left with a seething self-righteous brother all knotted up with resentment. Not a great way to end up in one of Jesus' stories. By focusing on the older brother's bad attitude, Jesus was holding up a mirror to the religious faithful who chose resentment instead of rejoicing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's very easy to be more like the bitter big brother than the forgiving father. Watch out that you don't take all the glory if you have stayed on the straight and narrow path. It was a really good thing that the older brother stayed home - he was with his father and everything his father had was his. The guy was insanely blessed already - but over time, he'd become blind to the blessing. Remind yourself every day not to take God's blessing for granted. If you're already a Christian, you're already home with the Father and totally accepted by Him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Eph 1:1-4:16, Luke 6:17-26, Ps 137, Pr 17:22-23&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54146&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<title><![CDATA[Practise Pure Religion!]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[practise-pure-religion]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Pure... religion before God... is this...' James 1:27 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you tell your mate that you've become a Christian, they might dismiss it or say you've 'got into religion'. If they haven't walked away by then, you might have the chance to gently explain it's more about living relationship, not 'old-fashioned religion'. Yet were often so eager to distance ourselves from this boring old idea of 'religion' that everyone seems to picked up from the media, that we seem obsessed with showing how 'not religious' we are. 'Religion', as many think, is about what you can't or won't do (read:&lt;em&gt; the rules&lt;/em&gt;). But is 'religion' a bad thing altogether?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James describes it this way: '&lt;em&gt;...to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.&lt;/em&gt;' (James 1:27 NIV) The two parts of this verse show that it's not just about what we don't do, but just as importantly, it's about using all we've got to make a positive impact. Jesus said, '&lt;em&gt;Whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of Mine, you did for Me.&lt;/em&gt;' (Matthew 25:40 NIV) And when the Pharisees asked what the greatest commandment was, He gave two answers: '&lt;em&gt;Love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, and all your mind. This is the first and greatest commandment. A second is equally important: Love your neighbour as yourself.&lt;/em&gt;' (Matthew 22:37-39 NLT) So for Jesus, there wasn't much difference between loving God and loving people. So no more holy huddles - practice pure religion by reaching out and helping people in need in your community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Eph 4:17-6:24, Luke 6:27-36, Ps 79, Pr 17:24-26&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54147&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['All you need to say is simply &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;...' Matthew 5:37 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When does a good thing become 'too much'? You're helping out a friend-in-need, but it's starting to take the life out of you too... Or you're that person in trouble, and you aren't sure if your mates have got your back...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's verse is about clarity, and integrity. The passage it's taken from tells us not to swear oaths, but to be trustworthy by just our 'Yes' or 'No'. The same is true when we're dealing with people around us, especially if they're in a tough spot. If we don't give them a straight-up Yes or No when we're relating to them, we lack the integrity that we owe to them, and to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needing to be needed by needy people (try saying that three times quickly), puts the needy person in the driver's seat - and can quickly drive you over the edge. The more you do to make them feel less... whatever they feel... and make yourself feel less guilty, the more they might resent you for not giving as much as they think you should, and you end up in a double bind - neither of you able to break the cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognise yourself in there? If so, youre already moving toward a healthier, less toxic relationship. Over the next few days keep reading to dig a little deeper and, in the meantime, take a good look at your health levels - both you and your friends will be glad of your honesty. And if you're beating about the bush, make an effort to be honest (as well as gracious!) all day today. If you find a person or situation you struggle to be straight-talking in, it's time to start praying!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Sam 1:1-3:21, Luke 6:37-49, Ps 109:1-15, Pr 17:27-28&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54148&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['... its parts should have equal concern for each other.' 1 Corinthians 12:25 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;While you're taking a good look at the areas of your life that drain you, be careful not to leap back in horror and jump right to the other extreme. It's easy to start holding off your friends and class/work-mates like a madman with a bargepole. We were made for relationships, to live connected lives where we're known and understood by others. That means more than just showing off your best side. Intimacy means being vulnerable enough to let others in on the real you, including your less attractive bits. Our human nature can put up a '&lt;em&gt;Keep out, trespassers will be prosecuted!&lt;/em&gt;' sign as we try to protect ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be crazy terrifying to let someone in that close. We think, 'You can't hurt me if I keep you at a safe distance.' But God didn't design us to live in isolation. So when we're brave enough to reach out to others (whether that's God or other people), we'll find people can quickly grow from being polite acquaintances to true and meaningful friends (it sounds a bit like a &lt;em&gt;Neighbours&lt;/em&gt; theme, but it's true). When you draw close to God, it's from a place of trust and safety that He can say big things to you - things you might not want to listen to but He knows you need to hear. Reach out! You were created to give to others, and to receive what they have to give back to you. In giving you are fulfilled, and in receiving you are made complete. Anything less is just existing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Sam 3:22-7:17, Luke 7:1-10, Ps 109:16-31, Pr 18:1-3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54149&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['... Like a city with broken-down walls.' Proverbs 25:28 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychologists experimented with school children to see how they reacted when boundaries were taken away from their playground at break time. Normally they'd play happily, lining the fences and having fun. But when the fences were removed, the children huddled in the middle of the playground, anxious and insecure, not knowing what to do. Interestingly, when the fences were put back, the kids went back to happily playing and having fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sneaky as these experiments are, it shows that boundaries are actually an important part of understanding the freedom God wants for His children. They provide security, love and direction - things we need no matter how old we are. Ok, this all sounds good in theory, but how does it play out in the everyday?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be great and even liberating to say 'yes', but if you haven't learnt how to healthily say 'no', you can easily become &lt;em&gt;'like a city with broken-down walls&lt;/em&gt;.' You'll always be putting yourself out, only to find people taking advantage. You may well end up suffering from burnout, maybe even resenting the people you love. It's often the nicest people whose heart is in the right place that end up chasing around pleasing people, rather than pursuing what God wants for them. How are your boundaries looking? Do you see yourself as the pleasing-people character heading for burnout? You can't take charge of your own life while you're overwhelmed feeling responsible for other people's lives. Set some boundaries, and live the life God gave you to live!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Matt 5:8, Ps 24:3-6, 2 Pet 3:3-14, Ps 17:15&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54150&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['For I can do everything through Christ, who gives me strength.' Philippians 4:13 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create rigid boundaries and you'll miss out. Have no boundaries and you'll flip out. What's the solution? Flexible boundaries! The apostle Paul came to understand what this means. He was secure in His relationship with God and everything he did flowed out from what God wanted for him. '&lt;em&gt;I know how to live on almost nothing or with everything. I have learned the secret of living in every situation, whether it is with a full stomach or empty, with plenty or little. For I can do everything through Christ, who gives me strength.&lt;/em&gt;' (Philippians 4:12-13 NLT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that Paul uses the word &lt;em&gt;learned&lt;/em&gt; - getting to that point isn't something that happens overnight (we know it's sometimes hard to work out where God is leading!) God wants '&lt;em&gt;streams of living water&lt;/em&gt;' to spring out from you, but when you're doing everything based on pleasing other people (or just what seems right to you without checking it out with God), you'll end up drier than the Sahara and emptier than a... ... ...well, a very tired empty thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a deep well of God's strength available to you and it's found in His Word, as you let Him disciple you daily. He'll reshape you and teach you how to cope with anything that life throws at you. So go to Him for it, and give Him space to move in your life. Let Him build boundaries in you that enable you to adjust to circumstances. Then you'll be able to practise the principle, '&lt;em&gt;Bear one another's burdens...&lt;/em&gt;' (Galatians 6:2 NKJV), without over-functioning or being responsible for others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Sam 7:18-11:27, Luke 7:11-23, Ps 118:1-9, Pr 18:4-6&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54151&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Search me, O God, and know my heart...' Psalm 139:23 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of that mirror from &lt;em&gt;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&lt;/em&gt;. The wicked queen looked into it, asked who was the fairest of them all and got a reply along the lines of, 'Know that step-daughter of yours - the one without the tan?' The one you never really liked anyway? She's way nicer looking than you. Ignore any focus on external beauty and consider the real point here: &lt;em&gt;Snow White was also inwardly fair&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about you? If you're not making any progress spiritually, it could be time for a spiritual check-up. God loves it when we're honest with Him and when we ask Him to search our hearts. It's at that point He can step in and start to work with us. He's not going to force Himself on us, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first question asked in the Bible was: '&lt;em&gt;Where are you?&lt;/em&gt;' (Genesis 3:9 NIV) Adam and Eve had not long eaten the forbidden fruit and were feeling the shame of it all. God wasn't on a fact-finding mission - He knew all along! He was simply looking for honesty. There's no point us hiding behind the fig leaves of our good actions and smiling sweetly, when beneath it all we're dying. God wants you to live happy, healthy and whole, so have the courage to book yourself in for an examination with God. Use Psalm 139 as your spiritual health-check today: read through it and take the time to let God search you and highlight any improvements that need to be made in your heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Sam 12:1-14:20, Luke 7:24-35, Ps 118:10-18, Pr 18:7-9&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54152&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities...for Christ's sake...' 2 Corinthians 12:10 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever get a thought that makes you stop and say, 'Hmm, is that you, God?' Then you hear it again. By the time it comes onto your radar a third time, you just 'know in your knower' that it definitely &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; God and not just your brain stuck on one-track repeat. It was exactly the same with Paul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the middle of a tough situation, God said to Paul three times, '&lt;em&gt;My grace is all you need. My power works best in weakness.&lt;/em&gt;' (2 Corinthians 12:9 NLT) This is Paul - &lt;em&gt;the &lt;/em&gt;Paul - learning an important lesson. He wrote loads of the New Testament and faithfully served God evangelising Europe, and the guy still talked about having a 'thorn in his flesh' - a weakness that kept coming back over and over again. We don't know exactly what he was talking about, but we do know that it drove him towards Jesus. That's the important thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the ultimate example of power working best in weakness was Jesus was on the cross. At the same time, it's the most glorious and gracious moment in history. Jesus Himself prayed to God that if He was willing He would '&lt;em&gt;take this cup from [Him].&lt;/em&gt;' (Luke 22:42 NIV) It might be a paradox, but '&lt;em&gt;God blesses those who are poor and realise their need for Him, for the Kingdom of Heaven is theirs.&lt;/em&gt;' (Matthew 5:3 NLT) Bring your 'thorns' and your weaknesses to God, and ask Him to reveal how He can use them, and your current circumstances, for His Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Sam 14:21-17:13, Luke 7:36-50, Ps 118:19-29, Pr 18:10-12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54154&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Bring Me an offering...' Exodus 25:2 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;God is amazing! I'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;m so excited&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;!! &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;We were praying and God gave me a word that confirms He&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'s got a really exciting plan for my life!!! I just can'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;t wait to see what He'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;s going to do!!!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now while it's totally true God does have an exciting plan for your life, it's worth pointing out that He's also waiting to see what &lt;em&gt;you'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;re&lt;/em&gt; going to do. Whatever it is &lt;em&gt;you'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;re&lt;/em&gt; hoping to build - whether it's a relationship with that special someone, or a career or business - it'll require sacrifice. This train were on isn't about putting our collective feet up and expecting God to do all the hard work while we coast along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God asks us to bring an offering, and that doesn't mean simply dropping money onto the plate or into the velvet bag as it passes by on Sunday. It's about &lt;em&gt;'offering your body as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God - this is your spiritual act of worship.&lt;/em&gt;' (Romans 12:1 NIV) This means more than a praise party on a Sunday evening, it also means the attitude you wake up with on a Monday morning. Jesus Himself knew what it meant to offer everything to His Father when He said, '&lt;em&gt;It is finished&lt;/em&gt;,' from the cross (John 19:30 NIV). Make sure you can say the same as you give your life back to God and indicate to Him, just as Jesus did, what you are willing to sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Sam 17:14-19:43, Luke 8:1-15, Ps 123, Pr 18:13-16&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54227&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Make everything according to the pattern I have shown you...' Exodus 25:40 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Genesis 1, when God's creating the world, His comments range from 'good' to 'very good'. 'Good' might sound bland by today's use of the word, but this is God labeling something as properly 'good' - that carries a fair bit of weight! God is holy and perfect - so, for Him, excellence is just the way things are, and He wants the same from us and for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When instructing Moses on what He wanted the tabernacle to be made out of, you can tell by the quality of materials used that only the very best interested Him. Though God smiles on excellence, it doesnt mean He's into perfectionism. Edwin Bliss puts it like this: 'The pursuit of excellence is gratifying and healthy. The pursuit of perfection is frustrating, neurotic, and a terrible waste of time.' The worst bit about it is that nobody ever 'arrives' at 'perfection' through pursuing it. It's like that dream where you're running but you never arrive at that far-off point in the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excellence means always moving forward - but not stressing out if you've had a bad day as you journey with Jesus. It means not looking at how shiny and 'Christian' your mate's life looks and feeling bad about yours. That's a whole lot less pressure off you right there! Striving for excellence in our relationships with God involves spending time with Him and being open to His influence in our lives. So, if you suffer from perfectionism, make a conscious decision to give God your best and leave the rest with Him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Sam 20:1-22:30, Luke 8:16-25, Ps 133, Pr 18:17-20&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54228&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['... Go into all the world and preach...' Mark 16:15 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The word '&lt;em&gt;tabernacle'&lt;/em&gt; basically means '&lt;em&gt;tent of meeting&lt;/em&gt;' - it's worth digging around this one to see what it's about. We all know bricks and mortar don't make a house a home. Even if you bling up your church building, it's only worth looking at because it's a place to come together to worship God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tabernacle was a tent and not a permanent building because the Israelites were a people on the move. Peter says we're more like '&lt;em&gt;foreigners in the land&lt;/em&gt;' (1 Peter 1:17 NLT) - when you become a Christian, your true home is God's world, and an eternity of Heaven. Think of this life now as just a prequel, your own origin story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all relies on God living in you and making His home in your heart. Dont fall into thinking the church building is the only place where God lives: Dont you realise that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, who lives in you and was given to you by God? (1 Corinthians 6:19 NLT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure you get this: the '&lt;em&gt;tabernacle&lt;/em&gt;' is also your heart. You're in God, living-your-life-on-the-move with Him because He's in you. It's true! As you spend time with Jesus today, take advantage of the chance to welcome Him afresh and ask Him where He wants to go and who He wants to speak to through you. The last thing Jesus said to His disciples was, &lt;em&gt;'Go into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature&lt;/em&gt;.' That's why God tabernacles in your heart: so He can reach out to others through you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Sam 22:31-24:25, Luke 8:26-39, Ps 140, Pr 18:21-22&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54229&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I will give you...right desires...' Ezekiel 36:26 TLB&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freedom's something we all want. God wants us to be free too - in fact, His first three words to Adam in Genesis 2:16 NIV are, '&lt;em&gt;You are free...&lt;/em&gt;' So all is rosy so far, but have you blissfully switched off at that point and missed what else He's saying? If you don't hear the rest of the conversation, you'll miss the proviso that comes next. The next verse says, '&lt;em&gt;...but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die.&lt;/em&gt;'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul sheds more light on the whole issue of freedom in Galatians 5. At no point does he say that freedom means doing what you want, when you want, how you want. He shows us that sin is actually the opposite of freedom, where we keep on craving what's bad for us, wanting more and more until we die, whether that's in a spiritual, emotional or physical sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a paradox that goes against what the world considers to be freedom, but true freedom is actually found in self-control. The ancient philosopher Aristotle said that self-control was about 'feeling the right amount of pleasure at the right things to the right degree.' Too much pleasure is obvious to spot, like when you need to loosen your belt after gulping half a cheesecake. However pleasure in the wrong things sometimes requires more discernment. You need the Holy Spirit to help you decide between right and wrong in the choices facing you. With God's help, you can develop self-control, so that you will find more of the true freedom He wants you to experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Matt 5:9, Rom 12:17-21, James 3:17-18, 2 Ki 6:8-23&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54230&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[' In their hearts humans plan their course, but the Lord establishes their steps.' Proverbs 16:9 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going on a never-ending spiritual retreat to discover God's will for you might sound like a good idea, but there comes a point where you've got to start doing what He asks you to do. There's nothing wrong with making plans - after all, '&lt;em&gt;who would begin construction of a building without first calculating the cost to see if there is enough money to finish it?&lt;/em&gt;' (Luke 14:28 NLT) But you can't steer a stationary ship. The reality is that sometimes God's got a different (and always better, btw) plan for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God created us and wants us to go to Him with our requests and our plans and ask Him what He has to say, not just go steamrolling into a situation 'just because we can'. When everything you touch seems to be turning to gold (like you're walking on a cloud of marshmallows and a flock of bluebirds do your hair every morning and bring you breakfast in bed), self-confidence can easily creep in. So be careful: '&lt;em&gt;...you do not even know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes. Instead, you ought to say, &quot;If it is the Lord's will, we will live and do this or that.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;' (James 4:14-15 NIV) You may not always look where you're going, but you will always end up going where you're looking! David changed his perspective and prayed, '&lt;em&gt;My eyes are fixed on You...Lord...&lt;/em&gt;' (Psalm 141:8 NIV) You should pray that too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 2 Pet 1-3, Luke 8:40-56, Ps 146, Pr 18:23-24&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54232&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Call to Me and I will...tell you...things you do not know.' Jeremiah 33:3 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you feel lost in unfamiliar territory, uncertain as to what your next move should be? God uses such times to get your attention, call you back to Himself and encourage you to lean on Him. The disciples were in this situation: a storm was lashing at their boat and it was so bad that, although they'd been through heaps of gales, they genuinely feared for their lives. Two of the disciples were sent to the lower deck where Jesus was sleeping. '&lt;em&gt;Teacher, don't you care that we're going to drown?&lt;/em&gt;'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus coolly responds by calming the storm in one sentence, then asking two questions. (Go find it all in Mark 4:35-41. We'll be right here when you get back). The first question was about fear and the second about faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disciples learned through this storm something about who Jesus was. The storms you go through can be used for good, too, driving you closer to God. Jesus' questions to His disciples (&lt;em&gt;Why are you afraid? Have you no faith?&lt;/em&gt;) also show they hadn't grasped who was in control of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If God has pointed you in a particular direction, and you've obediently set off but stuff's just not happening, hold back on the complaining. It may be that part of your journey includes learning some lessons. Remember who He is and rest in the fact God knows what He's doing. As long as your hope is in anything other than God's unfailing love and goodness, you'll wrestle with uncertainty. What's the answer? '&lt;em&gt;...Their hearts are steadfast, trusting in the Lord.&lt;/em&gt;' (Psalm 112:7 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Nah 1-3, Luke 9:1-17, Ps 14, Pr 19:1-4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54559&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<title><![CDATA[Yes, He Still Heals]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[yes-he-still-heals]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...I am the Lord, who heals you.' Exodus 15:26 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you think God leaves the business of healing to doctors and hospitals these days. But wait. In the Bible, one of the names God chooses to be called by is &lt;em&gt;Jehovah Rapha&lt;/em&gt;, which means 'I am the Lord who heals.' God also says, '&lt;em&gt;...I am the Lord All-Powerful, and I never change&lt;/em&gt;.' (Malachi 3:6 CEV) And Jesus, who is God, is '&lt;em&gt;...the same yesterday and today and forever&lt;/em&gt;.' (Hebrews 13:8 NIV) What He was, He still is. What He did, He still does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when you or a loved one is sick, bear in mind that God, our loving Father, still heals today. If, however, you're praying your guts out and not seeing anything happening, it's not that you're doing anything wrong. The question of why our good God let bad things happen is thousands of years old - an entire book of the Bible, the Book of Job, is dedicated to it. It seems that God sometimes lets things happen for reasons hidden from us - but He makes us a promise: all things work together for good for those who love Him. He is still God and His love for us is constant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So. What's our part in the healing process? Give it to God. This doesn't mean just 'stop worrying', but actually deciding to trust Him to move. Jesus gives us guidance about how to pray: '&lt;em&gt;...All things for which you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and they will be granted you.&lt;/em&gt;' (Mark 11:24 NAS) When your prayer is lined up with God's will, healing is part of His gift of salvation to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Chr 10:1-12:22, Luke 12:22-34, Ps 119:25-32, Pr 20:25-27&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=55926&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I have learned how to be content with whatever I have.' Philippians 4:11 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;'&lt;em&gt;This too shall pass&lt;/em&gt;' is a great motto. If you're on top of the world, it keeps you grounded. If you're as low as you can go, it's a good way to remember that things won't always look as dark as they do now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often find ourselves reminiscing about the good times looking back on the happiest times of our lives. You might be wishing you were back home and not at uni/school/your job or vice versa. Maybe it's something that you're looking forward to just waiting &lt;em&gt;until&lt;/em&gt; something happens. Do your prayers just consist of: 'God, please get me out of here?'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While imprisoned, Paul had a strange and deep gratitude. Consider that for a second: back then, prisons were more like sewers and Paul was in there simply for preaching the Gospel. In spite of this, he was actually &lt;em&gt;thankful.&lt;/em&gt; From his cell, just before he wrote the amazing words above, he didn't moan about being in the slammer. Instead he wrote, '&lt;em&gt;Don't worry about anything; instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need, and thank Him for all He has done. Then you'll experience God's peace, which exceeds anything we can understand. His peace will guard your heart and mind as you live in Christ Jesus.&lt;/em&gt;' (Philippians 4:6-7 NLT) When you really seek God and His will for your life, God Himself will be your great reward. Everything else is just a bonus. In what area of your life do you need God's peace? He might change the situation, but your attitude might be the thing that needs to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Hab 1-3, Luke 9:18-27, Ps 65, Pr 19:5-8&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54560&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<title><![CDATA[It's Not about the Money, Money, Money? (1)]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[its-not-about-the-money-money-money-1]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['It is [God] who gives you the ability to produce wealth.' Deuteronomy 8:18 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Money. There are a bunch of songs we could quote to emphasise the subject, but consider yourself spared today. Whether finances float your boat or not, you'll be aware that money matters. Jesus spoke about money more than He did about Heaven and hell combined, and in fact more than anything else except the Kingdom of God. The reality is that despite all the references to money in the Bible we often find it a tricky topic to talk about: &lt;em&gt;Is wealth bad? How much should you give away? Is wealth a sign of God'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;s blessing? Do we act in faith first and trust the funds will follow, or is that trying to force God'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;s hand?&lt;/em&gt; These aren't easy questions with straightforward answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe there are deeper reasons Jesus talks about money because of what money can reveal about us. Surprisingly, those parables weren't really to do with earthly investments. He was using them to ask us what we value. Do we really need possessions to feel good about ourselves? Can we be ok with not fitting in? Who or what do we really rely on? What's our definition of treasure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the solution to our actual money stresses is a bit less spiritual, a lot more practical and is summed up by the word 'discipline'. Consider Paul's advice: '&lt;em&gt;I know how to live on almost nothing or with everything. I have learned the secret of living in every situation, whether it is with a full stomach or empty, with plenty or little. For I can do everything through Christ, who gives me strength.&lt;/em&gt;' (Philippians 4:12-13 NLT)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Tim 4-6, Luke 9:37-45, Ps 42:1-5, Pr 19:12-14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54561&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I am the Lord... who teaches you to profit...' Isaiah 48:17 NAS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of God's names is 'Jehovah Jireh' which basically means 'God will provide'. God's provision for you includes your brain and body. For most of us, it also includes the energy to go out and put in a shift at work. Up until the age of 30, Jesus Himself would have been a fully-fledged carpenter under the guidance of His earthly father, learning a trade and learning the (many) benefits of a hard day's work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Living to work' shouldn't ever be a lifestyle for a Christian, though God's provision means that we won't ever have orient our entire lives around employment, careers or the rat race. There might be a few cliches youve heard about God's provision, but some of them have lasted because they're true. 'Where God leads, God feeds!' reminds us that if were living for Him as a priority, all the secondary stuff, like finances, will fall into place. And just because God's provision might come through in a way we don't expect, scheduled and regular, that doesn't mean that it isn't His provision. Just say thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may want your financial provision to be nice and tidy, like uncooked spaghetti (bear with us for this metaphor) dropping straight from your employer's bank account to yours. But often it's more like cooked spaghetti, with a lot less pattern and predictability. Instead of asking what God's doing, ask yourself what you're doing. God will keep providing and in the process He'll be smiling as you put your faith in Him. One last cliche: when you've done your best, you've got to trust God with the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Tim 4-6, Luke 9:37-45, Ps 42:1-5, Pr 19:12-14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54563&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

Giving people your attention and your company is the best way of letting them know you value them - we all need to be appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus says this should be a no-questions-asked priority in our lives: '&lt;em&gt;...He has commanded us to love one another...&lt;/em&gt;' If obeyed, this command will have an astonishing effect on us. Jesus said: '&lt;em&gt;Give and you will receive. Your gift will return to you in full - pressed down, shaken together to make room for more, running over, and poured into your lap. The amount you give will determine the amount you get back.&lt;/em&gt;' (Luke 6:38 NLT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No excuses or procrastination: the best time to express your love is &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;! Why? Because no-one, but God, knows how long we have left here on earth. Sadly not all of us will live to a 'ripe old age'. Circumstances change; so use every opportunity to 'love one another' while it's still possible. Live a life of love, not one of regrets. The best use of life is love, the best expression of love is time, and the best time to love is now. Think about all your family and friends. Make plans today; get dates in your diary to spend quality time with those who youve been neglecting. Decide to live a life of love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Zeph 1-3, Luke 9:46-56, Ps 42:6-11, Pr 19:15-17&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54564&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['For we walk by faith, not by sight.' 2 Corinthians 5:7 NAS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever spent time searching for God on Twitter? Hunted in vain for His Facebook profile? Trying to get the lowdown on exactly what God is like, to know everything about Him? You don't just 'google' the Almighty...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll get frustrated if we ask God to hand us everything we want to know about Him, His plans, and our lives on a silver platter. That magic, wish-fulfilment god is not the one in the Bible - in fact, one prophet in the Bible went so far as to say: '&lt;em&gt;Truly, You are a God who hides Himself, O God of Israel, the Saviour.&lt;/em&gt;' (Isaiah 45:15 ESV) No wonder many people get annoyed when they try to find God and only discover silence - they've searched for evidence, facts and data; their approach has been more like trying to excavate an object than find a Person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God wants us to engage with Him, and wants His family to be people who seek Him. It's not about knowing dry, lifeless facts about Him. Learning to walk by faith means bridging the gap between what we see and what we can't see - not with knowledge, not with thoughts, not even with understanding: but simply by wanting God. Wanting God with your whole being - your mind, body, and spirit. A little prayer of 'Yes' to God to want Him above everything else, will result in so much more than anything the world can offer. Decide, right now, to make all your tomorrows a walk of faith. Invite Him into everything you do, at every step, and seek His leadership for your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Matt 5:10, 1 Thess 2:13-3:5, 1 Cor 4:11-13, Rev 6:9-11&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54565&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!' Mark 9:24 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;'&lt;em&gt;We walk by faith and not by sight&lt;/em&gt;.' Whether you sing songs about faith, say a hearty 'Amen!' to other people's prayers about it, or agree to it in theory, what is really meant by it? What does 'walking by sight' mean, anyway, and what's so wrong about it? Well, it's about guidance, and what - or who - we use as our GPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're less likely to question God's guidance when things are awesome. You feel amazing and the world recognises what a master basket-weaver you are. However when the rain's pouring down and the storms of life are getting wilder, then we can meet the enemy of faith: commonly known as &lt;em&gt;doubt&lt;/em&gt;. Then God's guidance becomes easier to question. Faith needs to kick in at the point where our natural instincts, thoughts and feelings come up against difficulties in relationships/health/stress/fill-in-the-blank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Mark 9:23, we read of a dad who had the same dilemma. He knew the power of God from the past, but his current circumstances made him question all of that as he started to trust what he could see: his little boy foaming at the mouth in pain. It was only when he was honest: '&lt;em&gt;I do believe, but help me overcome my unbelief&lt;/em&gt;' (Mark 9:24 NLT) that Jesus came through for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there something coming up that you're dreading? Be honest with God as you pray - trust that He knows exactly how you feel about it, but more than that, also has it under control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Ezra 1-2, Luke 9:57-62, Ps 46, Pr 19:18-20&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54567&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Open my eyes, that I may see...' Psalm 119:18 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Astronomers think the centre of the Milky Way is home to a supermassive black hole called Sagittarius A*. If it's there and on schedule, it'll be devouring a colossal gas cloud as you read this issue of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;word4U2day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Then it'll spend the rest of its life snacking on our galaxy's space debris and asteroids, hungrily swallowing anything that comes near.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not exactly the most comforting thought, is it? How much more reassuring is it to be a Christian with an insight into a deeper reality - knowing the centre of our universe is a Person, not a thing! The centre is a strong and kind Creator with our best interests in mind, and a good plan for humanity. It's true! The warm heart of reality is a Creator longing for relationship with His creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But often we don't act like this is for real. We don't live like it's true for those around us. And we don't live like it's true for us, at the core of our beings. The way some days go, there may as well be a hungry black hole at the centre of our lives. Do your eyes need to be opened? Are you just 'getting by' from day to day? Do you order your life in the light of the fact there is an active, powerful God working in you and those around you? Perhaps you've let that fact grow stale. Well, today is the day to start seeing things as they really are again. Ask the Holy Spirit to open your eyes so you can see the whole picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Ezra 9-10, Luke 10:25-37, Ps 78:17-31, Pr 19:27-29&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54712&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<alias><![CDATA[i-believe-in-angels]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['... Some people have welcomed angels as guests, without even knowing it.' Hebrews 13:2 CEV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sceptics tend to think the Christian belief in God is weird. And those baby cherubs and sweet-looking angels are just tacked-on religious sentiment. Well, don't let your mind neutralise your faith, just because a few artists got carried away with some pretty faces. Angels are majestic enough to inspire fear. (They often start conversations with: 'Don't be afraid.') An angel shut the mouths of lions for Daniel (see Daniel 6:22). An angel opened prison doors for Peter, saving him from execution (Acts 12:7). An angel showed up in a storm to let Paul know that he'd survive a shipwreck (Acts 27:23).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angels aren't entertaining sidekicks in a Bible episode, they're part of God's real-world promise for your life. &lt;em&gt;'For He will order His angels to protect you wherever you go&lt;/em&gt;.' (Psalm 91:11 NLT) A team of divine servants of God have been sent to assist us as we walk with God. '&lt;em&gt;Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?&lt;/em&gt;' (Hebrews 1:14 NIV) They're part of God's promise for your everyday life. God's secret service is on the case! They're not sitting on their hands claiming a Jobseeker Allowance somewhere in Heaven, but out on active duty. Now, they're extremely clear they don't want us to pay much attention to them - as any good servant does, they'd rather point to their Master. They want God to get the glory. Isn't it encouraging to know God is with us and His angels surround us every day to help us in times of danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Jn 1:1-3:10, Luke 10:38-42, Ps 78:32-39, Pr 20:1-3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54713&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['If we have enough...let us be content.' 1 Timothy 6:8 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;'If only I...' This simple phrase, repeated regularly, holds the key to lasting discontent. No matter how good your life is now, no matter how God has blessed you in the past, 'If only I...' brings it all crashing down, making you feel like you've got nothing worth having.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul had this all sorted. He said, '&lt;em&gt;I have learned how to be content with whatever I have&lt;/em&gt;.' (Philippians 4:11 NLT) And Ben Franklin agreed, writing: 'Contentment makes poor men rich, and discontent makes rich men poor.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contentment is found by leaning on your Creator. Your Father knows what you need, and He will provide for you - if you lean on Him. So how does contentment come about? First, &lt;em&gt;seek Him.&lt;/em&gt; Make it a daily choice. We really need to come to the place where we know that having more materially won't make us happier. The only permanent fix for this is to replace our desire for more stuff with a desire for more of God. Often this means simplifying your life, stripping away unnecessary things. Then&lt;em&gt;, say it.&lt;/em&gt; Say, 'I have enough' every time that you're faced with the temptation to say 'If only I...'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus on eternity and let enough be enough. Whenever you are about to buy something new, ask God: 'Lord, how can I use this for you?' Lastly, &lt;em&gt;settle it&lt;/em&gt;. Don't set your heart on any other riches than that of the knowledge and love of God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Jn 3:11-5:21, Luke 11:1-13, Ps 78:40-55, Pr 20:4-6&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54715&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['What do you think about...Christ?' Matthew 22:42 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day Jesus took Peter, James and John to the top of a mountain. And there Jesus began to glow with dazzling light and two famous people from Jewish history suddenly popped into view. 'Moses and Elijah appeared and began talking with Jesus... Peter...blurted out, &quot;Master...Let's make three shelters as memorials - one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.&quot;' (Luke 9:3033 NLT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might have expected Peter to come out with something like this. He wanted to honour the miraculous appearance of Moses and Elijah - giants of the faith and heroes of history - and give them the respect due to them. From his point of view, their discussion with Jesus meant that the three most significant champions in the entire history of the world were in the same spot together. No wonder he came across all tongue-tied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But his thinking was wrong. This was the moment Peter and the other disciples started to learn just how different and high-above-all Jesus is. Three memorials would have made Moses and Elijah equal with Jesus. Right then, Jesus started to lift the veil on the truth - He is wholly, solely, thoroughly and altogether God, and that first place belongs to no-one else. The penny dropped for the disciples. Has it dropped for you yet? On that mountaintop, God said, '&lt;em&gt;This is My Son, whom I have chosen; listen to Him.&lt;/em&gt;' (Luke 9:35 NIV) Are you listening to Him and Him alone? If He isn't yet the Lord of all your life, perhaps it's time to make that decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Jn 1:1-14, Matt 4:12-16, Matt 5:14-16, Acts 9:1-19&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54716&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['You are My servant; I have chosen you.' Isaiah 41:9 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fully grown elephants can grow to weigh over five tonnes. How on earth did circus trainers in the old days keep them smashing through every fence and escaping? The answer was not by building a stronger cage but by controlling its thinking - they would begin with the baby elephant and tie it to a wooden post secured in the ground. Because it was not yet very strong, it was unable to pull out the post. It would try and try but never succeed. And before too long it would give up trying. The elephant grew older and stronger but its thinking was locked tight. 'Elephants never forget' is a famous saying and it's pretty accurate. The elephant continued to believe that whenever it was tied to a post, it couldn't get away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are not much different. Things we were told or taught when we were very young can continue to hold us back and keep us tied to one spot. Many of us have been told we'll never amount to much - someone has sneered that we haven't got what it takes to go to uni, follow our dreams or succeed in reaching a longedfor goal. So we never really try. Or we're become convinced we're not worth anyone's time or love. Overcoming this 'post' is not impossible! Believe God. Trust Him. He says: 'You are My servant; &lt;em&gt;I have &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;chosen you&lt;/em&gt;...do not fear, for &lt;em&gt;I am with you&lt;/em&gt;...&lt;em&gt;I will strengthen you and help you.&lt;/em&gt;' (Isaiah 41:910 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So pray that God, who has chosen and committed Himself to you, will break any unwanted ropes and wooden posts holding you back from the life He wants for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Chr 1-2, Luke 11:14-28, Ps 78:56-64, Pr 20:7-10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=54718&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<title><![CDATA[Proud of Your Parents?]]></title>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Parents are the pride of their children.' Proverbs 17:6 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Come again?&lt;/em&gt; Yep.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Today, we're zoning in on the Biblical idea that children should honour their parents. Families are important to God. God can use any family member to bless, teach or correct any other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ever end up with children of your own, you'll realise how challenging it can be to be a parent. It starts off with a shock as normal life is interrupted by an insatiable infant and months of broken sleep. Then it gets worse! Instilling strong values and good character into kids, tweens and teens isn't easy. It's a daily challenge to lay out firm boundaries while assuring them they are loved. Building character and encouraging them to go for all God has in store for them means being constantly alert. In short: it's hard work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to honour your parents - those who mothered and fathered you. God blesses us for it. (Ephesians 6:2) Perhaps you should honour them through thanks, or perhaps through forgiveness. Most often it's both! Some of us have had a really hard time with mum or dad. If your parents weren't the role models God asked them to be, or hurt you some way, leave room for God to deal with them by leaving your anger and bitterness in His hands. If you can, try to see the best in them today, not excusing them but forgiving them. Excusing lets them off the hook but forgiving lets you off! How can you honour your parents in a special way today? Write a letter, make a call, send a text. Tell them (or whoever has helped to raise you well) that you're really thankful for who they are and what they do for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Chr 7:20-9:44, Luke 12:13-21, Ps 119:17-24, Pr 20:22-24&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=55925&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<title><![CDATA[Fear's Foothold]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[fears-foothold]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Do not fear, for I am with you.' Isaiah 41:10 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The words 'fear not', 'do not fear' or 'do not be afraid' appear hundreds of times in the Bible, all the way from Genesis to Revelation. Why is that? Because God knows fear can be such a huge part of human life, and how easily we can move from fearless to fearful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As babies, we didn't know what fear was. But when we learned after a few bumps and tumbles, some of us never recovered. Fear has stuck with us since. It's a constant companion God wants us to send away permanently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't let fear keep you inside your comfort zone and minimise what God's done for you. Don't let fear steal the freedom you have in Christ. The good news is, if you're living in Him, fear will never be able to get a proper foothold! It may try to sneak its toe in the door but, if you let the knowledge God cares for you sink in, it enables Him to unhook fear's toehold, slam the door on it and also set you free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can live fearlessly. That doesn't mean you'll never be afraid, simply that you won't let fear control the way you think and act. Some fear is good - but when caution keeps us in check, never ever taking a risk, then our lives are really shaped by a worry about what will happen if we take that risk. The negative thoughts and unexamined anxieties keeping you behind bars are faulty feelings God wants to remove from your life. Let Him do that today. Remember: '&lt;em&gt;Do not fear, for I am with you&lt;/em&gt;.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Chr 3:1-4:23, Luke 11:29-44, Ps 78:65-72, Pr 20:11-14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=55922&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I will uphold you with My...right hand.' Isaiah 41:10 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;What right do we have &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to fear? When the rest of the world quakes in its boots at the latest financial crash or pandemic, and friends grumble through another personal crisis, what makes us so different? What's your get-out-of-fear-free card?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have a reason not to fear. And it is very simply this: the presence of your Father. A Father who thinks of you dearly, and counts you as one of His own protected children. Through thick and thin, ebb and flow, illness and health, you have the companionship and care of the universe's greatest 'Wingman'. You can lie in a hospital bed and, even there, praise the God who heals. You can draw on strength, especially when you feel weak, withered and battered down inside. You can resist the enemy even when you feel defeated - remember, God commanded the Israelites to fight huge nations and armies with just a handful of warriors. Why? Because God's greater strength would win the day (see Deuteronomy 20:19), but any large army full of fearful hearts would hold back from His awesome seeminglyimpossible destiny for them. '&lt;em&gt;...Is anyone afraid or fainthearted? Let him go home so that his fellow soldiers will not become disheartened too.&lt;/em&gt;' (Deuteronomy 20:8 NIV) God knows that when you allow fear to rule your heart, it's fatal, not only for you, but to those around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let today be the day you lift your head and raise your hopes. Go out and share your confidence, knowing '&lt;em&gt;the Lord your God...will be with you.&lt;/em&gt;'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Chr 4:24-5:26, Luke 11:45-54, Ps 119:1-8, Pr 20:15-18&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=55923&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['When you are tempted, He will...provide a way out.' 1 Corinthians 10:13 NIV &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bible makes no promise of total freedom from temptation. But if you are faithful to God, He promises there will always be an EXIT sign leading away from the sin you're considering. '&lt;em&gt;The temptations in your life are no different from what others experience. And God is faithful...He will show you a way out so...you can endure&lt;/em&gt;.' (1 Corinthians 10:13 NLT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God will always provide a way out for His beloved children, but that means we have to choose to take it. And it &lt;em&gt;doesn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;t &lt;/em&gt;mean we have a licence to keep going back. Think of the finale of &lt;em&gt;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&lt;/em&gt;! (*Mahoosive Spoiler Alert*) Indy's love interest has just toppled into a chasm which opened up when she tried to remove the Holy Grail from its temple. Indy grabs her hand to stop her falling into the abyss. Then she spots the Grail resting on a ledge just within reach. Moments away from rescue, she chooses to grasp towards the treasure... and loses her grip on Indy's hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your Saviour's pulling you out of some compromising situation you've got into, stay very close to Him! Don't lose your grip on your His hand. And - don't try to reach for some forbidden fruit on the way out. It might hurt, it might not be what you want, but it is absolutely for your best. If you're faithful to God, you've no reason to be scared of temptation. When it shows up, look for the promised EXIT sign and take it, boldly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Chr 6:1-7:19, Luke 12:1-12, Ps 119:9-16, Pr 20:19-21&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=55924&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['... Speaking the truth in love...' Ephesians 4:15 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your loose-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;tongued best friend has spent the last ten minutes laying out every bit of dirt on the love life of someone you both know. It was embarrassing, hilarious, and just a little bit malicious. This isn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;t the first time it&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;s happened&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;, and the gossip is starting to leave an ugly taste in your mouth...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over to you. Is it time to wade in, or hold off?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your mate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;s unlimited broadband means he&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;s getting the newest films in the comfort of his bedroom before they&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;re even showing at the cinema. Not to mention any music his iPod desires. All without paying a cent. Even though he says it&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;s not hurting anyone, your conscience is beginning to differ...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And back to you. Is it time to wade in, or hold off?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to be careful to choose the right time to do this, but sometimes loving someone requires confronting them for their own good. If it involves a destructive habit, something that's illegal or a situation that could hurt them, it's important not to turn a blind eye. The Bible offers amazing wisdom on how to tackle this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are two examples: (1) 'Love is not rude.' It doesn't use an aggressive, heavy-handed approach. What is said is spoken with kindness. (2) 'Love is not self-seeking.' It forgets about needing to be accepted and liked, or to score 'holy points' off the other person. Instead it makes sure their wellbeing is the main priority. If you're in this sort of situation today, pray for God's Holy Spirit to speak through you with wisdom and tact, so that the truth comes out in love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Exodus 16:1-18, John 6:1-15, John 6:25-40, 1 Cor 11:23-24&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=55927&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Lift up your eyes and look to the heavens...' Isaiah 40:26 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where do you stand on the debate? Some of the world's finest minds are determined to persuade you the planet you live on, the body you inhabit, the brain you are using to understand this sentence, were all just happy accidents. That you, me, all of us are just the product of a moment in time that went very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very well. Oops! Our mistake! We underestimated those &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt;'s by a hundred or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible couldn't be more clear that the universe itself is not a mistake. Neither is it the result of accident nor blind chance. It's the work of a very purposeful Creator: '&lt;em&gt;Lift your eyes and look to the heavens: Who created all these? He who brings out the starry host one by one, and calls them each by name. Because of His great power and mighty strength, not one of them is missing.&lt;/em&gt;'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, surprising as this may be, the particular copy of &lt;em&gt;word4U2day&lt;/em&gt; you happen to be holding was not the result of an explosion in a printing press (or a server somewhere, internet friends). No, if there's a book, then there must be a publisher. If there's a building, there must be an architect and builder. If there's a work of art, there must be an artist. If there's a website, there must be a designer.&lt;/p&gt;

<title><![CDATA[Waiting for a Relationship?]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[waiting-for-a-relationship]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'...we belong to each other.' Ephesians 4:25 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right at the beginning of the Bible, we read, 'And God saw that it was good.' Then there comes a 'not good.' 'The Lord God said, 'It is &lt;i&gt;not good&lt;/i&gt; for the man &lt;i&gt;to be alone...&lt;/i&gt;' (Genesis 2:18 NIV) Yep, God has made us for relationship and He says such companionship is 'good'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about those of us who are still waiting for a relationship? Three wise things to do: (1) &lt;i&gt;Be the kind of partner you seek:&lt;/i&gt; dedicated to God; pursuing wisdom; generous; hopeful. Like attracts like. (2)&lt;i&gt; Reach out to others.&lt;/i&gt; 'Do not be interested only in your own life...be interested in...others.' (Philippians 2:4 NCV) There are no perfect relationships, or risk-free ones. You can guard your heart, and at the same time see what people need and strive to bless them. Blessing others eventually brings blessings back! And (3) &lt;i&gt;Pray for your future partner. &lt;/i&gt;Even if you haven't met him or her yet. Pray that God will bring His good things into their lives - including you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, an important note! Some of us are given a different calling - set aside for special use, which means God's plan for us doesn't include marriage or a mate. It's not always easy, but there are some pretty powerful examples of faithful unmarried servants of God. Paul's a bit of a legend, (1 Corinthians 7:1-10), and he certainly shows that we don't need to be married to be powerful for God! Whatever your future holds, if it's in God, you'll know Love.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness...' Matthew 5:6 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are you hungry for? What do you thirst for? Jesus says that if you're hungry for the right things, for righteousness itself, then you'll be filled. He is promising that the bad stuff of the world-as-we-know-it is going to be sorted out. And in the meantime, if what propels you through life is righteousness, and if you know God - who is righteousness and floods every place where He's honoured with it - well then, how supremely happy you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In John 4, Jesus came across a woman at a well who wanted to satisfy her deepest desires (she had married five times!) but was constantly left dissatisfied. Jesus used the situation to highlight her need for real satisfaction. It's the same offer He makes to us today. You were made for Him, and nothing else in life will satisfy like He will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satan loves to whisper in our ear that we won't be satisfied until we've got the qualification, the love of our life, the job, the house, the car. The truth is that Jesus is enough. Our righteousness is actually found in Jesus, walking as He walked. When we live in His power, we can live so much higher than our sense of not-good-enough-ness. That's what it means when it says in John 1:17 NAS, '&lt;em&gt;For the Law was given through Moses; grace and truth were realised through Jesus Christ.&lt;/em&gt;' With the help of the Spirit of the Lord, your attitudes and behaviours can change. When you hunger and thirst for righteousness, you become more and more like Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.' Matthew 5:7 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, &quot;&lt;em&gt;Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?&quot; Jesus answered, &quot;I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times&lt;/em&gt;.&quot;' (Matthew 18:21-22 NIV) This statement is quite sobering, especially when people may have hurt us really badly, many times! The point Jesus was trying to drive home is that it's vital to forgive. Just after Jesus taught His disciples how to pray by giving them the Lord's Prayer (read it for yourself in Matthew 6:9-13). He clearly states that '&lt;em&gt;if you refuse to forgive others, your [heavenly] Father will not forgive your sins&lt;/em&gt;.' (Matthew 6:15 NLT) If you find giving grace to those who 'trespass against you' easy, then how supremely happy you are. If you don't, you've just found something to pray for God to give you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is 'being merciful' such a big deal? Well, it's not just about receiving forgiveness from God, but also about the state you've got into. Lewis B. Smedes says, 'When you release the wrongdoer from the wrong, you cut a malignant tumour out of your inner life. You set a prisoner free, but you discover that the real prisoner was yourself.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're not torturing the wrongdoer when you hold back forgiveness, but yourself. Is there anyone who has wronged you and hasn't apologised, but you know you still need to forgive? Release them and be blessed. God has promised you justice, so leave it in His hands. In fact, the only people you should consider getting even with are those who've helped you.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Blessed are the pure in heart...' Matthew 5:8 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you went to the doctor and were told you had coronary heart disease, you'd want to do something about it, fast. The root of the problem could be high cholesterol from a bad diet, or a lack of exercise, or years of neglecting your health. Well, spiritually, we can be just the same. Do you need a health check? Does your spiritual diet consist of the odd binge followed by weeks of starvation? Or are you just going through the motions, but not actually pushing yourself and getting any fitter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'd think we'd come up with a different story by now, but guess what? Yup, it's &lt;em&gt;all about relationship&lt;/em&gt;. If your heart is pure, if you have nothing in your spiritual life coming between you and the King of Righteousness, then how blessed you are! Today's verse finishes with '&lt;em&gt;...for they will see God.'&lt;/em&gt; (Matthew 5:8 NIV) Want to see Him? To actually meet Him? Pray for a right heart as soon as possible!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you react when you're feeling the pressure? What's your response when you're criticised or ignored? Are you still harbouring a grudge from weeks ago?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer to these kinds of questions will indicate where you're really at. Anyone can play a part at church for a couple of hours on Sunday, but God's interested in the other 166 hours of the week. When your heart is purified, your eyes will be clear to see God in all sorts of people, places and situations. So spend some time worshipping God, just simply to be with Him.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Blessed are the peacemakers...' Matthew 5:9 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Albert Einstein won the Nobel Peace Prize for physics in 1921 and was clearly a very clever guy. In one of his lectures in 1948, he commented on the threat of nuclear warfare: 'It is not a physical problem, but an ethical one. What terrifies us is not the explosive force of the atomic bomb, but the power of the wickedness of the human heart - it's explosive power for evil!'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all want peace. So why do countries wage war on each other, why do families break down, why can't we seem to love our neighbour as ourselves, just like Jesus so simply commanded? Einstein nailed it when he talked about the wickedness of our hearts. The reality is that our hearts are selfish and, out of that sinful heart, flows all sorts of evil. And that's what causes the wars that rage within ourselves. Do you know someone who seems to be amazingly gifted in bringing peace to arguments? How supremely happy it is to be that person! They seem to carry God's presence with them wherever they go! '&lt;em&gt;...for they will be called sons of God.&lt;/em&gt;'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as nuclear weapons will wreak destruction in the wrong hands, our tongues too can be used as weapons of war, whether it's shooting down peoples reputations with a sarcastic response, or spreading gossip behind their backs. Instead, we can be peacemaker in our everyday lives and see God transform our surroundingSoulFood: 1 Sam 24–26, Luke 5:27–39, Ps 110, Pr 17:15–17&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake...' Matthew 5:10 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final Beatitude! And here, at the end of it all, Jesus is saying it's a good thing when you get a hard time for doing the right thing?! Doesn't really sound like a great incentive, does it? But that's the topsy-turvy right-side-up Kingdom Jesus came to establish that goes in the opposite direction to the rest of the world. The life that Jesus lived was all about doing the right thing despite the (considerable) cost. Just look at the cross. Are you getting a hard time at school/uni/work, or anywhere, for being a Christian? Then you're walking the same path Jesus walked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;em&gt;are &lt;/em&gt;getting shot at by the arrows of the enemy, if times are hard because others think your faith is nonsense: &lt;em&gt;you are blessed&lt;/em&gt;. You. Are. Blessed. How supremely happy it is to be you! No, really! Jesus is standing right next to you and promising you His Kingdom, forever, and for right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the centre of all of Jesus' teaching while He was up the side of this mountain was '&lt;em&gt;taking up your cross daily&lt;/em&gt;', which meant dying to yourself and choosing the right thing. A great reward awaits you if you do. Without God's power in our lives, these Beatitudes can seem too awkward and costly to weave into the fabric of our every day. But He will be faithful if you ask Him for the power, mercy and grace to make the Beatitudes a reality in your life.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Blessed are the gentle...' Matthew 5:5 NAS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being gentle doesn't mean being weak. When you were a baby, your parents' arms were the strongest things you knew, but they never squeezed you anywhere near as hard as they could. They weren't weak, they were &lt;em&gt;gentle&lt;/em&gt;. Gentleness isn't about the amount of strength you have; it's the amount of strength you &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt;. We're talking about power under restraint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Back to the Future&lt;/em&gt;, it takes Marty McFly three whole films to understand this. He learns that punching someone's lights out when someone calls him 'chicken' doesn't do anyone any favours. Punching someone's lights out, either with your fists or with your words, is the weak option. The reality of living in an imperfect world means that most of us need to choose gentleness on a regular basis. For those who find it easy to be gentle to people how 'supremely happy' it is to be you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meekness can be summarised by three S's: &lt;strong&gt;s&lt;/strong&gt;ensitivity, &lt;strong&gt;s&lt;/strong&gt;urrender and &lt;strong&gt;s&lt;/strong&gt;ubmission. It's about being sensitive to God and to other people to make sure were not just a freight train smashing through people's lives. It's about surrendering and letting go of our own bad ways, thoughts and habits and instead choosing to go God's better way. And it's about accepting God's bigger picture, and embracing the fact that you're not the star of the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Blessed are those who mourn...' Matthew 5:4 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life's full of difficult questions and perplexing circumstances and we're often left with 'whys', 'what ifs' and 'maybes'. Sometimes, the paracetamol of a quick prayer in a ministry time isn't enough to ease the pain of the grief we can feel when, for instance, we've suffered the loss of a close relative. The loss of a dream, or even a closed door, can be difficult too. So why is Jesus saying that &lt;em&gt;you'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;re blessed when you mourn&lt;/em&gt;? That doesn't sound quite right!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tough lesson God wants us to learn is for Him to be our everything. Job and Joseph are examples of people who suffered massive loss, but came through it all, and still recognised God as Number One. Job 22:23 NLT says: '&lt;em&gt;If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored...&lt;/em&gt;' God will not only heal you but teach you valuable lessons through it. Even though its a painful road to walk down, '&lt;em&gt;weeping may go on all night but in the morning there is joy&lt;/em&gt;.' (Psalm 30:5 NLT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; saying He wanted your loss. He is saying that if you're in that place, you're not alone in the darkness, He is with you. He is the most experienced, most loving, most perfect comforter ever, and in that place of deepest darkness you may find yourself closer to Him than at any other time in your life. &lt;em&gt;'Blessed&lt;/em&gt; are those who mourn, for they &lt;em&gt;shall&lt;/em&gt; be &lt;em&gt;comforted&lt;/em&gt;.' If you feel like you're in the tears of the night, turn to God, and trust that His peace is on its way in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Bearing with one another...' Colossians 3:13 NAS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy one of the clothing bargains from the sale rail that turns out to be bad quality and you're likely to find there's a clause in the purchase - no refunds. Why not? Because you bought it 'as is'. It's like that with us. God loved us 'as is', came to us when we were at our worst, and didn't turn back. And He bears with us now, even though He sees the darkest pit of thoughts in our heads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can He be so patient? Leslie Weatherfield wrote, 'Another strange thing about Jesus. He has the power to see below the surface into the very depths of the heart. He sees the seeds of lovely flowers where others see only the ugly brown soil that hides them. It is not so true to say that He loves the unlovable as to say that in every one He sees something lovable.' If He's put His spirit in you, then He won't abandon what He's started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about our attitude to other Christians? Even (especially) the less-than-lovable types? Is it our aim to fix others, or wait for them to start behaving the way we want? If someone does wrong to us, do we avoid them and write them off? That's not God's attitude. Jesus reminds you should love (yep, he said &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt;) them 'as is'. The Colossian church was told to, '&lt;em&gt;Get along with each other, and forgive each other. If someone does wrong to you, forgive that person.&lt;/em&gt;' (Colossians 3:13 NCV) Next time you find yourself thinking negatively of someone, start to look for the good in them that Jesus sees.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Loose him, and let him go.' John 11:44 KJV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We love coming back to the story of Lazarus because it's such a great model of what Jesus does to bring us new life. Today is the first day of the rest of your life, so to speak, a time to leave the disappointments and hurts of the past in the past. Let this story stay with you as you cross from one stage of life to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covered in embalming fluid and draped in linen, Lazarus stumbles out of the tomb and finds himself in daylight. 2 Corinthians 5:17 says, '&lt;em&gt;If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new&lt;/em&gt;.' We leave behind the murky tomb of sin where we've been buried, and breathe fresh air, new life. We have the choice to write off our history as God already has and start again with a clean slate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice Jesus has to tell the disciples to '&lt;em&gt;loose [Lazarus], and let him go&lt;/em&gt;' because the grave clothes dont just fall off him the minute Jesus speaks to him. The principle here is that Christ has made you alive from the inside out. Jesus has made you a new creation from the inside now it is your turn to loose yourself of the things that will trip you and stop you from walking. So stop and think. Identify what has tripped you up: negative influences and thought patterns, low self-esteem, old habits, destructive relationships. Now confess it to God and loose them off. With help from His Word, make a plan to live in a new way.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Blessed are the poor in spirit...' Matthew 5:3 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Sermon on the Mount&lt;/em&gt;, who does God consider 'blessed'? This basically means supremely happy. You might find it surprising. Right before we start, note that Jesus isn't simply giving us instructions - He's talking about people who &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; find themselves in these situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'&lt;em&gt;Supremely happy are the poor in Spirit&lt;/em&gt;' ...what? Jesus isn't talking about having low self-esteem. (Actually both arrogance and an unhealthily low self-esteem are both really about &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;.) Jesus is talking about a genuine humility that sees God as Saviour and recognises our desperate need for Him. In other words: 'if you feel weak, if you lack confidence, if you know you need to turn to God for whatever reason, how good it is to be you!' However life and other people make you feel, if you're right with God, you are blessed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be supremely happy, keep your focus on what matters and live for what lasts. Each winter in Kemi, Finland, you can visit a sprawling ice castle that features a theatre, a playground, an art gallery and a chapel. The castle walls are 4 metres high and stretch for over 500 metres. The chapel is a popular wedding venue and the theatre can seat 3,000 people. In it rock concerts, musicals, modern dance and opera recitals have been held. The problem is, its upkeep costs millions of dollars and, each year, it all melts in the spring. Do you get the idea? Focus on what lasts, not on what doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'God has surely listened and has heard my prayer.' Psalm 66:19 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;History proves that much prayer results in much blessing; and little prayer, little blessing. John Wesley was instrumental in changing the spiritual climate of Britain. In the 18th Century, enormous crowds gathered to hear his open-air preaching, with many encountering the person of Jesus for the first time. His efforts founded the Methodist movement, which has since spread worldwide. All without the help of ticket promoters, cars, phones, TV appearances, anything. His fuel: &lt;em&gt;prayer&lt;/em&gt;. He said, 'I have so much to do that I must spend several hours in prayer before I am able to do it.' Much prayer, much blessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 500 years ago, a little known German monk lost patience with a greedy and ungodly Church. His bullet-pointed criticisms spread across Europe and ignited the Reformation, a major historical turning point for getting the Church back on track. Martin Luthers secret was this: 'Prayer is the most important thing in my life. If I should neglect prayer for a single day, I should lose a great deal of the fire of faith.' Much prayer, much blessing. A teeny Albanian nun became one of the most beloved and inspirational women of the last century for her work in the slums of Calcutta. Mother Teresa's secret to endurance: 'Prayer enlarges the heart until it is capable of containing God's gift of Himself.' Much prayer, much blessing. Ask God to help you make prayer a habit and priority in your daily life.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'But Paul shook the snake off into the fire...' Acts 28:5 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story's told of a farmer whose mule fell into a well. Since he had no way to get him out, he decided to bury him there. He got a truckload of dirt and dumped it on top of the mule. But instead of lying down under it, the mule started kicking and snorting until he worked his way to the top of it. This continued all afternoon. Truckload after truckload, the mule just kept shaking it off and stepping on top of it. Finally when the dirt reached the top of the well the mule just snorted and walked away, a dirtier but a wiser mule. What was intended to bury him, just brought him out on top. On his way to Rome Paul was shipwrecked on an island. As he was gathering firewood a snake attached itself to his arm. What did he do? The Bible says he just 'shook it off'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's an important lesson for you in those two stories. You can either dwell on the past, or shake it off and move toward the future God has planned for you. Paul, a man with a past, writes: '&lt;em&gt;Forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forward to those things which are ahead&lt;/em&gt;.' (Philippians 3:13 NKJ) Now, Paul didn't forget his past, he just shook it off and kept going. You say, 'But I've failed so badly.' The Bible says, '...He] will not remember your sins.' (Isaiah 43:25 NAS) Sometimes forgiveness requires a healing process, but until you make the decision to forgive yourself and others, and shake it off, the process can't even begin.&lt;/p&gt;

<title><![CDATA[Built for Relationship]]></title>

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;' It is not good that man should be alone.' Genesis 2:18 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God wants you to have good, long-lasting relationships that run deep. We're built that way. Genesis contains these words from God: '&lt;em&gt;It is not good that man should be alone&lt;/em&gt;.' Later in the Bible, He brought Jonathan a great friend in David; to the widow Naomi He gave Ruth, a daughter-in-law who gave her a reason to live again. And to Paul He brought a very supportive companion, Timothy. We can read all that in the Bible, but the message is pretty much common sense - a lonely life is not much fun. God doesn't want you to make your way through life all by yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we all know that God wants a relationship with each one of us, but sometimes we forget how much. Every day, make it your priority to remind yourself of your worth, value and purpose from God. Think of how precious that bond between you and God is. And secondly, remember that friends are God's life preservers, and life enrichers. He never created you to go it alone. Trust Him to bring you those you need to have around you, and ask Him to help you build lasting relationships. And remember: He sees your imperfection, handles your rejection and loves you regardless. So don't throw someone aside because they made a mistake. Instead recall the love He has for us all and work that into your relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'We are labourers together...' 1 Corinthians 3:9 KJV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apprentice&lt;/em&gt;: a boardroom look at entrepreneurial talent or an excuse for desperate business graduates to take out their frustration and anger on each other? Each episode, teams are headed up by different project managers in order to win money-making tasks. Often the degree of success will depend on the style of the project manager. One will start discussions, share ideas and encourage people to feel good about their involvement; others will charge off to do their own thing, leaving a confused and squabbling team behind them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your (Christian) achievements similarly depend on the way you treat others. Anyone who goes it alone in this faith walk is going to end up disheartened or burnt out. '&lt;em&gt;We are labourers together...&lt;/em&gt;' - this means we need to work together. Jesus Himself didn't tackle His work alone; instead He included 12 ordinary people in the work; 12 disciples who prayed with the sick along with Him, 12 disciples who met with the poor by His side. If you want to do great things for God you'll need to work well with Gods people! True success is shared success, and it only happens when you're willing to invest in the lives of others.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...This work had been done with the help of our God.' Nehemiah 6:16 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good level of self-confidence helps with sports, studies and even life in general. But when it comes down to what we really rely on deep down, our self-confidence may perhaps fail us. Sometimes people realise this at different times in their lives - after a breakup, or when an identity crisis hits - but the good news is that were not designed to live depending on self-confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nehemiah shows us how &lt;em&gt;confidence in God is the best groundwork a life can be laid on&lt;/em&gt;. In his book (named, with startling originality... &lt;em&gt;Nehemiah&lt;/em&gt;), it tells how he heard about the terrible state that Jerusalem was in after the Temple of God was destroyed by the Babylonians. He set aside his own problems and focused on the nations. Nehemiah was so burdened that he 'wept... mourned... and prayed before... God...' (Nehemiah 1:4 NIV) Heres the key: he said, 'I know who You are, God, and I know who we are. Your people have rejected You, but were coming back and You can give us success.' God honoured His prayer by enabling the walls to be rebuilt in 52 days, making the enemy nations lose &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; self-confidence, 'because they realised this work had been done with the help of... God'. Nehemiah kept his reliance on God as his starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God needs people who follow Him closely in their own lives and who can turn weakness into strength, obstacles into stepping stones and disaster into triumph. As a follower of Christ, people watch you every day. The question is,&lt;em&gt; do they know who you're following? And that it's about Him - not you?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Gal 4-6, Mark 12:13-27, Ps 101, Pr 13:20-23&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['... She was made straight, and glorified God.' Luke 13:13 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Jesus healed a woman who had been crippled for 18 years, she (unsurprisingly) started rejoicing. Yippee! Yahoo! Break out the poppers and streamers! It would be easy to imagine all the people around her were as delighted as she was. But the majority decided to lay into Jesus for healing her on the Sabbath day (the religious day of rest)! They chose joyless 'religion' instead of rejoicing over something genuinely good. What did the woman do? Did she give them a good shake: 'Just look at me, you hard-hearted bunch! I'm free after 18 long years of pain! Check in with yourself?' No, she kept on praising! She didn't feel the need to defend herself. She knew better than any of them that the Lord was her defender. Their minds were set and not open to change, and the woman was wise not to get swept away with the mood they were setting. If she did, her defensiveness could have turned a great moment into something very ugly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever get drawn into a faith-fight? Focus on how wonderful God is rather than how wonderfully wrong some people are. Don't get pulled into arguments. When you drop defending yourself, you open a door for the Lord to 'fight' for you, and you set a better mood in conversations.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Look at Romans 12:9-21. It's a great passage of love in action. The love of Christ that others see in you will triumph over a faith-fight every time. Ask God to help you to focus on praising and emulating Him and to have an open heart to understand others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Lam 1:1-3:39, Mark 12:28-44, Ps 108, Pr 13:24-25&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['Because You say so, I will...' Luke 5:5 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;'[Jesus] said to Simon: &quot;Put out into deep water, and let down the nets for a catch.&quot; Simon answered, &quot;Master, we've worked hard all night and haven't caught anything. But because You say so, I will...&quot; When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break.' (Luke 5:4-6 NIV) Notice two principles in this story: (1) God will use failure to get your attention. Peter was tired, empty-handed and disappointed when Jesus spoke to him. And He will speak to you through the difficult times. He doesn't want you to run from your problems, He wants you to learn from them; to discover the difference He can make in your situation when you invite Him into it. (2) God can take you back to the place of failure and give you success. We assume that because we weren't successful at something, it wasn't God's will. But often the truth is that we failed because we relied on our own strength instead of His. The Bible says: '...They caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break. So they signalled their partners in the other boat to come and help them and they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink.' (Luke 5:6-7 NIV) God is not limited by your circumstances or past failures; because He chooses to work through faith, He's limited only by your unbelief. When you obey Him, you'll discover He has a level of abundance in mind that will exceed all your expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Lam 3:40-5:22, Mark 13:1-11, Ps 113, Pr 14:1-4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['... Let us strip off every weight that slows us down.' Hebrews 12:1 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jim Collins, author of the business book &lt;em&gt;Good to Great&lt;/em&gt;, noticed that &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; companies could become &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; companies if they stripped away stuff that was slowing them down. It's good advice for everyday lives as well. He writes: 'Most of us lead busy but undisciplined lives. We have ever expanding 'to do' lists, trying to build momentum by doing, doing, doing. But it rarely works. Those who built the good to great companies made as much use of 'stop doing' lists, as 'to do' lists. They displayed a remarkable discipline to unplug from all sorts of extraneous junk and channel their resources into only one or a few areas.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul writes along the same lines about our busy lives: 'Let us strip off every weight that slows us down... And let us run with endurance the race God has set before us.' Sometimes it's negative attitudes, laziness or plain old messy sin that stops us from reaching our potential. Other times it's just because were too &lt;em&gt;busy &lt;/em&gt;to be of any use. We over-commit to stuff or fill our time with things that, though not bad in themselves, keep us from what we're called to do. 'Many are the plans in a person's heart, but it is the Lord's purpose that prevails.' (Proverbs 19:21 NIV) Prayerfully think through what God is calling you to do. Ask what is stopping you from getting on with the job. Now tear up the 'to-do list' and create a 'to-stop' list. In other words, begin to strip off every weight that slows you down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Amos 1:1-5:17, Mark 13:12-23, Ps 82, Pr 14:5-8&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.' 1 Samuel 18:7 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jealousy lives off the little scraps you feed it the more fodder you push its way, the hungrier it becomes. Until one day it swallows you up from the inside out. A textbook case for this is the story of King Saul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David returns home having successfully protected king and country and so the women from the towns of Israel sing, 'Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands!' Saul's gutted when the lyrics lift him up only to bump him down to size. He starts feeding his jealousy until it totally devours him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It probably started with harmless thoughts like, '&lt;em&gt;Numbers aren'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;t everything!&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;I'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;m the king, he'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;s just a kid with a sling&lt;/em&gt;.' But before long they keep him up at night, making him wonder what David has that he hasn't. He begins to compare himself with David, instead of seeking God's perspective on the situation. He wonders why he holds the title 'King' when this shepherd boy gets all the respect. And then he starts to see David's face everywhere he looks, hear his name mentioned in every conversation. He can't stop thinking about the power and influence he's losing. Until one day the king launches a spear at the boy's head, but it's his own heart that's pierced with shame. Jealousy clamps its jaws shut on Saul's spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next few days we're going to be looking at the deadly effects of jealousy. Saul's rivalry with David is our kick-off point. Start today by reading the story in 1 Samuel 18:1-16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Gal 5:23, 1 John 2:15-17, Gen 39:1-23, Pr 29:18&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['... They measure themselves by themselves...' 2 Corinthians 10:12 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life is too short for unhealthy comparisons. If a goalkeeper starts getting jealous because he hasn't scored a single goal, the team's probably heading for trouble. And when King Saul started treating a good friend and faithful servant, David, as his competition, he'd lost the plot. God had handed Saul a major player for his team, but all he saw was a new enemy. So victory for the nation was replaced by Saul's need for victory for himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalm 39:5-6 CEV says that 'Human life is but a breath and it disappears like a shadow.' We have little of life in quantity, so let's make up for that in quality! Always comparing yourself to others will water down the richness of life. Measuring life in terms of personal victories over others will steal away its joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A certain level of competitiveness is good. But there's no place for it at the core of our lives, at the centre of our motivations. What about you? Have you taken your eyes off your own game? Remember the story of King Saul and David. Jealousy will make us lose sight of what's really important, like Saul lost sight of what God had done for him. Don't get green-eyed about that talented person next to you, rather think about how you can encourage them. God has given you your own set of talents, skills and desires. Focus on doing what God created you especially for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Amos 5:18-9:15, Mark 13:24-37, Ps 117, Pr 14:9-12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God made it grow.' 1 Corinthians 3:6 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not just individuals who jealously compare themselves to others, envious of what the other guy has. It's also groups and - shock, horror! - churches, too. Ever joined a group with a cause? If you have, you'll have noticed it's easy to start to compare the vision, accomplishments and resources of your group with those of other groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul wrote these tough words to a church plagued by internal strife and divided loyalty: 'You are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and quarrelling among you, are you not worldly? Are you not acting like mere men? For when one says, &quot;I follow Paul,&quot; and another, &quot;I follow Apollos,&quot; are you not mere men? What, after all, is Apollos? And what is Paul? Only servants...' (1 Corinthians 3:3-5 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bickering over who's the best preacher in town kept this church from other, much more important things. Understanding your gifts and your God-given purpose frees you from the need to measure yourself by the runner in the next lane, or someone playing a different position on the team. When you understand this, your sense of inadequacy will be healed and you'll be able to enjoy and complement others. You'll also be able to break free from sibling rivalry and show everyone that success is not about being like somebody else, but about being the best you can be, and all God made you to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Ezek 1-4, Mark 14:1-11, Ps 121, Pr 14:13-16&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA[' There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit.' 1 Corinthians 12:4 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, down to the core of the matter. What exactly makes comparing yourself to others unhealthy? It's about identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book &lt;em&gt;Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain&lt;/em&gt; describes an unusual technique for creating art - if you are drawing a chair, for example, you draw the space around it rather than the object itself. You define the chair by drawing the things that are not the chair. When it comes to identity, you can't afford to live this way. If you start defining ourselves by what you're not, your life will start to look like an empty canvas. To live like Jesus, to live in the way you've been called to, you must define yourself by what you actually &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what are you? Well, if you're a follower of Jesus, your identity resembles a list of Christmas presents far too good to be true, far too undeserved to be possible... You're &lt;em&gt;accepted, chosen, appreciated&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt;. Your identity is drawn in His hands (Isaiah 49:15-16), not drawn in the sand (Matthew 7:24-26). It's solid and immovable. You're &lt;em&gt;corrected, forgiven&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;forgiving -&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;a human being, who lives &lt;em&gt;at peace, with God&lt;/em&gt;. That's not to be passed over lightly. Your life has a distinctive scent of godliness to it, like nothing and no one else on this planet. It's the gift of identity that is the final answer to the question: 'Who am I?' When you understand &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; you are and &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; God created you to be - &lt;em&gt;being yourself&lt;/em&gt; brings glory to God! Here's a prayer to say today: 'Lord, I'm thankful for who You made me; I've finished complaining or wishing I could be somebody else.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Ezek 5-9, Mark 14:12-26, Ps 4, Pr 14:17-20&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=52889&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Godliness with contentment is great gain.' 1 Timothy 6:6 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've discovered that the way out of a life of jealousy is to understand the identity and value we have through Christ. But what stops us from sliding back? A lifestyle built on today's verse: 'Godliness with contentment is great gain.' So, let's take it apart to see how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;em&gt;what does &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;godliness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; look like?&lt;/em&gt; Simply put, it's the characteristics of God that we can imitate in our own lives. Love, patience, faithfulness, forgiveness and consistency. It's when we seek to love against the odds, when we're patient though we could be careless, when we forgive though we hurt, when we're dependable though the short-cut would be easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, &lt;em&gt;what is it to be content?&lt;/em&gt; When you're just as satisfied with a lot as you are with a little, you've cracked contentment. When you don't have to be Queen Bee or King of the Hill to feel happy, you're content. Contentment enables you to get on with the job even when nobody cares you're doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;em&gt;what is great gain?&lt;/em&gt; When we're happy to choose God's way and we're not concerned about getting recognition, we've got great gain in this life. Our everyday experiences are so much richer when we live with godliness and great contentment that our lives can well be described as overflowing with joy! One will lead to the other: godliness to contentment to great gain. So start at the beginning: Galatians 5:22-23 says that God's fruit of the Spirit (in other words, godliness) are 'love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.' Practice those and you will learn contentment and enjoy great gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Ezek 10-13, Mark 14:27-42, Ps 124, Pr 14:21-24&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=52890&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.' Philippians 3:12 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you're keeping jealousy in your life in check, you're better placed to compare yourself to others in a healthy way. But what do healthy comparisons look like? Ever seen a runner run with a pacesetter? Although pacesetters run too, their job isn't to compete. Rather, it's to set a fast pace for the runner to aspire to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a healthy way of looking at each other. There'll always be a better preacher, or finer singer, or cleverer mind. If we're always trying to compete with those around us, we'll run ourselves straight into the ground so, why not treat others as pacesetters, not competition?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep an eye on the great, mature qualities in other people not to bring out your competitive streak, but to set your life at a better pace. If you have a friend who often goes out of her way to witness to others, listen quietly and pick up tips. If you have a friend who's a better listener, learn from his model. (Handy tip: with some skills, the best way to learn is to act as if you already have it, and constantly see what you need to adjust to get better. This is not to try to lie to others, but to grow it in yourself.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a win-win for everyone. Other people will feel treated respectfully; you'll develop in leaps and bounds; and you'll be acting in a way pleasing to God! Think about studying the lives of the great Bible heroes like David, Moses, Job, Esther or Paul. There is serious encouragement in their stories. How can you use their pacesetting to help you run your race?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Ezek 14:1-16:52, Mark 14:43-52, Ps 129, Pr 14:25-28&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=52891&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['But God has revealed [it] to us by His Spirit...' 1 Corinthians 2:10 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we encouraged you to read up on the lives of the heroes of our faith, but if you do, a word of warning first! Make sure you're not left with a hero-hangover: high on the exploits of King David or the apostle Paul one moment, but over-shadowed by their achievements the next. The temptation is to get deflated because you can't see how to defeat your Goliath or because you're not seeing miracles on the mission field. Remember the Bible or the book is meant to inspire you towards &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; life's plan, not make you a carbon copy of someone else's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, we need to put down the books and develop our own trust in God. We need to live out our own vision. It's good to be challenged by some missionary's fervour from the frontline but we must wait on God ourselves. God wants you to follow Him, not someone else's story - no matter how helpful or good it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And sometimes when we read these books we can convince ourselves that, say, India or China is where the real action is. But the truth is that people are people: they may look, dress or talk different, but all people are desperately in need of God. There is little difference in being a missionary today in your own neighbourhood and a one in deepest Mongolia. Ask yourself what you can start doing right now! And then ask God, by His Spirit, to reveal to you His plan and your part in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Ezek 16:53-19:14, Mark 14:53-65, Ps 1, Pr 14:29-32&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=52892&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['All Your words are true; all Your righteous laws are eternal.' Psalm 119:160 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever been to a doughnut factory? You can follow the whole doughnut-making process along a little conveyor belt, from liquid batter to crude dough lump, right through to the final glazed product. You wouldn't want to pick up a doughnut at the half-way point - it'd fall right through your hands like custard. Some things just need the time and effort before you can see the rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microwave your Bible-reading time? No chance. Shortcuts might be useful to get to the other side of town quicker, but not for things that are eternally worthwhile. The Bible works best by slow degrees; God's wisdom breathed into the lives of His children, into the fabric of their day-to-day experiences and thoughts. Treat it as a book of sound bites and you'll get the odd puff of wind in your sails - why go for that when you could have gale force?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you know that you should be reading your Bible a bit more, it's easy to guilt-trip yourself about it. But that won't get you anywhere. Go to God and ask the Holy Spirit to help you as you read. Know the Author. Don't necessarily expect anything big (although you can never rule that out with God), but read calmly and patiently, and see what you get! Drifting in and out of your Bible when the mood takes you might be convenient and time-saving, but it won't be life-changing. Try to make it a pattern that comes easily after a bit of practice. It doesn't particularly matter how long you spend at first, just that it becomes a regular thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Matt 5:3, Luke 18:9-14, Isaiah 57:14-21, 2 Sam 7:18-29&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=52893&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['He who abides in Me...bears much fruit.' John 15:5 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people view the Christian life as a bed of thornless roses, others see it as a battlefield. The first group says, 'If I've enough faith, I'll never be sick, broke or have problems.' The second group says, 'Every time I stick my head up out of the trench, another disaster shoots me down.' The truth is, our faith levels are revealed by hard times. When our backs are to the wall financially we need faith to believe that God is Jehovah Jireh, &lt;em&gt;the Lord who provides&lt;/em&gt;. When were battling illness we need faith to believe He's Jehovah Rapha, &lt;em&gt;the great physician who promises to heal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reality isn't always easy. God gives us hope but He doesn't grant our every wish. Fantasising about winning the lottery or having a smaller nose won't make things easier in the long run, if we're to grow in a mature way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Christian, blessing comes from staying close to the Lord. Jesus said that we 'abide' in Him. 'Abiding' is like &lt;em&gt;standing with&lt;/em&gt;, or more accurately,&lt;em&gt; living in&lt;/em&gt;. Living in Jesus' life means we are, all of us, in the hands of the Father. In today's verse, Jesus is saying that those who live within His being during the tough times are going to get the blessing - closeness to Him. Those who face life as it is will find life as it should be. So, pray for the strength and endurance to face the more uncomfortable facts of reality, whatever they are for you today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Ezek 20-21, Mark 14:66-72, Ps 48, Pr 14:33-35&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=52895&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<alias><![CDATA[its-a-trap-1]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['... Am I trying to please people?' Galatians 1:10 NCV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Am I trying to please people?' is a great question to ask ourselves. For whatever reason, we can fall into the same old people-pleasing trap over and over again. And so we become the shoulder to cry on, not because we want to help someone out, but rather because we like the feeling of being needed. Or we volunteer to help out at any given opportunity, not out of an act of service, but because we enjoy being known as the 'helpful' one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When our goal becomes about elevating ourselves rather than God, we're never going to be truly happy. There will always be someone to point out our failings. There will always be people who let us know when we've done well. But what you say about yourself or what others think about you is secondary. The opinion that counts above all others is God's and, as you know, you already have God's approval! So, don't use your kind acts as a way of building yourself up, but use God's approval as inspiration to carry out kindness. People-pleasing leads to disappointment; God's approval leads to people pleased. Ask the Holy Spirit for help to answer these questions: &lt;em&gt;Do I do things for others because You want me to or because I need to feel needed? Do I do things for others out of guilt or fear? Do I do things for others because I feel I &lt;/em&gt;have&lt;em&gt; to&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;or because You'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;ve asked me?&lt;/em&gt; Only when God is your source of approval will you be totally satisfied and content to be yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Ezek 22-23, Mark 15:1-20, Ps 132:1-10, Pr 15:1-4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.  2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;track=53485&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'... Am I trying to please people?' Galatians 1:10 NCV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we considered how pleasing people is often rooted in pleasing ourselves. Paul gives us strong warnings about getting preoccupied with pleasing anyone other than God: &lt;em&gt;'If people's thinking is controlled by the sinful self, there is death. But if their thinking is controlled by the Spirit, there is life and peace. When people's thinking is controlled by the sinful self, they are against God, because they refuse to obey God's law and really are not even able to obey God's law. Those people who are ruled by their sinful selves cannot please God.'&lt;/em&gt; (Romans 8:6-8 NCV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, Paul warns us that God isn't best pleased when were seeking to feel good about ourselves through the wrong means. However, He also gives us the solution. Attention to what pleases God is like the key for our prison door. Knowing what God wants of us frees us from what others want from us. This should give us the courage to say 'no' to things that need saying 'no' to. It should give us the freedom to be who we are rather than try to live up to others' expectations. It should give us guilt-free consciences rather than worries about letting others down. God always has the key to our prisons. So, know your values, relax, and just stay connected to Him. He will... 'equip you with all you need for doing His will...[and] produce in you...every good thing that is pleasing to Him...' (Hebrews 13:21 NLT)&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'I have seen God face to face, yet my life has been spared.' Genesis 32:30 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early on in the Bible there's a story about a wrestling bout. A real smackdown. And Contender Number 2 was no one less than the Creator of the universe! You might have heard people say they've 'struggled with God', but Jacob did this for real and went toe-to-toe with the Almighty Himself. Up to this point he had lived a life of deception and lies. So, in God's eyes, this midnight grapple was probably as much Jacob's fight with his own identity as it was a physical brawl. Jacob came out of the struggle able to say, '&lt;em&gt;I have seen God face to face, yet my life has been spared&lt;/em&gt;.' What a thing to say!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you facing an identity crisis, struggling to come to terms with who you are? Well, today's story gives us hope that, when we wrestle with such things, the struggle may take a lot out of us but in the end well be stronger for going face-to-face with God, rather than turning our backs on Him. For those of us battling our past, God says,'&lt;em&gt;...if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!&lt;/em&gt;' (2 Corinthians 5:17 NIV) If you're grappling with what others say about you, take heart, '&lt;em&gt;For it is not the one who commends himself who is approved, but the one whom the Lord commends&lt;/em&gt;.' (2 Corinthians 10:18 NIV) For those who struggle to see any future, '...God's powerful hand...will lift you up when the right time comes.' (1 Peter 5:6 NCV)&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'There hath no temptation taken you...' 1 Corinthians 10:13 KJV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've deliberately chosen an old-fashioned language translation for today's verse because we want to focus on the word '&lt;em&gt;taken&lt;/em&gt;'. When you're in a big city you make sure you're holding onto your bag or wallet tightly. If you're in a particularly rough area you'd hold it closer. Your awareness of danger is heightened. If only we had that same awareness when it came to temptation - that sense of protecting what's valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A guy might find his iPhone innocent enough. But when he's alone and temptation beckons, how easy is it to access sites that could lead him astray? A girl might think there's nothing wrong with her latest e-book, but what imagery is it placing in her head?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment has taken them to some places they shouldn't be. The image might last a few moments; the results linger longer. Why? Because lust promises what it can't deliver. We believe the pictures will satisfy a need, but what it creates is a drive for more and more. The problem with porn is that it &lt;em&gt;takes&lt;/em&gt; you to a place you shouldn't be, where you can't protect what's valuable. For the next few days we'll be talking about the dangers of pornography. (If this isn't something you struggle with yourself, please pray for those who do, and learn more about the struggle they have!) Rather than hide from God in shame, be honest about your struggles (whatever they are). Hebrews 4:16 NIV says: '&lt;em&gt;Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need&lt;/em&gt;.'&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'... but such as is common to man...' 1 Corinthians 10:13 NAS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proverbs 7 is a rich poem that describes foolishness as a beautifully dressed woman ready to pounce and kill. The loaded imagery shows the woman enticing the man with honeyed words and sweet promises into a secret room - a place where she can hold and kiss him. The final line is a twist - her house is actually on the road to death. A pretty serious twist, really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what a picture of how pornography works on our senses. Like promiscuity (sleeping around or fooling around), it offers the excitement of intimacy with no strings attached. The secret is kept between yourself and the internet, your own personal laptop, iPad or phone. Is it ok to have one without the other - sex without the bond of an actual relationship? We'll look at that in tomorrow's reading. Today, though, know that secrecy, one of pornography's strongest weapons, is the first barrier to attack. A secret isolates you so you can't get help from anybody. A secret tells you not to let anybody else know, because you will be judged. And without support you're left wondering whether God could possibly love you. (In battle, its called a &lt;em&gt;Divide&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conquer&lt;/em&gt; strategy.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'&lt;em&gt;No temptation has overtaken you but such as is common to man&lt;/em&gt;.' (1 Corinthians 10:13 NAS) This lets us know we're not alone in the struggle. We are sensory creatures. The contours of a body appeal to our senses. The problem isn't the body. The problem is the lust that comes with the territory and draws us into slavery or addiction. Think hard about breaking this secret (or any other secret you're holding on to) by asking a trustworthy church or youth leader to support you in your struggle.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'... But God is faithful...' 1 Corinthians 10:13 KJV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's not beat about the fig-tree: why is it wrong to go ahead with sex if you both feel like you love each other, and you both want it? The answer from God is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; that sex is wrong, it's that it's &lt;em&gt;precious&lt;/em&gt;. That means it has to be handled with care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason Christians hold back sex for marriage is not to deprive the singles. It's not even to build up our faith while we're waiting. It's because it connects us on the deepest human level to another person. Sharing ourselves through sex has such potential to damage and destroy us that, frankly, we almost shouldn't be trusted with it at all. We certainly should make sure we only allow ourselves to share ourselves sexually in the most strong, stable, committed relationship there is: marriage. (By the way, this isn't even a young thing, look at how many adults are mis-using sex and getting torn up by it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why porn is so damaging. It's like sex's physical pleasure without the joy of marriage. More on that tomorrow, but for today, the point is that God isn't a kill-joy. He's given you the best He could invent, and told you to handle with care. And if you use it right, at the right time, it's a part of what your bodies were made for. Set boundaries for yourself, firm ones, today, and stick to them. For those who need a reset button: &lt;em&gt;God absolutely will forgive you if you ask for it&lt;/em&gt;. He will. Memorise this verse to help you live without shame: '&lt;em&gt;Through love and faithfulness sin is atoned for&lt;/em&gt;.' (Proverbs 16:6 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'I have the right to do anything...' 1 Corinthians 6:12 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CS Lewis writes, 'Now suppose you came to a country where you could fill a theatre by simply bringing a covered plate onto the stage and then slowly lifting the cover as to let everyone see, just before the lights went out, that it contained a mutton chop or a bit of bacon, would you not think that in that country something had gone wrong with the appetite for food?'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lewis is saying that something is wrong in our culture's attitude to sex. Striptease shows, chat-lines, internet porn...all signs that our appetite for the naked body has taken a wrong turn somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Augustine long ago defined 'Sin' as 'man turned in upon himself'. Were designed to be (1) turned up to God, to receive His love, (2) turned out to each other, to share His and our love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porn is all about you, and you only. The more of yourself you give to it, the less youll be able to feel the love of God or other people. Paul looked at freedom like this: '&lt;em&gt;I have the right to do anything - but I will not be mastered by anything&lt;/em&gt;.' (1 Corinthians 6:12) Clicking on porn isn't a sign of being truly free with sexuality; it's a sign on the route to addiction of some form. Like the woman in chapter 7 of Proverbs, porn will seduce us with sweet talk to our face, but stab us in the back when we're not looking. Addiction diverts us off the path of freedom. If porn has become an addiction for you, a great place to get help is &lt;strong&gt;http://www.x3watch.com/x3watchfree.html&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'... God...will...make a way of escape...' 1 Corinthians 10:13 KJV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staying clear of porn these days is probably harder to do than at any other time. It is so readily available, and not just on the internet. Random products are sold on billboard posters by scantily-dressed models and music channels parade very explicit videos. Our culture presents sex as the best that this life has to offer. Our hearts were designed to be devoted with God; but instead we have a generation devoted to seeking out sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do we break free? Jesus. Jesus is the original and best rope-breaker. The reliable Saviour. So obviously, start by running to Him. Want to be free? Ask Him. Spend time talking to Him about it. Make peace with God, on His terms of unconditional acceptance and love, and decide that you're ready to turn your back on porn. Listen for what He's saying to you. Then get practical. Think of the times and places where porn tempts you, and take steps to stamp its voice out. Make that time your prayer time, and turn your phone or computer off for that time. Whatever your situation is, make it an inside decision to change, and an outside action of change. But, you're not going to go through this alone. Not only are we praying for you, but: '&lt;em&gt;God...will...make a way of escape...&lt;/em&gt;' Romans 12:2 NIV says, '&lt;em&gt;Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind&lt;/em&gt;.' If this series was for you, ask God/a pastor/youth-worker/friend for practical ways to transform your mind. If not, today pray for those who are trapped in addiction.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Catch... the little foxes that spoil the vines...' Song of Solomon 2:15 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's verse is one of those Biblical double-takes: &lt;em&gt;what does it even mean&lt;/em&gt;? A bit of context for you: in Old Testament times, grapes, melons and other fruits grew on vines. (Matter of fact: they still do!) Without grapes or melons, the people's diet would suffer. So, people in these ancient cultures depended heavily on the growth of these vines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little fox might look sweet in Disney cartoons and it might be just an urban pest in cities, but it's actually a serious threat to crops (and chooks!) in the country. Let one in, and then another and a few too many 'fox incidents' means that nobody gets to eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what are the pesky foxes in your life; small things that seem insignificant but left unattended will one day trip you up? Maybe it's a relationship that doesn't seem to be doing too much damage right now, but that you know isn't right for you. Chase off the fox before the vine is spoiled. Maybe it's a little wardrobe replenishment habit you've formed. Watch it before it turns out to be a crippling debt problem! What little foxes do you need to catch today? Little resentments, habits, or areas of dishonesty nip them in the bud. Do you need to be honest with someone or stop doing something? Put a date in your diary now to deal with it and make that date today!&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'The... years of abundance... came to an end.' Genesis 41:53 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Joseph became a ruler in Egypt, he saw hard times on the horizon. So he '&lt;em&gt;stored up huge quantities of grain... The seven years of abundance in Egypt came to an end, and the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in all other lands, but in the whole land of Egypt there was food&lt;/em&gt;.' (Genesis 41:49-54 NIV) Joseph had been warned of a coming famine, so he acted responsibly in the years leading up to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hard truth is that many of us are not so responsible. Take money, for instance. We probably don't need half of the small things we buy but we buy them anyway. We've heard somewhere that we're supposed to give ten per cent of our money to God but, hey, we excuse ourselves by thinking that's just for the people who've got the big bucks... and, anyway, if you gave ten per cent you'd have nothing to buy your small things with, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus isn't necessarily looking for set figures or budget breakdowns. He's more concerned about your attitude. He commends a widow for giving a few cents to the church offering because he knows her attitude is right. He challenges the Pharisees for giving buckets of dollars because He knows their hearts are wrong. Consider your attitude to money. It is meant to be a blessing to you and to others. God doesn't want you to hoard the blessing for yourself but to share it responsibly with others, just as Joseph did.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Don't be jealous or proud, but be humble and consider others more important than yourselves.' Philippians 2:3 CEV &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without 'bit-part' extras in films the story cannot be told. Often Christians who are digging in and serving God or helping other people are compared to bit-part extras. But it doesn't sound ideal, does it? Where's the joy in that, when you could be the star? Why do we bother serving? Well, let's rein it in for a second; there's no point in serving if you dont know who you're doing it for or why!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, &lt;em&gt;serving takes attention away from yourself and towards God.&lt;/em&gt; This isn't about God being vain, but it's about Him being &lt;em&gt;personal&lt;/em&gt;, not 'a thing'. God is a person, and He loves it when you do things for Him; simple, really! The act of serving is one of the best ways of redirecting our eyes to Him. Secondly, &lt;em&gt;serving helps you.&lt;/em&gt; Self-serving is actually one of the most damaging ways of life: it will turn you inside-out and leave you feeling empty. Serving others causes your character to blossom beautifully, and shifts your heart to point towards God. And finally, &lt;em&gt;serving helps others.&lt;/em&gt; It lifts them up in love: opens them more to the love of God, and helps them to see Him more clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So serving is good in God's eyes and helpful for you. There's great joy in it that can't be found elsewhere. Practice the art of the bit-part today. Volunteer to help with a job at church feel the buzz of helping somebody else get the praise because you quietly did your part without considering how it would either benefit you or put you out.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Rejoice with those who rejoice...' Romans 12:15 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul writes, '&lt;em&gt;Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep&lt;/em&gt;.' The second part is easy enough. When your near-perfect best mate has been dumped by the local Romeo or Juliet, it's easy enough to offer a few consoling words. But the first part, '&lt;em&gt;Rejoice with those who rejoice...&lt;/em&gt;' well, that's a different scenario altogether. It's harder to feel happy with friends when they get things we wanted and we missed out. When they succeed in a way that we haven't, it becomes tricky to hold to these words from the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Envy tries every trick in the book to stop you being happy for others. We compare ourselves to others and wonder why God isn't cutting us a break too. Instead of playing the 'poor me' card, why not do as Paul suggests? Maybe today is not your day to be super-blessed. Such is life. But it will come, and wouldn't you want others to be happy for you when that day comes for you? So do the same for them, and '&lt;em&gt;rejoice with those who rejoice...&lt;/em&gt;'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's amazing how much better you can feel when you are simply happy with someone who has been blessed. If you think about them and not yourself, you can enjoy their success too. Try it!&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Trust in the Lord...' Proverbs 3:5 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'&lt;em&gt;Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths.&lt;/em&gt;' (Proverbs 5-6 NKJ) But what if your path leads through pain, pressure and problems? John the Baptist's did. He didn't deserve imprisonment. After all, he was Jesus' cousin and the voice of God in his community. So he sent Jesus a message asking, '&lt;em&gt;Are you really the Messiah, or should we keep looking?&lt;/em&gt;' Rephrased: 'If you're Lord, and you're in charge, 'going on with this prison business?!' It's a question based on unfulfilled expectations. We think, 'Lord, if You're good, how come things aren't working out for me?' If you're in this sort of situation, it's not that God has suddenly turned against you. We don't know a definite explanation of 'why' bad things happen, but we do know that, even in the midst of them, God is on our side. That means He is for you in a very real way, right now. He asks us to trust Him, and trust He knows what He's doing. We can be sure it is in His very nature to turn shocking situations for good. Want an example? How about the cross...? So whatever your circumstances you can say, 'I don't know why this is happening, but I know and trust that God can redeem it, and bring good out of it.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;SoulFood: 2 Cor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';&quot;&gt; 9:1–11:15, Luke 2:8–20, Ps 144:9–15, Pr 16:4–7 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp;amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia. 2013 UCB International Ltd&lt;/small&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;amp;track=53543&amp;amp;www=blog&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'My life is worth nothing... unless I use it for finishing the work assigned me by the Lord...' Acts 20:24 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You wonder what's up when multi-million recording artists end up overdosed on prescription drugs. Or when footballers who have graced fields around the world finish their lives drowning in alcohol. Or when movie stars bring their lives to an end in hotel rooms. It seems you can have it all and yet have nothing. Sometimes the things we desire most (fame, money, power) are the things most deadly for us. If you want to make your life count, don't think celebrity status will help - sign yourself over to God instead. Root your life in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DL Moody once said, 'Give your life to God; He can do more with it than you can.' Ephesians 1:11 NLT goes further: '&lt;em&gt;Furthermore, because we are united with Christ, we have received an inheritance from God, for He chose us in advance, and He makes everything work out according to His plan.&lt;/em&gt;' That's the big picture. And it is a &lt;em&gt;big &lt;/em&gt;picture! As God's children, we get to build for God's Kingdom. God promises that we will be part of the purpose He is working out in everything and everyone, in all of history. It may not be fame in the world's eyes, but you will truly have success, and treasure in God. So focus on the only profession truly worth giving your attention to - go to Christ, and find out who you are and what you are living for. What skills or talents has God placed in you to work for His Kingdom? Pray that He will do more with your talent than you could ever do yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['... Stay within the [boundaries] of the work which God has set for [you]...' 2 Corinthians 10:13 GNT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's get something straight. &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;obody&lt;/em&gt; is good at everything and &lt;em&gt;nobody&lt;/em&gt; is called to do everything. God has given each of us clearly defined roles in life. Paul understood that his job wasn't to achieve everything or try to please everyone, but to focus on what God had called and equipped &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt; to do: 'Our goal is to stay within the [boundaries] of the work which God has set for us.' You want to be successful? You'll only manage it if you're doing what God wants you to (and, though it's sometimes opposite to the world's definition of success, God's is the only one worth considering in the long run).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep your eyes peeled: Satan will try to rob you of the joy of serving God by getting you to compare yourself with Brainy McSmarts, some celebrity Barbie-lookalike or even, for us Christians, some seemingly perfect super-saint in church. Satan loves pressuring you to fit into the expectations of others. Don't do it! (Insert slow-motion: &lt;em&gt;'Nooooooo...'&lt;/em&gt;) You'll always find someone who &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; to be doing a better job than you, and you'll become discouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's calling for your life is completely different from theirs: 'Our goal is to stay within the [boundaries] of the work which God has set for us.' The Bible says: 'Pay careful attention to your own work, for then you will get the satisfaction of a job well done, and you won't need to compare yourself to anyone else.' (Galatians 6:4 NLT) John Bunyan, author of the Christian classic, &lt;em&gt;Pilgrim'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;s Progress&lt;/em&gt;, wrote: 'If my life is fruitless it doesn't matter who praises me. And if my life is fruitful it doesn't matter who criticises me.' So, just do what God's called you to do!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Judges 12-15, Mark 11:1-11, Ps 97, Pr 13:9-10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['... Lord, teach us to pray...' Luke 11:1 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;One person can be crazy joyful for a friend who'd go on &lt;em&gt;Australia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'s Got Talent&lt;/em&gt; dressed up as tulip. Another feels like hiding out behind their knees and twitching with a #awkward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out we're all different (who knew?!) So then it's good news that God values all types of people and all types of people's prayers. Most importantly He relates to us all in the way that meets each of us. Do you ever feel like you don't know how to pray? Do you spend a lot of time listening to other people pray and then try to pray like them? Well, although there are some principles of prayer that apply to everyone, God will lead each of us individually. He wants to take you just the way you are, and help you discover your own rhythm of prayer. He wants you to develop a style of prayer that maximises &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prayer isn't ordering a take-away from Heaven, expecting what we pray for to drop out of the sky in a stay-warm box with extra mozzarella. It's not a lamp that needs to be rubbed for the genie to come out and grant us some wishes. It's a chat with God, the original heart-to-heart, which includes taking the time to also hear what He wants to say to you. A really good place to start is to simply ask Him, just as the disciples did, 'Lord, teach me to pray.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['... Jesus... spent the night praying...' Luke 6:12 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Do as I say, not as I do' isn't exactly a quality pep-talk. Sadly, a survey revealed that, of 1000 pastors, half admitted that they can go through long periods of time without taking time out to pray. Some preached persuasive sermons about prayer, yet it wasn't a feature in their own life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We shouldn't look to the religious people in the Bible for the most perfect way to be or how to relate with God. They are human beings with human failings. We need to look at Jesus. What did He do? Jesus woke up before dawn and spent hours in prayer. He even prayed all night. Did it show? Of course it did! Look at the miracles He performed, the lives He touched! It will show for you too if you make it your simple routine to start and end each day with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll start to find yourself praying throughout the day as things come to you. Talking to Him will come to be simply second nature. Most importantly you'll want to do it, rather than feel pressured to. How would you feel if your boyfriend or girlfriend said they feel 'obliged' to spend time with you. No one wants that. Neither does God. Wait what? Is this God-thing, like, a &lt;em&gt;relationship&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Joyce Meyer wrote: 'I realise that prayer is a great privilege, not a duty. I no longer approach God in fear, wondering if He will really hear me and send an answer to my prayers. I now approach Him boldly, as His Word teaches me to do, and with great expectation.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Gal 5:23, Isaiah 40:9-11, Isaiah 42:1-4, Ps 18:31-35&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['Evening [and] morning... He hears my voice.' Psalm 55:17 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it a coincidence that Jesus seemed to pray a lot outside? Here are just a few examples from the Bible. 'Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where He prayed.' (Mark 1:35 NIV) 'After leaving them, He went up on a mountainside to pray.' (Mark 6:46 NIV) 'But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed.' (Luke 5:16 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is that Jesus knew He needed to be somewhere quiet where He'd feel comfortable to best hear from God. Notice in one of the descriptions of Jesus He was slipping away. It gives the impression of not wanting anyone to notice He was leaving so He could have time alone with God. Time that He knew He needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you got a favourite place to be with God? You should find one. Somewhere where you know you can switch off and just be in His presence. Maybe you love spending time listening to worship music first or getting creative with the Creator by sketching, painting or making something. Don't be afraid to mix things up with God or have fun finding new places to hang out with Him. The most important thing to God is getting to spend time with you, hearing what's on your heart and you hearing whispers from His heart. God enjoys meeting you where you are, developing a personal relationship with you, and helping you grow to become everything He wants you to be!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Judges 19:16-21:25, Mark 11:27-33, Ps 45, Pr 13:13-16&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'He fashions their hearts individually...' Psalm 33:15 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about all those confident people who just launch into prayer and make it up as they go. They keep on praying for five minutes, while you're trying to think how to fill out five seconds. You're just not all that confident about how to go about this whole praying business. Praying can be nerve-wracking, especially out loud in front of other people. It can be really intimidating to hear someone pray with the biggest mountain-moving zeal imaginable. And really tempting to think you should copy what they say and how they say it. But prayer isn't about how other people go about it. Instead, God wants to spend time with you, the way you'd naturally talk to Him, and let His Spirit take over in a way that's completely &lt;em&gt;you-nique&lt;/em&gt;! When we look out for more of the Spirit and less at our own insecurities, that's when exciting things happen. When we stop following our own rituals or someone else's pattern, we allow God room to surprise us as He takes the lead. 'Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.' (2 Corinthians 3:17 NIV) This relationship, more than any other, needs honesty! When it comes to your faith-relationship, God doesn't care how your holy friends pray, but He's desperate to spend quality real time with you! In John 21:22, Jesus urges Peter not to worry about other people's relationships with Him, but to concentrate on his own walk. The Bible says, 'He fashions their hearts individually.' So when it comes to prayer: &lt;em&gt;Be yourself&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts...' Colossians 3:15 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We would be a whole lot more chilled out if we worried less and prayed more! In fact, let's go one better - we would be completely transformed if we didn't worry at all and prayed about everything! Philippians 4:6-7 TLB says, 'Don't worry about anything; instead, pray about everything; tell God your needs and don't forget to thank Him for His answers. If you do this you will experience God's peace, which is far more wonderful than the human mind can understand... His peace will keep your thoughts and your hearts quiet and at rest...'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prayer is an exchange service - you give over your worries or problems to Jesus! You get to let go! 'Let Him have all your worries and cares, for He is always thinking about you and watching everything that concerns you. Be careful - watch out for attacks from Satan... Stand firm when he attacks...' (1 Peter 5:7-9 TLB) Don't listen to the enemy's worry-whispers; not even for a second! The moment you find yourself worrying ask, 'What's the enemy trying to do here? If I give in to these thoughts and emotions what's going to happen?' 'Do not give the devil a foothold.' (Ephesians 4:27 NIV) Know your enemy, and each time he attacks put him to flight by saying what Jesus said to him in the wilderness: '...It is written...' (Matthew 4:4 NIV) When Jesus said for the third time, 'It is written,' we read, 'The devil left Him, and angels came and attended Him.' (Matthew 4:11 NIV) So here's the question: &lt;em&gt;How well do you know God's Word?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Deut 32:29-34:12, Mark 9:1-13, Ps 62, Pr 12:18-19&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['Whoever wants to be My disciple musttake up their cross daily...' Luke 9:23 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;An army lieutenant called his platoon together and said: 'Ok boys, I'm looking for volunteers. Chances are, this mission won't succeed and many of you won't come back. If you're interested, step forward.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just about the entire troop took a collective step backwards, leaving one unsuspecting 'volunteer' standing alone. God is not looking for 'involuntary volunteers' like that poor soldier. Jesus said, 'If anyone would come after Me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily.' He wants people who are willing to leave their comfort zone; to give up their expectations that life be lived on their terms; to sacrifice everything for people who may never know they did it; to pay the price so that God's purposes can be fulfilled. And what's more, He expects us to do it daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jesus said, 'Whoever does not carry his own cross... cannot be My disciple' (Luke 14:27 NAS), He wasn't asking us to do something He Himself hasn't done. Oswald Chambers said, 'If we are devoted to the cause of humanity we will be crushed and broken-hearted, for we shall often meet with ingratitude... But if our motive is love for God, no ingratitude will hinder us from serving our fellow man.' John says, 'We understand what love is when we realise... Christ gave His life for us.' (1 John 3:16 NLT) Think about how you can show people love today. You may not get thanks, but remember, it's for your love for God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: 1 Peter 1-5, Mark 9:14-29, Ps 49, Pr 12:20-22&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['... You received the spirit of adoption...' Romans 8:15 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did you know that you're a member of a Royal Family? Although it may seem like a bit of a stretch from where you are now, when people accept Jesus as their Lord and Saviour, they become heirs of the Kingdom! They are princes and princesses, so they won't be without any good thing. It's true! Look it up in Philippians 4:19. What a family you're part of!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's really important to remember &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; you were adopted in the first place. It's really important to remember you didn't earn it. It was given freely to you by grace. Can you imagine a couple rocking up to an adoption agency, saying, 'We'd love to take on dear little Joe and Susie, but first: do they have a house, money for education, a ride to school in the morning and clothes to wear every day?' The adoption agency would say, 'Hold on a minute. You're not adopting them because of what they have, but because of what they need: love, hope, a home and a future.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you didn't get adopted by your efforts you can't lose it through a poor performance, either. How reassuring is that? And it gets better; you're an heir to all your Father owns. That means you'll never have a need He cannot or will not meet. How good is that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Obadiah, Malachi 1-4, Mark 9:30-37, Ps 18:1-29, Pr 12:23-24&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA[ '... Receive the Kingdom of God as a little child...' Mark 10:15 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;God can tell us He loves us over and over again, but sometimes we can struggle to believe it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us had a tough time growing up, and we struggle to imagine God as a perfect parent when all we've known is imperfect ones. But even if you haven't been protected like you should have been, God can reverse what you've been through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's it like to become a little child again, to allow yourself the kind of relationship with the Lord that you may have missed; to allow Him to heal and adjust the damaged places of your past? Here's what He told His people: 'I passed by and saw you kicking about...and as you lay there...I said to you, &quot;Live!&quot; I made you grow like a plant of the field. You grew up and developed and became...beautiful... I...covered your nakedness. I...entered into a covenant [a covenant is a relationship with an unbreakable promise] with you...and you became Mine. I bathed you with water and washed the blood from you and put ointments on you. I clothed you with an embroidered dress and put leather sandals on you. I dressed you in fine linen and covered you with costly garments.' (Ezekiel 16:6-10 NIV) It's a beautiful image of God stooping down to give special attention to you, to nurture you, and to give you a dignity that no one can take away. He's done that for you. Psalm 51:10 GNT says, 'Create a pure heart in me, O God, and put a new and loyal spirit in me.' God will never leave you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Ruth 1-4, Mark 9:38-50, Ps 18:30-50, Pr 12:25-28&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['... Motives are weighed by the Lord.' Proverbs 16:2 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think you're fooling God? Think He's too busy running the universe to notice little ole you? Nice try. He cares about everything in His creation and He's wearing Creator-Ray glasses (think X-ray on overdrive). And He has direct line-of-sight into your heart. So those secret thoughts, those sly intentions, those ulterior motives, yes, He sees them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Done a good deed and already looking forward to telling your mates about it? He sees. Sitting in church to boost people's opinions of you, but your heart's far from your Father? He sees. Helping the needy, but really sneakily greedy? He sees it all: name, time and place. Surprise, surprise, God sees right through the falsehoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible is full of people, including some of the amazing Bible heroes, messing up just like this. Check these verses for some examples: King David, guilty (2 Samuel 11). The nation of Israel, guilty (Isaiah 1:10-17). Peter, guilty (John 18:15-27). And there are a whole heap more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a good look at your heart. God does. Are the things that drive your thoughts and actions things that make the Father's heart sing over you with joy? Or have you allowed a Grand Canyon to open up between you? Wake up and smell the burning of His Creator-Ray-vision - it may cut deeper than youd like. This boils down to nothing more than keeping your relationship open and right with God, and it is definitely easier said than done. Set serious time aside today to ask Him where you need to get right with Him again. Write down the answers He shows you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Lev 23:15-22, Acts 2:1-18&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['The righteous choose their friends carefully...' Proverbs 12:26 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friendship is wonderful, but some friendships can be tricky affairs. If only there were a set of guidelines we could follow, some wise advice to help us know how to have the best friendships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proverbs 27 has some helpful tips on discerning the best relationships possible. 'Wounds from a sincere friend are better than many kisses from an enemy.' (Proverbs 27:6 NLT) That's a telling trust tip. '...When disaster strikes, you won't have to ask your brother for assistance.' (Proverbs 27:10 NLT) True friendship means you don't even have to ask - nice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about when things turn sour? The prophet Jeremiah was dismayed at how his people treated each another. He went as far as saying, 'Beware of your friends; do not trust anyone in your clan. For every one of them is a deceiver and every friend a slanderer. Friend deceives friend and no one speaks the truth.' (Jeremiah 9:4-5 NIV) Not feeling the love, eh? Another prophet Isaiah is not much more positive: 'Don't put your trust in mere humans. They are as frail as breath. What good are they?' (Isaiah 2:22 NLT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of today's reading is that it is good to be wise with your relationships. God's Word says it, and were strongly agreeing! Sometimes it's no bad thing to remember that God's the only one we can 100% rely on; and that actually, living that out is likely to improve your friendships rather than weaken them! It's good to remember that good friendship is a two-way street. Have a read of Colossians 3:12-14 to self-check how you relate to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Judges 1-3, Mark 10:1-12, Ps 88:1-9a, Pr 13:1-3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['... If [you]...overdrive them...[they] will die.' Genesis 33:13 KJV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Esau and Jacob were pretty different brothers with a very rocky relationship history. They were getting together to celebrate a record number of years without having a go at each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esau had a bit of a just-do-it attitude, telling his brother and his family: '... let us go...' (Genesis 33:12 NKJ) However, Jacob held back, knowing the family he had brought with him needed to rest: 'You go on ahead!' ... He explained his reasoning to Esau: '...The children are weak, and the flocks and herds which are nursing are with me... if the men should drive them hard... the flock will die... I will lead on slowly at a pace... the livestock... and the children, are able to endure...' (Genesis 33:13-14 NKJ) Jacob wasnt snubbing his already-strained relationship with his brother for no good reason, he was being realistic about his own people's abilities to cope, he was keeping things in balance. Jacob refused to take on too much (even if it seemed the best way forward at the time) and risk neglecting his family and straining the weaker ones who depended on him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible says: 'Don't look out only for your own interests, but take an interest in others too.' (Philippians 2:4 NLT) People are God's priorities. What about you? Are you being wise with where you put your energy? Are you moving too quickly to spend proper time with your family or with your friends who need you? Or are you the sort who likes to push things along (not that that's always wrong!), and right now you're pushing someone too hard? Maybe it's time to wise up?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Judges 4-6, Mark 10:13-22, Ps 88:9b-18, Pr 13:4-6&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['... They could not dwell together.' Genesis 13:6 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abraham and Lot were close partners in business. Then a problem arose: '...&lt;em&gt;Their possessions were so great that they could not dwell together. And there was strife between the herdsmen...'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(Genesis 13:6-7 NKJ) So Abraham said, &lt;em&gt;'Please separate from me. If you take the left, then I will go to the right...'&lt;/em&gt; (Genesis 13:9 NKJ) They realised the time had come to go their separate ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes friendships or relationships are only for certain seasons in your life and *newsflash* that's actually ok. The fact is, people change because of their experiences and the things that life throws at them. You may find that what was once a natural fit is a bit of a struggle now, doing more to damage you both than it is helping either of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Need some Bible tips on how to shape a good friendship? Here are five. (1) Proverbs 12:26 NIV - '&lt;em&gt;The righteous choose their friends carefully, but the way of the wicked leads them astray.'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(2) Proverbs 13:20 NIV - '&lt;em&gt;Walk with the wise and become wise, for a companion of fools suffers harm.'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(3) Proverbs 14:6-7 NIV - &lt;em&gt;'A mocker seeks wisdom and finds none, but knowledge comes easily to the discerning. Stay away from a fool for you will not find knowledge on their lips.'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(4) Proverbs 22:24-25 NIV - &lt;em&gt;'Do not make friends with a hot-tempered person, do not associate with one easily angered, or you may learn their ways and get yourself ensnared.'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(5) 1 Corinthians 15:33 NIV - &lt;em&gt;'Do not be misled:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Bad company corrupts good character.'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;So, how are your friendships looking? Today, ask God's opinion on them. Pray with your Bible open next to you, ask Him and listen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['...This is the victory that has overcome the world, even our faith.' 1 John 5:4 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the devil thought was his biggest victory - the death of Jesus - was actually God's greatest triumph! Victory over death! 'Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?' That's God 1, devil 0. God's won and we're on the right team. You don't have to win or come up with all the answers on your own or in your own strength. If you find yourself doing that you may not yet fully trust your Dad in Heaven to 'win' for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David said, 'Through You we push back our enemies; through Your name we trample our foes.' (Psalm 44:5 NIV) Faith is only as valuable as the thing it's placed in, and our faith should be in a God who never fails. Fact: we invest our lives where we invest our love. So: 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind.' (Luke 10:27 NIV) Jesus said, 'I have given you authority to...overcome all the power of the enemy...' (Luke 10:19 NIV) Paul said, 'Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us.' (Romans 8:35-37 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believe the truth about who you are in Christ. Know that you, through Christ, are fully equipped and in a place to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Judges 9:34-11:40, Mark 10:35-52, Ps 129, Pr 20:25, Ecc 5:4-6&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'... Stay within the [boundaries] of the work which God has set for [you]...' 2 Corinthians 10:13 GNT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's get something straight. &lt;em style=&quot;line-height: 18px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, serif; font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em style=&quot;line-height: 18px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, serif; font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;obody&lt;/em&gt; is good at everything and &lt;em style=&quot;line-height: 18px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, serif; font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;nobody&lt;/em&gt; is called to do everything. God has given each of us clearly defined roles in life. Paul understood that his job wasn't to achieve everything or try to please everyone, but to focus on what God had called and equipped &lt;em style=&quot;line-height: 18px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, serif; font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;him&lt;/em&gt; to do: 'Our goal is to stay within the [boundaries] of the work which God has set for us.' You want to be successful? You'll only manage it if you're doing what God wants you to (and, though it's sometimes opposite to the world's definition of success, God's is the only one worth considering in the long run).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep your eyes peeled: Satan will try to rob you of the joy of serving God by getting you to compare yourself with Brainy McSmarts, some celebrity Barbie-lookalike or even, for us Christians, some seemingly perfect super-saint in church. Satan loves pressuring you to fit into the expectations of others. Don't do it! (Insert slow-motion: &lt;em style=&quot;line-height: 18px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, serif; font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;'Nooooooo...'&lt;/em&gt;) You'll always find someone who &lt;em style=&quot;line-height: 18px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, serif; font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; to be doing a better job than you, and you'll become discouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's calling for your life is completely different from theirs: 'Our goal is to stay within the [boundaries] of the work which God has set for us.' The Bible says: 'Pay careful attention to your own work, for then you will get the satisfaction of a job well done, and you won't need to compare yourself to anyone else.' (Galatians 6:4 NLT) John Bunyan, author of the Christian classic, &lt;em style=&quot;line-height: 18px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, serif; font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;Pilgrim'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em style=&quot;line-height: 18px; font-family: Verdana, Arial, serif; font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;s Progress&lt;/em&gt;, wrote: 'If my life is fruitless it doesn't matter who praises me. And if my life is fruitful it doesn't matter who criticises me.' So, just do what God's called you to do!&lt;/p&gt;

<title><![CDATA[Why Have Courage?]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[why-have-courage]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Be strong and of good courage...' Deuteronomy 31:6 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever been in situations where courage just comes naturally to you? Usually, you're more likely to take heart and go for it if there's likely to be a worthwhile outcome to a situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at all the amazing things the disciples did in the book of Acts. Where did they find the motivation to preach to hostile crowds and face prison, beatings and rejection from their families? Obviously they knew that Jesus had their back. But it must be more than that! Here's the core of the matter: they knew that having the courage to do great, faith-inspired things would draw them so much nearer to Him their friend and companion, the God of the universe. They felt so moved to step out for Him that all other things faded in comparison. Wanting to honour God and to get closer to Him in relationship were things so precious to them that they would do anything short of sin to gain them. There's no other reason for courage in the Christian walk than these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's both behind us and before us - He's set us free so that we can have the courage to go to Him, and He stands ahead beckoning us towards Him in glorious relationship. Let's pluck up the nerve to take a risk for Him. Trusting in Him to come through for us, and then seeing Him do so, is a deep and satisfying interaction. It's like nothing else. Having courage and faith is pointless without anchoring it in Jesus - engaging in relationship with Him is the point of it all. If that's something you haven't done yet, perhaps now is the time!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Deut 25-27, Mark 8:1-13, Ps 44:9-16, Pr 12:10-11&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go...' Matthew 14:22 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you find yourself in the middle of hard times or trouble, do you sometimes think, 'I must have done something wrong - perhaps I've missed God's will and He's punishing me'? No. Troubles can come from all over the place and usually have nothing to do with our wrongdoing or God's punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about Jesus' disciples caught in the storm at sea. The disciples weren't in the storm by disobeying, but by obeying Jesus; not by rejecting God's will, but by embracing it. The Bible says, 'Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go...' - and they obeyed. Doing the right thing is not always the easiest thing. It can often mean going against the grain of what everyone else is doing or thinking by staying away from what's popular, easy or selfish. When that happens, here are some helpful lessons from the disciples' experience: (1) Obedience doesn't mean there won't be storms along the way. The disciples had just witnessed Jesus' handiwork with the loaves and fishes - you'd think they'd be bursting with faith. But when fear comes knocking, faith can take a nosedive. Jesus had told them He'd meet them on the other shore yet they forgot His miracle-working power and His promise and gave in to anxiety. God may not solve your problem in the way you want, but you can be sure He will show up in the middle of it. (2) Having fear doesn't mean you're a failure. It's just a reminder that you're human, and, like the disciples, you've forgotten Who has the power and Who's in charge. And these are lessons that transform your trial into triumph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood Mothers Day: Gal 5:22, Luke 19:11-26, Ps 36:5-9, Heb 10:19-23&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['The boat was... buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it.' Matthew 14:24 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a great little saying that goes like this: 'When you can't trace His hand, you can trust His heart.' It's a good thing to remember when you feel that God might have abandoned you. We can't always see precisely what God's doing to work all things together for good. But we are called to, walk by faith, not by sight. (2 Corinthians 5:7 NKJ)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where was Jesus while the disciples were freaking out on the water and fear was sloshing into their hearts? Actually, He was up a mountain praying for them. He wasn't taking a siesta. At every stage He was their mediator and their need meet-er and He's ours too. 'He always lives to intercede for [you].' (Hebrews 7:25 NIV) Can you imagine Jesus praying to the Father for His fear-filled mates in the boat? And can you imagine the Father refusing to answer His prayers? Never! 'The Spirit Himself intercedes for us...' (Romans 8:26 NIV) With both Jesus and the Holy Spirit talking to the Father on your behalf, your victory is guaranteed. (2) Between the command to 'Go' and your safe arrival on the other side, there's often a crisis. Jesus told them to cross to the other shore, but before they got there they were well shaken. What's shaking your life today - loss, guilt, loneliness, money problems, illness, addiction, rejection? When our faith is low and our fear high, we cry, 'If only I had (or hadn't)... If only I could...' Learn to trust God. It's not over until He says so. And He hasnt!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Deut 28-29, Mark 8:14-26, Ps 44:17-26, Pr 12:12-14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'God is... a very present help in trouble.' Psalm 46:1 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picture it one more time - a boat lashed by huge waves, 12 frightened disciples who thought they were going under. They forgot to look for Jesus to rescue them. Yet as the night advanced and things looked hopeless, '...Jesus went to them, walking on the sea.' (Matthew 14:25 NKJ) Did they rejoice? No, their fear intensified and they said, '...It's a ghost!' (Matthew 14:26 NKJ)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your fear can distort your perceptions and make you see the answer as just another problem. Often what appears a threat is actually a blessing about to be revealed. Look to Jesus in your time of fear; when He takes away the lesser it's always to give you the greater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very often, God's best requires facing something you fear. Jesus called Peter to come to Him. Deciding it was safer in the storm with Jesus than in the boat without Him, Peter took the plunge. But there's always a moment after you step out in faith when you hear, 'What if Im not up to this?' Peter heard it, and the waves began to engulf him. Panicked, he called and Jesus immediately rescued him. Peter wasn't drowning; he was learning and growing! When you walk by faith, even your failures will lead to success. So step out with Jesus; He won't let you drown. Rely on God more today. Do something today that's way out of your comfort zone - maybe it's offering to pray for someone's healing or giving your testimony.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and your plans will succeed.' Proverbs 16:3 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems like too good to be true, doesn't it? 'Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and your plans will succeed.' Now, it doesn't say, 'Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and your plans will succeed at once.' &lt;em&gt;Or without any effort on your part. Or without any mistakes along the way&lt;/em&gt;. God didn't say you wouldn't stumble. He just promises to pick you up when you do, dust you off, correct you when you need it and keep on keeping on with you. 'The Lord directs the steps of the godly... Though they stumble, they will never fall, for the Lord holds them by the hand.' (Psalm 37: 23-24 NLT) So don't get bent out of shape when things don't work out perfectly - by God's grace, you're still heading towards the goal He's helping you achieve. Remember: God can bring good out of bad situations. Out of the ashes of a disaster, He can create astonishing beauty. (That's one of the reasons why He's God!) 'God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God and are called according to His purpose for them.'(Romans 8:28 NLT) So, don't give up if you're hitting struggles and setbacks. Success awaits those who do not give up!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['... Be it known...that we will not...' Daniel 3:18 KJV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;All through life you'll come across people who will try to control you. Their threats can sound real, and the consequences of ignoring them, intimidating. Look at Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. Their commitment to God landed them in a fiery furnace hotter than the inside of a volcano. But it also promoted them to a place of huge blessing and influence. Their story in Daniel 3 teaches us that in a real test of character the outcome is not in your hands. You make the choice to do what is right before God and leave the consequences to Him. It's a trial by fire, but it's a fire of refinement, and on the other side of it you come out stronger. Each time you do the right thing, choosing to walk rather than escape the path God has called you on, you enter a new level of freedom. And as Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego discovered, three things happen: (1) You are set free from the 'Nebuchadnezzars' who claim to have control over the outcome of your life. (2) You are set free to say 'no' to those who would try to use and manipulate you. (3) You are set free to serve your all-powerful King and say 'no' to all the other pretenders who really have no power over you at all. In that moment you not only gain insight into who you are, but more importantly, Whose you are. And God will do one of two things: develop you in the fiery furnace or deliver you from it. He may even do both!&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['... Be it known...that we will not ...' Daniel 3:18 KJV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wonder what the final thoughts of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego were as they were carried towards the furnace? Perhaps there were a few last flashes of doubt as they were dragged to the ovens. Did Shadrach think, 'Nobody else is risking martyrdom - why should I?' Or what about Meshach? 'Better a live dog than a dead lion. If we stay alive, maybe we can do good for God and for others?' Possibly Abednego wavered as the heat began to warm his cheeks, 'Where are You, Lord?'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doubt, reason, self-pity can all impinge on our journey of faith, rightly or wrongly. But what's so commendable about this situation is that neither logic, nor emotion, nor circumstance could separate these Hebrew boys from their conviction in God. They were prepared to die for what they believed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a faith that goes down in history (whether that's earth's history books or Heaven's scrolls!), you'll need a priority list that has 'God' written at  Number 1. God must be the ruler of logic, fear, situation, danger - the lot. These guys put their faith on the line in the public domain with everyone watching. The result: a whole nation turned its heart back to God.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul said, 'I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.' (Philippians 4:13 NKJ) So if the spotlight ever turns on you, do you want to be able to stand strong with God? Those who answered 'yes' had best get ready for the flames. In your prayer times today, ask God to increase your capacity to grow and your capacity to cope.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['David inquired again of God...' 1 Chronicles 14:14 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picture this: the Commander-in-Chief of the Australian Army holds a phone to his ear. The enemy's closing in. Fighter jets are tearing through the sky. Battleships are moving in. And still the Prime Minister refuses to act. 'Prime Minister, this is a red alert,' the head of the army bawls into the phone. 'If we don't fight back now; Australia will be enemy-occupied territory. When do you want us to issue orders to attack?' 'Not yet,' a cool-headed PM replies. 'Then when?' There is a pause, as if the PM is listening to a higher power. 'When you hear the sound of leaves rustling in the treetops - then you will know it is the moment to move. Then and only then, give the signal!' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, right! Yet David does almost exactly this in 1 Chronicles 14 (check it out for yourself). So attuned to God is this giant-slayer that he is willing to ignore all danger signs in favour of an odd piece of strategy, dreamed up through prayer. David gets his victory because he will not make a move without first consulting God. David waited upon a sound. He knew the voice of God so well he could recognise it in the movement of mulberry bushes. David put faith over logic. He knew God would not fail him - the real question was, would he fail God? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: When God speaks (compare His words with the Bible to check it sounds like Him!), no matter how bizarre the request, follow it through. &lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['God...made Jesus perfect by suffering.' Hebrews 2:10 CEV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bible says, 'God...made Jesus perfect by suffering.' Pain is a learning experience. A friend cheats on us, an illness steals our youth, a parent abandons us - none of us escapes pain. Even 'Jesus...had to suffer before He could learn what it really means to obey God.' (Hebrews 5:8 CEV) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philip Yancey writes: 'God understood physical pain, having designed the marvellous nervous system that warns against harm... In thirty-three years on earth Jesus learned about hardship, rejection and betrayal. And He learned too about pain: what it feels like to have an accuser leave the red imprint of his fingers on your face...to have a crude iron spike pounded through muscle, tendon, and bone. On earth, the Son of God learned all that.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus took His degree in suffering. A lone man abandoned by His friends, nailed naked on a cross - at one point He even feels abandoned by God. Everything He has lived for seemed lost. And when we cry at the storm clouds, 'God, where are You?' we know Jesus has been there too. By joining us on earth, Jesus gave visible, historical proof that God hears our groans and groans along with us. Suffering isn't the last word, resurrection is. &lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['God...made Jesus perfect by suffering.' Hebrews 2:10 CEV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The angel of death passed over every home smeared with lamb or goat blood. Yet that was specific to that particular story in the Bible (find it in Exodus 12). Cancer doesn't skip your house just because there's a 'Shalom' sign hung on the wall. Debt doesn't leave you alone just because there is a Christian fish sticker on your car bumper. Weekly attendance at church doesn't send suffering an 'excuse me' note. The best of us will have our dose of pain. It's part and parcel of the ride. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus gives Peter a verbal slap-on-the-wrist when he suggests that Christ should not suffer, 'Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block...you do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men...If anyone would come after Me, he must deny himself...take up his cross.' (Matthew 16:23-24 NIV) Harsh words. But let's not be surprised when misery knocks on our door. Jesus has promised it. God uses suffering to make us more Christ-like. 'It was good that I had to suffer in order to learn Your laws.' (Psalm 119:71 GWT) Remember, it's by His wounds we are healed (Isaiah 53:5) and by His weakness that we are made strong.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['... Keep your conscience clear...' 1 Timothy 1:19 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul insists we know the difference between right and wrong. No matter what advantages there are in twisting our sense of right, Paul warns us to stay God's side of the fence. He lays it on the line to Timothy: 'Cling to your faith in Christ, and keep your conscience clear. For some people have deliberately violated their consciences; as a result, their faith has been shipwrecked.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a captain doesn't set out to wreck his ship. But if he falls asleep at the wheel or takes his eye off the compass, he will end up on the rocks anyway. The question is not, 'Can I get away with it?' No, the question is, 'Can I live with it afterwards? How will it affect my confidence before God? How does He feel about it? Who am I trying to please?' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Romans 14:23 NLT, he gives another warning: 'But if people have doubts about whether they should [do] something, they shouldn't [do] it. They would be condemned for not acting in faith before God. If you do anything you believe is not right, you are sinning.' After all what good is it to receive everybody's respect but not deserve it? Keep your life clean and clear before God.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Cross-examine me, O Lord...' Psalm 26:2 TLB&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a story about a guy named Bill. He phoned his boss and said: 'I believe you're looking for an experienced, talented, hard-working manager for your office. I'd like to apply for the position.' The boss replied, 'We already have someone in that job and he's excellent. By the way, your voice sounds familiar. Do I know you?' The guy replied, 'It's me Bill; I was just checking up on myself!' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like Bill, you need to check up on yourself regularly. You need to invite God to cross-examine every detail of your case, scrutinise the facts, expose any corruption and get to the truth, no matter how deep He has to dig. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we invite the Holy Spirit to scrutinise us, He makes us aware of the stuff that doesn't add up. The dirty secrets we'd like to keep dead and buried rise to the top. Confronted with our darkness and sin, we have some options: to justify why we did it or to ask God to deal with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Psalmist prayed: 'I have tried to keep Your laws and have trusted You without wavering. Cross-examine me, O Lord...test my motives and affections too. For I have taken Your loving-kindness and Your truth as my ideals.' (Psalm 26:1-3 TLB) It may not be nice facing up to our sin but it certainly benefits us. Confession opens up forgiveness. And forgiveness sets a prisoner free: you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Dan 11-12, Matt 9:14-26, Ps 89:38-52, Pr 3:1-2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and your plans will succeed.' Proverbs 16:3 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;By now, you've probably been warned a few times about the perils and pitfalls of making a bad decision. And that's wise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sometimes paralysis - just sitting there and not making that all-important decision - can be just as risky. Picture a donkey standing between two bales of hay, unable to decide which one to eat and afraid of making the wrong choice. Eventually he just starves to death!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how can you avoid being an ass? (1) &lt;em&gt;Stop trying to please everybody&lt;/em&gt;. 'Fear of man is a dangerous trap, but to trust in God means safety.' (Proverbs 29:25 TLB) Once you know God's will, don't be thrown off track by others. (2) &lt;em&gt;When God is on your side, you'll succeed&lt;/em&gt;. Fear of failure can stop you going places but fear is just an emotion. God's Word, on the other hand, is unshakeable: 'Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and your plans will succeed.' (Proverbs 16:3 NIV) (3) &lt;em&gt;Stay in tune, stay on track&lt;/em&gt;. As long as you keep close to God in prayer, your steps can't fail. 'I am the light of the world. Whoever follows Me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.' (John 8:12 NIV) So pray!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.' Romans 10:17 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millions of people around the world foolishly depend on horoscopes for their daily dose of wisdom. They see the Bible as old and outdated and so would rather put their trust in an unknown group of people who'll interpret the movements of exploding spheres of gas zillions of kilometres away to advise them on whether they'll have a good or bad day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust a bunch of strangers or turn to God? Tough choice! There is so much wisdom in the Bible and you don't even need special training (although that's a good idea too). You can start simply by opening it. In it you'll find the stories of God's dealings with people throughout history. It's a book that has repeatedly proven helpful in grounding, correcting and inspiring countless people for thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest celebrity songsters may have the odd clever sound byte, but will we be combing the lyrics of pop-stars for life guidance in two thousand years time? True, the Bible is longer than the average song. But, did you know it is possible to read the entire New Testament in a month by reading just nine chapters every day? No more excuses - get stuck into your Bible!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a helpful checklist: (1) Find a translation that floats your boat. (2) Don't use it as a lucky dip - have a systematic plan. (3) Follow the plan but don't have a guilt trip if you miss a day. If you start SoulFood today, you'll have read your whole Bible in a year. (4) Expect that God will speak to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['...To equip God's people to do His work...' Ephesians 4:12 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;'The church is full of hypocrites besides, it's your relationship with God that counts.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it's true that, ultimately, your relationship with God is what counts God has put His Spirit in each of us, and as Christians, we are given the amazing gift of partaking 'in the divine nature.' (2 Peter 1:4 ESV) Part of what that means is that when Christians gather together, we experience the presence of Christ by being a part of His Body. Yup - the Bible's straight up about calling the Church 'Christ's Body'. And God tells us plainly to 'love Me, love My Church'. That's because the Church is the God-chosen, God-inspired, God-lived-in plan for the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think you're too good for the Church, you may have some serious pride issues to talk to God about. The word 'Church' is today's version of the Greek word 'ekklesia' in the New Testament: &lt;i&gt;assembly&lt;/i&gt;. That means &lt;i&gt;meeting&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;together as a group&lt;/i&gt;. It's hard to assemble on your own - imagine how disappointing &lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Avengers&lt;/i&gt; would've been if only &lt;i&gt;Captain America &lt;/i&gt;turned up! God works through us as a people. Everyone plays their part. When the disciples faced a hungry crowd who'd spent the day listening to Jesus, they were a bit put out when Jesus sent the ball back into their court saying, '&lt;i&gt;You &lt;/i&gt;feed them.' (Mark 6:37 NLT) It's the same for your church. If there are needs in your church that aren't being met, why not try and meet them yourself! Your leader's job is to, 'equip God's people to do His work and build up the Church, the body of Christ.' (Ephesians 4:12 NLT) So roll up your sleeves and get stuck in - you are the Church!&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Therefore, pray...Our Father in Heaven...' Matthew 6:9 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disciples genuinely wanted to get close to God, but they didn't always know how. However they did know Jesus would hold the key. Their request has left us the most beautiful prayer ever. (1) &lt;em&gt;'Our Father in Heaven.'&lt;/em&gt; When you say, 'Father' you're acknowledging that you're 'family', that you have a special relationship with God which entitles you to go to Him at any time, confident you're loved, welcomed and assured of His favour. When you say, 'in Heaven,' you can go no higher. You're putting your request to the ultimate source of goodness, grace, mercy, provision, protection and authority. What a privilege! (2) &lt;em&gt;'Hallowed be Your name.'&lt;/em&gt; (Matthew 6:9 NKJ) Whatever you do today, whether in thought, word or deed, let it honour God. People should be able to look at your life and want to become acquainted with the One you serve. (3)&lt;em&gt; 'Your Kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in Heaven.'&lt;/em&gt; (Matthew 6:10 NKJ) Each time you choose to say no to yourself and yes to God's will, you demonstrate to a watching world what it means to live as a citizen of His Kingdom. Note the words, 'as it is in Heaven.' Is anyone in Heaven fearful or doubting? Stubborn or disobedient? Critical or negative? When you come across something that's contrary to God's will, you have the authority to rise up and say, 'If it's not done and approved in Heaven it has no place in my life here on earth.' The one thing Satan hopes you never discover is that you have the God-given authority to restrict his movements in your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['... Give us this day our daily bread...' Matthew 6:11 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fresh bread mmm... that lovely smell that wafts from the bakery... Jesus taught, 'Give us this day our daily bread.' Notice the word 'daily'. That's because you can't fight today's battles on the strength of yesterday's bread. In the wilderness God's people were only permitted to collect enough manna for one day. If they tried to collect more, it rotted. It's wonderful to talk about what God did yesterday and what He's going to do tomorrow, but all you've got is today.&lt;em&gt; 'Give us this day our daily bread.'&lt;/em&gt; What God's provided for you today is what you need to stand up to the challenges you face. This prayer is an expression of faith. The very act of asking shows you believe God's got what you need and that He cares enough to provide for you. It says, 'I don't need to go to anybody else but You, Lord.' So turn off your phone, computer and TV, shut the door, get down on your knees, approach God in faith and pray, 'Give me what I need for this day.' God knows what you need, you don't! And He'll provide for you today so you'll be able to handle whatever life throws at you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If people start getting on your nerves for no apparent reason or you start having all sorts of mood swings or you find yourself living by &lt;em&gt;feelings&lt;/em&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;faith&lt;/em&gt;, it's probably because you're not eating right. It's time to go back to your Source and say, 'Lord, I've come for my daily bread.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['...Forgive us...as we forgive...' Matthew 6:12 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, so good with our trip through the Lord's Prayer. We've reminded ourselves that God is our Father and He wants what is best for us. We've thought about being dependent on our heavenly Father as He provides bread for us both physically and spiritually. And today Jesus asks us to think about speaking well of the people who have crushed and stamped on our hearts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry, run that last one by us again, Jesus? Surely you mean us to pray for God to send a lightning bolt to zap our enemies, right? Surely there's a typo in your words, 'Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors'? We can live with the first bit - we've run up enormous debts against God, but He forgives us. But what's that about me forgiving that vermin who's ruined my life? Are you serious?! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus majors on extending mercy to those who don't deserve it. After all, where would we be if God held a grudge? So Jesus wants us to practice letting go of our grudges. There is no resentment in Heaven and God wants us to start living like that now on earth. Ask the Holy Spirit to help you forgive the person who has wronged you. If you're feeling even braver, ask God to doubly bless them - that really is what Jesus loves!&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['... Deliver us from the evil one...' Matthew 6:13 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our last look at the Lord's Prayer starts with a question: What do you pray when temptation is crawling up your collar? Answer: 'Do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one...' (Matthew 6:13 NKJ)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not God who dangles the carrot of temptation: we have certain pulls and desires within us, and Satan wants to jump on them. Therefore we pray for God to save us from ourselves and to deliver us, or rescue us, from the evil one's exploitative traps. Here's the good news then: if we bring our weaknesses to God, not only does He work on our behalf; in the process we get closer to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul had this one sussed: 'I am glad to boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may work through me.' (2 Corinthians 12:9 NLT) Paul actually boasts - yes, boasts! - about his weaknesses: '...to keep me from being puffed up with pride...I was given a painful physical ailment, which acts as Satan's messenger to...keep me from being proud...' (2 Corinthians 12:7 GNT) You'll often find a weakness attached to strength, acting as a governor to keep you from becoming boastful or running ahead of God. Gideon chose 32,000 men to fight the Midianites, but God reduced his numbers to 300 (see Judges 7). Why? So that Israel would know it was God's power and not their own that saved them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your most painful area of weakness CAN become your area of greatest strength: so, pray into it, hard, and watch yourself walk more and more closely with God at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...No man ever spoke like this Man!' John 7:46 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The power of words: words can be like a mask you hide behind; words can set a spark in someone's heart; words can cut a scar into another; words can comfort; words can destroy; words send the tanks in; words sign the peace treaty; the world turns on words. It's no surprise then that John starts his Gospel off referring to Jesus as the Word of God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think for a second about the power of Jesus' words: ordinary uneducated fishermen sparked a revolution that is still unfolding today because of these words; monks would spend all night by candlelight turning over these words in their minds; slave-traders would unlock shackles at the force of these words; cathedrals, paintings, frescoes, poems, plays, books and films would shoot into existence inspired by these words; the Salvation Army would create a blueprint for the modern welfare system stirred by these words; alcoholics put down bottles, cancers pack their bags, addicts bin their needles - and all because of Jesus' words. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;History shows that words change people. And words can change you too - if you let them. Which of Jesus words are your favourites? Journal them or write them in a place that you'll return to, and open yourself up to being changed by them. Then when you need inspiration, a pick-me-up, comfort, healing, truth or encouragement - choose one of those highlighted diamonds from the mind of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['You have...put a wall of protection around him.' Job 1:10 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Job was at his wit's end. His body was in excruciating pain with scabs and broken flesh where disease had eaten away at him. He was exhausted from the sleepless nights when dark thoughts raced around his mind. Grief weighed down like a stone on his chest. His marriage was in tatters, his children all dead when they'd gone to a party and the roof had collapsed on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He'd obeyed God all his life. Surely that should have counted for something? Why was God punishing him? It didn't make sense. God had always protected him previously. But the situation was so bad, death couldn't be any worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At last, seemingly long overdue, God stepped into the picture, armed with healing and restoration. Finally, the breath of resurrection blew into the room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the same promise is for you when your world crumbles around you. When your mind, your health, or your relationships are attacked, the pain is raw and real. But it's only for a time. God won't allow more pain than you can possibly endure. Just when you think it's impossible to take any more, the breath of resurrection will blow into your room. God's promises are true. 'He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.' (Psalm 147:3 NIV) And... 'Blessed is the one who perseveres under trial because, having stood the test, that person will receive the crown of life that the Lord has promised to those who love Him.' James 1:12 (NIV)&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...he struck three times, and stopped.' 2 Kings 13:18 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's start with an unusual story from the Old Testament. A prophet of God came to the king of Israel who, at the time, was worried about losing in battle. The prophet told the king to get some arrows and strike the ground. Strange instructions! But the king gave up quickly: 'He struck it three times and stopped. The man of God was angry with him and said, &quot;You should have struck the ground five or six times; then you would have defeated [the enemy] and completely destroyed it.&quot;'(2 Kings 13:18-19 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's going on in this story? This message is simple: &lt;i&gt;How&lt;/i&gt; you do something is as important as doing it. The means to an end are as important as the end itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this mean for us? God's priorities haven't changed, He desires obedience in every area of our lives. He is gracious with us, but it is in our best interests to listen to His instructions. And His instructions are simply this - to live our lives in love. Paul wrote, '...if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.' (1 Corinthians 13:2 ESV) If we live in love, we take the time to think deeply about the most Christ-like way forward. Love puts people first, above projects, above goals and tasks. It thinks about the means, not just the end. So, if you're worrying, or tempted to do something half-heartedly - stop! Take a step back and think about God's priorities. &lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['This is the day the Lord has made.' Psalm 118:24 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever happened yesterday, it's gone. It's finished. Whatever happens tomorrow is null and void because you're not there yet. Today is a brand spanking new day that God has made for us to enjoy. You can live your life in a whole new way by sticking with this attitude: scrap two days from your mind - yesterday and tomorrow - and just focus on today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's right in front of you today? Who can you bless? Can you learn patience, gentleness, kindness from your experiences, even in the next few hours? Will you look closely at what's in front of you each day? If you do, maybe you'll see familiar situations and people in a new light. You might find yourself starting to understand how you can make a difference. You'll even find that living the right way today takes care of a surprising amount of tomorrow. That old exhortation to 'seize the day' simply means taking a careful look at what's around you, who's near you, and what situations you're already involved in. Invest time and character into them, and you won't go to bed feeling like you've wasted the day. Look to help those around you, and look to God to help you with it; but don't be tempted to waste the day in couch potato land which, let's face it, usually leaves you feeling limper than warm lettuce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1 Samuel 3:9 NLT, Eli told Samuel to say the most basic of prayers, 'Speak, Lord, Your servant is listening.' Pray that prayer, and focus on what God has to say to you today.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['I desire to do Your will, O my God.' Psalm 40:8 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's one thing you can be sure of: God wants you to spend a large amount of time helping and blessing people. How could He not? Jesus, who had the best possible relationship with the Father, didn't just pop down to earth to complete His mission and scoot off. No, His journey to the cross followed on from a life of tremendous love and grace focused on others. We are called to live the same way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, 'If any of you wants to be My follower, you must turn from your selfish ways, take up your cross, and follow Me. If you try to hang on to your life, you will lose it. But if you give up your life for My sake, you will save it.' (Matthew 16:24-25 NLT) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a tricky calling, and Christians can be easily distracted from it. It is possible to focus only on our own dreams and visions - the danger there is that if we go too far that way, we will puff up our ego, promote our self-importance and nothing more. Dreams and visions aren't worthy of your life if they don't bless others, and even a good dream can get in the way of valuing others. So, don't start with goals and targets. Focus first on loving God and loving others. Trust that God's a great driver with a great destination in mind for your life. He knows better than anyone what you've got to give and how best to use it. So while you're on that journey, &lt;i&gt;love&lt;/i&gt;. This might mean scaling back on some of your commitments, or things you do often, in order to focus on God's 'first things first'.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Be an example...' 1 Timothy 4:12 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter where an Australian embassy is located, the building and land it occupies is classed as sovereign to 'Australia'. Each embassy is a tiny Aussie outpost in a foreign country. Inside the embassies, government officials are on hand, ready to help out Aussie citizens living locally or to act on behalf of the Australian government in its international relations. When a foreign nation's leader summons the local Aussie ambassador for a meeting, that leader is talking to the official representative of the Prime Minister of Australia, and the Australian government. Ambassadors 'represent' in a very big way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we are 'in Christ', we are an example of Christ. That's big. There should be something different about us. Of course, we're a work-in-progress for Christ-likeness, so we're not the finished article yet. But we are supposed to represent Him, just like an ambassador. That means when people interact with us, we are the local representation or ambassador for Jesus. That's a huge responsibility and should mean people see a difference in the way we live and the way we behave. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Paul says, 'be an example,' he is basically saying, 'When you talk about Jesus, people should actually see Jesus. Not just hear words &lt;i&gt;about&lt;/i&gt; Him. Then they'll desire to know Him and be pulled to Him. When you talk about faith, the evidence of it in your life should be so compelling that they want to live by it.' &lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Be an example...in...speech...' 1 Timothy 4:12 GNT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's all fine and dandy to be told to 'be an example'. But how, and where? Let's break it down over the next few days and look at a few different areas. We'll start with our speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your words give voice to what's going on in your heart (see Matthew 12:34). And once the words have been said, there's no taking them back - spoken words are out there like a stubborn stain on our clothes and 'sorry' doesn't always work like &lt;i&gt;Vanish&lt;/i&gt;. You may need to rebuild and repair the trust in your relationship. That can take time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible says: 'May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing to You, O Lord.' (Psalm 19:14 NLT) This means that there should be a clear path from your transformed heart to your mouth. So chew on your words and figure out the taste of them before you let them out your mouth. Think them over. Christ's words brought life; do yours? Will your words swing towards war, or peace? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we can be 'generally' good but fall down in our dealings with one or two specific people. If there's someone in your life you need to 'tame your tongue' around, study the book of Proverbs about the power of words. Try Proverbs 21:23, 25:23, 29:20 for starters. &lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Be an example...in conduct...' 1 Timothy 4:12 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;How we act tells other people just who we're listening to. Look at the story of Noah in the Bible. He set about building an ark of mammoth proportions to save his family and all the species living on the earth. All around him were people who thought he'd utterly lost it! Still, he chose not to listen to them. He carried on listening to God, and his actions eventually saved the lives of his whole family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that wasn't the end of the story. Noah's character really shone through immediately &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; the flood. The first thing he did when it was all over was to build an altar to the Lord to show how grateful he was. An altar, even before a home. He gave thanks before doing anything else. We all have homes, we're provided with food, air, and a ground to walk on; but many of us don't even make time to say thanks to God.  '...all our busy rushing ends in nothing.' (Psalm 39:6 NLT) So let gratitude shape the way you live your life. The Bible says, 'Don't copy the behaviour and customs of this world, but let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think.' (Romans 12:2 NLT).  Jesus tells us that our life is filled with examples of God's care for us. (See Matthew 6:28-34) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything beautiful begins with God. Every good thing in your life has its start in Him. Recognise the gifts from God in your life. There is enough time today for you to give Him thanks. &lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Be an example...in love...' 1 Timothy 4:12 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all honesty, it's hard to find all people lovable, all the time. Disillusioned with people? We all can be, and that's simply because people are difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pastor of a big church tells a story of a time when he was stuck in a lift with a very drunk, vomiting man. Eager to get out of the situation as fast as possible, the pastor made his escape and walked back to his room, all the while mentally criticising the guy. But that night, God spoke to him about it. He said, 'You laughed at him, but I loved him enough to die for him.' Ouch. Relying on our willpower to love others isn't enough, because it will fail us, and those around us. We're left with no other choice here - we must connect to God's source of love. The same love that died for 'the least' and 'the worst', and treated them as human beings, not things. 'Love means doing what God has commanded us, and He has commanded us to love one another, just as you heard from the beginning.' (2 John 1:6 NLT) Matthew 5:43-44 shows us the radical way Jesus asks us to treat people: &lt;i&gt;love your enemies, pray for those who persecute you&lt;/i&gt;. Ask God to speak to you about specific people in your life and pray for the ability to live this out towards them. &lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Be an example...in spirit...' 1 Timothy 4:12 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In New Testament times the religious people would often look down on the non-religious, thinking they were beneath them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's upsetting to be treated with contempt, and that's how Jesus' disciples felt when they were turned away from a Samaritan village, just for being Jewish. As Jesus' nearest and dearest, you might have expected them to respond with humility and forgiveness. Not quite - the story in Luke 9 records the disciples asking Jesus for a vengeful jet of fire from Heaven! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Jesus fired this back at them: 'You do not know what...spirit you are of.' (Luke 9:54-55 NKJ) They thought they were doing what God would have wanted, or at least asking for something to please Him. But they weren't. Jesus told them they were missing the mark big time. So we too should take a closer look at how we respond to people. Do we want immediate vengeance if we're insulted? Are we really responding with God's Spirit? God's Spirit is one of unbroken forgiveness, unusual kindness, and wide, wide mercy. It always focuses on the good of others. And it has the bigger picture in mind, too: Jesus said, 'Blessed are you when men hate you, and when they exclude you, and revile you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of Man's sake. Rejoice... your reward is great in Heaven.' (Luke 6:22-23 NKJ) It's difficult to instantly love your enemies but we can start by including them in our prayers.  &lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Be an example...in faith...' 1 Timothy 4:12 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be easy to sit back and switch off your critical faculties in your uni lecture or even at church and automatically accept every word being said is true. &lt;i&gt;'They're the experts, they've written the textbook, they're in the pulpit - they must know what they're on about, right?'&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But who and what do you ultimately put your faith in? As much as we should respect our God-given leaders, we should never assume they are right all the time. Every human makes mistakes, and your lecturer or pastor should be the first to admit that for themselves! Our faith comes from Jesus. So we ultimately put our faith in Him&lt;i&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;not a human being. If we're unsure about something, we have the right to go back to God, read the Bible and check it out. It's ok (in fact, it's very good!) to question things that don't seem right to you - if you keep praying to God and talking to wise people, what is true will stick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Christians in the city of Berea didn't just take Paul's word for it, they 'received the word with all readiness, and searched the Scriptures daily to find out whether these things were so.' (Acts 17:11 NKJ) Let's do this! Sermons and books are important, but God's Word is our ultimate benchmark. So, whenever you hear something in a lecture or sermon you're not sure about, make a note of it in your journal and check it against the Bible. Get into the habit of 'searching the Scriptures' and weighing up what you hear.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Be an example...in purity...' 1 Timothy 4:12 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;'So I bought this t-shirt with &lt;i&gt;Purity&lt;/i&gt; written in gold, this silver ring that says &lt;i&gt;Say No To Lust&lt;/i&gt; and this amazing worship CD called &lt;i&gt;Pure Praise&lt;/i&gt; which just makes me want to meditate on God's pure love for me and my new found purity in Him. I'm now pretty much totally purified. Pure pure pure. Only problem is, when I left the shop my eye and my mind wandered off again...' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can put on or buy a whole heap of stuff to make us feel pure, but really we are pure only by Jesus' blood. Nothing else. Living in this truth, we need to set our minds on all that pleases Him. Regular Bible reading, particularly in the New Testament, helps us pin down the things we need ask God's forgiveness for. 'Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is.' (Romans 12:2 NIV) Don't let yourself separate the spiritual challenge from the physical challenge in that verse: this is a whole-life transformation; it's about every bit of you. It describes the change in you, and should change all of you. Ask God to show you where you're still fitting into worldly patterns and praise Him for His transforming power.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Nor give place to the devil.' Ephesians 4:27 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In every person's life Satan is looking for opportunities as he lurks behind the scenes trying to take centre stage. And just like the pantomime villain, Satan himself has many disguises. It says in the Bible he can morph into 'an angel of light.' (2 Corinthians 11:14 NKJ) But whatever appealing things Satan may offer up on his platter, his endgame is always the same: 'to steal and kill and destroy.' (John 10:10 NIV) Destroy what? You name it: peace of mind, destiny, relationships... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satan may be waiting in the wings of our lives, but the good news is you have power and authority to resist him and rest in the victory over him that Christ has won. How? In three ways: (1) Don't fear him. 'The Lord will keep you from all harm11 - He will watch over your life.' (Psalm 121:7 NIV) Throughout the New Testament, it says we are 'in Christ'. For Satan to get to you, He needs to get through God first! (2) Don't give Satan room. Laying down the welcome mat for him to wipe his feet in your thought life won't help. Sinful thoughts usually come before sinful actions. So, just as you have been placed 'in Christ', be sure to remind yourself that Jesus is living inside of you. Keep close to Him in prayer. (3) Take charge of your actions. Choose a verse to learn by heart, so that when sinful thoughts come to mind, you make a habit of replacing them straight away with ones fit for our King. &lt;/p&gt;

<alias><![CDATA[abounding]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Always abounding in the work of the Lord.' 1 Corinthians 15:58 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abounding is an old-fashioned word, but it simply means 'overflowing'. Outside of our life in Jesus, we are abounding with sin. There are no boundaries there, we rule by our own impulses and desires. We are kings of our own private jungles, rather than living and working for the King of Kings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that felt like a trip down memory lane for you, it wasn't meant to make you feel guilty, but grateful. It's good to remember how far you've come since Jesus took over your life, and keep in mind where God has brought you to. Because what was His solution for your sin? Abounding grace: 'Where sin abounded, grace abounded much more.' (Romans 5:20 NKJ) Amazing. Really, &lt;i&gt;amazing.&lt;/i&gt; God welcomed you into His amazing family with open arms rather than an angry heart, and showered you with love and blessings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What should be my response to that?&lt;/i&gt; How would you react if you were welcomed into a warm, kind family? Sit down. Rest. God's deepest desire is not that you run around serving Him (He doesn't need you to!), but that you would let Him love you. When you live like that, in His abounding grace, you'll then naturally want to 'abound in the work of the Lord'! You'll be able to serve '...enthusiastically for the Lord, for you know that nothing you do for the Lord is ever useless.' (1 Corinthians 15:58 NLT) So today &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;serve&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; in an enthusiastic response to His love. &lt;/p&gt;

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Do not worry...' Matthew 6:31 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Don't worry, be happy!' isn't always the most practical piece of advice. But imagine if we could actually exterminate worry from our minds completely. It must be possible for us not to worry, because it's a command from Jesus: 'Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life.' (Matthew 6:25 NIV) And God doesn't set us up to fail in this instance. Quite the opposite - in these sorts of things, He sets us up to be conquerors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here's a practical step to help you along. If we're going to quit our worrying, we can't just leave a gaping hole where worry has been. The secret is to replace it with God's Word and turn our worries into prayers. If you've said or done something that you really regret and wish you hadn't, what should you do? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is to pray for forgiveness, while trusting that God can work all things for good. He promises to do that, and also to help you learn from it. For example, if you're worried about having said something you shouldn't, instead of letting your worries tumble on and on all day, pray that God will prepare that person's heart for the next time you see them, and ask that it can be mended. You'll come out of it all a wiser person, and you might even get a better friendship out of it. &lt;/p&gt;

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Jesus was...tempted...' Matthew 4:1 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are two questions answered in the story of Jesus' temptation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question 1 - &lt;i&gt;Are some people immune to temptation?&lt;/i&gt; Well, if Jesus was tempted, we've got no chance of getting away from it! Temptation is just one of those things that comes with being human. But Jesus did overcome it, and so we can too. The answer is not just to pray for it to go away, '&lt;i&gt;Lord, please take away all temptations so I can merrily skip from moment to moment, with nothing ever getting in the way!'&lt;/i&gt; No, Satan used all manner of ways and means to tempt Jesus, and you'll get the same treatment. Being tempted doesn't mean you're not in the will of God. It may mean that Satan (or his cronies) is nipping at your heels to stop you. So, 'Put on the full armour of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes.' (Ephesians 6:11 NIV) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question 2 - &lt;i&gt;When are you most likely to be tempted?&lt;/i&gt; Jesus was tempted just after His baptism, where Heaven opened and God publicly announced the arrival of His Son. If God appears to be moving in your life, don't think you've suddenly got it all together - that could be the perfect moment for the enemy to move in. Rather, sudden and unwanted temptation may be a sign you are growing closer to God! After the devil tried and failed to defeat Jesus we read, 'Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee...' (Luke 4:14 NKJ) And you will too! As you read the story of full story Jesus' temptation in Matthew 4, notice the importance of knowing Scripture like Jesus did.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Each one is tempted...' James 1:14 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Satan took a special trip out into the wilderness to tempt Jesus to obey him. He even used the Word of God to attack three 'hotspots' of human nature: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) &lt;i&gt;Need&lt;/i&gt;: 'If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.' (Matthew 4:3 NIV) This taps into one of our biggest fears - that if we don't look after ourselves, no one else will. Jesus had been fasting for forty days. Satan went straight in for what he hoped would be His biggest weakness. (2) &lt;i&gt;Protection&lt;/i&gt;: 'If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down. For it is written: &quot;He will command His angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands.&quot;' (Matthew 4:5-6 NIV) This hits another fear: will God protect us? The truth is laid out in the Psalms: '...in the day of trouble He will keep me safe in His dwelling.' (Psalm 27:5 NIV) (3) &lt;i&gt;Power&lt;/i&gt;: 'The devil...showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendour. &quot;All this I will give you if you will bow down and worship me.&quot; Jesus said to him, &quot;Away from Me, Satan! For it is written: 'Worship the Lord your God, and serve Him only.'&quot;' (Matthew 4:8-10 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's nothing wrong with wanting our needs to be met, wanting protection, or being in a position of authority! God is sovereign over it all. But what &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; dangerous, is looking for them from other people and other places, rather than from God alone. Jesus' response to temptation (Matthew 4:1-11) is to always bring His attention back to God and that's a pattern for us to follow. &lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life...' 1 John 2:16 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lust is not confined to just a &lt;i&gt;sexual&lt;/i&gt; thing. &lt;i&gt;Lust&lt;/i&gt; can describe anything we are obsessed with - anything that consumes our thoughts in a way that's not holy. It can be broken down into three categories: lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, and pride. 'When the woman saw that the tree was good for food (lust of the flesh), that it was pleasant to the eyes (lust of the eyes), and a tree desirable to make one wise (pride), she took of its fruit.' (Genesis 3:6 NKJ) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lust of the flesh is a desire for anything you'd throw all your money away on, take for your own gain or would rob your integrity. Lust of the eyes is about wanting such a visual feast you abandon any self-control. Dwell on that desire too long and by the time you're thinking clearly, you could be saying goodbye to valuable relationships and opportunities. Pride is when we look at ourselves rather than God for success - when we're right and everyone else is wrong, when we blame others rather than taking any responsibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So those are three very different kinds of temptation, and our strategy should always be the same: bolt the doors; don't be tempted to take a peek. The life God has for you is broader, better and kinder to you. But you won't see it if you're stuck in temptation. Sometimes we need to go as far as setting up physical boundaries to stop into losing to temptation. For example, could you set up an accountability buddy to receive emails of what you've been looking at on the internet? (www.x3watch.com has a paid (or free) email accountability system.)&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['I will...tell you...things you do not know.' Jeremiah 33:3 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is anything too hard for God? It can be easy for your head to answer 'no', but try asking your heart what it thinks. It's not what your mind says, but what you actually &lt;i&gt;do,&lt;/i&gt; that proves what you believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When God decided that Moses would lead the children of Israel out of Egypt, Moses never questioned God's ability, he just questioned whether God could do it through him. What was God's answer when Moses complained that he wasn't an articulate speaker? 'Now go; I will help you speak and will teach you what to say.' (Exodus 4:12 NIV) There's far more He wants to do through you than what you've already experienced. Your future can be bigger - so much bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is we get attached to methods which worked in the past. So we keep going back to them. But by always looking to the familiar, we limit God. He's much greater than any proven method, and He's never predictable. Jesus is known as the Living Word for a reason. God wants to whisper in your ear things you've not yet heard or seen, so have high expectations of God, and respond with faith to what He tells you.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['If what he has built survives, he will receive his reward.' 1 Corinthians 3:14 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine a house fire. Every object you once treasured is now crumbling ashes, lost forever. Can you imagine that kind of devastation? Paul describes our day of judgment before God to be like this: 'Fire will test the quality of each man's work. If what he has built survives, he will receive his reward. If it is burned up, he will suffer loss; he himself will be saved, but only as one escaping through the flames.' (1 Corinthians 3:13-15 NIV) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you holding on to things on earth that can't possibly remain in Heaven, for the sake of looking good or impressing your friends? God gave us the inbuilt capacity to disobey Him but remember, that means you're in danger of experiencing great loss instead of great reward one day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the New Testament, Paul says this about his life: 'I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day.' (2 Timothy 4:7-8 NIV) That's a much greater reward than any appreciation or approval we can get from those around us! Today's passage from 1 Corinthians gives us a good mental picture of getting our priorities in order. Often what we value most is what we spend most of our free time on. Does this match up with what God says we should value?&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['If anything is excellent or praiseworthy - think about such things.' Philippians 4:8 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're not moving closer to your dream, maybe you're not pursuing it tenaciously enough. It's not necessarily about working harder at the same things, but more about being willing to change. Change what? (1)&lt;i&gt;Your thinking&lt;/i&gt;. Are you telling yourself you can't succeed? Do you talk about yourself and what you're doing with words like &quot;I can't...&quot; or &quot;I'm not...&quot;? Afraid to get started, or afraid to take the next step because you don't have everything you need? You need to change your words and break the cycle of negative thinking. (2) &lt;i&gt;Your perspective&lt;/i&gt;. Do you have a short-term way of thinking? Are you expecting success in days, weeks, or months? The greater the assignment, the longer it's likely to take. So recalibrate your expectations and create a new timetable. Otherwise, you'll be banging you head in frustration and defeat. That's not God's will for you. Paul's desire was '...that I may finish my race with joy...' (Acts 20:24 NKJV) God wants you to experience joy in the pursuit of your goal. (3) &lt;i&gt;Your ways&lt;/i&gt;. How are things going in your personal life and at home? Are you ready to deal with the habits and hang-ups that stand between you and success? What steps can you take today to bring you closer to your dream - no matter how small? Author and publisher Robert Collier says, 'Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out.'&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['If another believer is overcome...help that person.' Galatians 6:1 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's ok to confront somebody you believe is in the wrong, but it's not ok to do it with a self-righteous attitude. When the church leaders insisted a woman '...caught in the act of adultery' be stoned (John 8:4 NLT), Jesus replied, '...let the one who has never sinned throw the first stone.' (John 8:7 NLT) Ouch! Lisa Harper writes: '...have we appointed ourselves the &quot;moral police&quot; to justify examining the blemishes in everyone else's behaviour? Is our ultimate goal to help restore prodigals, or do we have a hidden agenda to elevate ourselves by condemning those around us?... I've been confronted twice by other Christians, the first was a red-faced stranger who was furious with me for wearing knee-high leather boots with a short skirt to her church. She called me a &quot;Jezebel&quot;. The second was a good friend who tenderly pointed out my pride in a specific situation. The name-calling left a bruise on my soul; the compassionate rebuke turned me toward the forgiving arms of our Heavenly Father.' God alone has the perfect combination of holiness and mercy to stand in judgment of the human heart. The Bible says, 'If another believer is overcome by some sin, you who are godly should gently and humbly help that person back onto the right path. And be careful not to fall into the same temptation yourself.' 'The only One who was worthy to condemn us, chose instead to pardon us. Before you to confront someone who's messed up, remember you too are only saved by grace, so make sure all your words come from an honest, compassionate and humble heart.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Run in such a way as to get the prize.' 1 Corinthians 9:24 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;William Arthur Ward wrote: 'Believe while others are doubting. Plan while others are playing... Decide while others are delaying. Prepare while others are daydreaming. Work while others are wishing. Save while others are wasting. Listen while others are talking. Smile while others are frowning... Persist while others are quitting.' If you're always comparing yourself to everybody else, you'll never fulfil your potential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul talked about life being like a race, and how we should 'run in such a way as to get the prize.' Who are we competing against? Ourselves, really. Each person who has put their faith in Jesus can receive the prize. That's good to know because there's always going to be someone faster, stronger and smarter than you. And when you feel like you can't go on, remember that God isn't just at your finishing line, He's running your race with you too. The Holy Spirit is our own personal trainer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three important pointers for running the race of life: ()&lt;i&gt; Get going.&lt;/i&gt; Starting anything is often the toughest part, but don't be put off. ()&lt;i&gt; Push yourself.&lt;/i&gt; Our culture loves leisure time, but too much of it may mean we achieve nothing. ()&lt;i&gt; Don't give up.&lt;/i&gt; It matters both how you start and the way you finish, so don't stop short when you're on to something good! If you've got ll the gear but no idea, read 1 Corinthians 9:25!&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['A gentle answer deflects anger, but harsh words make tempers flare.' Proverbs 15:1 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syria, Afghanistan, Egypt, Iraq, Pakistan... all these countries seem to have scored poorly in the delicate art of handling conflict. But are we any better? It's worth considering how we handle our own pressure cooker scenarios. Is it a case of pot, kettle, black? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us don't naturally choose to have enemies. The main reason people get deleted from our friend list is because of the way we deal with conflict, or handle differences of opinion. A verbal pounding might seem a fair reaction when a person is doing your head in, but it won't do yourself or the situation any favours. Even if you think you're in the right, hang fire and take some deep breaths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, look at the situation through the other person's perspective. Get right into their shoes. And secondly, think through exactly what it is you want to say. Each day can throw things up that could make your blood boil, but Jesus says: 'Let me teach you...I am humble and gentle at heart.' (Matthew 11:29 NLT) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably won't nail it in your first peace-keeping mission, but commit to keep learning as the same sort of situations come back around. That's your route to diffusing the bomb rather than setting it off.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['The Son of God came to destroy the works of the devil.' 1 John 3:8 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next few days, we're going to be looking at the basic fact that Satan is defeated. There's no reason to hide behind the sofa at the mention of the 's' word, and we'll find out why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satan is real - but he won't be announcing himself in your living room in a red catsuit with a pitchfork. And throw far from your mind the 'good god of light' and 'bad god of darkness' model that paints Satan as an equal and opposite power to God. Satan holds some power. But he is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; God. And it's important to understand that God has once and for all annihilated Satan's dominion. He loses. God wins. It's not even close - it's more comparable to an elephant trampling a worm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satan's greatest weapon is your ignorance of God's Word. That's why he will fight you over Bible reading more than most other things. Jesus said, 'You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.' (John 8:32 NIV) The truth itself doesn't set you free; it's 'knowing' the truth, standing on it in times of trouble and trusting God to do what He has said, that empowers you not only to survive Satan's attacks, but to triumph over him.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.' John 8:32 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;First words matter. They often tell us what matters most to someone. For babies it's usually 'Mama' or 'Dada'. God's first words (in the Bible) are significant too and show us what matters to Him: 'Let there be light.' (Genesis 1:3 NLT) To God, light really matters, and if you're His child then it should matter to you too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sometimes we prefer the dark. After all, keeping things hidden can be so much easier in the dark. We can say things are fine when they're not. Satan loves the dark because it's harder to spot what he's up to there. His favourite thing is sin brushed under the carpet where it can fester and grow. A pure white sheepskin rug doesn't mean the floor underneath is perfect; there could be a stain you're trying to hide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satan is referred to in Scripture as 'darkness' and Jesus as 'light'. (Acts 26:18) Darkness and light don't mix. Jesus' life on earth shone so bright even the most religious people couldn't handle it. He wants you to shine too, but that means letting go of the darkness. He wants to reveal the darkest parts of your life so you can walk freely in the light. The moment the light moves in, the darkness has to move out. So your first priority is not to conquer Satan, but to move closer to Jesus; to line up your will and your word with His will and His Word. When you understand who you are 'in Christ', you are more than a match for the devil and he can no longer control your life. &lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...He set free all who have lived their lives as slaves to the fear of dying.' Hebrews 2:15 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people hate heights. Some are scared of snakes. You might fear drowning. But behind all these (what seem like perfectly reasonable) fears is fear of death itself, and most people have it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it doesn't have to be that way. One reason why the Gospel really is 'good news' is that when you believe in Jesus, what happens when you die isn't an issue. Satan's all about stealing, killing and destroying. It might have seemed like his mission was accomplished when Jesus died, but not even death could rule Jesus. He rose again three days later! And, 'Does the Spirit of the one who brought Jesus back to life live in you? Then the one who brought Christ back to life will also make your mortal bodies alive by His Spirit who lives in you.' (Romans 8:11 GWT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul went even further, saying that he was not only not afraid of death, but trusted God completely with it! 'Living means opportunities for Christ, and dying - well, that's better yet!' (Philippians 1:21 TLB) Paul hadn't lost the plot, he was sold out for Jesus and had an unparalleled confidence that meant death was just another step closer to Jesus. He was living out a win-win situation! You can be in that win-win situation too! Check out the inside back cover.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['God stripped the spiritual rulers and powers of their authority. With the cross, He won the victory...' (Colossians 2:15 NCV)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you've ever asked, 'Who am I?' then being a Christian should answer that question for you. You are a son or daughter of the Most High God. And you were made in the image of God. Satan is jealous and would love to rob you of your identity and drag you down to his level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you accept Jesus into your life, not only does God rescue you from darkness but He calls you His own. You'll discover who you are and how you're meant to live your life. With Jesus, you can even do greater things than Jesus did! (John 14:12)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See what Jesus told the disciples about their status, when they returned from a mission trip buzzing with excitement: '&quot;Lord, even the demons obey us when we use Your name!&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; He told them, &quot;I saw Satan fall from Heaven like lightning! Look, I have given you authority over all the power of the enemy, and you can walk among snakes and scorpions and crush them. Nothing will injure you. But don't rejoice because evil spirits obey you; rejoice because your names are registered in Heaven.&quot;' (Luke 10: 17-20 NLT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you know who you are 'in Christ' (check out Ephesians 2:4-7), you don't have to fear Satan - he's been defeated!&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['The serpent...asked the woman, &quot;Did God really say you must not eat...?&quot;' Genesis 3:1 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Satan's no doormat. His first strategy is to make you question and doubt God. Then he'll use your power of reasoning. 'That part's not relevant,' he'll mock. 'That was written to a specific culture, you don't have to listen to it now.' He'll do what he can to get you to hold Scripture at arm's length - he might even cherry-pick bits of the Bible as part of his ploy. If he can, he'll rob you of your confidence in simply trusting God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Satan's got under your skin, you can justify all sorts of things that are actually wrong. The lies he'll tell will sound like the truth. The very fact you're entertaining the conversation with him is dangerous. But don't go to war with Satan armed with the last segment of James 4:7, 'Resist the devil', without going through the training ground of the first segment, 'submitting yourself to God'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You won't hear from a talking snake, but Satan's subtle messages are thrown at us 24/7 in all sorts of ways, including the media and the education system. Sometimes sneaky, sometimes outright, lies and temptations will be pumped at you everywhere. Even the people around you might be saying, 'Whatever makes you happy! So long as you're not hurting anyone.' This is a pretty dangerous lie, so watch out. In everything, remember - if Jesus has already won your heart, the devil can't make you do anything. Take a moment to pray Psalm 51:10-13 as a prayer of commitment and surrender to God.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['I searched for someone to stand in the gap...' Ezekiel 22:30 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;JA Wallace said, 'Prayer moves the hand that moves the world.' So let's give prayer its rightful place in our lives - first place! In the book &lt;i&gt;Glorious Intruder&lt;/i&gt;, Joni Eareckson Tada writes about a woman called Diane, who suffers from multiple sclerosis: 'In her quiet sanctuary Diane turns her head slightly on the pillow towards the cork board on the wall. Her eyes scan each thumb-tacked card. Each photo. Each torn piece of paper, carefully pinned in a row. The stillness is broken as Diane begins to murmur. She's praying. Some would look at her, stiff and motionless, and shake their heads, &quot;What a shame, her life has no meaning.&quot; But Diane is confident, convinced that her life is significant and that her labour of prayer counts. She moves mountains that block the paths of missionaries. She helps open the eyes of the spiritually blind in South East Asia. She pushes back the kingdom of darkness that blackens the alleys and streets of the gangs in east LA. She aids homeless mothers, abused children, despondent teenagers, and dying forgotten old people in the nursing home down the street from where she lives. Diane is an intercessor! She has heard the call of God, &quot;I sought for a man among them who would make a wall, and stand in the gap before Me on behalf of the land.&quot; So Diane is on the front lines advancing the Gospel of Christ, holding up weak saints, inspiring doubting believers, and delighting her Lord and Saviour.' Are you 'standing in the gap' for someone? If not, go for it! Your prayers will move God and He will come through for you.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Rise up...take courage and do it.' Ezra 10:4 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accelerating into the night sky, showering vibrant colours and erupting with sound - fireworks are fantastic, but they fade fast. We can be like fireworks, when God wants us to be more like fires. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're more 'firework' than 'fire that works', it's worth asking yourself what's going on. Great ideas and visions can quickly burn in our hearts, but without the courage and commitment to see things through to completion, you won't have the finished article. Just like the metal used to make the wings of an aeroplane, you'll be put through stress testing. When turbulence hits, do you find you're more &lt;i&gt;coke can&lt;/i&gt; than &lt;i&gt;jet fighter&lt;/i&gt; grade aluminium?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tests and trials might freak you out, but one of their main aims is to spur you on from where you're at and what you know. Besides, an honest assessment is not a bad thing. God knows you well enough to know that you will fall, but He also wants you to bounce right back up again. 'The godly may trip seven times, but they will get up again.' (Proverbs 24:16 NLT) Stay committed, in spite of the difficulties. Ralph Waldo Emerson said: 'Whatever course you decide upon, there will always be someone to tell you that you are wrong. There are always difficulties arising which tempt you to believe that your critics are right. To map out a course of action and follow it to an end requires courage.'&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['The word of the Lord came...in a vision...' Genesis 15:1 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abraham is often used as a great example of faith, and rightly so. He was no spring chicken when he heard God speak to him, but he quickly got with God's programme and, a few hiccups aside, followed Him obediently. After all, God said, 'All the families on earth will be blessed through you.' (Genesis 12:3 NLT) That's quite a statement!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you feel like God's not interested anymore. Maybe you're thinking, 'Did I hear You wrong, God?' Perhaps you've posted an 'out-of-bounds' sign on some dreams you once had, or hopes you had for your future. Before shutting off from God, check how your own attitude lines up. Here are a few thoughts on breathing life back into lost hopes: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) Don't be too narrowly idealistic. Going to God with a shopping list of wants isn't what prayer is all about. Assuming things will pan out one way then throwing a hissy fit when they turn out another isn't going to impress anyone. Know that He is always close to you no matter what way things turn out. (2) Keep dreaming. Every day brings new possibilities, so don't close yourself off from new stuff just because it doesn't fit with your plan. (3) Thank God for the little successes, even if they're baby steps. (4) Make personal growth your goal. The only way to fulfil a big vision is to grow with it. The bigger the vision, the bigger you have to be to achieve it. What is God revealing to you in your current situation? How can you grow? The greatest reward of pursuing a vision is - who you become as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...Only the things that cannot be shaken will remain.' Hebrews 12:27 NCV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever had those days when everything goes wrong? When the world seems to gang up on you and you start to wonder if there's a huge target painted on your back? You try dialling up for God but there's no answer. The line seems busy. Soon enough, you're feeling some shots of discouragement - they're like daily arrows of frustration that wear you down and steal your joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satan's like a terrorist specialising in guerrilla warfare. He knows he'd lose big time if he went against the forces of Heaven, so he singles out individual believers. The question is, how do you stand firm when 'everything that...can be shaken' is shaking? Well, for starters, Isaiah says, 'You will keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on You...' (Isaiah 26:3 NKJV) If Moses had focused on his circumstances, he'd never have had peace standing between the Red Sea and the Egyptians. His peace came from knowing he was right where God wanted him to be. But peace itself isn't the goal; peace is a by-product of knowing: 'How great is Your goodness, which You have stored up for those who [honour] You...' (Psalm 31:19 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes God allows shaky times in order that we would draw faith from Him. Ask God to give you strength to endure.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.' Psalm 23:1 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, 'If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them gets lost, what will he do? Won't he leave the ninety-nine others in the wilderness and go to search for the one that is lost until he finds it?' (Luke 15:4 NLT) Can you recall when you were that one lost sheep? Do you remember when Jesus found you? Where would you be without Him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eighty percent of Jesus' listeners made their living off the land. Many were shepherds living in the countryside with their sheep. No flock ever grazed without a shepherd and no shepherd was ever off-duty. When the sheep wandered, the shepherd found them. When they fell, he picked them up and carried them. When they were wounded, he fixed them up. Sheep aren't clever; they don't think for themselves and they probably invented the game 'follow the leader'. They need a shepherd to lead them to '...still waters.' (Psalm 23:2 KJV) They have no natural defence - no claws or sharp teeth. They need a shepherd with a big stick to protect them from predators (Psalm 23:4). They have no sense of direction. They need someone who knows the way to lead them '...on paths that are right...' (Psalm 23:3 NCV) So do we. We tend to get swept away in we should have avoided. We have no natural defence against our enemy who goes about as a '...roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.' (1 Peter 5:8 NAS) And finally, we lose our way, don't we? No doubt about it, we need a shepherd. Not a cowboy to herd us, a true shepherd to lead us - and aren't you glad we have one looking out for us every minute of every day. &lt;/p&gt;

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Trust in the Lord...' Proverbs 3:5 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths.' (Proverbs 3:5-6 NKJ) But what if your path leads through pain, pressure and problems? John the Baptist's did. He didn't deserve imprisonment. After all, he was Jesus' cousin and the voice of God in his community. So he sent Jesus a message asking, 'Are you really the Messiah, or should we keep looking?' Paraphrased: 'If you're Lord, and you're in charge, what is going on with this prison business?!' It's a question asked from unfulfilled expectations. We think, 'Lord, if You're good, how come things aren't working out for me?' And it feels so much worse when you've been trying your best to faithfully serve Him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're in this sort of situation now, it's not because God has not suddenly turned against you. Zapping you with suffering is not His response to your actions. We do not know a definite explanation of 'why' bad things happen, but we do know that even in the midst of them, God is for you, and that means He is for you in a very real way, right now. He asks us to trust Him, and trust that He is doing something with everything that happens. We can hope that He will do something good too, because it is in His very nature to turn awful situations for good. Want a good example? How about the cross... So you can say, in suffering, 'I don't know why this is happening, but I know that God can redeem it, and bring good out of it.' &lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...Who works out everything in agreement with...His...will.' Ephesians 1:11 AMP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bored Christopher Wren was skimming stones across a river when, to his astonishment, he looked up to see each stone had magically fallen into place to erect a church. Lo, St. Paul's Cathedral was born! Michelangelo was mindlessly vandalising a slab of marble when a passerby pointed out its uncanny resemblance to King David. Amazing! Neil Armstrong had fallen asleep at the wheel. Imagine his surprise when he woke up on the bright side of the moon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, none of these historic events happened by chance; they were all the result of the finest planning and careful attention to detail. Should it surprise us then that the architect, artist and pioneer of the universe should has thought very, very carefully about His creation? And you - yes, &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; - are a part of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalm 139 argues a pretty good case for God having you in His mind's eye long before your dad met your mum. Maybe you've been made to feel like you were an accident. It's nothing to God. It doesn't even enter His view of you. Regardless of the circumstances of your birth, God is always more than able to achieve His plan for you. He brought you into being because He loves you. God didn't cut and paste you into His creation - you were always in His heart.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...trouble produces patience.' Romans 5:3 NCV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Storms come for a reason. They also come for a season. Discover the reason and grow wiser. Outlast the season and grow stronger; but never quit! Chuck Swindoll writes: 'Somebody needs to address the other side of Christian life, if for no other reason than to uphold reality. We need to be told that difficulty and pressure are par-for-the-course. No amount of Biblical input, deeper life conferences or super-victory seminars will exempt you from struggle. God promises no bubble of protection. Ask guys like Job, Joseph, Daniel and Paul, and you'll become acquainted with an ancient word that has almost disappeared in this generation of splashy, always-grinning, a-miracle-a-day spirituality: &lt;i&gt;perseverance&lt;/i&gt;! I know of no better partner to dance with when you're doing the three-steps-forward and two-steps-back number. It's in the tough times that true character is forged, the life of Christ is reproduced in us, and our flimsy theology is exchanged for a set of convictions that enable us to handle things rather than trying to escape them. It's when the bottom falls out and life tries to pound you into a corner of doubt and unbelief, that you need what perseverance produces: (a) a willingness to accept whatever comes, knowing that by God's grace you'll win and come out stronger (b) a determination to stand firm while those around you are falling or running away (c) insight to see the character-developing hand of God in it all. Without that, we stumble and fall and God is grieved. With it, we survive and conquer and God is glorified.' So, don't quit - instead ask God for the patience to help you as you wait.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['The hearing ear and the seeing eye, the Lord has made them both.' Proverbs 20:12 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two sisters: one puts her feet up, laughing loudly, talking the night away with the guest. The other diligently sticks to the kitchen, making sure there's soup in the pan, bread in the oven, drinks in cups. And yet it is Mary, the chatterbox, who is commended by Jesus for doing the right thing, not Martha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the untrained eye Martha is closer to God; after all she &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; being servant-hearted, generous and accommodating. Mary seems to have just dropped herself on the sofa. But Jesus sees through appearances. He knows who is close to Him and who is just going through the motions. 'The hearing ear and the seeing eye, the Lord has made them both.' You can fool others with a Christian mask, and you can even fool yourself with it sometimes, but the eye of the Lord sees things as they really are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt Redman penned the lyrics, 'I've filled my time with preparations / Worn the cloak of endless serving / Though this is a part of loving / Some things can grow cold...'  It's not always the massive fall from grace or ten-storey high sin that wrenches us from Jesus. Sometimes, disguised in our endless serving, we can be light years from His presence. If that's you, resolve to take off your Martha make-up and be more like Mary, spending time at the feet of Jesus. Refresh your heart in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Go and be reconciled...' Matthew 5:24 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bible says 'Get rid of all bitterness, rage, anger, harsh words, and slander.' (Ephesians 4:31 NLT) But how? Sometimes the only way to get over your hurt feelings is to seek reconciliation - getting back the relationships you might have lost. And if you are willing, God will help you do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A college professor, teaching on the weight of unforgiveness, asked each of her students to bring a sack of potatoes to class. For each person they refused to forgive, they had to select a potato and write the date on it beside that person's name. Then for a month, without fail, they had to carry that sack of potatoes with them everywhere they went. After lugging those sacks around for a while each student began to recognise how much weight they were carrying, the amount of energy it took to focus on their bag, and that they had to be careful not to leave it in the wrong place. Eventually, as the potatoes began to rot and stink, they realised that getting rid of them was the only sensible move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' thoughts on forgiveness go like this: 'If you forgive anyone his sins, they are forgiven; if you do not, they are not forgiven.' (John 20:23 NIV)&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;He also taught us to pray: 'Forgive our sins as we forgive everyone who has done wrong to us.' (Luke 11:4 CEV) If that prayer makes you uncomfortable, do something about it! Take time alone with God and ask Him for the strength to forgive that someone who has been weighing you down.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Just say a simple...no.' James 5:12 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Question one: Your pastor asks you to consider joining the frisbee community outreach team. Do you... (a) Go straight to the frisbee shop. Hey, if the pastor has asked you, the Lord has spoken, right? (b) Tell your pastor you'll get back to him after you've weighed up the commitment and prayed about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question two: Your best mate has been out partying all weekend, and now finds herself with no coursework to hand in. She texts you, asking to copy yours. Do you... (a) Email her the essay you've been working on for the last month. The Good Samaritan could learn a thing or two from you. (b) Explain that you won't be pressured into doing something compromising. For some reason, always saying 'yes' can seem like the Christian thing to do. We want to be good witnesses and let our light shine. But Jesus didn't preach, 'blessed are those who blindly say &quot;yes&quot; without thinking it through.' The Bible says, 'Let your no be [a simple] no, so that you may not sin.' (James 5:12 AMP) You're not a shining light if you're burnt out from saying yes to everything. Sometimes 'no' is the right answer. It's not always easy but, if you don't say 'no' to the things outside your gifting and call, you'll end up investing too much time and energy in what seems urgent, and neglect what's important.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['He prayed that he might die...' 1 Kings 19:4 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elijah had just stood up to the prophets of the god Baal and the goddess Asherah. The people had gathered on Mount Carmel to watch the contest: in one corner, Elijah and, in the other, 850 of Baal and Asherah's prophets. The result was a knockdown victory for Elijah: fire from Heaven had come in answer to his prayer. The false prophets were totally defeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter, stage right: one very miffed monarch. You know the sort. She's the type they used for a model for all the wicked queens in fairytales. Except that Jezebel was very real. And so nasty that when she tossed a death threat Elijah's way, he folded completely. He was so scared he ran as fast as he could for the desert and begged God to let him die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His focus had shifted from God to his circumstances. The moment we start to dwell on problems instead of God, we too can become overwhelmed like Elijah. Now, God didn't reach a hand through the clouds and instantly smite Jezebel, and neither did He zap Elijah straight to Heaven. Not yet, anyway. Instead God spoke to him in a 'still small voice.' (1 Kings 19:12 NKJ)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even those with great faith are not always strong. Every Christian, no matter what emotional state they are in, must continually come back to this place of quiet listening to God. What you really need is to meet with that still small voice. Let God whisper to your soul. Today, find a spot where you can be quiet for a few minutes and just be, with Him.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...Through love serve one another.' Galatians 5:13 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's an understandable mistake. Jesus' disciples were expecting the King of the Universe to be like the kings of the earth. So they were looking forward to swanky chariots, palatial mansions looking out over the Sea of Galilee, armies of servants to anticipate His every whim (not to mention those friends sitting on His right and His left hand when His Kingdom arrived.) But what did they get? A king who was a&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;role-model of servanthood. A king who said, 'I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd gives His life for the sheep.' Jesus gave up everything to love and serve everyone. That's why He left the glory of Heaven: to pick up the pieces of the mess we've made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not an easy act to follow, but it is the way of the cross we are called to. So why are so many Christians still hungry to be a success in the world's eyes? Why do we want the modern equivalent of the swanky chariot, palatial home and servants on call 24/7?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, 'If you try to hang on to your life, you will lose it. But if you give up your life for My sake, you will save it. And what do you benefit if you gain the whole world but lose your own soul? Is anything worth more than your soul?' (Matthew 16:25-26 NLT) Live a life worth remembering, live in Jesus' way: live for others. To live for Jesus means your life is His property and your hopes and aspirations are laid at His feet, so you can instead take up your cross and follow. (Matthew 16:24)&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Be holy in all you do.' 1 Peter 1:15 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The young man was down on one knee, the restaurant was dead silent. All eyes were on the flushed girl who drew a hand to her face. 'Would you make me the happiest guy on the planet by setting apart yourself for me? Would you share the rest of your days with me? Would you marry me?' With one quiet 'yes', the place erupted. But as the happy couple walked arm in arm to the restaurant door, the young man stopped, dropped her hand, and made for the young slightly blonder girl at table two. Straightening his tie, he lowered himself to one knee. 'Darling, would you make me the happiest guy on the planet...'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to turn a picture of romance into one of shallowness! Marriage should be an example of a holy relationship, a husband and wife setting themselves apart, putting other options aside, in order to devote themselves exclusively to each other. Our relationship with God should be a holy one. We should remain faithful, not getting down on one knee to every whim and fancy. We should set ourselves apart for God. Spend valued time together, share our hearts, our deepest desires, talk, laugh, journey together. And when the going gets tough, you don't throw in the towel, you work through it. Devoted, passionate, faithful - that's how you are 'holy in all you do'. Sound like marriage? Many of the things important in a good marriage also apply to your relationship with God.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Walk in wisdom...redeeming the time.' Colossians 4:5 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a time when the concept of adolescence didn't exist. Back in the good old days, parents would school you and marry you off before the age of sixteen. There was no &lt;i&gt;time&lt;/i&gt; to be youthful. And yet here we are in the third millennia, Xbox-ed up to our eyeballs, drip-fed with downloads, leisure-time junkies, complaining that there just aren't enough hours in the day for praying or 'making time for God'. We have more time-saving devices (think of your gran stirring a pot of boiled pants with a broomstick next time you drop your clothes in the washing machine) and yet seem to have less time than any other generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it's time you took control of the clock. We easily make time for other things that we are enthusiastic about - we just need to transfer that skill into the everyday with God. Start simple. Instead of dedicating the entire month of March to games, books or DVD boxsets, think about scheduling the odd hour of quiet time. Switching your console off and opening your Bible might not be as complicated as you think. One method might be to put a reminder on your phone for quiet time. That way you can be intentional about spending some time with God. Don't feel guilty if you miss one or two - remember, 'quiet time' exists in order to enrich &lt;i&gt;the rest&lt;/i&gt; of your life, not to segment off God into regular small spots. It is good for you. Rather than file away your spiritual life into these set times alone, think about how you can spend quality time with God in order to increase the overall quality of your life.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Teach us to realise the brevity of life...' Psalm 90:12 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people know that life is short, and they make their time count. Gladys Aylward, for example. 'Gladys who?' People thought the same about a hundred years ago. Gladys was an ordinary working girl in London, doing nothing particularly glamorous apart from saving her wages. Eventually she saved enough to boat over to China, where she founded her own inn. She took in orphans and risked her life to intervene in prison riots. In 1938, Japanese forces invaded, and Gladys led 94 orphans across the mountains to safety, despite being wounded herself. In the last twenty years of her life, she founded an orphanage in Taiwan, dedicating her last days on this earth to helping the poor and needy. Her life story was so inspirational that Hollywood made a film about her: &lt;i&gt;The Inn of the Sixth Happiness&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk about making your life count! Gladys understood what the psalmist meant when he spoke about life being brief. But it wasn't any big, grand, flashy life she embraced. It was quiet, unnoticed dedication and intentional care for others. We need to realise that making our lives count doesn't necessarily mean making ourselves a big deal. In fact, if we make our lives count Jesus' way, it means the exact opposite.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['I must work...while it is day.' John 9:4 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus didn't have a watch to keep His eye on the time, yet by thirty-three He'd achieved everything He'd been put on the earth for. How did He use His time so well?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1)&lt;i&gt; He understood who He was.&lt;/i&gt; His 'working day' consisted of teaching and praying and healing; and even in His spare time He was teaching and investing into His friends. Never was a man so busy and yet, He knew what He wanted to do, and everything else fell into place around that. Jesus was happy with who He was. He went to sleep content. Once you discover how God wants you to live, anything not in line with it will be easy to spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2)&lt;i&gt; He knew His limits.&lt;/i&gt; The Son of God surely knows no limits, right? Well, Jesus would spend the first part of His day up a mountain in prayer. The Son of God recognised where His power came from. He recognised the value of silence and quiet time with God. If Jesus needed it, how much more should we be thinking through our day on the back of early morning prayer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3) &lt;i&gt;He cared for and invested into others.&lt;/i&gt; Jesus wasn't working out a business model. He treated people as people. Jesus said, 'I will build My church...' (Matthew 16:18 NKJ) He had a plan, but it would be worked out by trusting other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the way to maximise your time - keep your life's purpose before you at all times and evaluate each decision in the light of it.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['I have come that they may have life...to the full.' John 10:10 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes when we achieve the things we strive for, we find they're not very fulfilling. As we look back we realise that our greatest joy was not in the goal we reached, but in the growth we experienced on the way to it. Scientist Koichi Tanaka had this feeling as he worked on trying to create an ion with lasers: 'I failed for weeks and months before I succeeded in making an ion. Why did I continue the experiment? Because I enjoyed it. It was fun for me to come to know something that I had never known before, and that fun enabled me to persist.' That persistence helped him to win the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have the potential to make many wonderful discoveries in life, and none greater than what you discover about God, and yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God tells us, 'I know all the things you do, and I have opened a door for you that no one can close.' (Revelation 3:8 NLT) Just as Jesus has once and for all opened the door for your connection with God, He will also open doors specific for you, to lead you into paths that are good for you. When you see one of these doors opening from God, jump through it! There's no guarantee it will be a journey free of struggles but, like the scientist, take it slow, notice what God is doing and there will be joy in the journey. &lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Let the words of my mouth...be acceptable in Your sight...' Psalm 19:14 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;What would happen if someone stood up on Sunday morning and swore at everyone in the congregation? It wouldn't be tolerated. A church would hopefully take something of a hard line on this sort of behaviour. Now, what would happen if you casually slipped this into conversation over coffee: 'We really need to pray for so-and-so, I hear that he's cheating on...'? Would our helpfully hypothetical church take the same line on this sort of behaviour? Maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gossip can be a tolerated sin in churches. Sin is sin, though. Jesus doesn't tiptoe around careless words, He says they 'come from an evil heart.' (Matthew 15:18 TLB) And there'll be no gain from brushing them under the carpet either: 'I tell you this, you must give an account on judgment day for every idle word you speak.' (Matthew 12:36 NLT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gossip can seem like a good thing. After all, when we are chatting, we are getting closer to the other person, aren't we? We're laughing, we're sharing something, we're taking the same side on something, aren't we? But stop and think about the words that are coming out of your mouth. There'll always be someone wanting to draw you into gossip so watch out and  'Let your speech always be with grace...that you may know how you ought to answer each one.' (Colossians 4:6 NKJV)&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Take over the land...flowing with milk and honey.' Deuteronomy 11:8-9 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the super-size West, we have a crisis if there's a two-week chocolate shortage or no breakfast cereal in the supermarket. But imagine what it's like to live in a place where you are completely dependent on your crops growing - otherwise you don't eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As slaves in Egypt, the Israelites faced this reality every day. Not particularly famed for its drizzly days, Egypt got its water from the River Nile and God's people had to rely on it for their crops too. Individuals were forced to pump the water by foot every day. Picture the sheer amount of blood, sweat and tears just on an old foot-pump. Contrast that with the life God promises them: 'Go in and take over the land...flowing with milk and honey...not like the land of Egypt...where you planted your seed and irrigated it by foot.' (Deuteronomy 11:8-10 NIV) Oh, the relief to be off the foot-pump and into the flow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you been in a place where everything seems like an effort, and you slave away with sweat, blood and tears just to stand still? Well, God promises a day when you will no longer struggle as His goodness will flow into all areas of your life. But this promise is conditional - it's for those who obey God: 'Observe therefore all the commands I am giving you today, so that you may have the strength to go in and take over the land...' (Deuteronomy 11:8 NIV) Obedience may not be your favourite word but it is the key that opens the door of God's blessing.&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['I will...exchange their sorrow for rejoicing.' Jeremiah 31:13 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you deal with the heartbreak, anger and questions of losing someone? Go to Jesus. He has total, endless compassion. You can find Him at the scene of death and grief in the story of Lazarus (John 11). There, we find out a few things about His reaction to grief... (1) &lt;i&gt;Jesus allows us to question&lt;/i&gt;. When Lazarus died, Martha asked, in effect, 'Where were You when we needed You, Lord?!' Jesus wasn't upset with her. That's because God's response in these situations is to 'never cease' in love. And Lamentations 3:22 ESV says it is 'steadfast love'. That means it's fixed and never moves. It's more permanent than the oldest stars in the universe. It will be there long after the last light in space goes out. (2) &lt;i&gt;Jesus shows us how to grieve.&lt;/i&gt; 'Jesus wept', not because He was powerless, but because He was human and had human emotions. He was our example. Working through grief isn't a problem to simply get over, it's seriously important for the soul. So feel deeply, relate honestly, stay open to healing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people get through their grief faster than others; sadly, some never do. But you don't have to be one of them! God said, 'I will turn their mourning into joy. I will comfort them and exchange their sorrow for rejoicing.' God can reframe your past and give it meaning. He can help you to look back with gratitude, then forward with confidence. How? By transforming painful memories into powerful motivators and sources of future wisdom. Ask Him; He will show you how!&lt;/p&gt;

Colossians 1:13 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The King James Bible says God has 'delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of His dear Son.' The New King James Bible says, 'He has delivered us from the power of darkness and conveyed us into the Kingdom of the Son.' In one version it says we were 'conveyed,' in the other it says we were 'translated.' Both translations are correct; each just gives us a different angle on the truth. Let's look at each: (1) &lt;i&gt;Conveyed&lt;/i&gt;. When someone buys a house, a legal document&lt;i&gt; conveys&lt;/i&gt; ownership into the buyer's name. 'You were bought at a price; therefore glorify God...' (1 Corinthians 6:20 NKJV) God owns you, therefore He has the right to send you anywhere and ask anything of you. (2) &lt;i&gt;Translated&lt;/i&gt;. We translate books from one language to another. As a result the words sound different. Understand this: you are a child of God so start speaking His language! When God's Word says you 'can' and you say you 'can't,' it's an open invitation for Satan to influence you. Your new birth calls for a new language. The Bible says that the power of life and death are in your tongue. So learn to say what God's Word says about each situation you face. This is not easy, and it's not learned overnight. But if you study your Bible each day, you'll get to the place where your first response will be to quote God's Word. When that happens your life will change for the better.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['O You who hear prayer, to You all flesh will come.' Psalm 65:2 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Homework, Facebook, Twitter, TV, PS3, music, sorting the sock-drawer. Now we've given you enough things to do instead of praying, here's one good reason to start praying: to get to know God better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pastor of a mega-church admitted that for many years he preached more than he practiced prayer, until one day God pulled him up on it. 'It has been twenty years since I began taking time to pray. My life has been transformed. The greatest fulfilment hasn't been the list of miraculous answers to prayer I've received, although that has been wonderful; the greatest thrill has been the quality of difference in my relationship with God. When I started to pray I didn't know what was going to happen. God and I used to be rather casually related to one another. We didn't get together and talk very much. Now, however, we get together a lot, not talking on the run, but carrying on substantial, soul-searching conversations every morning for a good chunk of time. I feel as if I've gotten to know God a lot better since I started praying.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Luther said, 'I have often learned more in one prayer than I have been able to glean from much reading and reflection.' Do you want to know God better? The answer is found in prayer. Try setting your alarm clock an hour earlier for tomorrow morning. Keep your Bible next to your bed, and start the day off by spending that first hour reading and praying.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Your Father in Heaven [will] give good gifts to those who ask...' Matthew 7:11 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of us have (or had) fantastic parents, and had the blessing of a tip-top start in life. (Thank God for that, right now.) Others of us, through no fault of our own, faced harsh realities from an early age. You may have been through battles that other people your age have no idea about and you may still be nursing your scars. If that's you, it's ok. God's still got you. (And, if you need help, go talk to someone about it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever your human parents were like, God is the perfect parent. He finds nothing sweeter in the universe than the moment when you turn to Him. If you're hungry, He'll feed you. If you need healing, He'll heal you. If you're fearful, He'll strengthen you. He won't interfere where He's not wanted, though. If you need something, He wants you to ask. You've got to open up that line of communication. But when you do, nothing in the world will keep Him from giving you His full attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Though my father and mother forsake me, the Lord will receive me.' (Psalm 27:10 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note down your conversations with God in a prayer diary so you can look back and see how God has answered your prayers.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Pray continually.' 1 Thessalonians 5:17 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;An enemy army was zooming up, intent on wiping Israel out. So Moses let Joshua in on his battle strategy: 'You go fight them. I'll go up that hill and pray.' (Read all about it in Exodus 17) Joshua might have wondered how effective that would be but, as it turned out, it was only while Moses had his hands raised to Heaven that Joshua's troops made headway. As soon as Moses dropped his arms, Joshua's troops were struck down. Moses eventually had to have help from Aaron and Hur to stretch up his arms toward Heaven and bring the matter before the Lord. However, when he did, the tide of battle shifted. Without God, the Israelites were losing but with Him, it was a different story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lesson here: if you reach out for God, His power will reach back to you to help you with your daily battles. The flip-side is, it's hard for Him to release His power in your life when you just put your hands in your pockets and say, 'I can handle this on my own.' Instead you may find yourself a casualty on one of life's battlefields. 'At the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in Heaven and on earth and under the earth.' (Philippians 2:10 NLT) So, pray - until your arms feel like dropping off! If Moses could ask for help, so can you!&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['He shall call upon Me, and I will answer him.' Psalm 91:15 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok, the film &lt;i&gt;Bruce Almighty&lt;/i&gt; is mainly an excuse for a series of plastic-faced explosions from Jim Carrey, but there's some pretty good sermon fodder in there too. Like the bit about prayer. Bruce keeps hearing voices building up and up. He discovers they are people's prayers waiting for an answer. He tries to answer them individually through email but finds he just can't keep up with the demand. Finally he sets his email to automatically respond to 'yes' for every request. Good idea, he thinks - &lt;i&gt;everybody gets what they want&lt;/i&gt;. The film goes on to illustrate the pandemonium this carefree, couldn't-care-less approach to prayer has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes an important point. Prayer is not about having God as your own personal genie in a bottle. Prayer is about living in relationship with God. Prayer is a gift, not a duty. You may think having a boyfriend or girlfriend who always did exactly what you want would be a dream come true, yes? No: the true joy of the relationship would be lost, because you'd have a slave, not a partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prayer is about getting close to God. Yes, sometimes He will give you what you want, but sometimes He won't. Sometimes it will seem like He's not even answering. God is your Father, not your genie, and the time you spend with Him is the point.  'The Lord is close to all who call on Him, to all who call on Him in truth.' (Psalm 145:18 NLT)&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['For we do not know what we should pray for...' Romans 8:26 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prayer is about working on a relationship with God. And because the God we have is no ordinary friend, there are immense benefits to spending time with Him. If you had Superman as a best friend and your flight to LA was in a nosedive, you'd only need to give him a call and you'd be touching down safely before you could say, 'Is it a bird? Is it a plane? Is it...'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God always hears our desperate pleas. Sometimes we are so frantic that all we can do is cry out a 000 prayer. He listens to those, too. Those prayers give us instant connection to the One above all emergency situations. 'Also, the Spirit helps us with our weakness. We do not know how to pray as we should. But the Spirit Himself speaks to God for us, even begs God for us with deep feelings that words cannot explain.' (Romans 8:26 NCV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The songwriter of Psalm 116 had experience of these sorts of 000 prayers too. He wrote about them there, 'I love the Lord because He hears my voice and my prayer for mercy. Because He bends down to listen, I will pray as long as I have breath!' (Psalm 116: 1-2 NLT) God is above all your panic, and He's on the case before we even know how to pray.&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt; 'He hears us whenever we ask for anything that pleases Him. And...He will give us what we ask for.' (1 John 5:14-15 NLT)&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['You will ask what you desire, and it shall be done.' John 15:7 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 1996, ValuJet flight 592 crashed into the Florida Everglades, killing 110 passengers. Navy experts tried using special technology to detect the plane's black box, without success. Holding a rope that kept them spaced a metre apart, searchers poked through every square metre of muck. The physical conditions were unbearable. The sun beating down, temperatures in the high 30s, diesel fuel and caustic hydraulic fluid floated in the water, forcing searchers to wear several layers of protective rubber. After fourteen days they'd found nothing. Sergeant Felix Jimenez of Metro-Dade Police was one of the searchers. For fourteen days he'd prayed for the bereaved families and the safety of his fellow workers. But on the fifteenth day as he took a break, suddenly he realised he'd failed to pray for one important thing: that God would help them find the black box. So he asked God for direction, resumed the search, and when he stuck his pole into the water he hit something metallic. He pulled the object out of the muck. It was the black box. Jimenez wrote in &lt;i&gt;Guideposts&lt;/i&gt;: 'I thought of the many days we had spent searching for the recorder, how we must have tramped over it many times, and I wondered why its retrieval had taken so long. Amid the low rustle of sawgrass and the call of the wild heron, I seemed to hear the response: &quot;Why did it take you so long to ask?&quot;'&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['There is a time for everything...a time to weep and a time to laugh.' Ecclesiastes 3:1-4 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nelson Mandela was president of South Africa from 1994-99. Years before, he had been an activist against apartheid (a racist government policy that favoured the rights of white people). For this he was sentenced to life imprisonment. After serving 27 years he was finally released and played a significant part in changing South Africa's inequality and poverty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recalling his highs and lows he once said this, 'I have discovered the secret that after climbing a great hill, one finds many more hills to climb. I have taken a moment here to rest, to steal a view of the glorious vista that surrounds me, to look back on the distance I have come. But I can rest only for a moment, for with freedom come responsibilities, and I dare not linger, for my long walk is not yet ended.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nelson Mandela realised that to change the world for the better you have to accept the rough with the smooth. You have to be prepared to weep and to laugh. You have to accept that there will always be another hill to conquer. For, 'There is a time to be silent and a time to speak. There is a time to love and a time to hate. There is a time for war and a time for peace.' (Ecclesiastes 3: 7-8 NCV) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always do the right thing - despite how you feel, despite what others may say or do in response. And that, at the end of the day, will lead to fulfilment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It happened every year. The Priest would wrestle a young lamb to the altar. He would raise a hatchet high above his head and bury it deep in the animal's neck. Blood would spray across the stone and the people were forgiven for another year. Only this year, a lamb was replaced with a man. And there was no wrestling to the steps of the altar. The angels in Heaven hushed as a soldier raised a hatchet high above his head and buried a nail deep into the hands of the man. And the sky turned black as blood sprayed across rough wood. And on the cross, the Lamb of God was slain. Now there would be no more lambs. And no more blood. And no more sacrifice. And no more would sin be remembered. It happened once and for all. 'For the grace of God (His unmerited favour and blessing) has come forward (appeared) for the deliverance from sin and the eternal salvation for all mankind.' (Titus 2:11 AMP)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His sacrifice on the cross was for &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;that first Good Friday, two thousand years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'What do we do now?'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Silence...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of history's darkest moment, the disciples would have been stunned. Everything they had given themselves to, their hopes and their plans for reform, had been crucified alongside their agony-stricken, horrifically-wounded Master. He had cried, 'My God, My God, why have You forsaken me?' - the cry of someone overwhelmed by sin, who certainly felt the weight of the sin that separates mankind from God. And now the disciples themselves were lost, leaderless and fearing for their lives. Had they been forsaken, as it looked like Jesus had?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where was God in all of this? What possible hope was there now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was surely their darkest hour. But we know what they didn't. From that day forward tomorrow would forever be &lt;strong&gt;Resurrection Sunday&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Jer 10-13, Matt 27:57-66, Ps 38:13-22, Pr 8:24-26&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['We believe that Jesus died and rose again...' 1 Thessalonians 4:14 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Pritchard tells of a story about an archbishop in Uganda who was killed under the Idi Amin regime. Thousands of Christians gathered on a hill to mourn his passing. But the government refused to give the body back. The people stood around lost. Then the previous archbishop began to read the story of the resurrection. As he read, 'Why do you look for the living among the dead?' a spontaneous shout of praise rose from the crowd. Everyone realised that their leader wasn't a cold corpse in a government morgue but a child of God, safe in the presence of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the same for us. When Jesus rose again it was not just amazing, not just awesome, but  a bold triumph, a victory! When Jesus rose again, it signalled victory over every trouble life can throw at us, every low moment, every self-esteem issue, even over death itself! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CHRIST IS RISEN! The hymn &lt;i&gt;Thine be the glory, risen, conquering Son!&lt;/i&gt; is best sung with the broadest beaming grin on your face - God's got you, even through to the other side of death itself. (And all because He loves you!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crudely put, 'resurrection' means 'the standing up of a corpse'. Jesus proved there is no corpse when He's around. What does resurrection look like? 'He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and there will be no more death, sadness, crying or pain, because all the old ways are gone.' (Revelation 21:4 NCV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celebrate! Jesus conquered the grave! Your future, even your death, is secure in His resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Bless those who persecute you...' Romans 12:14 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Jesus preached His 'Sermon on the Mount', He didn't say, 'Love your enemies,' then add a stage whisper to the front row, '...but not you guys. You get a free pass on this one.' No, Jesus' revolutionary new idea was intended for every Christian, to be directed at every kind of person. We might not have enemies in the way the people had back then (think: Roman legions), but we're not off the hook just because our enemies aren't carrying swords or breathing out death threats. We probably have enemies in a different sense (think: people who annoy us, get us down, or oppose our beliefs.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're on this planet in order to be a self-sacrificing blessing, even to those sorts of people. You could say that God followers are intentionally 'anti-me'. People are supposed to recognise us because of the way we extravagantly bless others, even those who persecute us. Ok, but doesn't blessing our enemy make us a bit of a walk-over? Well, which is more likely to lead them to Christ, blessing and praying for them, or fighting and keeping our distance from them? It's a severe test of your faith, but in order to follow Jesus, we need to bless others, including those who disagree with you, or rubbish your beliefs, or just plain irritate you. Actually, this isn't a message about other people, it's about sorting your own perspective out. Ann Voskamp said, 'If we only got into the Christ-faith through the door of forgiveness, how can we claim Christ as our home if we aren't people who forgive?' Do we believe in the forgiveness of other peoples' sins, or just our own?&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation...' 2 Corinthians 5:17 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thief on the cross became a Christian with his dying breath. So why not spend a few more years experiencing sin while you can, and scrape into Heaven at the last second? That logic is seriously flawed. For one, there are consequences of sin. Was King David forgiven for his sin with Bathsheba? (2 Samuel 11-12) Yes (read Psalm 51) but the consequence of that sin was that their baby died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose the apostle Paul had  dedicated his life to fast living and prayed a last minute sinner's prayer. He'd still be in Heaven, but the church would be a lot smaller, the Bible a lot thinner. Suppose Mother Teresa spent her time in the casino. Yes, a last dash for salvation would guarantee her place in the book of life, but think of all the thousands of orphans and dying people forever neglected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sooner we get on track with God, the more time we'll have for building up an everlasting legacy, and (this is big) finding ourselves ever closer and closer to the living God, &lt;i&gt;here&lt;/i&gt;. Because the joy of knowing God - the joy of eternity - doesn't start after you die. More than just the good we can do, walking with God in &lt;i&gt;this &lt;/i&gt;life is RIGHT! John 10:10 AMP says: 'I came that they may have and enjoy life, and have it in abundance (to the full, till it overflows).' If you've never made your peace with God, know that it is so, so worth it. You can do it now - there's a section inside the back cover to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['The...Lord has given me...words of wisdom, so that I may know how to comfort the weary...' Isaiah 50:4 NLT &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;James, who wasn't known for mincing his&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;words, tells it like it is: 'A tiny spark can set a great forest on fire. And the tongue is a flame of fire. It is a whole world of wickedness, corrupting your entire body. It can set your whole life on fire, for it is set on fire by hell itself.' (James 3: 5-6 NLT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His harsh words might make you want to chop off your tongue, but it is important to carefully consider what we let out of our mouths. So many people don't, and it's no wonder that James describes the sort of careless, insulting language that results as 'set on fire by hell itself!' Let's also focus on the fact that our words can do amazing good as well. Taking a hold of your tongue is more important than all the church meetings you go to (or how many hours you clock in reading the word4U2Day J) Pause each day to pray for guidance, asking God tell you what to say. And He will: TheLord has given mewords of wisdom, so that I know how to comfort the weary. Morning by morning Heopens my understanding to His will. TheLord has spoken to me, and I have listened (Isaiah 50:45 NLT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen, and then speak - as the old saying goes, you've been given two ears and one mouth, which might indicate the proportion of listening to speaking you should do! &lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Whoever lives in Me...shall produce a large crop of fruit...' John 15:5 TLB&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's no mean feat to get a song in the Top 40. But it's when artists get there on a regular basis that they go from 'one-play' to Coldplay. Lasting success over a period of time requires more than one moment of inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God wants us to be in the habit of being successful too - on His terms. That means caring for the needy, keeping yourself from being polluted by sin, and making time to seek Him regularly. And while He knows that we won't be on top form all the time, He does want us to try to live the best we can, every day. We can't do that in our own strength. That's why today's verse says 'Whoever lives in Me...shall produce a large crop of fruit.' He wants you to live in a way that's obviously Christ-like. Whatever you work at in that way, God does want you to do it well. But more than that, He wants you to do it with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, He created the universe without you, so He doesn't need your help in solving the world's problems. But He invites you to the table to let you play a part, through Christ. Carve out prayer time every day and be faithful to it. Try to be kind to those who you would otherwise look past. Be honest with the Holy Spirit, and ask Him to protect your heart from wrong desires. Then you will be well on your way to lasting success! &lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['I will gladly spend myself and all I have for you...' 2 Corinthians 12:15 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disciples had missed it again. They'd clocked up a few kilometres with Jesus, they had front row seats of Jesus' ministry and they'd seen some amazing miracles. They were feeling pretty good about themselves, and why shouldn't they? They'd made some big sacrifices for Jesus. And, when Jesus was tired after preaching to the masses, it was James and John that He'd chill out with and unwind. So one evening, they boldly went where no disciple had been before: 'Master... we want to sit on the thrones next to Yours in Your Kingdom...' (Mark 10:35-37 TLB) Jesus carefully put them in their place, explaining how God's Kingdom is a topsy-turvy place, 'Among you it is different. Whoever wants to be great among you must be your servant. And whoever wants to be greatest of all must be the slave of all. For even I, the Messiah, am not here to be served but to help others and give My life as a ransom for many.' (Mark 10:43-45 TLB)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's easy to think we'd never be as proud as the disciples were here, but we can quickly lose perspective too. Understanding God's Kingdom isn't rocket science, but it does mean you need to be willing to have heart surgery. Even if 'getting and gaining' might make you successful, it's only by serving Christ that you truly become significant.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['I will be faithful to you and make you Mine...' Hosea 2:20 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Genesis to Revelation, the Bible is God's love letter to you. It's not here one week, gone the next. People who say the three magic words 'I love you,' then fail to live up to it can make us think that God's wired the same way. Because we live among people who disappoint us and let us down, it's easy for us to assume that God works like that. But God is utterly committed to you: '...I have loved you, My people, with an everlasting love. With unfailing love I have drawn you to Myself. I will rebuild you... You will again be happy...' (Jeremiah 31:3-4 NLT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Letting God's love filter down from our heads to our hearts means we don't need to look for love in all the wrong places. Nothing about us surprises God or makes Him change His mind, 'Even when we are too weak to have any faith left, He remains faithful to us... for He cannot disown us.' (2 Timothy 2:13 TLB) If we are faithless, He remains faithful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says, 'I have called you by name; you are Mine... You are precious to Me. You are honoured, and I love you.' (Isaiah 43:1-4 NLT) You might take your eye off God but He never, ever takes His eye off you. 'There is no one like the God of Israel. He rides across the Heavens to help you...The eternal God is your refuge, and His everlasting arms are under you. He drives out the enemy before you...' (Deuteronomy 33:26-27 NLT) So live in God's love. It's the most secure place on earth!&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...At that time men began to call on the name of the Lord.' Genesis 4:26 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prayer meetings can be intimidating. Other people sound so confident and eloquent that you may feel your prayers are not up to the mark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the disciples didn't have the first clue about prayer either. There are loads of different ways to pray and God won't give you a hard time for your diction, but finding a framework for prayer could help you start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, spend some time just being with your Father, knowing who He is and what He's done. That's the first of three A's: &lt;b&gt;Adore&lt;/b&gt;. It's a good place to start because it takes your eyes off yourself. Otherwise, prayer can just be a jumbled mess of personal cares and worries, without ever really looking properly to God. Secondly: &lt;b&gt;Ask&lt;/b&gt;. Jesus encouraged His disciples to knock on Heaven's door. There's a place for asking for what we need, and even Jesus needed to get away from the noise and bustle of everyday life to do just that. That leads to the third A: &lt;b&gt;Accept&lt;/b&gt;. Jesus prayed for God's will to be done and rounded everything off by looking to His Father again. God loves you perfectly and knows exactly what you can and can't handle at any given time, so you can end your prayers trusting that everything is in its right place. The &lt;i&gt;Lord's Prayer&lt;/i&gt; in Matthew 6:9-13 contains this structure, and it all reflects the constant goodness and providing care of God. It is the template Christ gave His disciples when they asked Him, 'Lord, teach us to pray.'&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Your ears shall hear a word...' Isaiah 30:21 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 'word' from God can bring you the answer you need. God created the world with a word, so imagine what a word from Him could do for your situation. The Bible says, 'Your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, &quot;This is the way, walk in it, whenever you turn to the right hand or whenever you turn to the left.&quot;' Notice the words, 'Your ears shall hear a word.' But if your spiritual ears are not open, trained and tuned to hear God, you'll miss what He is saying to you. And, if you try and filter what He's saying to you through your intellect so it lines up with your own opinions, you will get nowhere. God gives a 'word' to those who have an open ear - and heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you pray, what are you looking for? A spiritual high, or a time of intimacy with the Lord in which He speaks and you listen? When you read your Bible are you seeking confirmation of your own thoughts, or are you seeking God's will? Imagine what one of God's ideas could do for your life! '...the people who know their God shall be strong, and carry out great exploits.' (Daniel 11:32 NKJV) If you dream of doing great things in life, get to know God. He will reveal Himself to you through His Word. You'll hear a lot of different ideas each day; some will benefit you, others won't. But when you get a 'word' from God it's like a seed; it has the potential to produce a tree; or better yet, a whole orchard of fruit. &lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['If we love each other, God lives in us...' 1 John 4:12 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relationships bring us joy, but they also require effort. Done properly, our ability to communicate is one of the ways God made us to reflect Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you believe God's called you to be a recluse in the farthest corner of the world, getting there will require interacting with at least one other human being. And for the rest of us, being part of some sort of team is at the heart of most things we do, so good communication is an absolute must.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people are natural talkers, others make good listeners. But whatever category you'd put yourself in; make the effort to improve on what doesn't come naturally to you. Communication breakdown often leads to relationship breakdown. A simple 'How are you?' followed by a period of genuine listening to the response is more than just proving to someone that you care; it could really contribute to a healthy friendship, in turn giving you both a better quality of life. Are you too wrapped up in your own world to give someone else the time of day? We were made for relationships, and good relationships require good communication and good communication requires good listening. So, how's your communication?.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...Their nobles would not put their shoulders to the work...' Nehemiah 3:5 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When talking about church, one leader once said, 'It's neat and tidy in the graveyard, but it's messy in the nursery.' Despite the chaos, there's no doubt that there's plenty of life in a nursery. So for your church to move ahead it's going to need people who are willing to put some work in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem, Nehemiah wrote, 'The next section was repaired by the men of Tekoa, but their nobles would not put their shoulders to the work.' These guys suffered from two common diseases known as 'convenient commitment' and 'limited involvement'. Which group are you in - the workers or the Nobles? God has a plan for you in your church, and you can do much more than just play your part, you can enjoy the community with the people of God who are there with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter what church you go to, you'll always find a pick-and-mix bunch - some might be easy to love, and others may 'grow your grace'. But whatever they're like, make sure &lt;b&gt;you&lt;/b&gt; are someone who can be relied on. Tomorrow' s good leaders are today's great servants. Getting excited for the summer ball and then not being seen for the next month, isn't the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loads of things demand your attention, but it's only when you prioritise and knuckle down to working with other Christians that your prayers for your church start to get answered. You are the church.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...Then you will receive praise, honour, and renown...' Deuteronomy 26:19 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you had a friend over, you might let them crash on your bedroom floor with a casual 'excuse the mess'. But if the Queen made an unexpected visit, you wouldn't leave dirty dishes piled up in the sink and clothes strewn across the floor. No, you'd give the place a radical makeover! And you wouldn't make her sleep on the floor; nope, it would be the master bedroom. Your goal would be to honour her in every way because her presence had honoured you. Ok, now read this: 'You have declared today that the Lord is your God. And you have promised to walk in His ways, and...do everything He tells you. The Lord has declared today that you are His people, His own special treasure, just as He promised, and that you must obey all His commands. And if you do, He will set you high above all the other nations He has made. Then you will receive praise, honour, and renown...' (Deuteronomy 26:17-19 NLT) When Old Testament priests entered the ministry they went through a rite called 'consecration'. From that moment on they belonged exclusively to God and were committed to obey Him in all things. Ok, so what does any of this have to do with me? Heaps: if you want God to use you, to honour and promote you, you can't marginalise or compartmentalise Him. You must commit yourself to doing His will! And that includes your time, your talent, your treasure, your body, your mind, your spirit, and your &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;all&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. God wants 'total commitment'.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['If we ask anything according to His will, He hears us.' 1 John 5:14 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A preacher once said, 'God speaks through the Bible!' This led to much discussion among the church: 'But God speaks through dreams and visions as well,' said one. 'And He speaks through people too - what about words of knowledge, prophecy and tongues?' pipes up another. 'Hey, didn't he once speak through a donkey?' chips in a third (talking about the story of Balaam in Numbers 22). 'Yes,' agreed the preacher, 'God speaks in all kinds of ways, but there's only one way we can guarantee what we hear from other sources is truly from God - and that's by checking it out in God's Word. God will not say anything different than what He's already told us in the Bible.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preacher was right! God speaks truth at all times, and in many different ways, but it will always check out with the principles in Scripture. So if you're struggling to know how best to live your Christian life, don't only copy others or just take advice from sermons; dive into the Bible and hear what God says direct from Heaven (but, here's a challenge, taking verses out of context is an express route to mishearing God! Don't just read the promises of God, study the conditions that go with them and check out the whole passage before you focus on one verse.) God communicates to us in many ways and we can know for sure it's His voice we're listening to if it's there in His Word. God knows what's best for us - it's so important that we listen to Him well. &lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['We are...created...to do good works...' Ephesians 2:10 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are unique, wonderful, amazing and magnificent. In fact you are 'God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for [you] to do.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yes, you. Yes. You.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, God's in the business of training you up, giving you all the right equipment, knowledge, experience, understanding and people you need in your life in order for you to achieve all these good things. He's working on your attitude, your character and thought processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are saved and God 'saved us...not because of anything we did...but because of God's purpose...before time began.' (2 Timothy 1:9 NCV) We are wanted; God '...has given each of [us] a gift from His great variety...to serve one another.' (1 Peter 4:10 NLT) We have supernatural ability to help build the church, 'A spiritual gift is given to each of us so we can help...' (1 Corinthians 12:7 NLT) We are on a mission; Jesus said, 'Go and make followers of all people in the world...' (Matthew 28:19 NCV) Don't ever think your life doesn't account for much. You're not just another face in the crowd. Your life has value and purpose, even on the days you're feeling useless!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, 'Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart...since...you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward...' (Colossians 3:23-24 NIV) Can you think of any greater incentive than that moment when you stand in His presence and hear, 'Well done,' for giving it your best shot?&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['God...will fulfil His purpose for me.' Psalm 57:2 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;'I can't do anything, I'm totally useless! And they&lt;i&gt; said I was pathetic. Just look at me. I'm hopeless, my life's a mess, everyone would be better off without me.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever thought or spoken words like this, believing inside that they're true? If so, stop. There is good, wholesome, life-lifting truth that can take the place of these sorts of lies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your self-worth is not based upon what you think or what others think about you. The one true authority on your self-worth is Jesus Christ, and since He gave His own life up in order to forgive you (read these words of truth in Luke 5:20), that should tell you just how valuable you really are. And there's more. He doesn't allow the value He's placed in you go to waste; Romans 12:6 NLT tells us; 'In His grace, God has given us different gifts for doing certain things well.' Above all else, He has made you for friendship with Him, and to bring Him glory through that friendship. The Psalmist said, 'I cry out to God...who will fulfil His purpose for me.' So, pray and ask for God's direction. Begin to list your strengths and weaknesses. Get feedback from people who will be honest with you. Once you find your God-given purpose, build your life around it, and '...do it all for the glory of God.' (1 Corinthians 10:31 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Always seek to do good to one another and to everyone...' 1 Thessalonians 5:15 ESV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A line often quoted from &lt;em&gt;Forrest Gump&lt;/em&gt; is... 'My momma always said, life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.' People are mixed bags too; they often seem to be more like chocolate seconds than a premium box of Ferrero Rocher. We may all have value in God's eyes (praise the Lord for that!), but we can also be very unpleasant to each other. So when God instructs us to look for the best in each other and 'always seek to do good to one another,' how can you do that, when you feel a person is deliberately winding you up, bullying you or setting out to make your life a living hell? You have to choose to, that's how. It is your decision. The only way to find the best in someone is to choose to look for it. God never asks us to do things that are pointless or bad for us, so when He says to do your best to bring out another person's good qualities, then choose to do it. But it's hard to &lt;em&gt;look for the best in each other, and always do your best to bring it out&lt;/em&gt; when you're looking for perfection and focusing on the other person's shortcomings. The Bible also says, 'Love...keeps no record of wrongs.' (1 Corinthians 13:4-5 NIV) So start looking a people through God's eyes and look for the best in them!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Acts 1:1-3:10, Mark 3:7-12, Ps 43, Pr 10:17-18&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['If [your city] prospers, you too will prosper.' Jeremiah 29:7 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;God cares about your home - not just the building where your family is, but the wider community you're in, right now. Maybe you don't enjoy the place you're living in, but that doesn't mean God has written off your chances of putting down roots and making the most of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might have heard people say things like 'God wants me to move here!' or, 'God wants me to move there!', whether it's to a sunny coastal town, or a city full of opportunities. That's great. Really. God does work like that. But His main concern is that you live &lt;i&gt;fully, &lt;/i&gt;in whatever place you are, right at this moment&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; That won't change your living situation, but it will change how your living situation affects you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 590 BC, many people were taken from Jerusalem to be slaves in Babylon. It was a horrendous situation. Hundreds of kilometres away from home comforts, God spoke to them through Jeremiah, telling them to, 'change your attitude, dig in and make the best of it...pray for peace and prosperity where you live, because when it prospers, you will prosper.' (Paraphrasing Jeremiah 29: 5-7)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God cares about our homes; and when we do our bit to build His Kingdom there, He says things will change for the better. What a promise! The instruction we're given in the Bible is also a beautiful picture: 'Do everything without grumbling or arguing...shine among them like stars in the sky as you hold firmly to the Word of life.' (Philippians 2:14-16 NIV) If you want to go from surviving to thriving, make the most of where God placed you.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['I take joy in doing Your will...' Psalm 40:8 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is it that we ask, 'How far can I go in this situation/with this person?' instead of 'How close can I be to God's will?'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, in relationships with the opposite gender, we tend to ask, 'How far can I go before it matters?' when 1 Corinthians 6:18 NLT says, 'Run from sexual sin! No other sin so clearly affects the body as this one does. For sexual immorality is a sin against your own body.' Your sexuality is precious. It's yours - a secret part of you. Messing around with it demeans it. That's why Paul posts a big warning sign, not a list of small print.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And anger. Psalm 4:4 NLT says; 'Don't sin by letting anger control you. Think about it overnight and remain silent.' But how many times have we gone to bed with regret? We don't stop and ask God how we can control our anger, but instead we wade into arguments with both feet. We can also find ourselves giving into temptations too easily, thinking, 'I can't help it.' But 1 Corinthians 10:13 NLT says, 'God is faithful. He will not allow the temptation to be more than you can stand. When you are tempted, He will show you a way out so that you can endure.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God wants you closer than close to His Will, because it's there that you will have greater friendship with Him. Can you, like David, say 'I take joy in doing Your will, my God, for Your instructions are written on my heart'? As believers, God's Word should be so ingrained in our hearts that we want to do what's right, and 'take joy' in doing His will.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Weep with those who weep.' Romans 12:15 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1883, poet Ella Wheeler Wilcox was travelling by train to a ball when she noticed a woman weeping. Wilcox crossed the aisle and spent the journey comforting her. When she reached her destination she was in no mood to celebrate. Later, remembering the woman on the train, she wrote a famous poem &lt;em&gt;Solitude&lt;/em&gt; which starts: 'Laugh, and the world laughs with you; weep, and you weep alone.' Holly Vicente Robaina says: 'We laugh...play...and celebrate together. Why's it so difficult to cry together? When friends hurt, Christians say, &quot;I'll pray for you&quot;...In some cases God heals and restores, but sometimes there's no miracle - it can be that there's only profound sadness. CS Lewis wrote about losing his wife: &quot;Where's God?... Go to Him when your need is desperate and what do you find? A door slammed in your face, and a sound of bolting and double-bolting on the inside.&quot; I don't think Lewis would have been comforted by &quot;God loves you...I'll pray for you.&quot; While it's great to encourage, we need to evaluate our words before we speak. Are we using &quot;encouragement&quot; to ignore somebody's pain?... When we promise to pray for somebody, do we even check on them later?' These are tough questions, but at some stage in your life you will probably be around someone in need of help through grief. Ever wonder why Jesus wept at Lazarus' tomb? He could just have told the mourners, 'Everything's ok, folks. God loves you,' and raised Lazarus. Instead He met them where they were, by crying with them.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;He's our model, when you know someone is in need, visit them, sit with them, listen to them and maybe even cry with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Acts 8-9, Mark 3:28-35, Ps 130, Pr 10:24-26&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['God knows how often I pray for you.' Romans 1:9 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suffering. No one wants it, we all try to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But have you noticed that it's the one thing every human has in common? No matter who you are, or where you're from, everyone goes through it. Pain affects us all in different ways, to different degrees, but we all know what it feels like. In his first letter, the apostle Peter encourages Christians who are being horrifically tortured for their faith. Sadly, pain and suffering have not been far from faithful Christians since the start. But no matter what sort of tough situations we're in, God wants us to help each other through them with real care. Paul frequently includes something like this in his letters: 'How often I pray for you. Day and night, I bring you and your needs in prayer to God...'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barnabas, another Christian from the Book of Acts, was actually called Joseph. 'Barnabas' was just his nickname. It means 'son of encouragement', so he was probably a fairly good friend to get a nickname like that! When we're going through a hard time we look for those who know what to say, who encourage us. So return the favour and ask God to make you that kind of friend - one who brings comfort and encouragement to others. Do you find it easy to pray for others? Ask God to make you the kind of friend whose presence brings comfort and encouragement.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Share each other's burdens, and in this way obey the law of Christ.' Galatians 6:2 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you too caught up in your own problems to help anyone else? We all feel like this sometimes, but it's not a feeling that we're supposed to carry over into a lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to live a way that puts others first, you must ask yourself: (1) What am I doing to invest in myself? You can't give what you don't have. Unless you're committed to personal growth you'll have nothing of worth to give others. So, work to 'add to your faith...knowledge' (2 Peter 1:5 NIV) and keep adding! (2) What am I doing to invest in others? Success can cause you to be self-seeking. Although it's good to make the most of your natural talent and work hard, there's always a temptation to ask, 'What can I get from others?' Instead, Christians should be asking, 'What can I give to others?' In the book &lt;em&gt;Come Be My Light&lt;/em&gt;, Mother Teresa shares her thoughts about her life and her calling to serve people. 'I don't know what the success will be...but if [we] have brought joy to one unhappy home...made one innocent child from the streets keep pure for Jesus...one dying person die in peace with God...don't you think it would be worthwhile offering everything... for just that one...because that would bring great joy to the heart of Jesus.' Mother Teresa inspired and modelled what servanthood is to the world. But her dream of helping others started small. The way in which you can bless the world around you is to do it - one life at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Gal 5:22, 2 Pet 3:3-15, Matt 5:39, 1 Sam 25:1-42&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['So we fasted and earnestly prayed...and he heard our prayer.' Ezra 8:23 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever fasted? Many Christians don't understand it, and are left wondering if it is essential to Christian living. But one thing that's very clear from the Bible is that when God asks us to do something, there's always a good reason behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fasting is not a healthy eating plan or fad diet that's been dragged up from history - it is, admittedly, something of a mystery. We know that it is a spiritual discipline meant to benefit us. As we fast, we recognise our weakness without God's provision, and our total need for God. And then, as we grow closer to Him, it can be a direct way of getting God's attention. (However this doesn't mean you should put yourself in danger. Never fast, if you have a medical condition. And if you have trouble with eating disorders, fasting should always be avoided. We really encourage you to talk to someone older that you trust about a different spiritual discipline other than fasting.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Ezra found life overwhelming, he knew God's help was essential, or he'd collapse under the weight of his problems. So he and his friends 'fasted and prayed' (Ezra 8:23). God honoured their commitment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we fast, we let God know we are serious about wanting His help. We believe with all of our being that God has the power to change things for the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it is safe for you, consider putting it into practice: fast by skipping a meal or an activity, and use that time to pray for a specific area, person or situation that you're keen to see change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Acts 12-13, Mark 4:10-20, Ps 103:13-22, Pr 10:30-32&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['Christ sacrificed His life's blood...our sins are now forgiven.' Ephesians 1:7 CEV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is the tight knot of regret a familiar feeling for you? Have the words 'if only' ever echoed around your head? &lt;em&gt;'If only I'd not done that, not said that, not agreed to that!' &lt;/em&gt;If you're going through life beating yourself up, or finding it tricky to forgive yourself, listen to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Christ sacrificed His life's blood to set us free, which means that our sins are now forgiven. Christ did this because God was so kind to us.' (Ephesians 1:7 CEV) Let God be God in your life; accept His forgiveness today!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A word of warning: failure to do so could well be seriously detrimental to your health. Your mind and feelings affect your body. Doctors say an attitude of bitterness generates chemicals that affect your vital organs: increase your heart rate, raise your blood pressure, disrupt your digestion, tense your muscles, drop cholesterol into your bloodstream, and reduce your ability to think clearly. All this comes from a life spent rehearsing the past. Science confirms that those who don't forgive themselves and others are more prone to heart attacks, depression, hypertension and other serious illnesses. It points towards a deep truth you'll find in the Bible - bitterness traps people in death, forgiveness leads to life. Start looking ahead. With God's forgiveness comes the wisdom and understanding to not only survive your past, but grow stronger as a result of it. Instead of guilt, choose gratitude. That's not hard to do; just begin to reflect on God's goodness. When you start to look for God's gifts, you'll find lots of things to thank Him for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Acts 14-15, Mark 4:21-29, Ps 16, Pr 11:1-2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['Praise the Lord...He forgives all my sins...' Psalm 103:2-3 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you've had one, you'll know that computer viruses spell doom. Malicious software spreads throughout your entire system, infects your files and, if not caught in time, can take down your whole system. Ignoring a virus is not an option, as once you have one it continues to damage and destroy, even transferring itself to any other computers it can connect to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colossians 3:13 NLT says: 'Make allowance for each other's faults, and forgive anyone who offends you. Remember, the Lord forgave you, so you must forgive others.' Unforgiveness comes naturally to humans. But forgiveness is a gift from God to Christians, to use as often as needed. Without it we're allowing the fast-acting and fast-spreading effects of unforgiveness to run riot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not always easy. We don't always feel like forgiving, it doesn't always appear right, and often we just don't feel like it. Since forgiveness goes against our nature, we must choose to do it by faith. Forgiveness is a gift from God that allows us to relate to each other with real, graceful joy - ask God to help you install it deep in your soul. Search your heart for unforgiveness - of God, of others, of yourself. And ask the Holy Spirit to help you purge it from areas you can't find. Remember: if we live our lives in personal gratitude to God, we will become accepting of His gift of forgiveness, and keener to spread it to others!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Acts 16-17, Mark 4:30-34, Ps 7:1-9, Pr 11:3-6&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

Ignoring the elderly, disregarding the homeless, prejudice against other races, carefree termination of the lives of unborn babies - attitudes all from the same root.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we notice an attitude like that crop up in ourselves, it's easy to get disheartened. Maybe we overlook the class weirdo, don't make time for our neighbours when we meet or devalue people who are different to us. Even though we know that prejudice is wrong, a little bit can slip through the net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, there is forgiveness. Secondly, although evil will always be present in this life, we can defeat it. God gives us the means. He says, 'Don't just pretend that you love others: really love them. Hate what is wrong. Stand on the side of good. Love each other with brotherly affection and take delight in honouring each other... When others are happy, be happy with them. If they are sad, share their sorrow... Don't try to act big... And don't think you know it all! Never pay back evil for evil... Don't quarrel with anyone. Be at peace with everyone, just as much as possible... never avenge yourselves. Leave that to God, for He has said that He will repay those who deserve it... Don't let evil get the upper hand but conquer evil by doing good.'

<introtext><![CDATA['Learn to serve and...grow strong.' Ephesians 4:12 CEV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;CS Lewis said, 'Joy bursts in on our lives when we go about doing the good at hand, and not trying to manipulate things and times to achieve joy.' Church isn't meant to be a place where everyone signs up to a serving roster out of obligation - far from it! God wants us &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; to participate in building His Kingdom, but our desire to do that comes from the inside out, and it can't be artificially planted on us from the outside in. When we serve out of our desire to please God, 'doing the good at hand' for Him, we will find joy. So find the place where you want to serve, and get at it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul writes: 'Just as there are many parts to our bodies, so it is with Christ's body...God has given each of us the ability to do certain things well. So if God has given you the ability to prophesy, then prophesy whenever you can, as often as your faith is strong enough to receive a message from God. If your gift is that of serving others, serve them well. If you are a teacher, do a good job of teaching. If you are a preacher, see to it that your sermons are strong and helpful. If God has given you money, be generous in helping others with it...' (Romans 12:4-8 TLB)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has given each one of us gifts. So let's use them: 'learn to serve and...grow strong.' If you're serving for any other reason than to please God, it's time to address your priorities. Put 'spending time with God' higher up your list and watch His presence flow through everything else you do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Acts 20-21, Mark 5:1-10, Ps 144:1-8, Pr 11:10-11&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['Don't let anyone think less of you...' 1 Timothy 4:12 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You shouldn't be overlooked because of your age, your gender, your nationality, your education or your financial status. That's not the way that things should work in God's Kingdom. Take the example of Timothy, in the New Testament. Timothy started preaching in his teens. He became Paul's travelling companion, which was no small honour. But in those days, society said you didn't come into maturity until you were thirty, so Timothy wasn't seen as being qualified for leadership. Since Timothy was facing flak for this, Paul wrote to him, saying, 'Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With God, it's not the length of your life that qualifies you to serve Him, but the depth of it. Look at Timothy's credentials! 'From childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures.' (2 Timothy 3:15 NKJ) Timothy had spent lots of time with God and was grounded in the truth. 'I am reminded of your sincere faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, now lives in you also.' (2 Timothy 1:5 NIV) So Paul writes to the Philippian church and says: 'I hope...to send Timothy to you soon... I have no one else like him, who will show genuine concern for your welfare. For everyone looks out for their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ. But you know that Timothy has proved himself, because...he has served with me in the work of the Gospel.' (Philippians 2:19-22 NIV) The right to work in God's service isn't determined by your age: it comes by your experience with God, your growth in grace, and learning from His Word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Acts 22-23, Mark 5:11-20, Ps 144:9-15, Pr 11:12-13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['...through love serve one another.' Galatians 5:13 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;William Wilberforce was born in 1759 in England, the son of a wealthy merchant. After studying at Cambridge, Wilberforce became a member of parliament. But it was meeting John Newton that changed his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before he became a Christian, Newton had captained a slave ship; but God convicted him of the horrors of slavery. He turned his life around, becoming a preacher and hymn writer. In fact, he wrote one of the most famous hymns of all time, &lt;em&gt;Amazing Grace&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Newton had a massive influence on Wilberforce. In 1787, Wilberforce initiated a campaign to make Great Britain aware of the atrocities of slavery and vote for its abolition. It was a fierce fight, and hard work. Politicians, industrialists, even religious leaders who had their own slaves opposed him. But William Wilberforce never gave up, always aware that the lives of millions of people were at stake. Twenty-six years later, near the end of Wilberforce's life, slavery was abolished throughout the British Empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'So let's not get tired of doing what is good. At just the right time we will reap a harvest of blessing if we don't give up.' (Galatians 6:9 NLT) Wilberforce decided to take up the challenge in today's verse and he changed history!&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant.' Mark 10:43 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;William Wilberforce not only enabled the British and American slave trade to be abolished, he was also a catalyst for the world choosing not to ignore - but to take responsibility for - the poor and suffering everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier in his life, Wilberforce spent his life wining and dining and was touted as 'the wittiest man in all of England.' Looking back on that seemingly successful life, he wrote, 'For the first years I was in Parliament I did nothing - nothing of any purpose.' It was only when he committed his life to Christ that his life, attitude and passion changed and he found His life's purpose. In chasing after God's heart, he saved the life of millions! How much could we do if chose to do the same?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilberforce drew close to God, and because of that was moved to act on the sort of things that are close to God's heart. Ephesians 2:10 NIV tells us; 'we are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.' And what's really exciting is that God 'is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to His power that is at work within us.' (Ephesians 3:20 NIV) Pursue God, dream big and work very hard - and you could be the change you want to see in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What change for the better would you like to see in our world? Make a short list and be specific. Search the web and find Christian charities that want the same change and discover how you can help too.&lt;/p&gt;

<alias><![CDATA[praying-right]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['When you ask, you don't get it because your motives are all wrong.' James 4:3 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes our prayers are 'me' centred where we treat God as a genie to be conjured up to fulfil our every wish. Then when we don't get what we want we think He doesn't hear, doesn't care, or maybe doesn't exist. James says, 'You...do not receive, because you ask amiss, that you may spend it on your pleasures.' Selfishness is at the root of many unanswered prayers. The first 'ask' in the Lord's Prayer is 'Hallowed be Your name', the second 'Your Kingdom come' and the third, 'Your will be done.' (Matthew 6:9-10 NKJV) Our first concern in prayer is supposed to be what God wants, not what we want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some suggestions for praying right:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) &lt;em&gt;Ask God to slay your sinful nature&lt;/em&gt;. Even though we are new creatures in Christ we still wrestle daily with our old nature. And when we're losing our prayers will be hindered. (2) &lt;em&gt;Ask Him to cleanse you&lt;/em&gt;. You can't come into God's presence covered in sin; you must confess it and ask Him to forgive you. (3) &lt;em&gt;Ask Him to fill you with the Holy Spirit&lt;/em&gt;. The indwelling of God's Spirit enables you to overcome temptation and live according to His will. (4) &lt;em&gt;Ask Him to guard and guide your steps&lt;/em&gt;. God's plan for our lives is always better than best. (5) &lt;em&gt;Ask Him to use you for His glory&lt;/em&gt;. Make yourself available as a servant with a willing heart to do whatever He asks. Why is this important? Because, prayer gets answered in ways you never imagined possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Acts 27-28, Mark 5:31-43, Ps 94:12-23, Pr 11:16-18&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind...' Romans 12:2 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first Christians knew where they stood. They knew they were different to those around them, not just on the surface, but deep down. They had the Spirit of Christ in them; they'd been transferred from one life to another. Starting from that place, they then made a decision to enter the culture and society around them, bringing God's Kingdom in to affect their world just like yeast works in bread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about us? Have we got our perspective settled, do we know God's word? Or are we just made up of the same stuff as the world around us? If we don't get this one down, we'll struggle with questions like: How far can I go in this situation, in this party, with this boy/girl? We wind up going around in circles and never really surfacing into the freedom that God offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible says that Christians are designed to '... shine among [others] like stars in the sky as you hold firmly to the Word of life...' (Philippians 2:14-16 NIV) Designed to bring calm and peace into chaos, healing over sickness, and Jesus' new life into empty places. Designed to hold the Holy Spirit within us, as a precious gift. To do that though, we must have a new heart. It starts inside. Letting God in, we can live a life that is beautiful, graceful and magnetic but we have to repent, submit, and let Him do the work. So, where do you stand on this issue? Your decisions and actions should always take you closer to God, not away from Him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Deut 1-2, Mark 6:1-6, Ps 35, Pr 11:19-21&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['Do not follow the crowd...' Exodus 23:2 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark D. Roberts writes: 'In [high school], a boy named Andrew was the classic nerd: overweight thick glasses skin so white it seemed hed never been outside. One day some of the boys began teasing Andrew and making fun of his appearance I saw the pain in his eyes and knew I should tell the other guys to knock it off. But I saw an opportunity to be aligned with the in-crowd. So I joined in adding my taunts as Andrew began to cry... In my heart I knew I'd done a terrible thing... Sometimes the temptation to follow the crowd is almost more than we can bear. We crave acceptance to such an extent that we do what we know is wrong so others will like us. This is true not only for insecure boys [in high school], but for just about everybody. It's hard to stand up to the crowd.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allowing anyone to feel unworthy or unloved is not ok. It's not how Jesus lived and it's not how He wants you to live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus was never led or swayed by other people's thoughts and opinions. Even His critics acknowledged, 'We know you are a man of integrity... You aren't swayed by [others].' (Matthew 22:16 NIV) When you truly know who you are in God, being desperate to impress an insecure, nasty crowd is a concern that just fizzles out. Knowing His love for you frees you from needing respect from unrespectable crowds. And if you feel like Andrew in the story, praise God that you can run into His love and shelter with a shield all around you to defend you from empty taunts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can ask God for strength anytime you need it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Deut 3-4, Mark 6:7-13, Ps 2, Pr 11:22-23&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['... You will understand later.' John 13:7 NCV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;God doesn't just forgive and forget all the sins you know you've done in the past. He's already seen and forgiven any wrong you'll do in the future too. Remember how Jesus washed the disciples feet the night before He was crucified? The disciples struggled to get why Jesus was lowering Himself to one of the muckiest jobs around, but He told them they would understand later. You see, Jesus knew they were going to perform one of the worst deeds of history that very night: He knew they were going to desert Him. By morning they would bow their heads in shame, looking down at their feet, disgusted. And when they did, Jesus wanted them to remember that He had washed their feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See? He had given them mercy and forgiven their sin before they knew they had needed it. Stunned by His love, all but one of them would give back their lives in return - by giving everything they had to the Gospel. 'The blood of Jesus, God's Son, cleanses us from every sin.' (1 John 1:7 NCV) Jesus is still in the same business of washing us clean from our sins. And this clean-up is not a future promise but a reality, right now. Max Lucado said, 'Let a speck of dust fall on the soul of a saint, and it is washed away!'&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Read the story for yourself in John 13. Pay particular attention to Jesus' very human prayer about how He felt about the choice He made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Deut 5-7, Mark 6:14-29, Ps 37:1-7, Pr 11:24-26&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['[He] redeems your life from destruction...' Psalm 103:4 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you were asked to think of someone who had really let you down or broken a promise, sadly, you could probably think of more than one person. Maybe even people in your family. Turn the tables and you know that you could probably be accused of the same at some point in your life. Good news: &lt;em&gt;God'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;s not like us&lt;/em&gt;. The point of the covenant (promise) He's made with us (that's constantly being talked about in the Bible) is that He won't ever leave you, and He won't ever break His promises. That's the case no matter how you feel - God loves you just as much when you can't sleep for guilt as when you're living your life entirely on fire for Him. That's the case whoever has a go at you, whatever situations hit you or whatever seemingly-shaming mistakes you may make. Even when you are in the thick of all that feels wrong in your life, God is working all things in it for good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says He does that for all who love Him and are called by Him. Even when you don't realise He's doing it, He redeems your life from destruction Think about all the doors that have shut on you in the past, even those that you desperately wanted to open. Know this. God doesn't keep the best from His kids. It's against His nature as your heavenly Dad. But He may keep you from what &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; think is your best. He wants His perfect way in your life. That's Gods agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's His promise to you and God never breaks His promises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Deut 8-10, Mark 6:30-44, Ps 37:8-15, Pr 11:27-29&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['... I have found my sheep which was lost.' Luke 15:6 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fun way to remember what's in Luke 15 is thinking of it as the lost property department. But unlike the sort of things you usually find there - worn-out shoes or mouldy Tupperware boxes - all these things are precious. Open your Bible up and take a look. There's the parable of the lost sheep, the lost silver coin, and the lost son. Let's start with the lost sheep story, Luke 15 verses 3 to 7. If you can, give it a read now, and then come back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This parable shows us two amazing things about Jesus, our Shepherd. (1) &lt;em&gt;We get a real sense of how God values us.&lt;/em&gt; It's easy to think that one sheep out of 100 might not be missed. But, just like shepherds would be compelled to track down a single missing sheep, the Good Shepherd was driven by His compassion to find us when we were lost. If you were to be the only person who ever sinned, Jesus would have gone to the cross and died for you! (2) &lt;em&gt;We see that God will go to amazing lengths to save you, because it is His joy to do it.&lt;/em&gt; 'When [the shepherd] has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing.' (Luke 15:5 NKJ) Jesus doesn't just save you then duck back into Heaven. He keeps you on His shoulders, bearing you up and giving you strength. His promise is, 'I will never leave you nor forsake you.' (Hebrews 13:5 NKJ)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're feeling lost today - being found is just a prayer away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Gal 5:22, Luke 6:27-36, Ex 23:1-9, Rom 12:14-21&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['... I have found the piece [of silver] which I lost!' Luke 15:9 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus' next parable was about a lost coin: 'What woman, having ten silver coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp, sweep the house, and search carefully until she finds it? And when she has found it, she calls her friends and neighbours together, saying, &quot;Rejoice with me, for I have found the piece which I lost.&quot;' (Luke 15:8-9 NKJ)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's bring out some detail in this story! The silver coin is an inanimate object. It had no feelings of being lost; it wasn't concerned about its own welfare. And it was lost, even though it was in the house. This itty-bitty parable is a big picture of people who sit in church and believe they are earning their way into Heaven by being good. They're as inanimate as the coin, not engaging at all with God's Spirit or His Word. But what did the woman in Jesus' story do to find the coin? She lit a lamp, she swept the house, and she searched for it until she found it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's what Bible-based teaching will do. He'll shake them loose from their safety and show them they need to be truly found by Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through other hearts on fire for Him, Jesus wants to sweep out the clogging dust of misunderstanding that's in the way of people properly coming to Him. God wants to shine a light on the power of His Word, and show all His children their true value! &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; could be His chosen means of bringing them back to Him!

<introtext><![CDATA['... [My] son was lost, and is found.' Luke 15:24 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last, but not least, it's the parable of the lost son. In this story the son &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; he was lost - he knew his way home. No one came looking for him like the Shepherd seeking the sheep, or the woman seeking her coin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this story, after throwing his inheritance away, living recklessly on the best the world could offer, the son finds himself minding pigs. And he's jealous of their food. But in the pigsty he comes to his senses: 'I will go back to my father and say to him: &quot;Father, I have sinned,&quot;... But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him... the father said to his servants, &quot;Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet... Let's have a feast and celebrate. For this son of mine was lost and is found...'&quot; (Luke 15:17-24 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The son didn't feel worthy of love, but all the father cared about was that his lost child had come home. And no sin exists greater than the love God the Father has for you. He'll act in &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; the same way as the father in this story. He will never give you the cold shoulder if you choose to run back to Him. He will always, always, welcome you home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's welcoming grace for you today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Deut 14-17, Mark 7:1-13, Ps 37:25-31, Pr 12:1-3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['Some parents brought their children to Jesus...' Mark 10:13 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus was teaching in Judea and drawing quite a crowd. People were also, 'bringing little children to Jesus for Him to place His hands on them, but the disciples rebuked them. When Jesus saw this, He was indignant. He said to them, &quot;Let the little children come to Me, and do not hinder them, for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these.&quot;' (Mark 10:13NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disciples assumed Jesus wouldn't want to include the children. Instead Jesus was not only keen to allow them in, but to bless them too. We can easily have the same attitude and judgment as the disciples did with people who don't yet know Jesus. We can let our judgments take hold of us and assume that they won't want to hear the Good News because of their bold atheism, drug addiction or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Gospel, the Person of Jesus Christ, is not just for people who &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; think are fit to hear or most likely to listen. It's not your job to convince; it's your job to share. When we grow closer to Him, His life in us will become more magnetic to those around us. And we'll naturally start wanting to share the Gospel and be more open with people we wouldn't usually give a second look. Remember, often the people who are most passionately against Christianity can be the ones seeking the most, without them or us knowing it. Jesus was busy yet He made time to bless little children. The little children in our lives might be young or young in their faith but we too should look for opportunities to bless!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Deut 18-21, Mark 7:14-23, Ps 37:32-40, Pr 12:4-6 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['... You are precious to Me...' Isaiah 43:4 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look for love in the wrong places and you'll end up feeling like you've been chewed up and spat out. Even if you feel adored and respected one minute, you may end up feeling discarded and thrown away like old newspaper the next. Perhaps you've actually grown up with that sense of being discarded, unwanted and unloved. Maybe you feel or have felt unlovable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing: that sort of 'love' is a tremendous lie so it's a pleasure to introduce you to someone who sees you with a truer, clearer love. And He sees you as perfectly lovable! More than that, He put you together in your mother's womb, so as far as He's concerned you are a masterpiece. The security and stability in your worth comes from seeing yourself as God sees you. (1) &lt;em&gt;You'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;re loveable to Him&lt;/em&gt;, 'You are precious to Me. You are honoured, and I love you. Do not be afraid, for I am with you...' (Isaiah 43:4-5) (2) &lt;em&gt;Valuable.&lt;/em&gt; 'The Son of God, who loved [you], and gave Himself for [you].' (Galatians 2:20 NIV) Jesus gave His life for you so that you could have life and have it to the full! (3) &lt;em&gt;Capable.&lt;/em&gt; You are God-made with God-given talents. He's '...given...you...special abilities...' (1 Peter 4:10 TLB) There are things that God has given only to you. And hope that God alone can give you. Turn to Him, and find love. Furthermore, He has '...seated us with Him in His heavenly Kingdom...' (Ephesians 2:6 NIV) So stay in your seat and don't let anybody tell you that your life doesn't matter. It does, because God says so!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Luke 24:50-53, Acts 1:1-11, Eph 4:7-10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'My grace is all you need. My power works best in weakness...' 2 Corinthians 12:9 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we feel incapable or not strong enough in our own efforts we can feel tempted to rely on other things to help us through. It's no secret that celebrities often turn to drugs to deal with their constant goldfish bowl existence in the public eye. Jason Donovan, star of the TV show &lt;em&gt;Neighbours&lt;/em&gt;, once said that off drugs he just wanted to get away from everyone, but on them he felt like the master of the party. But the 'strength' he found in drugs almost killed him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are feeling weak or unable to cope, God says not only can He cope with it, but that, actually, His strength is perfected in our weakness. So long as we are relying completely on Him. When we feel too weak to resist temptation, Paul's answer is this: 'The temptations in your life are no different from what others experience. And God is faithful. He will not allow the temptation to be more than you can stand. When you are tempted, He will show you a way out so that you can endure.' (1 Corinthians 10:13 NLT) Peace in God's strength is actually a choice. We have to listen to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Constantly dwelling on a weakness just reinforces it, whereas applying the Scriptural solution brings results. And the good news is, you don't have to do it alone. God is available to help you. He told Paul, '...My grace is all you need. My power works best in weakness...'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Deut 22-24, Mark 7:24-37, Ps 44:1-8, Pr 12:7-9&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp;amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia. 2012 UCB International Ltd&lt;img src=&quot;http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=4&amp;amp;track=51644&amp;amp;www=blog&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'There is another power within me that is at war with my mind...' Romans 7:23 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a famous story: &lt;em&gt;A suicide note is found at the body of a brilliant doctor. The genius has created a potion which enables a person to behave in ways uncharacteristic of themselves. The potion takes away the things that bind and opens up a new freedom and courage. Except the freedom sets loose a savage. No longer sensitive to the lives of others, the potion encourages wild selfish mood swings and awakens deadly desires. Soon murder is permissible; nothing stands in the way of the selfish desire. It's like a destructive alter-ego birthed in man. The story is Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and at its end, the doctor sees no alternative but suicide - only then will he be rid of his soul's dark shadow, Mr Hyde.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Louis Stevenson's famous dark tale serves as a warning to us about the monster within. Paul is only too aware of our Jekyll-and-Hyde nature, 'I love God's law with all my heart. But there is another power within me that is at war with my mind. This power makes me a slave to sin that is still within me.' (Romans 7:22-23 NLT) No potion necessary, we all have a wild savage let loose inside us. The trick is to starve Mr Hyde and feed Dr Jekyll. Feed your prayer life; starve your wild thought-life. Feed your Bible reading; starve your sin. Feed your values; starve temptation. Spend time with friends talking about the things of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;‘You have…put a wall of protection around him.’ Job 1:10 NLT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;Job was at his wit’s end. His body was in excruciating pain with scabs and broken flesh where disease had eaten away at him. He was exhausted from the sleepless nights when dark thoughts raced around his mind. Grief weighed down like a stone on his chest. His marriage was in tatters, his children all dead when they’d gone to a party and the roof had collapsed on them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;He’d obeyed God all his life. Surely that should have counted for something? Why was God punishing him? It didn’t make sense. God had always protected him previously. But the situation was so bad, death couldn’t be any worse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;At last, seemingly long overdue, God stepped into the picture, armed with healing and restoration. Finally, the breath of resurrection blew into the room. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;And the same promise is for you when your world crumbles around you. When your mind, your health, or your relationships are attacked, the pain is raw and real. But it’s only for a time. God won’t allow more pain than you can possibly endure. Just when you think it’s impossible to take any more, the breath of resurrection will blow into your room. God’s promises are true. ‘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;versetext4&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;’ (Psalm 147:3 NIV) And&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;versetext4&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Cambria','serif';&quot;&gt;... ‘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;versetext4&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;Blessed is the one who perseveres under trial because, having stood the test, that person will receive the crown of life that the Lord has promised to those who love Him.’ James 1:12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;versetext4&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Cambria','serif';&quot;&gt; (NIV)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt; &lt;span&gt;‘…No man ever spoke like this Man!’ John 7:46 NKJ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;The power of words: words can be like a mask you hide behind; words can set a spark in someone’s heart; words can cut a scar into another; words can comfort; words can destroy; words send the tanks in; words sign the peace treaty; the world turns on words. It’s no surprise then that John starts his Gospel off referring to Jesus as the Word of God. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;Think for a second about the power of Jesus’ words: ordinary uneducated fishermen sparked a revolution that is still unfolding today because of these words; monks would spend all night by candlelight turning over these words in their minds; slave-traders would unlock shackles at the force of these words; cathedrals, paintings, frescoes, poems, plays, books and films would shoot into existence inspired by these words; the Salvation Army would create a blueprint for the modern welfare system stirred by these words; alcoholics put down bottles, cancers pack their bags, addicts bin their needles — and all because of Jesus’ words. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;History shows that words change people. And words can change you too - if you let them. Which of Jesus words are your favourites? Journal them or write them in a place that you’ll return to, and open yourself up to being changed by them. Then when you need inspiration, a pick-me-up, comfort, healing, truth or encouragement — choose one of those highlighted diamonds from the mind of Jesus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;‘… Deliver us from the evil one...’ Matthew 6:13 NKJ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;Our last look at the Lord’s Prayer starts with a question: What do you pray when temptation is crawling up your collar? Answer: ‘Do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one...’ (Matthew 6:13 NKJ) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;It’s not God who dangles the carrot of temptation: we have certain pulls and desires within us, and Satan wants to jump on them. Therefore we pray for God to save us from ourselves and to deliver us, or rescue us, from the evil one’s exploitative traps. Here’s the good news then: if we bring our weaknesses to God, not only does He work on our behalf; in the process we get closer to Him. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;Paul had this one sussed: ‘I am glad to boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may work through me.’ (2 Corinthians 12:9 NLT) Paul actually boasts — yes, boasts! — about his weaknesses: ‘...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;to keep me from being puffed up with pride...I was given a painful physical ailment, which acts as Satan’s messenger to...keep me from being proud&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;…’ (2 Corinthians 12:7 GNT) You’ll often find a weakness attached to strength, acting as a governor to keep you from becoming boastful or running ahead of God. Gideon chose 32,000 men to fight the Midianites, but God reduced his numbers to 300 (see Judges 7). Why? So that Israel would know it was God’s power and not their own that saved them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;Your most painful area of weakness CAN become your area of greatest strength: so, pray into it, hard, and watch yourself walk more and more closely with God at the same time. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;‘…Forgive us…as we forgive...’ Matthew 6:12 NKJ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;So far, so good with our trip through the Lord’s Prayer. We’ve reminded ourselves that God is our Father and He wants what is best for us. We’ve thought about being dependent on our heavenly Father as He provides bread for us both physically and spiritually. And today Jesus asks us to think about speaking well of the people who have crushed and stamped on our hearts. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;Sorry, run that last one by us again, Jesus? Surely you mean us to pray for God to send a lightning bolt to zap our enemies, right? Surely there’s a typo in your words, ‘Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors’? We can live with the first bit — we’ve run up enormous debts against God, but He forgives us. But what’s that about me forgiving that vermin who’s ruined my life? Are you serious?! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;Jesus majors on extending mercy to those who don’t deserve it. After all, where would we be if God held a grudge? So Jesus wants us to practice letting go of our grudges. There is no resentment in Heaven and God wants us to start living like that now on earth. Ask the Holy Spirit to help you forgive the person who has wronged you. If you’re feeling even braver, ask God to doubly bless them — that really is what Jesus loves!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;SoulFood: Num 4:34-6:27, Matt 10:32-42, Ps 104:24-35, Pr 3:11-12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;‘… Give us this day our daily bread…’ Matthew 6:11 NKJ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;Fresh bread mmm... that lovely smell that wafts from the bakery... &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;Jesus taught, &lt;i&gt;'Give us this day our daily bread.'&lt;/i&gt; Notice the word 'daily'. That’s because you can't fight today's battles on the strength of yesterday's bread. In the wilderness God's people were only permitted to collect enough manna for one day. If they tried to collect more, it rotted. It's wonderful to talk about what God did yesterday and what He's going to do tomorrow, but all you've got is today. 'Give us this day our daily bread. What God's provided for you today is what you need to stand up to the challenges you face. This prayer is an expression of faith. The very act of asking shows you believe God's got what you need and that He cares enough to provide for you. It says, 'I don't need to go to anybody else but You, Lord.' So turn off your phone, computer and TV, shut the door, get down on your knees, approach God in faith and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;pray, 'Give me what I need for this day.' God knows what you need, you don't! And He’ll provide for you today so you'll be able to handle whatever life throws at you. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;If people start getting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt; on your nerves for no apparent reason or you start having all sorts of mood swings or you find yourself living by &lt;i&gt;feelings&lt;/i&gt; instead of &lt;i&gt;faith&lt;/i&gt;, it's probably because you're not eating right. It's time to go back to your Source and say, 'Lord, I've come for my daily bread.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;SoulFood: Ex 20:8-11, Is 58:13-14, Lk 4:16, Heb 10:19-25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;‘Therefore, pray…Our Father in Heaven...’ Matthew 6:9 NKJ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;The disciples genuinely wanted to get close to God, but they didn’t always know how. However they did know Jesus would hold the key. Their request has left us the most beautiful prayer ever. (1) &lt;i&gt;'Our Father in Heaven.'&lt;/i&gt; When you say, 'Father' you’re acknowledging that you're 'family', that you have a special relationship with God which entitles you to go to Him at any time, confident you're loved, welcomed and assured of His favour. When you say, 'in Heaven,' you can go no higher. You're putting your request to the ultimate source of goodness, grace, mercy, provision, protection and authority. What a privilege! (2) &lt;i&gt;'Hallowed be Your name.'&lt;/i&gt; (Matthew 6:9 NKJ) Whatever you do today, whether in thought, word or deed, let it honour God. People should be able to look at your life and want to become acquainted with the One you serve. (3) &lt;i&gt;'Your Kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in Heaven.' &lt;/i&gt;(Matthew 6:10 NKJ) Each time you choose to say no to yourself and yes to God's will, you demonstrate to a watching world what it means to live as a citizen of His Kingdom. Note the words, 'as it is in Heaven.' Is anyone in Heaven fearful or doubting? Stubborn or disobedient? Critical or negative? When you come across something that's contrary to God's will, you have the authority to rise up and say, 'If it's not done and approved in Heaven it has no place in my life here on earth.' The one thing Satan hopes you never discover is that you have the God-given authority to restrict his movements in your life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;‘Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.’ Romans 10:17 NKJ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;Millions of people around the world foolishly depend on horoscopes for their daily dose of wisdom. They see the Bible as old and outdated and so would rather put their trust in an unknown group of people who’ll interpret the movements of exploding spheres of gas zillions of kilometres away to advise them on whether they’ll have a good or bad day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;Trust a bunch of strangers or turn to God? Tough choice! There is so much wisdom in the Bible and you don’t even need special training (although that’s a good idea too). You can start simply by opening it. In it you’ll find the stories of God’s dealings with people throughout history. It’s a book that has repeatedly proven helpful in grounding, correcting and inspiring countless people for thousands of years. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;The latest celebrity songsters may have the odd clever sound byte, but will we be combing the lyrics of pop-stars for life guidance in two thousand years time? True, the Bible is longer than the average song. But, did you know it is possible to read the entire New Testament in a month by reading just nine chapters every day? No more excuses — get stuck into your Bible! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;Here’s a helpful checklist: (1) Find a translation that floats your boat. (2) Don’t use it as a lucky dip — have a systematic plan. (3) Follow the plan but don’t have a guilt trip if you miss a day. If you start &lt;i&gt;SoulFood &lt;/i&gt;today, you’ll have read your whole Bible in a year. (4) Expect that God will speak to you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;‘Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and your plans will succeed.’ Proverbs 16:3 NIV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;It seems like too good to be true, doesn’t it? ‘Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and your plans will succeed.’ Now, it doesn’t say, ‘Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and your plans will succeed &lt;i&gt;at once&lt;/i&gt;.’ Or &lt;i&gt;without any effort on your part&lt;/i&gt;. Or &lt;i&gt;without any mistakes along the way&lt;/i&gt;. God didn’t say you wouldn’t stumble. He just promises to pick you up when you do, dust you off, correct you when you need it and keep on keeping on with you. ‘The Lord directs the steps of the godly... Though they stumble, they will never fall, for the Lord holds them by the hand.’ (Psalm 37: 23-24 NLT) So don’t get bent out of shape when things don’t work out perfectly — by God’s grace, you’re still heading towards the goal He’s helping you achieve. Remember: God can bring good out of bad situations. Out of the ashes of a disaster, He can create astonishing beauty. (That’s one of the reasons why He’s God!) ‘God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God and are called according to His purpose for them.’(Romans 8:28 NLT) So, don’t give up if you’re hitting struggles and setbacks. Success awaits those who do not give up! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;‘Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and your plans will succeed.’ Proverbs 16:3 NIV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;By now, you’ve probably been warned a few times about the perils and pitfalls of making a bad decision. And that’s wise.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;But sometimes paralysis — just sitting there and not making that all-important decision — can be just as risky. Picture a donkey standing between two bales of hay, unable to decide which one to eat and afraid of making the wrong choice. Eventually he just starves to death!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;So how can you avoid being an ass? (1) &lt;i&gt;Stop trying to please everybody&lt;/i&gt;. ‘Fear of man is a dangerous trap, but to trust in God means safety.’ (Proverbs 29:25 TLB) Once you know God’s will, don’t be thrown off track by others. (2) &lt;i&gt;When God is on your side, you’ll succeed.&lt;/i&gt; Fear of failure can stop you going places but fear is just an emotion. God’s Word, on the other hand, is unshakeable: ‘Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and your plans will succeed.’ (Proverbs 16:3 NIV) (3) &lt;i&gt;Stay in tune, stay on track&lt;/i&gt;. As long as you keep close to God in prayer, your steps can’t fail. ‘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;wordsofchrist&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;I am the light of the world. Whoever follows Me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;’ (John 8:12 NIV) So pray!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;‘Cross-examine me, O Lord...’ Psalm 26:2 TLB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;2dropcap&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;There’s a story &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;about a guy named Bill. He phoned his boss and said: ‘I believe you’re looking for an experienced, talented, hard-working manager for your office. I’d like to apply for the position.’ The boss replied, ‘We already have someone in that job and he’s excellent. By the way, your voice sounds familiar. Do I know you?’ The guy replied, ‘It’s me Bill; I was just checking up on myself!’ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;Just like Bill, you need to check up on yourself regularly. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;You need to invite God to cross-examine every detail of your case, scrutinise the facts, expose any corruption and get to the truth, no matter how deep He has to dig. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;When we invite the Holy Spirit to scrutinise us, He makes us aware of the stuff that doesn’t add up. The dirty secrets we’d like to keep dead and buried rise to the top. Confronted with our darkness and sin, we have some options: to justify why we did it or to ask God to deal with it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;The Psalmist prayed: 'I have tried to keep Your laws and have trusted You without wavering. Cross-examine me, O Lord...test my motives and affections too. For I have taken Your loving-kindness and Your truth as my ideals.' (Psalm 26:1-3 TLB) It may not be nice facing up to our sin but it certainly benefits us. Confession opens up forgiveness. And forgiveness sets a prisoner free: you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;SoulFood: Dan 11-12, Matt 9:14-26, Ps 89:38-52, Pr 3:1-2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;‘… Keep your conscience clear...’ 1 Timothy 1:19 NLT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;Paul insists we know the difference between right and wrong. No matter what advantages there are in twisting our sense of right, Paul warns us to stay God’s side of the fence. He lays it on the line to Timothy: ‘Cling to your faith in Christ, and keep your conscience clear. For some people have deliberately violated their consciences; as a result, their faith has been shipwrecked.’ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;Now, a captain doesn’t set out to wreck his ship. But if he falls asleep at the wheel or takes his eye off the compass, he will end up on the rocks anyway. The question is not, ‘Can I get away with it?’ No, the question is, ‘Can I live with it afterwards? How will it affect my confidence before God? How does He feel about it? Who am I trying to please?’ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;In Romans 14:23 NLT, he gives another warning: ‘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;But if people have doubts about whether they should [do] something, they shouldn't [do] it. They would be condemned for not acting in faith before God. If you do anything you believe is not right, you are sinning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;’ After all what good is it to receive everybody’s respect but not deserve it? Keep your life clean and clear before God.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;‘God…made Jesus perfect by suffering.’ Hebrews 2:10 CEV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;The angel of death passed over every home smeared with lamb or goat blood. Yet that was specific to that particular story in the Bible (find it in Exodus 12). Cancer doesn’t skip your house just because there’s a ‘Shalom’ sign hung on the wall. Debt doesn’t leave you alone just because there is a Christian fish sticker on your car bumper. Weekly attendance at church doesn’t send suffering an ‘excuse me’ note. The best of us will have our dose of pain. It’s part and parcel of the ride. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;Jesus gives Peter a verbal slap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;wrist when he suggests that Christ should not suffer, ‘Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block…you do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men…If anyone would come after Me, he must deny himself…take up his cross.’ (Matthew 16:23-24 NIV) Harsh words. But let’s not be surprised when misery knocks on our door. Jesus has promised it. God uses suffering to make us more Christ-like. ‘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;It was good that I had to suffer in order to learn Your laws.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;’ (Psalm 119:71 GWT) Remember, it's by His wounds we are healed (Isaiah 53:5), and by His weakness that we are made strong.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;‘God…made Jesus perfect by suffering.’ Hebrews 2:10 CEV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;The Bible says, ‘God…made Jesus perfect by suffering.’ Pain is a learning experience. A friend cheats on us, an illness steals our youth, a parent abandons us — none of us escapes pain. Even ‘Jesus…had to suffer before He could learn what it really means to obey God.’ (Hebrews 5:8 CEV) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;Philip Yancey writes: ‘God understood physical pain, having designed the marvellous nervous system that warns against harm… In thirty-three years on earth Jesus learned about hardship, rejection and betrayal. And He learned too about pain: what it feels like to have an accuser leave the red imprint of his fingers on your face…to have a crude iron spike pounded through muscle, tendon, and bone. On earth, the Son of God learned all that.’ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;Jesus took His degree in suffering. A lone man abandoned by His friends, nailed naked on a cross — at one point He even feels abandoned by God. Everything He has lived for seemed lost. And when we cry at the storm clouds, ‘God, where are You?’ we know Jesus has been there too. By joining us on earth, Jesus gave visible, historical proof that God hears our groans and groans along with us. Suffering isn’t the last word, resurrection is. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;‘… Be it known…that we will not ...’ Daniel 3:18 KJV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;Wonder what the final thoughts of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego were as they were carried towards the furnace? Perhaps there were a few last flashes of doubt as they were dragged to the ovens. Did Shadrach think, ‘Nobody else is risking martyrdom — why should I?’ Or what about Meshach? ‘Better a live dog than a dead lion. If we stay alive, maybe we can do good for God and for others?’ Possibly Abednego wavered as the heat began to warm his cheeks, ‘Where are You, Lord?’ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;Doubt, reason, self-pity can all impinge on our journey of faith, rightly or wrongly. But what’s so commendable about this situation is that neither logic, nor emotion, nor circumstance could separate these Hebrew boys from their conviction in God. They were prepared to die for what they believed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;If you want a faith that goes down in history (whether that’s earth’s history books or Heaven’s scrolls!), you’ll need a priority list that has ‘God’ written at #1. God must be the ruler of logic, fear, situation, danger — the lot. These guys put their faith on the line in the public domain with everyone watching. The result: a whole nation turned its heart back to God. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;Paul said, ‘I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.’ (Philippians 4:13 NKJ) So if the spotlight ever turns on you, do you want to be able to stand strong with God? Those who answered ‘yes’ had best get ready for the flames. In your prayer times today, ask God to increase your capacity to grow and your capacity to cope. &lt;span style=&quot;background: lime;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;‘David inquired again of God…’ 1 Chronicles 14:14 NKJ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;Picture this: the Commander-in-Chief of the Australian Army holds a phone to his ear. The enemy’s closing in. Fighter jets are tearing through the sky. Battleships are moving in. And still the Prime Minister refuses to act. ‘Prime Minister, this is a red alert,’ the head of the army bawls into the phone. ‘If we don’t fight back now; Australia will be enemy-occupied territory. When do you want us to issue orders to attack?’ ‘Not yet,’ a cool-headed PM replies. ‘Then when?’ There is a pause, as if the PM is listening to a higher power. ‘When you hear the sound of leaves rustling in the treetops — then you will know it is the moment to move. Then and only then, give the signal!’ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;Yeah, right! Yet David does almost exactly this in 1 Chronicles 14 (check it out for yourself). So attuned to God is this giant-slayer that he is willing to ignore all danger signs in favour of an odd piece of strategy, dreamed up through prayer. David gets his victory because he will not make a move without first consulting God. David waited upon a sound. He knew the voice of God so well he could recognise it in the movement of mulberry bushes. David put faith over logic. He knew God would not fail him — the real question was, would he fail God? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;Bottom line: When God speaks (compare His words with the Bible to check it sounds like Him!), no matter how bizarre the request, follow it through. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;SoulFood: Dan 3-4, Matt 8:18-27, Ps 84, Pr 2:16-19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;‘… Be it known…that we will not...’ Daniel 3:18 KJV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;All through life you’ll come across people who will try to control you. Their threats can sound real, and the consequences of ignoring them, intimidating. Look at Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. Their commitment to God landed them in a fiery furnace hotter than the inside of a volcano. But it also promoted them to a place of huge blessing and influence. Their story in Daniel 3 teaches us that in a real test of character the outcome is not in your hands. You make the choice to do what is right before God and leave the consequences to Him. It's a trial by fire, but it's a fire of refinement, and on the other side of it you come out stronger. Each time you do the right thing, choosing to walk rather than escape the path God has called you on, you enter a new level of freedom. And as Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego discovered, three things happen: (1) You are set free from the 'Nebuchadnezzars' who claim to have control over the outcome of your life. (2) You are set free to say 'no' to those who would try to use and manipulate you. (3) You are set free to serve your all-powerful King and say 'no' to all the other pretenders who really have no power over you at all. In that moment you not only gain insight into who you are, but more importantly, Whose you are. And God will do one of two things: develop you in the fiery furnace or deliver you from it. He may even do both!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;‘There is another power within me that is at war with my mind…’ Romans 7:23 NLT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;It’s a famous story: &lt;i&gt;A suicide note is found at the body of a brilliant doctor. The genius has created a potion which enables a person to behave in ways uncharacteristic of themselves. The potion takes away the things that bind and opens up a new freedom and courage. Except the freedom sets loose a savage. No longer sensitive to the lives of others, the potion encourages wild selfish mood swings and awakens deadly desires. Soon murder is permissible; nothing stands in the way of the selfish desire. It’s like a destructive alter-ego birthed in man.&lt;/i&gt; The story is Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and at its end, the doctor sees no alternative but suicide — only then will he be rid of his soul’s dark shadow, Mr Hyde. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Robert Louis Stevenson’s famous dark tale serves as a warning to us about the monster within. Paul is only too aware of our Jekyll-and-Hyde nature, ‘I love God’s law with all my heart. But there is another power within me that is at war with my mind. This power makes me a slave to sin that is still within me.’ (Romans 7:22-23 NLT) No potion necessary, we all have a wild savage let loose inside us. The trick is to starve Mr Hyde and feed Dr Jekyll. Feed your prayer life; starve your wild thought-life. Feed your Bible reading; starve your sin. Feed your values; starve temptation. Spend time with friends talking about the things of God.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;SoulFood: Lev 26-27, Matt 7:15-29, Ps 74:12-23, Pr 2:7-8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title><![CDATA[What Do You See?]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[what-do-you-see]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;‘We have seen His glory...’ John 1:14 NIV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;What are your eyes fixed on? Fame? The trouble with fame is, it’s one big popularity contest. In order to stay popular you have to keep up with the times. But the times change and so do you. You have to change to fit in and you can forget who you are in the first place. Is this why so many celebs end up in a mess? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;Maybe your eye is fixed on money. The trouble with money is, how much is enough? There is always somebody richer; there will always be something just too expensive for you to buy. How much does a rich person need? Answer: just a little bit more. Is this why the saying goes: ‘money can’t buy happiness’? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;Or perhaps your eye is focused on pleasure. The problem with pleasure is, the heart is never satisfied. Thrills promise satisfaction but soon the buzz is gone and the heart wants more, only this time bigger and better. Is this how addiction grows? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;Only with eyes fixed on Jesus can we find what our souls truly crave. God made us so God understands what we need to feel alive — really alive. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;‘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;Indulging in luxuries, wine, and rich food will never make you [rich].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;’ (Proverbs 21:17 GNT) To be rich in God, we need to fix our eyes on Him and pursue the lifestyle He wants, rather than one of pleasure, thrill and success. ‘Seek the Kingdom of God above all else, and live righteously, and He will give you everything you need.’ (Matthew 6:33 NLT)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;SoulFood: Ex 20:4-6, Deut 7:17-8:2, Is 40:18-31, Col 3:5-10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot; class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;2dropcap&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: windowtext; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot; class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;2dropcap&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: windowtext; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;People have tried all sorts of strange methods to get beyond the reach of temptation over the centuries: living in deserts or on deserted islands, or even on the top of high poles. But the fact is: y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: windowtext; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;ou’ll never be exempt from the lure of forbidden fruit. Each new season of life just brings temptation in a different form. Money, sexual fulfilment, even the desire for peace — &lt;i&gt;but at any price&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: normal; margin-top: 0cm;&quot; class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: windowtext; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;You never become so spiritual that Satan will throw up his hands in defeat as soon as he looks your way. Not even Jesus managed to achieve that. Even after forty days of prayer and fasting, Satan tempted Him. You are as open to attack after a great spiritual experience as you are in your lowest moments. Satan understood Jesus’ assignment and he was out to stop Him from accomplishing it. And he is out to stop you too! But how did Jesus stop Satan in his tracks? With the Word of God! So, which Scriptures have you memorised to help you conquer the tempter when he comes storming against you? What are your areas of weakness? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: windowtext; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;Don’t be ashamed to admit your struggles to God because remember He knows what it is like to be tempted. Pray for His help to stand strong. Like Jesus, memorise a verse to say aloud when temptation comes your way. (You could search biblegateway.com for suitable passages.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;‘…And they chose…Philip...’ Acts 6:5 NKJ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;The Bible says: ‘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;versetext4&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;We reached Caesarea and stayed at the house of Philip the evangelist...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt; He had four unmarried daughters who prophesied.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;’ (Acts 21:8-9 NIV) Philip was obviously a family man as well as a God-getting hero. He was the leader of one of the first, fastest-growing churches. He risked his life in the desert. He spoke to thousands from a platform. But the Bible takes time to point out one of his biggest heroic feats: being a good dad. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;See, with God, people are always more important than projects. What use is your Grammy-winning Gospel album if you’ve trodden on your producer to get it made? What good is your Youth Group if you’ve deliberately avoided inviting the kids from the local neighbourhood? What good are projects at the expense of people? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Philip’s diary must have been fit to burst with opportunity, and yet he still has time to nurture his family. And so must we avoid prioritising the latest opportunity over people who need us most. Perhaps your biggest display of the reality of the Gospel today might be phoning your gran, or checking in with ones of the lonely oldies from church. People, not projects, are what it’s about. Neglecting people is never good, spending quality time with someone is. Switching off your phone and giving them your full attention shows you care. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;SoulFood: Lev 18-20, Matt 6:9-18, Ps 71:1-16, Pr 2:1-2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;‘… And they chose…Philip.’ Acts 6:5 NKJ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Philip was one of seven men chosen to lead the church in its early days, just after Jesus returned to Heaven. He was off conducting a city-wide crusade when God sent an angel with a message. ‘Head off into the desert. I’ve got a job for you.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;The &lt;i&gt;desert&lt;/i&gt;?! Philip would have been scratching his head, wondering. He was needed right where he was: people were coming to believe in Jesus and well, you know how it is, Lord! You’ve got to seize the day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;But Philip left his comfort zone and stepped out to make some serious history. For on the desert road he met an eunuch who was secretary to the Queen of Ethiopia. The eunuch was reading the prophecy of Isaiah and puzzling over what it meant. And Philip was just the man to explain it. That chance encounter led the stranger to Christ and an entire nation to salvation. All because Philip was prepared to leave security behind and venture to the unknown, step by step with God. ‘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;So those who suffer as God wants should trust their souls to the faithful Creator as they continue to do what is right.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;’ (1 Peter 4:19 NCV) Are you willing to be a Philip?

<introtext><![CDATA['Serve the Lord with gladness...' Psalm 100:2 KJV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know those people who talk themselves up and can't help letting you know how wonderful they are? You can't think what you did to encourage them other than smile and say, 'Hi!'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul writes 'You may brag about yourself, but the only approval that counts is the Lord's approval.' (2 Corinthians 10:18 CEV) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your self-worth is based on anything other than God's approval, you won't serve with the right motives. Insecure people worry about how they'll be perceived by others: they hide their weaknesses beneath layers of protective pride. The more insecure you are, the more you need people to serve you, and the more you work for their acceptance. The thing is, if we hold other people's opinions of us above God's, we can stop being obedient to Him because we're too worried and stifled by what other people think. No wonder Paul writes, 'let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles.' (Hebrews 12:1 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free yourself from being trapped by concern over the thoughts and opinions of others. Make it easier on yourself and let your heart be glad to be released. Serve the Lord and every day make time to worship Him and pray. It is God we need to serve with gladness and we start by serving others!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Jesus knew that one of His closest friends would betray Him. Perhaps Judas wasn’t in it entirely for the thirty pieces of silver. Perhaps he was just frustrated that Jesus was healing the sick and feeding thousands of people when He could have been challenging the might of Rome. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;But if he was, Judas got it all wrong. He and Jesus were travelling on two completely different paths. The Messiah didn’t whip up a crowd of angry rebels from the streets into an uprising to oust the Romans. Instead, Jesus walked a solitary trail to the cross. And there was no sign of bitterness from Him. He didn’t call on the disciples to take revenge for the injustice done to Him. He didn’t pounce on Peter for turning chicken before the rooster crowed. He didn’t press the delete button on Thomas’ doubts. Jesus knew His destiny and no bitterness, betrayal or doubt would throw Him off course. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;There’s a lesson for us. When friends turn their back on us, colleagues doubt us or other people blank us, stay on the track God has laid out. No swerving off on Resentment Road or Sour Taste Street. If there’s someone you’re holding a grudge against, ask for God’s help to forgive, and the power to let go. The Bible says ‘Get rid of all bitterness… Instead, be kind to each other, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, just as God through Christ has forgiven you.’ (Ephesians 4:31-32 NLT) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['What the law was powerless to do...God did by sending His own Son.' Romans 8:3 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;God is good, God is in control, God desires to be in a relationship with us. But - and it's a big BUT - if we're not properly sorted in that relationship with God, we're in big trouble!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's because we all do wrong and fall short of God. We sin. Some sins are bigger and some are smaller. But a fall from God, whether it's big or small, is a fall from the highest height in the universe. We've hit rock bottom, all of us - no matter how good we think we are. That's the state of humanity, and it isn't pretty. We're scrabbling in the dirt, living our lives without God. So where do we go from here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a way back. To scale back up the height we've fallen takes more than the most colossal effort. It would take a human being with more than a good track record. It would take someone perfect. The question posed by Christianity is: 'What if that person existed?'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'God loved the world so much that He gave His only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him may not die but have eternal life.' (John 3:16 GNT) A friend at &lt;em&gt;word4U2day&lt;/em&gt; HQ tweeted recently, 'Jesus came not to rub it in, but to rub it out.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have a problem. But. You are forgiven. Jesus' offer is right off the 'too good to be true' scale, but it needs a response from you to make it real in your life. You have to let Him sort your problem out and now is the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['Faith without deeds is dead.' James 2:26 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If one of your friends told you that his mum was seriously ill and he was scared about the test results, would you say, 'I'll keep my fingers crossed for you?' It's the thought that counts, but we all know that's a bit pointless, really. 'By the power of these nimble digits, let the results be OK!' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, if you say, 'I'll pray for her' and then never give it a second thought, why bother even saying that you will? James (Jesus' half-brother, with a book of his very own in the New Testament) says there's no point to our faith unless we do good deeds. He gives this example: 'Does merely talking about faith indicate that a person really has it? For instance, if a person comes upon an old friend dressed in rags and half-starved and says, Go, I wish you well; keep warm and well fed, but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it? In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.' (James 2:15-17 NIV) A read through the book of James (it's not long) will help you understand how we should live out our faith in our words and deeds! &lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['I chose you...to go and bear fruit - fruit that will last.' John 15:16 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus told His disciples that they were branches - remember the reading way back on November 18? Jesus was saying that we are the branches and He is the vine. If a branch isn't attached to anything it can't produce any fruit. (In fact, Jesus goes as far as to say, 'apart from Me you can do nothing' in verse 5). Wondering about what fruit your life will bear? It's only through your relationship with Jesus that you can find out who you really are, whether you're a Galatians 5:19-21 (rotten fruit) or Galatians 5:22-24 (super fruit) kind of guy or gal, and the extent of how you can use your God-given gifts. Your strength and success is in Jesus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's not the end of it, though. We all know that not all of the 'fruit' we produce would get God's tick of approval. Some branches need to be cut down - pruned. God even can take away things in your life which are an investment in your security or self-esteem. This can feel like God is hacking away at you rather than looking after you. But God is preparing and shaping you for greater things to come. Here's a thought, how does your relationship with God compare with the one Jesus talks about in John 15? (This chapter also tells you plain and simple 'Jesus loves you'.)&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['God ...will fulfil His purpose for (you).' Psalm 57:2 NLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;What might seem to be Plan B to us is no surprise to God. He's seen it all - people throughout all of history have been making a mess of Plan A and then wondering what on earth to do next with their life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'What if I mess it up?' we ask. 'What if I get in the way of what God wants to do in my life?' The Father of all creation is big enough to deal with your mess. He's creative enough to make a masterpiece out of the second-rate ingredients we offer Him. It's right there in the Bible: 'And we know that God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God and are called according to His purpose for them.' (Romans 8:28 NLT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn't say that He works all things for good when you're on your 'A' game or on your best day. No, the Bible says, '...He makes everything work out according to His plan.' (Ephesians 1:11 NLT) That means He's seen it all coming, and what might seem to be Plan B to us is, somehow...still...Plan A for God! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God will ultimately work all things for good - but what about the way we start? In Matthew 6:10 NKJ Jesus prayed, 'Your Kingdom come. Your will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven.' That's a great prayer to start your day. &lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Are you in health, my brother?' 2 Samuel 20:9 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would you ever accuse someone of something you would excuse in yourself? Never?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While confronting David over his sin with Bathsheba, Nathan the prophet told the king a story about two men. A rich man with many sheep and cattle and a poor man with only one lamb. When a guest came to the rich man's house for dinner, he took the poor man's lamb. 'David's anger was greatly aroused against the man, and he said, ...the man who has done this shall surely die! And he shall restore fourfold for the lamb...because he had no pity. Then Nathan said to David, You are the man!' (2 Samuel 12:5-7 NKJ)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, the story Nathan told had David's name written all over it. It broke though the pride that was blinding David to his sin. David finally repented and got right with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can very easily do the same. We can slam others for spreading gossip on Facebook but relish telling close friends juicy secrets we've heard. We're quick to condemn politicians and public figures for dishonest dealings even while our own affairs are not exactly whiter-than-white. Sometimes, like David, we don't even notice we're doing it. We need to keep watch over our hearts and make sure our hands are clean of hypocrisy. Scholars believe David wrote Psalm 51 ('Create in me a pure heart, O God...') at this time. His words are a powerful example for us of how &lt;em&gt;'a man after God's own heart'&lt;/em&gt; repents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA['Are you in health, my brother?' 2 Samuel 20:9 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, as the famous fable tells, there was a contest between Wind and Sun. They fought to see who could remove the coat of a man walking down a street. Wind had no doubt about its ability, so it simply blew great gusts of air down with all its strength. But it hadn't thought ahead - the man felt Wind billowing around him, and pulled his coat closer around himself. Sun looked down and took its turn. It shone lovely warm rays down onto the man, and shone and shone. Eventually, the man became too warm, and he gladly removed his coat to enjoy the sunshine! Where Wind had tried to use brute strength to force what it wanted, Sun worked persuasively, drawing the man towards what it wanted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is like that with us. He won't force His will on us, but will work with us. He loves us as we are right now - every part of us - but He wants to grow us, and develop us into healthy children of His. Ever wondered what people mean when they talk about being in a 'relationship with God'? Well, that's it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's your response to that sort of love? Don't just rely on word4U2day for your 'daily God intake'. Let God's Holy Spirit in on the action too. When we allow ourselves to be led by His Spirit, we enter a real conversation with God. 'Draw near to God and He will draw near to you.' (James 4:8 ESV) The more we give Him time and the more we draw near to hear His voice, the more we'll come to realise there's no friend closer. &lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Are you in health, my brother?' 2 Samuel 20:9 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's a healthy bite of truth to chew on: 'For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.' (Romans 8:38-39 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salvation doesn't stop at the cross. Jesus came back to life and will always intercede for us; will always, in effect, be 'saving' us. The love of God to man shown through Jesus is always trustworthy, total and never unsteady. These are amazing verses. It's so important to let the goodness of this good news cancel out any shame and guilt that may stop us from running back to our heavenly Dad to repent when we've messed up. The enemy will try and keep you away from God by telling you that you are no longer fit to be in His presence: 'You're not good enough. You're not worthy.' The truth is, we never were. It's only by Jesus' blood that we are made holy enough in the first place. We pray to God in Jesus' name and it's by His name that God answers. That's why we can come boldly. We need to keep coming back to this truth - it's where our faith starts and ends.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Are you in health, my brother?' 2 Samuel 20:9 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we sin, it doesn't 'just happen' - like we tripped over a rock in the road. Sin in our lives doesn't come out of nowhere. The Bible says, 'Temptation comes from the lure of our own evil desires. These evil desires give birth to evil actions, and evil actions lead to death.' (James 1:14-15 NLT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sin starts in the mind - when we allow our thoughts the freedom to roam as they please. What we feast on in our minds always affects the rest of us too. Being tempted is &lt;em&gt;not a sin in itself&lt;/em&gt;, but choosing to give over to it in fantasy or action is. The Bible says: 'Those who live according to the sinful nature have their minds set on what that nature desires; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires.' (Romans 8:5 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healthy bodies need healthy diets. So let your mind feast on the good stuff: 'Whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable - if anything is excellent or praiseworthy - think about such things.' (Philippians 4:8 NIV) God is able to show you the areas of your thought-life that need to change. Let Him show you the core of why you're being tempted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Are you in health, my brother?' 2 Samuel 20:9 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we saw the importance of keeping our thought-life in check because sin often enters our lives through temptation. But there's another area where our thoughts can cause us to sin: the failings of other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people upset us or let us down, it's easy to dwell on how much they've hurt us. But all that hanging on to past resentment does is churn away at your insides and infect future relationships. We end up passing on our hurt to other people, rather than forgiving and moving on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God said this, through Paul: 'Don't sin by letting anger control you. Don't let the sun go down while you are still angry, for anger gives a foothold to the devil... And do not bring sorrow to God's Holy Spirit by the way you live. Remember, He has identified you as His own, guaranteeing that you will be saved on the day of redemption. Get rid of all bitterness, rage, anger, harsh words, and slander, as well as all types of evil behaviour. Instead, be kind to each other, tender hearted, forgiving one another, just as God through Christ has forgiven you.' (Ephesians 4:26-32 NLT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forgiveness can seem impossible. 'Why am I the one who has to do all the work? They're the one in the wrong!' we say. But forgiveness comes from God, and we can't force ourselves to forgive. Rather than wait until you feel in a forgiving mood, turn to the source of grace and second chances - God. He alone will give you the ability to forgive. &lt;/p&gt;

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Are you in health, my brother?' 2 Samuel 20:9 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's quite a bit in the Bible comparing the Christian life to running a race and physical training. Maybe that doesn't motivate you - maybe the first things that come to mind are flashbacks of awkward PE lessons with ungainly arms, sore legs and the ultimate humiliation of finishing last!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, there's an important point here: 'Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the prize? Run in such a way as to get the prize. Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training. They do it to get a crown that will not last; but we do it to get a crown that will last forever. Therefore I do not run like a man running aimlessly; I do not fight like a man beating the air. No, I beat my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified for the prize.' (1 Corinthians 9:24-27 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PE lessons aside, the motivation should be clear - if you're serious about Jesus, you need to be serious about disciplining yourself to pray and read His Word. That's the way you'll get the life He promises. The Bible says, 'If you refuse to learn, you are hurting yourself. If you accept correction, you will become wiser.' (Proverbs 15:32 GNT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What discipline needs to be in place so you can run your race better? Deciding over and over to be a better person isn't hypocrisy. It's how we become mature. So, if you're struggling to spend time with God and pray every day, try getting up earlier, and make it a practice - like a muscle, it'll become easier the more you do it. &lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['I will...tell you...things you do not know.' Jeremiah 33:3 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we're honest, we'll admit that we mostly like to stick at doing the things we're already good at. We cling to what comes naturally to us because it's what's known; we're comfortable with it and can ace it every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here's a question: if that's how you're living, how much are you relying on God? By always sticking to what you know, are you actually downsizing your life from a royal palace to a tiny hut? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God had a mighty plan for Moses: he was to lead the children of Israel out of Egypt. Moses never questioned God's ability to do this, but he did question his part in it all. In response to this plan, Moses blustered about and told God that public speaking wasn't his forté. God's reply was simple, but incredible. He said, 'Now go; I will help you speak and will teach you what to say.' (Exodus 4:12 NIV) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, while Moses allowed himself to be 100% fully reliant on God, spectacular things happened. Give God the space in your life, and He will build something amazing. If you pray He will help you to keep your expectations high - and show you the areas He wants you to take risks for Him. &lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Remember...those who are mistreated.' Hebrews 13:3 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes our prayer requests can start to resemble the gift lists for Santa Claus we wrote when we were kids - all about me, me, me. Just as we never put requests for others on our annual letter to the North Pole, we can omit to include them in our daily prayers to our Father in Heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may need to wake up. There are members of our church family around the world who are being severely persecuted for believing in Jesus, and we must remember them in our prayers, just like we remember to include our family, friends and people who don't yet know Jesus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In countries like North Korea, Iran, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia, Christians are denied the right to practice their faith; secret police monitor worship gatherings and Christians are personally threatened with punishment, imprisonment and even death. Yet amazingly, the underground church continues to grow - fast. Paul, writing from prison himself, put it like this: 'Remember those who are in prison, as though you were in prison with them; those who are being tortured, as though you yourselves were being tortured.' (Hebrews 13:3 NRS) Why not pray right now for all those suffering for the name of Jesus? Pray for their physical protection, endurance, and for God to speak through them. &lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['I can die content...I have seen the Saviour.' Luke 2:29-30 TLB&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a very different day. Simeon had been waiting for it a long, long time. He'd been at the Temple for years - watching, hoping. Perhaps he thought that he'd been mistaken. That he'd heard wrong. The heavenly promise he'd received was late, so late he was wondering if it was ever going to come. Probably not in his lifetime anyway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people would have dismissed him as nice but a little bit quirky. Honestly, who could believe that one day an old bloke like Simeon would come face to face with God? That sort of thing didn't happen these days. Who did Simeon think he was - Abraham, the only man ever called 'Friend of God'? Or Moses, the man whose face glowed when he spent time in God's presence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet Simeon's devotion paid off. All those early mornings, late nights and long days he'd spent in the temple looking for the face of God were worth it the moment he spotted a teenage girl holding her newborn baby. The Holy Spirit whispered to him that here was the answer to the promise. At long last, Simeon could go to his grave knowing he'd once nursed the Messiah in his arms. God's salvation was on its way -  and it was so close, he could cradle the Saviour to his chest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christmas Day is about God making His Son known to the likes of Simeon, and to the likes of you and me. Salvation is here. And you can touch it. You can hold it. You can be face to face with God - if you want it. &lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Well done, good and faithful servant...' Matthew 25:23 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A young man vowed not to get married until he found the perfect lady. Finally, he found her. But then he discovered she'd vowed not to get married until she found the perfect young man. Last we heard, neither of them is married! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you bury what God's given you, don't expect a 'well done' when you meet your Maker. Waiting until everything is arranged perfectly can rob us of stepping out and trying stuff. Maybe you know the parable of the talents; if not, you can read it in Matthew 25. The first two servants who invested what they'd been given got a 'well done' from the Master. But the last servant, who buried his talent... he got totally slammed. 'Sir, I know you are a hard man... I was afraid I would lose your money, so I hid it in the earth and here it is.' (Matthew 25:24 NLT) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guy didn't have a balanced or true view of his master - he made him out to be a hard and harsh. The task seemed too hard, so he didn't bother. God is perfect and entirely holy, but He also understands you're not. God will meet you where you're at, and work with you from there. Don't let the fear of failure rob you of your future and what might be. If you're weighed down with fear or paralysed by a quest for perfection, ask a friend to pray with you: for freedom from those burdens.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['...You desire truth in the inward parts...' Psalm 51:6 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Psychology Today, more people say they have cheated on their marriage partners than on their income tax returns or expense accounts. Nearly half say that if they scratched another car in a car park they would drive off without leaving a note, even though 89 percent agree it would be wrong! Maybe our question shouldn't be, 'Why does God demand that we always tell the truth?' but, 'Why do we tolerate all these lies?' Jeremiah weighs in: 'The heart is deceitful above all things...' (Jeremiah 17:9 NIV) Much of the time, the bare truth makes us squirm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the age of three, when Mum asked, 'Did you hit your little brother?' we knew that honesty had its consequences. So we learned to think, 'Um, well, it's not really lying if I say...' We learned to cover things up. 'Did I hit my baby brother? That all depends on how you interpret the word hit. I mean, sure, I made contact with him, but would a jury consider it a hit? Everything is relative, you know.' We say, 'Did I hit my baby brother? Yes, Mum, I did. But it's not my fault. Had I been born with nonaggressive chromosomes and had you not permitted me to watch television, it would never have happened. So I can say I hit my brother, but the fault isn't mine. I'm just a victim of nurture and nature!' Yeah. Right! The Psalmist said, 'You desire truth in the inward parts, and in the hidden part You will make me to know wisdom.' That's the truth about the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Half-truths' will drive a wedge between you and your family or friends. Maybe today's the time to fess up and sort it out.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['You desire truth in the inward parts...' Psalm 51:6 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's all very well saying we should tell the truth all the time. But sometimes the truth isn't quite as impressive, or as shocking, as we'd like it to be. So we touch it up a little - just a little exaggeration here and there - to make the story a bit better. No one gets hurt, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so. In the book of Acts, Ananias and Sapphira sold a piece of property and gave a portion of the money to the church. But they lied, claiming the land sold for the same amount of money as they gave (see chapter 5). That little white lie resulted in their deaths. 'Whew!' you say, 'I'm glad God doesn't strike people dead today for lying!' Well, maybe. Little white lies can bring slow death:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) In your friendships. Lies undermine trust between friends. Over time, the damage might go beyond repair. (2) In your conscience. Because a second lie is always easier to tell than the first. (3) In your usefulness to God. God says if you are honest in small things He will trust you with greater things (Matthew 25:21). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've dug yourself into the 'little white lie' sort of hole, there is a way out. Repent before God then go and make it right.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Follow Me, and I will make you...fishers of men.' Mark 1:17 NAS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simon and his brother Andrew were happily getting on with the day-to-day fishing business. But Jesus had a different plan for their day: 'As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net...for they were fishermen. Come, follow Me, Jesus said, and I will make you fishers of men. At once they left their nets and followed Him.' (Mark 1:16-18 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon and Andrew left what they knew and what was comfortable to follow Jesus for a whole new life. Notice how these guys left their nets at once. There was no deliberation or conferring between them, no phone-a-friend or ask-the-audience. They just up and left their nets. They walked away from their trade, their security and their way of life. There was something about Jesus that they couldn't resist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus' mission was (and is) to restore an entire creation gone out of control by sin. It takes courage to join Him in a mission of such Biblical proportions; to care for the needy, to resist sin, to 'fish' for people to join in God's new life. Can you take a leaf out of Andrew and Simon's book and leave your (safety) nets behind? If you can, the mission comes with a warning: it will take you far out of what is comfortable to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wherever God is calling you to - caring for the downtrodden and poor, evangelism, or a time to get closer to Him - have the courage to follow Him. He'll take you by the hand and lead you there.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Rise up; this matter is in your hands...take courage and do it.' Ezra 10:4 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ezra was a priest who took courage and took charge by leading the people of Judea and Jerusalem out of their sin before God. They'd broken God's commandments and as a people were full of guilt and shame. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ezra didn't have a clue what to do at first, so he got vulnerable with God: 'While Ezra prayed...weeping and throwing himself to the ground in front of the Temple of God, a large crowd of people...gathered and wept bitterly with him.' (Ezra 10:1 NLT) We can take a lot from this reaction! Faced with a whirlpool of disobedience that he couldn't see a way out of, Ezra flung himself on the mercy of God in front of His people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes when we make mistakes, our first reaction is that we don't want to go anywhere near God or church. We don't want to go before a holy God, in His holy house while we're dressed in dirty clothes and reeking of sin. Ezra got it right by flinging himself before the King of Kings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He didn't stop there, though. Ezra then got up and took action against sin by instructing the people how to start living right. Have the courage to fling yourself on the mercy of God, then get on the offensive against sin by living out God's best for you. &lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['There is a greater power with us than with him.' 2 Chronicles 32:7 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the pathway to success were well lit it would already be crowded. All progress begins with one question: 'What needs to be done?' And somebody needs to be asking that question - why not you? The future belongs to those who have the courage to ask that question and the faith to hang in until they discover the answer. When the obstacles look too big and opposition seems too strong, stand on this Scripture: 'Do not be afraid or discouraged...for there is a greater power with us than with him.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are you seeing that needs to be done? Maybe your group of friends is stuck in a rut of bickering, simmering resentment or unforgiveness. It takes initiative to step in and get things sorted in a Christ-like way. Perhaps you see a gap in your school or workplace - an opportunity for evangelism, outreach, or peace-bringing. That empty space can be filled with your creative, God-honouring solution. It might not be comfortable. It might mean being unsettled. But take courage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And take the opportunity to be creative. If there's a lack of something in your life, it may be that God has something more profound for you than the 'normal' solution could provide. Remember - there is a greater power with us than in the world! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If God reveals a need to you it usually means He's asking you to do something about it. So start with prayer and go from there! &lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'...Forgive whatever grievance you may have against one another...' Colossians 3:13 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Year, new start, right? Well, as the clock ticks over to midnight, why not leave all your 2012 hurts and grudges behind? Make 2013 a blank screen ready to write new history on, or an empty canvas to paint your masterpiece on. Do you get where we're going with this? New Year, new start!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the festive season brought its fair share of family fighting and best-mate breakdowns... well, today's verse is telling us to loosen that grip on that grudge. Jesus-style forgiveness is on the menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forgiveness doesn't come easy to us grudge-bearers. Philip Yancey says it's unnatural: 'You don't find dolphins forgiving sharks for eating their playmates. It's a dog-eat-dog world ... not a dog-forgive-dog world.' He's right - throwing sharp objects and posting threats on Facebook is what we naturally want to do. But why not do the 'supernatural' thing? Learn a lesson from Jesus, who forgave his killers while they were murdering him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lew Smedes famously said, 'To forgive is to set a prisoner free and discover that the prisoner was you.' Who is really benefiting from you holding on to that gripe? Your insides are all tied up in knots, your brain is running that argument on constant replay, and your tear ducts are ready for an extra shift at the meltdown factory. You're prisoner to your own grudge. But you hold the key to freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoulFood: Rom 13:12-14:19, Jn 1:1-14 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word4U2day &lt;i&gt;(an adaptation of The Word for Today authored by Bob &amp;amp; Debby Gass)&lt;/i&gt; is published under licence by UCB Australia.

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'... He will receive his reward.' 1 Corinthians 3:14 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we can wonder if God notices or cares what we're doing for Him. There you are faithfully busting a gut to make youth group happen. Sweating prayers for your unconverted mates. Out of breath from constantly advancing God's Kingdom. And what is God doing? Seems He's got His divine eye on the some other person who's doing next to nothing for Him. The one who's blessed before she's even crawled out of bed. Everything's hunky-dory for her. And here you are without so much as an answered prayer to go on with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does it feel like you're merely an acquaintance He puts up with? Someone He humours when He can be bothered? Sometimes we carry this attitude around with us. Luke 14:13-14 NIV hints at why we don't always feel a pat on the back: 'When you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, and you will be blessed. Although they cannot repay you, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.' God always cares when we actively do the right thing. It's just that sometimes the reward will be seen the other side of eternity. Take heart, no good deed gets overlooked by Him. So if you've been feeling overlooked, praise Him that it is just a feeling, and isn't truth. Then praise God that He loves your brother or sister who seems to get all the glory as much as He loves you.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'... He will receive his reward.' 1 Corinthians 3:14 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know the kind of parent who buys off their children with presents? The sort who're too busy to spend time with the kids, so they lob phones and iPods at them to ease their own guilt. While it's nice to receive the gifts, it doesn't say much for the relationship. It's the same with God. We can throw all our time and efforts into doing stuff for God, but if we're not stopping for quality time together our relationship is dying. The church at Ephesus got told off for this: 'I know your works, your labour, your patience... Nevertheless I have this against you, that you have left your first love.' (Revelation 2:2-4 NKJ) God loves your all-out efforts for Him, but He does miss the sound of your voice. Don't be too busy to pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus told us to love our enemies, do good and hope for nothing in return (Luke 6:35 NKJ) Don't do things for God in the hope of reward. He knows your motives and whether they are right or not, and He will repay you accordingly. Aim to please Him, not people. Doing something to please God is an act of worship. So, make sure your motives are clear. What's more important, being a God pleaser or being a people pleaser?&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'No one can say that Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit.' 1 Corinthians 12:3 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let 'Worry' lord it over you and you'll get, free of charge: (1) Someone to talk things over with at 3 a.m. You'll never come to any solutions or anything useful because Worry just likes to stay up and chat. (2) A personal fitness coach. Worry loves to work that body. He'll try a few moves to increase your heart rate. He'll do some push-ups with your adrenalin. He'll leave you worn out soon enough (but not too tired for those late night chats.) (3) He'll let you see the world through new eyes. The smallest molehill can become Everest through the specs of Worry. And Everest never looked bigger than at 3 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OR... You can choose to let Jesus be Lord and receive this: (1) Sleep. Talk it over with Him in the evening and the night is yours. (2) Respite. When life is working you too hard, 'Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.' (Philippians 4:6-7 NIV) (3) Clarity. Your Everest is Christ's sandcastle: easily kicked in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So who's going to lord it over you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Worry comes knocking on your door try this: write down what's worrying you. Pray about it. Then scribble at the top of your list, '...the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard my heart and mind in Christ Jesus.'&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord...' 2 Peter 3:18 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How often do you dodge prayer and reason that you can catch up with God sometime tomorrow? You know you'll have more time then. God wouldn't want you to miss your favourite TV show, would He? Or delay updating your Facebook status? Surely He knows it's unrealistic to expect that your only desire is to spend every waking second with your Lord and Saviour in intercessory prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can make excuses, but spiritual growth doesn't happen by osmosis. It doesn't just seep into us because we're Christians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't fall in love with somebody by ignoring them. Perhaps you've never felt especially close to God because you've never spent time alone with Him. Why not start right now? The Psalmist wrote, 'My heart has heard You say, Come and talk with Me. And my heart responds, Lord, I am coming.' (Psalm 27:8 NLT) Start out by disciplining yourself to spend a little time with God each day and soon you'll find your whole being is craving more and more of Him. Steve Holmes writes that, 'Prayer is a gift God gives, not a duty God commands.' Time spent in prayer with God should reflect that fact. Prayer is a relationship, disciplined prayer is the act of putting appointments in your diary to make time for that relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'In due season He will honour you with every blessing.' Psalm 37:34 TLB&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You remember it vividly. One minute someone was praying for you, the next it was as if God Himself was next to you, topping your heart to the brim with dreams and ambitions. Everything in that moment made sense. The struggle to find out why you were put on this earth was over. It was all clear. God had a purpose for your life, tailor-made for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then nothing. The feeling faded and everyday life kicked in. And here you are now wondering did God let you down or have you slipped up? What went wrong? Has God lost the blueprints? Why isn't He playing ball?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truth is, God can't lie. And what has been promised will come to pass. It's just often there is a wait. And how you choose to wait is going to determine your happiness levels in the meantime. Waiting with frustration is not good for you. Frustration will lead to misery and mistakes and doubt. Waiting with anticipation is far healthier. Waiting on God will draw you closer to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Don't be impatient for the Lord to act! Keep travelling steadily along His pathway and in due season He will honour you with every blessing...' Psalm 37:24 TLB&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'Do not throw away your confidence; it will be...rewarded.' Hebrews 10:35 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expectant mothers want to keep their soon-to-arrive little bundle of joy wrapped up tight until it's time for a full-term delivery. The more premature the arrival, the more complications are possible. Waiting full term is the ideal for a pregnant mother - could it be the same with God's promises for you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If God gave you everything He'd promised you now, would you be ready? Chances are there'd be premature complications. It could cause you more heartbreak than waiting for it to go full term. Paul paints the same picture: '...we eagerly look forward to this freedom. For if you already have something, you don't need to hope for it.' (Romans 8:24-25 NLT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waiting is part of life. Again, the Bible puts it best: 'Be patient, then...until the Lord's coming. See how the farmer waits for the land to yield its valuable crop and how patient he is for the autumn and spring rains. You too, be patient and stand firm, because the Lord's coming is near.' (James 5:7-8 NIV) Think back to some of the personal promises that God has given to you: Bible verses, pictures, words of encouragement... Remember them, and take time throughout your day to give Him thanks that His timing is right. As the old song says: 'Count your many blessings, count them one by one. And it will surprise you what the Lord has done.'&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'I delight to do Your will, O my God.' Psalm 40:8 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine if the French had settled for an 'Eiffel Chimney'. Or Michelangelo had just painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel a nice blue. Or Alexander Graham Bell had decided to just write a letter. The world would be a lot less colourful, wouldn't it? These entrepreneurs didn't throw in the towel the moment the headaches started. They saw the potential, pictured the dream and persevered with the vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To keep your dream alive, you need to keep on dreaming. Don't let the waiting fester into frustration. Don't sell the dream short. Don't settle for a bargain bin sort of hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George Lucas had a vision to set new benchmarks for sci-fi movies. If the technology wasn't there, he'd invent it. When the impossible started knocking on the door, he and his colleagues would return to the vision: 'We were always dreaming of how it was going to be,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If he can keep believing in the name of Star Wars, surely you can keep believing in the name of Jesus. The Bible's number one dream-boy, Joseph, didn't let knockbacks steal his destiny. Disowned, trafficked, betrayed and left to rot in a dungeon... he still believed in his initial dream. Read Joseph's waiting game in Genesis 37-45. Take note of the obstacles Joseph overcomes in order to see his dreams turn to reality. Guess what? You might have to do some overcoming too before your dreams turn into reality.&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;'... endure hardship, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.' 2 Timothy 2:3 NKJ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the moment you gave it up for Jesus you've been in a battle between your old nature and your new one. And it begins the moment you open your eyes each morning. So, will you hold up or fold today? If you know the enemy's strategy you can have a plan to deal with it. The attack is twofold and today we'll concentrate on the attack from &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt;. '... If you want to be a friend of the world, you make yourself an enemy of God.' (James 4:4 NLT) That doesn't mean ditching all your unchurched friends, avoiding their activities and becoming holier-than-thou. It does mean being strong so that instead of you being negatively affected, you're a positive influence, like light in darkness. Susanna Wesley (mum of the two boys who founded the Methodist church) said these wise things: (1) 'Whatever dulls the sensitivities of my spirit toward God, or takes the fine edge off my thought of Him, must be ruled out for He is my Lord. (2) Whatever injures and weakens my body, or affects the mastery of it, must be ruled out for it is the temple of the Lord. (3) Whatever adversely affects the clearness of my witness to Jesus Christ before others must be ruled out for it was His parting wish that I should be a witness of Him. (4) Whatever may cause my brother to stumble in his Christian life must be ruled out for that would grieve Jesus.'&lt;/p&gt;

<introtext><![CDATA['Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus.' Philippians 2:5 NIV&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever find yourself acting as if you're the centre of the universe? It's scary how easily we can live as if 'it's all about me'. Even when we're serving God, our hearts can be pumping with the motivation of wanting to be noticed and admired.
&lt;p&gt;It's the heart behind what we do that's important to God. Paul says this: 'Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus, who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, but made Himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant.' (Philippians 2:5-7 NIV) In other words, serving God is about serving others rather than yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you feel treated like a servant, bossed around and belittled? Jesus said: 'But I say, don't resist an evil person! If you are slapped on the right cheek, turn the other, too...' (Matthew 5:39 NLT) If you ask the Holy Spirit will reveal times when you have acted or thought like you were better than others. If there's a recurring issue in your life that is preventing you from putting others first, don't worry, that revelation is the first step to victory. The next is to pray.&lt;/p&gt;
