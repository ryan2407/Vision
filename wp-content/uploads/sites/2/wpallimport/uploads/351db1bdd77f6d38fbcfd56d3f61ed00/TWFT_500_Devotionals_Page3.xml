<introtext><![CDATA['[He] redeems your life from destruction...' Psalm 103:4 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Dr. Ann Shorb writes: 'The key to being able to rejoice in the past is not found in counting the number of good things that have happened, but in remembering that God remembers! ...He never forgets His plan and He never forsakes His promises. Even when life is tough and things don't make sense, He's in control and He's working out His plan.' The Bible says, 'The Word of the Lord came to [Jeremiah]: What do you see?...I see the branch of an almond tree, I replied. The Lord said...You have seen correctly, for I am watching to see that my Word is fulfilled.' (Jeremiah 1:11-12 NIV) Almonds blossoming; it's springtime! The change of seasons is a reminder of God's faithfulness. It gives you hope that the winter season you are in right now will soon give way to springtime and new life. How can you be sure? Because the Bible says that God keeps '...His agreement forever...' (Psalm 105:8 NCV) In life, every investment comes with the possibility of loss. But there's a big difference between losing and being out. The truth is, God has too much invested in you to let His plans for your life be destroyed. The damage others can do to you is limited by the shield of God's divine purpose. Even when you are not aware of it, '[He] redeems your life from destruction...' Stop and think back on some of the doors He closed that didn't make sense to you at the time. Now you realise that without His guidance and protection, the enemy waiting behind some of those doors would surely have destroyed you, right?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I have found my sheep which was lost.' Luke 15:6 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Luke chapter 15 is sometimes referred to as 'the lost and found column' of the Bible. In it you find the parable of the lost sheep, the lost silver coin, and the lost son. Today let's look at the lost sheep. Like all of us, it had no intention of losing its way. Indeed, it probably thought it wasn't lost at all. This parable shows us two wonderful things about Jesus, our Shepherd: (1) The value God places on you! Some of us would say, 'It's only one out of a hundred sheep, no big deal, nobody will miss it.' Wrong, the Good Shepherd will! Understand this: If you had been the only person who ever lived, Jesus would have gone to the cross and died just for you. Next time you feel worthless and unloved, think about that! (2) The lengths to which God will go to save you! save Cornelius, a Gentile, God demolished social and religious barriers and sent Peter, a Jew, down to Caesarea to preach the Gospel to him. Heaven cannot shut its ears to the cry of one lost soul! When Cornelius prayed, God replied, 'Your prayers...have come up for a memorial before [Me].' (Acts 10:4 NKJV) And here's a gem: 'When [the shepherd] has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing.' (Luke 15:5 NKJV) Jesus will not only save you, He will 'carry' you when you feel you can't go on. His promise is, '...I will never leave you nor forsake you.' (Hebrews 13:5 NKJV) One Sunday when Charles Spurgeon preached, a man jumped up and shouted, 'I'm lost!' Spurgeon replied, 'Thank God, you've just been found!'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...[My] son...was lost, and is found...' Luke 15:24 NIV<br /><br /><p>After telling the story of the lost sheep and the lost silver coin, Jesus ends up by telling us the story of the lost son. The interesting thing about him is that he knew he was lost, and knew his way home. The shepherd sought the lost sheep, the lady with the lamp sought the lost silver, but nobody went looking for the lost son. Only when he had squandered his inheritance and ended up in a pigpen do we read: 'When he came to his senses, he said... I will...go back to my father and say to him: 'Father, I have sinned'...But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him...the father said to his servants, Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let's have a feast and celebrate. For this son of mine was...lost and is found...' (Luke 15:17-24 NIV) Backslider, though you have walked away from God, He is waiting to welcome you home. Your place at the table is reserved. He has a ring of sonship that identifies you as His own, and a robe of righteousness to cover your shame. The Prodigal Son's joy didn't return until he came back to his father's house. So, you have a decision to make. Though you're disappointed in yourself and ashamed before the God you've failed, you can come back home. And you can come today.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Some parents brought their children to Jesus...' Mark 10:13 NLT<br /><br /><p>The Bible says, 'He took the children into His arms and placed His hands on their heads and blessed them.' (Mark 10:16 NLT) Interestingly, Jesus had just taught on the subject of divorce. Does the Bible record it this way because broken homes produce broken children? Too often children get caught in the crossfire of angry parents. Sometimes we actually use them as weapons to hurt one another. It reminds us of the newscasts on the Gulf War, listing young men and women who are accidentally killed by their own military. We call it 'friendly fire'. What's 'friendly' about bleeding to death in the hot sand of a strange country? What's the point here? It's this: divorce should be our last resort, not our first option. We grow in grace by giving and forgiving, by dying to self-interest and putting our spouse first. The Bible says this kind of love '...never fails...' (1 Corinthians 13:8 NKJV) Jesus, who was dealing with grown-up problems, interrupts His busy schedule to bless children. He doesn't counsel them, He just touches them because there's power in a touch. Let's salute all the wonderful people who work with children, for it's a high calling. And let's not forget to touch little lives with a word of hope and a smile of encouragement. Indeed, it may be the only one some of them will get. Don't hurt them, for they are the future. You are building a house that one day you will have to live in. What's wrong with these disciples? Who told them they were too busy to love, bless and care for children? Is God speaking to you through today's devotion?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...You are precious to Me...' Isaiah 43:4 NLT<br /><br /><p>If you are struggling with feelings of unworthiness, working harder and vowing to do better won't necessarily change how you feel. Like remodelling an old house with a cracked foundation, you can redecorate every room but the floors and ceilings will just keep sagging until eventually it collapses. You've got to address the foundation! To do that, you must begin seeing yourself as God sees you; only then will you experience the stability and security you seek. Have you any idea how God feels about you? He sees you as: (1) <i>Loveable</i>. '...You are precious to Me. You are honoured, and I love you. Do not be afraid, for I am with you...' (Isaiah 43:4-5 NLT) What assurance! The Bible says, '...The one the Lord loves rests between His shoulders.' (Deuteronomy 33:12 NIV) What a secure position to be in! (2) <i>Valuable</i>. If you grew up feeling unwanted, you got the wrong message. God established your worth at the cross. '...The Son of God, who loved [you], and gave Himself for [you].' (Galatians 2:20 NIV) The slogan on Hallmark cards says, '<i>When you care enough to send the very best</i>.' That's what God did for you at the cross. (3) <i>Capable</i>. Without a supportive environment to grow up in, you can end up with a diminished sense of ability. It's why we compensate by overachieving. But God knows that you are capable because He's '...given...you...special abilities...' (1 Peter 4:10 TLB) Furthermore, He has '...seated us with Him in His heavenly Kingdom...' (Ephesians 2:6 NIV) So stay in your seat and don't let anybody tell you that your life doesn't matter. It does, because God says so!</p>

<alias><![CDATA[whats-your-greatest-weakness]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...My grace is all you need. My power works best in weakness...' 2 Corinthians 12:9 NLT<br /><br /><p>Self-help experts assure us that we can overcome any weakness, so it must be true, right? Look around you! The evidence doesn't show it. What we have seen, however, are people who, with God's help, have changed their lives by building on time-tested Scriptural principles. Trying to 'cure' your weaknesses just wastes valuable time and energy that could be redirected toward healthier pursuits. For example, when an addict stays clean, does that mean they are no longer vulnerable in that area? No, it just means they have filled the vacuum with something better. Paul writes: 'The temptations in your life are no different from what others experience. And God is faithful. He will not allow the temptation to be more than you can stand. When you are tempted, He will show you a way out so that you can endure.' (1 Corinthians 10:13 NLT) But what about all those socially acceptable weaknesses that masquerade as strengths, like perfectionism, materialism, judgmentalism and status-seeking? Many who would be ashamed to admit they are an alcoholic are proud to be a workaholic. Driven by fear and obsessed with time, they are totally focused on <i>doing</i> instead of . That is, until their obsession with not having enough, and being enough, lands them in cardiac rehab, bargaining with God for another chance. Constantly dwelling on a weakness just reinforces it, whereas applying the Scriptural solution brings results. And the good news is, you don't have to do it alone. God is available to help you. He told Paul, '...My grace is all you need. My power works best in weakness...'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be strong and of good courage...' Deuteronomy 31:6 NKJV<br /><br /><p>On the morning of September 11, 2001, United Flight 93 from Newark to San Francisco was hijacked by terrorists who claimed to have a bomb. When they received telephone confirmation that other planes with terrorists on board had hit the twin towers of the World Trade Centre, the passengers understood the hijackers' intent. Todd Beamer, a 32 year old businessman, picked up a seat-back phone and reached Lisa Jefferson, a Verizon Airfone supervisor. He told her that he and others were going to 'jump on' a hijacker who was guarding the passengers in the rear. Beamer asked her to pray the <i>Lord's Prayer</i> with him. He also made her promise to call his wife, Lisa, and tell her that he loved her and their two little boys. Dropping the phone after talking with Jefferson, Beamer said, 'Jesus, help me.' Then, after reciting Psalm 23, he said, 'Are you guys ready? Okay, let's roll.' Those were the unforgettable last words Beamer said before he and others rushed the hijackers. There were screams, then silence. That day brave civilians, complete strangers, rose up against impossible odds and tried to save the aircraft. In doing so, they made the ultimate sacrifice. United Flight 93 crashed into a large field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, killing all 44 on board. Of the four hijacked planes that morning, theirs was the only one that failed to hit its target. Those heroes showed courage - at the highest level. Whatever you are facing today, be courageous, 'for the Lord your God, He is the One who goes with you. He will not leave you nor forsake you'.</p>

Mark 10:15 NIV<br /><br /><p>Jesus said, 'Anyone who will not receive the Kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.' You need to become a little child again, to allow yourself the kind of relationship with the Lord that you may have missed; to allow Him to heal and adjust the damaged places of your past. God provides arms that allow adults to climb up like little children and be nurtured through the pain of earlier days. The new birth gives you a chance to start over. God will not abuse you when you come to Him. Through praise, you approach Him like a toddler on unskilled legs. In worship, you kiss His face and are held securely in His embrace. He has no ulterior motive, for His embrace is safe. That's why it's important that you learn how to worship and adore Him. Even if you were exposed to grown-up situations when you were a child, God can reverse what you've been through. Here's what He told His people: 'I passed by and saw you kicking about...and as you lay there...I said to you, Live! I made you grow like a plant of the field. You grew up and developed and became...beautiful... I...covered your nakedness. I...entered into a covenant with you...and you became Mine. I bathed you with water and washed the blood from you and put ointments on you. I clothed you with an embroidered dress and put leather sandals on you. I dressed you in fine linen and covered you with costly garments.' (Ezekiel 16:6-10 NIV) And God can do that for you too.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...You received the Spirit of adoption...' Romans 8:15 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says, '...[We] received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, 'Abba, Father'. The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs - heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ...' (Romans 8:15-17 NKJV) Adoptive parents understand what it's like to have an emptiness in their hearts, to search, to set out on a mission, to take responsibility for a child with a troubled past and an uncertain future. And that's what God did for you. Knowing full well the trouble you'd be, and what it would cost, He sought you, found you, paid the price for you, took you home, gave you His name and the right to call Him 'Abba', which means 'Daddy', a term of endearment. Adoption isn't something you earn, it's a gift you receive. You'd never hear adoptive parents say, 'We'd like to adopt little Mary but first we want to know - does she have a house, money for education, a ride to school in the morning and clothes to wear every day?' The adoption agency would say, 'Hold on, you're not adopting her because of what she has, but because of what she needs. She needs love, hope, a home and a future.' You don't earn the Spirit of adoption, you  it by faith. That's important, because if you can't gain it by your stellar efforts, you can't lose it through your poor performance. How reassuring! And it gets better; you're an 'heir' to all your Father owns. That means you'll never have a need He cannot or will not meet. How good is that?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Whoever wants to be My disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross daily...' Luke 9:23 NIV<br /><br /><p>The story is told of a lieutenant addressing his platoon: 'I'm looking for volunteers. Chances are, this mission won't succeed and many of you won't come back. If you're interested, step forward.' Everybody looks around, then takes a collective step backwards, leaving an unsuspecting 'volunteer' standing alone. God is not looking for 'involuntary volunteers'. Jesus said, 'If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily.' He wants people who are willing to leave their comfort zone; to give up their expectations that life be lived on their terms; to sacrifice everything for people who may never know they did it; to pay the price so that God's purposes can be fulfilled. And what's more, He expects us to do it 'daily'. When Jesus said, 'Whoever does not carry his own cross...cannot be My disciple' (Luke 14:27 NAS), He wasn't asking us to do something He Himself hasn't done. Oswald Chambers said, 'If we are devoted to the cause of humanity we shall soon be crushed and broken-hearted, for we shall often meet with ingratitude...But if our motive is love for God, no ingratitude will hinder us from serving our fellow man.' John says, 'We understand what love is when we realise...Christ gave His life for us. That means we must give our lives for other believers.' (1 John 3:16 GWT) So, are you willing to 'die daily'? (1 Corinthians 15:31) When you think about it, that's harder than physical death because it means denying yourself and obeying God even when it goes against the grain. But that's what you're called to do!</p>

<alias><![CDATA[operating-by-the-peace-rule]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts...' Colossians 3:15 NIV<br /><br /><p>If you don't have peace about it, don't proceed! Often peace is all God will give you to let you know whether you're in or out of His will. So how can you operate by the peace rule? 'Don't worry about anything; instead, pray about everything; tell God your needs and don't forget to thank Him for His answers. If you do this you will experience God's peace, which is far more wonderful than the human mind can understand...His peace will keep your thoughts and your hearts quiet and at rest...' (Philippians 4:6-7 TLB) Pay close attention to the words, 'Don't worry...instead, pray.' Prayer transfers the problem from you to Jesus. 'Let Him have all your worries and cares, for He is always thinking about you and watching everything that concerns you. Be careful - watch out for attacks from Satan...Stand firm when he attacks...' (1 Peter 5:7-9 TLB) Don't give the devil a few days to work you over. The longer you wait to resist him, the stronger his hold over you becomes. The moment you find yourself worrying, stop and ask, 'What's the enemy trying to do here? If I give in to these thoughts and emotions, what will the result be?' 'Do not give the devil a foothold.' (Ephesians 4:27 NIV) Know your enemy, and each time he attacks put him to flight by saying what Jesus said to him in the wilderness: '...It is written...' (Matthew 4:4 NIV) When Jesus said for the third time, 'It is written,' we read, 'The devil left Him, and angels came and attended Him.' (Matthew 4:11 NIV) So here's the question: How well do you know God's Word?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['God is...a very present help in trouble.' Psalm 46:1 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Let's observe two final things: () Between the dread and the devastation, look for the Deliverer. Picture a boat lashed by huge waves, and frightened disciples who thought they were going under. They forgot the promise: 'God is...a very present help in trouble. Therefore we will not fear...' (Psalm 46:1-2 NKJV) They didn't look for Jesus to rescue them. Yet as the night advanced and things looked hopeless, '...Jesus went to them, walking on the sea.' (Matthew 14:25 NKJV) Did they rejoice? No, their fear intensified and they said, '...It's a ghost!...' (Matthew 14:26 NKJV) Look out! Your fear can distort your perceptions and make you see the answer as just another problem. Often what appears a threat is actually a blessing about to manifest itself. For example, you lose your job and God opens up a better one, but your fear and inadequacy make you avoid the interview. Look to Jesus in your time of fear; when He takes away the lesser, it's always to give you the greater. (2) God's best always requires facing what you fear.Jesus called Peter to come to Him. Deciding it was safer in the storm with Jesus than in the boat without Him, Peter walked toward Him. But there's always a moment after you step out in faith when you hear, 'What if I'm not up to this?' Peter heard it, and the waves began to engulf him. Panicked, he called and Jesus immediately rescued him. Peter wasn't drowning; he was learning and growing! When you walk by faith, even your failures will lead to success. So step out with Jesus; He won't let you drown.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go...' Matthew 14:22 NIV<br /><br /><p>When you find yourself in trouble, do you sometimes think, 'I must have done something wrong, perhaps I've missed God's will and He's punishing me'? No. Trouble is multi-sourced, and frequently unrelated to our wrongdoing or God's punishment. The disciples weren't in the storm by disobeying, but by obeying Jesus; not by rejecting God's will, but by embracing it. The Bible says, '...Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go...', and they obeyed. At times you'll find yourself in troubled waters because you did what was right rather than what was popular, easy or selfish. When that happens, here are some helpful lessons from the disciples' experience: (1) Obedience doesn't guarantee there will be no storms.The disciples had just seen Jesus feed 5000 people with five bread rolls and two fish, and end up with more food than He started with. Shouldn't their faith have been strengthened? Yet they forgot it completely when fear came knocking. Jesus had told them He'd meet them on the other shore, yet they forgot His miracle-working power and His promise and gave in to anxiety. Understand this: When God doesn't solve your problem, He will show up in the middle of it and cause you to come out with your faith fortified. (2) Fear doesn't mean you're a failure.It's just a reminder that you're human, and, like the disciples, you've forgotten Who has the power and Who's in charge. And these are lessons that transform your trial into triumph.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The boat was...buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it.' Matthew 14:24 NIV<br /><br /><p>Notice: () Trouble doesn't mean that God has abandoned you. The disciples learned that Jesus may be out of sight, but He's never out of touch. To '...walk by faith, not by sight' (2 Corinthians 5:7 NKJV) means sometimes you'll walk in darkness without visible cues. Someone put it this way: 'When you can't trace His hand, you can trust His heart.' When the disciples were being tossed like a cork on the waves, Jesus was up on a mountain praying for them! He was aware of the problem and He was working on the solution. He was their mediator and their 'need meet-er', just as He has one hand on your need and the other on your answer. '...He always lives to intercede for [you].' (Hebrews 7:25 NIV) Can you imagine Jesus praying to the Father for His fear-filled disciples? And can you imagine the Father refusing to answer His prayers? Never! '...The Spirit Himself intercedes for us...' (Romans 8:26 NIV) With both Jesus and the Holy Spirit talking to the Father on your behalf, your victory is guaranteed. (2) Between the command to 'Go' and your safe arrival on the other side, there's often a crisis. Jesus commanded them to cross to the other shore, but before the trip was completed their world experienced upheaval. What's buffeting your life today - loss, guilt, loneliness, financial reversal, illness, addiction, rejection? When our faith is low and our fear high, we cry, 'If only I had (or hadn't)...If only I could...' Learn to trust God. It's not over until He says so. And He hasn't!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Don't copy the behaviour and customs of this world, but let God transform you into a new person...' Romans 12:2 NLT<br /><br />
<p>A man walking into a bank held the door open for the lady behind him. Instead of thanking him, she said, 'You don't have to hold the door because I'm a woman.' Smiling, he replied, 'I'm not doing it because you're a woman, I'm doing it because I'm a gentleman.' As believers we do what we do because of who we are 'in Christ', not because of how society thinks we should act. John says, '...The Holy Spirit...lives within...so [we] don't need anyone to teach [us] what is true...' (1 John 2:27 NLT) In his book <em>Hope Again</em>, Chuck Swindoll says: 'In the Marine Corps...our troopship carried us...onto Japanese soil...For many of us, it was our first visit to a foreign country. We were surging with excitement...Our company commander called us together... Remember that for the first time in your lives, you're the foreigners. This is not your country or your culture...you are the minority. These are not your fellow citizens; they do not speak your language. They know nothing of your homeland except what they see in you...Act in such a way that the Japanese people will gain a good impression of your country....As Christians...our citizenship is in heaven... We belong to the kingdom of God... We need to be on our best behaviour, otherwise people will get a distorted perception of what our homeland is like... Our earthly culture is pagan to the core... God left us here for a purpose...to demonstrate what it's like to be a member of another country, to have a citizenship in another land, that we might create a desire for others to emigrate.' Think about it!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The...Lord has given me...words of wisdom, so that I know how to comfort the weary' Isaiah 50:4 NLT<br /><br /><p>God has given each of us a tongue: a simple, basic tool to help us encourage one another. It has been given to all-young and old, rich and poor, wise and foolish. It is a tool we can use to discourage or encourage. Too often we use our tongue to tear people down rather than build them up. And it is in the closest relationships that we are usually the most critical. Criticism given in the wrong spirit undermines a person's self-esteem. And it can make that person become critical of others too! We also hurt people with our ridicule and sarcasm. 'What makes you think you're so smart?' or 'That's the stupidest question I've ever heard.' Laughing at another's mistakes, making fun of a person and labelling them as 'a klutz', 'lazy', 'sloppy', 'stupid' or 'fatty' may get a laugh from others, and even from the victim, but such words often leave painful wounds. We can discourage people by trying to show off our superior knowledge. Sometimes we hurt them just by talking too much and leaving them no time to express themselves. It gives the impression that what they have to say is relatively unimportant compared to our words of wisdom. So each day you need to pray for guidance and then let God tell you what to say. And He will: 'The...Lord has given me...words of wisdom, so that I know how to comfort the weary. Morning by morning He...opens my understanding to His will. The...Lord has spoken to me, and I have listened...' (Isaiah 50:4-5 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He who abides in Me...bears much fruit' John 15:5 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Jesus said, '...I chose you and appointed you that you should...bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain...' (John 15:16 NKJV) God has two goals for us: First, greater success; secondly, a legacy of success. And He will do whatever it takes to accomplish it. Just when we are comfortable at a certain level of success, He takes His shears and starts pruning some of the stuff we'd like to hold on to. The problem is, we settle for less than what God wants. When Jesus said, 'Without Me you can do nothing,' He was teaching us that when we're surrounded by the demands, needs and agendas of others we can get spiritually depleted. And when that happens we begin operating in the energy of the flesh. Andrew Murray wrote: 'Do not confuse work and fruit. There may be a good deal of work for Christ that is not the fruit of the Heavenly vine.' Jesus wants '...fruit that will last.' (John 15:16 NIV) Lasting success! Parent, God didn't give you children so that you could lose them to the enemy. Paul said that the faith he saw in Timothy, he first observed in his mother and his grandmother, both of whom were apparently married to unbelievers. How did they do it? They stayed connected to the vine and thrived in a hostile environment. Business person, God doesn't want you settling for temporal success; His purpose in blessing you is so you can help to extend His Kingdom. There's no shortage of resources; God just needs people He can entrust them to. So pray, 'Lord, make me successful, and give me success that lasts.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I will...gladly spend and be spent for [you]' 2 Corinthians 12:15 NKJV<br /><br /><p>At first, Nelson Mandela was motivated by a dream to free himself from oppression. But his dream expanded to include others. He writes: 'The hunger for my own freedom became the greater hunger for the freedom of my people. It was this desire for freedom of my people to live their lives with dignity and self respect that animated my life, that transformed a frightened young man into a brave one, that drove a law-abiding attorney to become a criminal, that turned a family-loving man into a man without a home, that forced a life-loving man to live like a monk.' When Mandela found himself at the crossroads of life-with one path leading to personal gain and the other to serving his people-he chose the more difficult higher road of helping others. And look at the impact he has made. Have you been confronted with that decision? If so, it doesn't mean abandoning your dream. It means expanding it! Thomas Edison said, 'I never perfected an invention that I did not think about in terms of the service it might give others.' He didn't stop being an inventor so that he could help others. No, he used what he had already accomplished for himself to help others. Don't simply aspire to make a living, aspire to make a difference! Paul writes: '...I will not be burdensome to you; for...I will very gladly spend and be spent for your souls...' (2 Corinthians 12:14-15 NKJV) In getting and gaining you become successful, but only in serving do you become significant. So live for others!</p>

<alias><![CDATA[triple-a-prayer]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...At that time people began to call on the name of the Lord.' Genesis 4:26 NIV<br /><br /><p>The first mention of prayer in the Bible is: 'At that time men began to call on the name of the Lord.' So, how often do you 'call on the name of the Lord'? Only when you're in trouble? Or when you're in church? Occasionally? Never? You say, 'But I don't know how to pray.' Try a triple-A prayer: </p>
<p>(1) <i>Adore</i>. You build intimacy in a relationship by focusing on the other person. So change your prayer pattern; get up tomorrow morning and ask, 'Lord, is there anything I can do for You today?' (2) <i>Ask</i>. Most of the time God's will is already revealed in His Word, so read it! When you know you are praying Scripturally-you pray with confidence. And use your faith. God's greatest desire is to be believed-in spite of the circumstances, your feelings, and all opinions to the contrary. Jesus said, '...Whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.' (Mark 11:24 NIV) (3) <i>Accept</i>. God told the prophet Habakkuk, 'The vision is yet for an appointed time...Though it tarries, wait for it...' (Habakkuk 2:3 NKJV) God understands your sense of urgency, but He always works in your best interests. His willingness to answer your prayer is never in question when you pray according to His will (1 John 5:14). But His answer is determined by the condition of your heart and your readiness to handle what He wants to give you. So instead of pestering Him like a child, grow up; say, 'Lord, You promised it, I believe it, and that settles it!'</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Your ears shall hear a word' Isaiah 30:21 NKJV<br /><br /><p>A 'word' from God can bring you the solution you need. God created the world with a word, so imagine what a word from Him could do for your situation. The Bible says, 'Your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, &quot;This is the way, walk in it, whenever you turn to the right hand or whenever you turn to the left.&quot;' Notice the words, 'Your ears shall hear a word.' But if your spiritual ears are not open, trained and attuned to God, you won't hear what He is saying to you. Furthermore, if you filter what He's saying to you through human intellect in order to harmonise it with your own opinions, you will get nowhere. God gives a 'word' to those who have an open ear-and heart.</p>
<p>When you pray, what are you looking for? A spiritual high, or a time of intimacy with the Lord in which He speaks and you listen? When you read your Bible are you seeking confirmation of your own thoughts, or are you seeking God's will? Imagine what one of God's ideas could do for your life! '...the people who know their God shall be strong, and carry out great exploits.' (Daniel 11:32 NKJV) If you dream of doing great things in life, get to know God. He will reveal Himself to you through His Word. You'll hear a lot of different ideas each day; some will benefit you, others won't. But when you get a 'word' from God it's like a seed; it has the potential to produce a tree; or better yet, a whole orchard of fruit. </p>

<alias><![CDATA[hows-your-communication]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Husbands, love your wives' Ephesians 5:25 NKJV<br /><br /><p>One of the biggest challenges in marriage is communication. Here's an example: in a new family, the husband might go to work and the wife stay home to look after the baby. Now, someone has estimated that the average man speaks about twenty-nine thousand words a day and the average woman speaks about thirty-three thousand words a day. That may not be accurate, but let's use it as an illustration. He's been out in the workplace all day and by the time he gets home he's used up twenty-six thousand of his words, leaving only three thousand he feels no need to say. But she's been locked up all day with the dishes, the nappies and the mundane. She has talked to her mother, friends and neighbours and used up about eight thousand words. So when he gets home she has twenty-five thousand words waiting for him. After a silent supper he spends the evening watching TV, then they go to bed. As he's about to fall asleep a voice says, 'Are you awake?' If you are wise, you will be! If not, tomorrow night there will be fifty thousand words lying beside you. Do the maths; in ten years there will be enough words to fill the state library. But maybe not; maybe there will be no words. A frequent reason given in divorce is: 'We just got to where we had nothing to say to one another anymore.' The Bible says, 'Husbands, love your wives.' Love listens when we have nothing particularly interesting to say. It listens because only when we have been heard and validated, do we feel cherished. So: 'How's your communication?'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...To equip God's people to do His work' Ephesians 4:12 NLT<br /><br /><p>If you think the unemployment statistics in the country are bad, take a look at the church. Twenty percent of its members give eighty percent of its income, and do eighty percent of its work. The rest are happy just to be spectators. It's easy to sit back, criticise and say, 'Why doesn't the church do something about the problem?' Hold on there: You are the church; you do something about it! You say, 'But I left my church because I don't like the way they do things.' You didn't leave God's church, which is the body of Christ, did you? So, instead of talking about what your church doesn't do, look in the mirror and ask yourself, 'What am I doing for the Lord?' Do you know what an Armchair Manager is? It's someone who analyses the game when it's over, criticises the players, complains about the referee's calls, and is content to sit in the stadium and be a spectator rather than a player. Hello! It takes commitment to spend hours in practice knowing you'll be booed by the crowd, tackled by opponents, and will leave the field beat up and covered in dirt. The Bible says that the job of your pastor is: '...to equip God's people to do His work and build up the church...This will continue until we all come to such unity in our faith and knowledge of God's Son that we will be mature in the Lord, measuring up to the full and complete standard of Christ. Then we will no longer be immature like children...' (Ephesians 4:12-14 NLT) Think about it!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Their nobles would not put their shoulders to the work' Nehemiah 3:5 NIV<br /><br /><p>The story's told of a football team that was losing badly. Pointing to the captain, their coach on the sidelines kept shouting, 'Give the ball to Calhoun! Give the ball to Calhoun!' Fed up and frustrated, the captain finally shouted back, 'Coach, Calhoun doesn't want the ball!' Yesterday we talked about those who would rather be a spectator than a player. Today let's talk about those who are on the team but don't want to put their heart into it. While rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem, Nehemiah wrote, 'The next section was repaired by the men of Tekoa, but their nobles would not put their shoulders to the work.' These guys suffered from two common diseases known as 'convenient commitment' and 'limited involvement'. For every person who fulfils their dream, you will find a hundred others who only talk about it. You say, 'Let somebody else do the giving for a change.' If somebody else sows, somebody else will reap the harvest you were meant to reap. Is that ok with you? The Bible says, 'God will generously provide all you need. Then you will always have everything you need and plenty left over to share with others.' (2 Corinthians 9:8 NLT) When God's blessing stops flowing through you, it stops flowing to you. Think long term. Treasure in Heaven is laid up, only as treasure on earth is laid down. Paul speaks of '...the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me.' (Galatians 2:20 NLT) Every time God asks you for time, money or talent, remember what Christ gave up for you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation' 2 Corinthians 5:17 NIV<br /><br /><p>The story is told of a man reading a newspaper when he came across a map of the world. So he clipped it out, cut it into pieces and told his little boy to put it back together again. After a while the boy said to him, 'I've done it!' His father marvelled, 'As quick as that? How did you do it?' His son said: 'I turned it over and on the back was a picture of a man. I put the man together-and the world came together!' You can't change the world, but Christ can change you, and when that happens, your world will start coming together. The Bible says, 'If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!'</p>
<p>But don't just give Jesus your heart; give Him your entire life. Yes, the thief on the cross found redemption in his dying moments, so there's no age limit when it comes to salvation. But JO Wilson points out: 'Suppose that Paul had been converted at seventy instead of twenty-five. There would have been no Paul in history. There was a Matthew Henry because he was converted at eleven and not at seventy...A Jonathan Edwards because he was converted at eight and not eighty; a Richard Baxter because he was converted at six and not sixty. How much more a soul is worth that has a lifetime of opportunity before it, than the soul which has nothing! Lambs are of more worth than sheep in the realm of souls, as well as in the marketplace.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I will pour out My...blessing on your children' Isaiah 44:3 NLT<br /><br /><p>You must pray, claiming God's promises over your children. Are such prayers effective? Yes. God says, '...I am ready to perform My word.' (Jeremiah 1:12 NKJV) We serve a promise-making, promise-keeping God! 'So shall My word be that goes forth from My mouth; it shall not return to Me void, but it shall accomplish what I please, and it shall prosper in the thing for which I sent it.' (Isaiah 55:11 NKJV) So pray for your children each day and stand on these promises:</p>
<p>'...I will pour My Spirit on your descendants, and My blessing on your offspring.' (Isaiah 44:3 NKJV) '&quot;And this is my covenant with them,&quot; says the Lord. &quot;My Spirit will not leave them, and neither will these words I have given you. They will be on your lips and on the lips of your children and your children's children forever. I, the Lord, have spoken!''' (Isaiah 59:21 NLT) 'Now this is what the Lord says: &quot;Do not weep any longer, for I will reward you,&quot; says the Lord. &quot;Your children will come back to you from the distant land of the enemy. There is hope for your future,&quot; says the Lord. &quot;Your children will come again to their own land.&quot;' (Jeremiah 31:16-17 NLT) '...the posterity of the righteous will be delivered.' (Proverbs 11:21 NKJV) '...Blessed is the man who fears the Lord, who finds great delight in His commands. His children will be mighty in the land; the generation of the upright will be blessed.' (Psalm 112:1-2 NIV) 'Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household.' (Acts 16:31 NKJV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['My life is worth nothing...unless I use it for finishing the work assigned me by the Lord' Acts 20:24 NLT<br /><br /><p>There's an old saying: 'If you love your job you'll never work a day in your life.' That's not quite true. Most people work hard. But even when they love their job they still have to do things they don't like to do. They give effort above and beyond what's comfortable. It's probably more accurate to say that if you're doing something you believe in, the hard work you do will bring you deep satisfaction. The hard work is part of the <i>journey</i> which is often more important than the <i>arriving</i> at the destination. Some people suffer from 'destination disease'. They think that arriving at a certain place in life will bring them happiness. What a shame. Because the reality is that many times when we arrive, we discover that it wasn't what we expected. If you become fixated on a destination you can miss the great things that happen along the way. You miss the joy of today. If you're convinced that 'someday' is going to be your best day, you won't put enough into today-or get enough out of it. If you're not doing something significant with your life, it doesn't matter how long it is. It's not enough just to survive; you need a reason to live. This is where Christ comes in: He will give you new life, and add purpose to your life-plus the power to fulfil that purpose. DL Moody once said, 'Let God have your life; He can do more with it than you can.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Your Father in Heaven [will] give good gifts to those who ask' Matthew 7:11 NIV<br /><br /><p>Phillips Brooks said, 'Pray the largest prayers. You cannot think of a prayer so large that God, in answering it, will not wish you had made it larger. Pray not for crutches but for wings.' When we love our children we want to be generous with them. And that's how God feels about us: 'If you, then, though you are evil...give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in Heaven give good gifts to those who ask Him.' Some of us have difficulty accepting the gifts God gives us, particularly material things. One lady said, 'I distinctly remember feeling God must have had His wires crossed. Why would He do that for me? In fact I felt guilty, as if I'd somehow acquired something God didn't really want me to have.' Think how cruel the following words would sound if they represented your attitude as a parent: 'I'm too busy. I don't want to hear about your lost bike or your school problem. Don't bother me with your personal requests. I'll take care of everybody else but you. If you love me you'll survive on bread and water. Sure, I'm rich, but why would I give you anything-back off!' Good parents don't talk like that! They want only the best for their children. So, take a good parent's feeling for their child, multiply it exponentially, and you'll only begin to understand how God feels about you. Nobody's voice sounds sweeter to Him than yours. Nothing in the world keeps Him from directing His full attention to your requests. So come to Him in prayer.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Pray continually.' 1 Thessalonians 5:17 NIV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says, 'Pray continually.' If you can worry continually, you can pray continually; you just have to change your focus! Try to picture this: an enemy army has arrived intent on wiping Israel out. So Moses says to Joshua, 'Take your best soldiers and go fight them. I'm taking two men, climbing the hill that overlooks the plains, raising my hands toward Heaven and praying for victory.' (Exodus 17:8-9 paraphrase) As Moses' hands stretched heavenward, Joshua's troops prevailed. But when Moses' arms grew weary and he dropped them to his side, the tide of battle shifted. Joshua's troops were being struck down. Again Moses stretched his arms toward Heaven, bringing the matter before the Lord. Immediately the battle's momentum shifted back to Joshua. Then it struck Moses-he must keep his arms outstretched toward Heaven if he wanted to open the door to God's supernatural intervention here on earth. There's a lesson here: if you are willing to invite God to involve Himself in your daily living, you'll experience His power in your home, your relationships, your career and wherever else it's needed. But the other side of the equation is sobering: it's hard for God to release His power in your life when you just put your hands in your pockets and say, 'I can handle this on my own.' If you do that, don't be surprised if you get the nagging feeling that the tide of battle has shifted against you and that you're powerless to do anything about it. To experience God's power in your life you must pray continually, pray Scripturally, and pray in faith.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['He shall call upon Me, and I will answer him' Psalm 91:15 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft, is hooked up to the internet. (Using the internet, subscribers can send email to other internet users.) So when <i>The New Yorker</i> magazine published Gates' email address he quickly got into trouble with email overload. Because now anyone on the internet was able to mail the computer genius. In no time he was swamped with thousands of messages-he simply couldn't handle it. So he armed his computer with software that filtered his email, allowing important messages through and sending all the others to electronic oblivion. We are limited; we can handle only so much and do only so much. God, on the other hand, never tires of s-mail (spirit mail). His ear is always open to our prayers. And He has an unlimited capacity to help. You'll never hear Him say, 'Due to an unusually high call volume I am unable to take your message at this time. Please call back or leave a message.' No, the Bible says, 'He shall call upon Me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him and honour him.' (Psalm 91:15 NKJV) '...the desire of the righteous will be granted.' (Proverbs 10:24 NKJV) '...the prayer of the upright is His delight.' (Proverbs 15:8 NKJV) 'Call to Me, and I will answer you, and show you great and mighty things, which you do not know.'

<introtext><![CDATA['...For we do not know what we should pray for' Romans 8:26 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Prayer works like the  emergency system. All you need to do is dial those numbers and you're instantly connected to an operator who is trained to keep calm in emergency situations and is able to connect with the emergency service required to send help straight away. You might not be able to say what the problem is. Perhaps a loved one has just suffered a heart attack and you are so out of control that all you can do is scream into the telephone. No problem. The operator doesn't need all the details. He knows where the call is coming from, and help is on the way. There are times in our desperation and pain when we pray  prayers. We're overwhelmed. Sometimes we don't know the words to speak. But God hears. He knows our name and our situation. Help is on the way; He's already begun to bring the remedy. 'Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. Now He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He makes intercession for the saints according to the will of God. And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose.' (Romans 8:26-28 NKJV) Speaking of prayer, John Bunyan said, 'In prayer it is better to have a heart without words, than words without a heart.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...You will ask what you desire, and it shall be done.' John 15:7 NKJV<br /><br /><p>In May 1996, ValuJet flight 592 crashed into the Florida Everglades, killing 110 passengers. Navy experts tried using special technology to detect the plane's black box, without success. Holding a rope that kept them spaced a metre apart, searchers poked through every square metre of muck. After fourteen days they had found nothing. The physical conditions were unbearable. The sun beat down upon them and temperatures hovered in the nineties. Diesel fuel and caustic hydraulic fluid floated in the water, forcing searchers to wear several layers of protective rubber. Fourteen days of that had left them dehydrated, but they had to find the black box. Sergeant Felix Jimenez of Metro-Dade Police was one of the searchers. For fourteen days he'd prayed for the bereaved families and the safety of his fellow workers. But on the fifteenth day as he took a break, suddenly he realised he'd failed to pray for one important thing: that God would help them find the black box. So he asked God for direction, resumed the search, and when he stuck his pole into the water he hit something metallic. He pulled the object out of the muck. It was the black box. Jimenez wrote in <i>Guideposts</i>: 'I thought of the many days we had spent searching for the recorder, how we must have tramped over it many times, and I wondered why its retrieval had taken so long. Amid the low rustle of sawgrass and the call of the wild heron, I seemed to hear the response: &quot;Why did it take you so long to ask?&quot;'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['There is a time for everything... a time to weep and a time to laugh.' Ecclesiastes 3:14 NIV<br /><br /><p>Optimists tend to believe that life is mostly good; pessimists, that it's mostly bad. Life is both. And only those who embrace that truth are able to find fulfilment. Why? Because those who accept it but don't embrace it become apathetic, meeting every difficulty with a shrug and a sigh. They may survive, but they won't be successful. To succeed you must be proactive, in bad times as well as good. If you examine the lives of successful people you'll discover they always do what's right no matter how they feel, and by doing right-they end up feeling good. On the other hand, unsuccessful people tend to wait to feel good before they do what's right. As a result, they neither do what's right nor feel good. Often you won't feel like doing the right thing, but you need to do it anyway. Nelson Mandela said: 'I have discovered the secret that after climbing a great hill, one finds many more hills to climb. I have taken a moment here to rest, to steal a view of the glorious vista that surrounds me, to look back on the distance I have come. But I can rest only for a moment, for with freedom come responsibilities, and I dare not linger, for my long walk is not yet ended.' If you always do the right thing-despite how you feel, despite what others may say or do in response-you will be satisfied with yourself. And that, at the end of the day, will do a lot to determine whether you feel fulfilled.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Rejoice with those who rejoice' Romans 12:15 NKJV<br /><br /><p>William Barclay said: 'It's more difficult to congratulate another on his success if it involves disappointment to us, than to sympathise with his sorrow...Only when self is dead can we take as much joy in the success of others as in our own.' Karen Ehman's home had been for sale twenty months when a friend called to say hers sold in twenty days. Ehman says: 'Although I was thrilled...I was a tad jealous...that &quot;poor me&quot; mentality when God answers someone else's prayer and my answer seems to be no, or not right now. As a child I envied kids from two-parent homes...in high school it was other girls' looks and cute clothes...I was average looking, and although I was every guy's pal, I was nobody's gal. In college I envied girls whose prayers for a knight in shining armour were answered...Once married, I struggled with miscarriage and dashed dreams of motherhood...I slapped a smile on my face and attended yet another baby shower. The cure for envy isn't easy...But when you call on God He will tell you...things...you could [never figure out on your own] (Jeremiah 33:3 NIV). Instead of begging Him to sell my house, take away my pain, and fix my kids, I need to ask what He's trying to teach me that I won't learn if He rescues me; and what qualities He's trying to grow in me. God's willing and able to answer our prayers as He sees fit...[His goal is] growing us to be more like His Son.' Paul writes, 'Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep.' To be Christ-like, you have got to be able to do both.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Trust in the Lord' Proverbs 3:5 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says, 'Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths.' (Proverbs 3:5-6 NKJV) But what if your path leads through pain, pressure and problems? John the Baptist's did. He didn't deserve imprisonment. After all, he was the forerunner of Christ and the voice of God in the community. Plus, he was Jesus' cousin. So he sent Jesus a message asking, 'Are you really the Messiah, or should we keep looking?' Paraphrased: 'Lord, if I'm in your will, how come I'm in this situation?' It's a question motivated by unfulfilled expectations. We think, 'Lord, I've obeyed You, how come things aren't working out for me?' And it feels worse when you've faithfully served Him. Writing about her daughter's death, Meg Woodson says, 'I'll never forget those shrill, piercing...screams; that the God who could have helped, looked down on this young woman who was devoted to Him...and decided to sit on His hands and let her death top the horror charts.' Talk about unmet expectations! Jesus could have saved John, but He didn't. Instead He sent back word: 'Don't worry, everything's on target, the Kingdom is being built. You did your job well.' (Matthew 11:4-5 paraphrase) It probably wasn't the answer John hoped for. He was looking for solutions to temporal problems while Jesus was busy establishing an eternal Kingdom. So next time God doesn't seem to meet your expectations, it's not that He doesn't care; it's that He sees the big picture and He's handling issues you can't even begin to comprehend. So trust Him!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Then you will receive praise, honour and renown' Deuteronomy 26:19 NLT<br /><br /><p>Imagine how honoured you would feel if a president or prime minister decided to visit you and spend the night at your house. You wouldn't leave dirty dishes piled up in the sink, clothes strewn across the floor and a ring around the bathtub. No, you'd give the place a radical makeover! And you wouldn't make them sleep in the garage, the box room or the attic; you'd vacate the master bedroom and give it to them. Your goal would be to honour them in every way because their presence had honoured you. Now read this: 'You have declared today that the Lord is your God. And you have promised to walk in His ways, and...do everything He tells you. The Lord has declared today that you are His people, His own special treasure, just as He promised, and that you must obey all His commands. And if you do, He will set you high above all the other nations He has made. Then you will receive praise, honour, and renown...' (Deuteronomy 26:17-19 NLT) Let's take this a step further. When Old Testament priests entered the ministry they went through a rite called 'consecration'. From that moment on they belonged exclusively to God and were committed to obey Him in all things. You say, 'What does any of this have to do with me?' A lot: if you want God to use you, to honour and promote you, you can't marginalise or compartmentalise Him. You must commit yourself to doing His will! And that includes your time, your talent, your treasure, your body, your mind, your spirit, and your all. God wants 'total commitment'.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...If we ask anything according to His will, He hears us.' 1 John 5:14 NKJV<br /><br /><p>We like to think that our wants are God's will, maybe, and maybe not. '...If we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. And if we know that He hears us...we know that we have the petitions that we have asked of Him.' (1 John 5:14-15 NKJV) Your confidence in prayer comes from knowing that you are asking according to God's will. And He reveals His will to us: (1) <i>Through His Word</i>. Find out what the Bible says about the thing you are asking God for. The story's told of a lady who's only Bible reading was a promise box. Remember those? First, she reached in and pulled out a Scripture that read, 'Judas went out and hanged himself.' So she reached for a second one and it said, 'Go thou and do likewise.' Quickly she reached for a third one and it said, 'And what thou doest, do quickly.' Seriously, don't just read the promises of God, study the conditions that go with them! (2) <i>Through personal revelation</i>. Hannah Whitall Smith said: 'I lay it down as a foundation principle...that God's voice will always be in harmony with itself, no matter in how many different ways He may speak. The voices may be many, the message can be but one. If God tells me in one voice to do or to leave undone anything, He cannot possibly tell me the opposite in another voice... therefore my rule for distinguishing the voice of God would be to bring it to the test of harmony.' So, make sure you are asking in harmony with God's will.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['We are...created...to do good works' Ephesians 2:10 NIV<br /><br /><p>God uses people like you, ordinary people with work and family responsibilities, mortgages and busy lives. The Bible says, '...we are...created...to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.' Note the word 'prepared.' It's the same word that's used for making sure a team has the training and equipment it needs to win. The truth is, each of us is '...an instrument for noble purposes...' (2 Timothy 2:21 NIV) When do you know the true value of an instrument? When it's in the hands of a master! So put your life into the Master's hands and watch what He does with it. He 'saved us...not because of anything we did... but because of God's purpose...before time began.' (2 Timothy 1:9 NCV) And He '...has given each of [us] a gift from His great variety...to serve one another' (1 Peter 4:10 NLT); '...gifts...to equip God's people to do His work and build up the church...' (Ephesians 4:11-12 NLT) Do you still think your life doesn't count for much? Jesus said, 'Go and make followers of all people in the world...Teach them to obey everything that I have taught you, and I will be with you always...' (Matthew 28:19-20 NCV) You're not just another face in the crowd; your life has value and purpose, even on those days when you feel totally inadequate. So, 'Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart...since...you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward...' (Colossians 3:23-24 NIV) Can you think of any greater incentive than that moment when you stand in His presence and hear, 'Well done,' for giving it your best shot?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['To prepare God's people for works of service' Ephesians 4:12 NIV<br /><br /><p>The story's told of a pastor who went to the railroad station every night to watch the express train roar through town. His congregation wondered why. When suspicions arose a deacon followed him, watched him, and asked what he was doing. He replied, 'This train is the only thing that comes through this town that I don't have to push!' God hasn't called your pastor to do everything in church, He's called them 'to prepare [you] for works of service.' So, have you found your area of service yet? Are you functioning in it? Paul writes: 'Just as there are many parts to our bodies, so it is with Christ's body... God has given each of us the ability to do certain things well. So if God has given you the ability to prophesy, then prophesy whenever you can, as often as your faith is strong enough to receive a message from God. If your gift is that of serving others, serve them well. If you are a teacher, do a good job of teaching. If you are a preacher, see to it that your sermons are strong and helpful. If God has given you money, be generous in helping others with it. If God has given you administrative ability and put you in charge of the work of others, take the responsibility seriously. Those who offer comfort to the sorrowing should do so with Christian cheer.' (Romans 12:4-8 TLB) CS Lewis said, 'Joy bursts in on our lives when we go about doing the good at hand, and not trying to manipulate things and times to achieve joy.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Don't let anyone look down on you' 1 Timothy 4:12 NIV<br /><br /><p>You shouldn't be overlooked because of your age, your gender, your nationality, your education or your financial status. People will try to put you down, but if you trust God He will lift you up. Timothy started preaching in his teens. He became Paul's travelling companion, which was no small honour. But in those days society said you didn't come into maturity until you were thirty, therefore Timothy wasn't qualified for leadership. Since Timothy was facing criticism, Paul wrote, 'Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young...' With God it's not the length of your life that qualifies you, but the depth of it. Look at Timothy's credentials: 'From childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures...' (2 Timothy 3:15 NKJV) Timothy was nurtured in God's Word and grounded in the truth. 'When I call to remembrance the genuine faith that is in you, which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am persuaded is in you also.' (2 Timothy 1:5 NKJV) So Paul writes to the Philippian church and says: 'I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly... For I have no one like-minded, who will sincerely care for your state. For all seek their own, not the things which are of Christ Jesus. But you know his proven character, that as a son with his father he served with me in the Gospel.' (Philippians 2:19-22 NKJV) The right to work in God's service is not determined by your years on earth, but by your experience with God, your growth in grace and in His Word.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Do it with the strength God provides' 1 Peter 4:11 NIV<br /><br /><p>William Wilberforce grew up as a child of privilege, attending Cambridge University. Two weeks after his twenty-first birthday he was elected to Parliament where he became a brilliant orator and politician. Then he met John Newton, author of the hymn <i>Amazin</i><i>g Grace</i>. A former slave ship captain, Newton had found Christ, repented of his old life and become a minister. Upon meeting Newton, seeds were sown in Wilberforce's heart that were destined to change history. In 1787, Wilberforce initiated a campaign to make Great Britain aware of the atrocities of slavery and vote for its abolition. It was a fierce fight. Besides politicians and industrialists, religious leaders who had their own slaves opposed him. From his deathbed John Wesley wrote to Wilberforce: 'If God be for you, who can be against you? Are all of them together stronger than God? O, be not weary in well doing! Go on, in the name of God and in the power of His might, till even American slavery (the vilest that ever saw the sun) shall vanish away before it.' Wilberforce persevered because he knew what was at stake: the lives of millions of people. Finally, in 1807, the Slave Trade Act outlawing traffic in slaves was passed in the House of Commons by a vote of 283 to 16. Twenty-six years later, near the end of Wilberforce's life, slavery was abolished throughout the British Empire. Shortly thereafter, it was abolished in the United States. How did it happen? Because one man decided to live by the principle, '...through love serve one another.' (Galatians 5:13 NKJV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant.' Mark 10:43 NIV<br /><br /><p>William Wilberforce's biographer, Eric Metaxas, points out that the abolition of the British slave trade had even greater implications: 'We had suddenly entered a world in which we would never again ask whether it was our responsibility as a society to help the poor and suffering. We would only quibble about how...Once this idea was loosed upon the world, the world changed. Slavery and the slave trade would soon be largely abolished, but many lesser social evils would be abolished too. For the first time in history, groups sprang up for every possible social cause.' That's why Metaxas calls Wilberforce 'The greatest social reformer in the history of the world.' Metaxas goes on to say: 'The world he was born into in 1759 and the world he departed in 1833 were as different as lead and gold. Wilberforce presided over a social earthquake that rearranged the continents, and whose magnitude we are only now beginning to fully appreciate.' During his first years in Parliament, Wilberforce wined and dined each night and was touted as the 'the wittiest man in all of England.' Looking back on it he wrote, 'For the first years I was in Parliament I did nothing-nothing of any purpose.' But in committing to Christ he discovered his life's purpose. It was not about achieving personal greatness, but about serving others. Today, go out of your way to help, bless and serve someone. If you do, when you get to the end of the day you'll feel good about yourself, knowing you have served God and His people.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['You...do not receive, because you ask amiss' James 4:3 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Sometimes in our prayers we are 'me' centred and see God as a genie to be conjured up to fulfil our every wish. Then when we don't get what we want we think He doesn't hear, doesn't care, or maybe doesn't exist. James says, 'You...do not receive, because you ask amiss, that you may spend it on your pleasures.' Selfishness is at the root of many unanswered prayers. The first petition in the Lord's Prayer is 'Hallowed be Your name', the second 'Your Kingdom come' and the third, 'Your will be done.' (Matthew 6:9-10 NKJV) Note, our first concern in prayer should be what God wants, not what we want. So here are some suggestions for praying with the right mindset:</p>
<p>(1) <i>Ask God to slay your sinful nature</i>. As new creatures in Christ we wrestle daily with our old nature. And as long as that nature has the upper hand, our prayers will be hindered. (2) <i>Ask Him to cleanse you with His blood</i>. You can't come into God's presence tainted by sin; you must confess it and ask Him to forgive you. (3) <i>Ask Him to fill you with the Holy Spirit</i>. The indwelling of God's Spirit enables you to overcome temptation and live according to His will. (4) <i>Ask Him to guard and guide your steps</i>. God's plan for our lives is always better than anything we could ever devise. (5) <i>Ask Him to use you for His glory</i>. Make yourself available as a servant with a willing heart to do whatever He asks. Bottom line: when you pray with the right mindset you'll get answers you never imagined possible.</p>

<alias><![CDATA[building-lasting-relationships]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...It is not good that man should be alone' Genesis 2:18 NKJV<br /><br /><p>God's plan for your life always requires building relationships with the right people. To succeed, you must be able to recognise these people and work with them. Remember Jonathan, who loved David even at the cost of his own life? Or Ruth, who loved her widowed mother-in-law Naomi and gave her a reason to live again? Or Paul, who wrote about Timothy, '...I have no man like [him]... For all men seek their own...' (Philippians 2:19-21 KJV) God wouldn't say, 'It's not good that man should be alone,' then tell you to do it all by yourself. But there may be areas in your life that need to be healed before you can enter these relationships and enjoy them. There's a world of difference between 'using' relationships and 'heart-ties'. Blood-ties don't wear as well as heart-ties. So allow God to work on you. When you are ready, He will make the necessary introductions. In the meantime, get to know Him better. Make His opinion the source of your self-worth. If your last relationship stripped you of worth and drained you spiritually, use this time to get back on your feet. You may never have this opportunity again.</p>
<p>And one more thought: begin to love as God loves. He sees your imperfection, handles your rejection and loves you regardless. That should help you not to throw someone away because they made a mistake. You wouldn't discard your car over a faulty part, right? If God forgave you as you forgive others, what shape would you be in? Come on, let God teach you how to build lasting relationships.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Where sin abounded, grace abounded much more.' Romans 5:20 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Paul writes, '...I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it.' (Galatians 1:13 NIV) Clearly, Paul had no thoughts of becoming a Christian. As a Pharisee, he was obsessed with the law. As an intellectual, he could debate the finest minds. Articulate and educated, he was committed to the tenets of his faith. Yet he hated Christians! He watched as Stephen, the first martyr, was stoned to death. And while he didn't personally participate, he held the coats of those who did (Acts 7:57-59). Paul never dreamed that one day he'd be a zealous follower of Christ himself. But when God has a plan for your life He will do whatever it takes to fulfil it. By the time He places the hook in your jaw, He's already begun to work out His purpose for you. Even while Paul held the coats of Stephen's executioners, God had plans to use him. Just as He had plans for you when you were out partying, doing your own thing, going from relationship to relationship, or thinking only of making money. None of that stopped God because, 'Where sin abounded, grace abounded much more.' Had Paul known God planned to meet him that day on the Damascus Road, he might have taken a different route. But '...a light from Heaven flashed around him. He fell to the ground...' (Acts 9:3-4 NIV) This proud Pharisee had an appointment with God that wasn't in his diary, one that knocked him off his high horse. And to bring you into submission with His will, God will do whatever it takes. So be warned! God won't permit your stubbornness to subvert His plans for your life!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['What you say can mean life or death' Proverbs 18:21 NCV<br /><br /><p>There's a story about a teacher who, to honour her students, gave each a ribbon that stated, 'Who I am makes a difference,' and asked them to pass it along to someone who'd made a difference in their lives. One kid gave his to a young executive who helped him plan his career. He in turn gave it to his boss, who was hard to get along with. He told him how much he'd been influenced by his creativity, and asked him to give the ribbon to somebody he admired. That night the boss told his fourteen-year-old son, 'I've thought about who I want to honour-and it's you. My days are hectic, and I'm always complaining about your grades and your messy bedroom. Tonight I want to let you know the difference you've made in my life. Besides your mother, you're the most important person I know, and I love you.' Fighting back tears, the boy replied, 'Earlier today I wrote a letter explaining why I'd taken my life, and asking you to forgive me. I was going to do it when everybody was asleep. I didn't think you'd care. I guess I won't need the letter now.' Upstairs in his son's room the father found the anguish-filled note beside a loaded gun. God can help you to '...speak a word in season to him who is weary...' (Isaiah 50:4 NKJV) Words change lives: 'What you say can mean life or death.' So go out of your way today to speak words of encouragement to somebody you don't normally think about. '...a word spoken at the right moment-how good it is!' (Proverbs 15:23 AMP)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I will be faithful to you and make you Mine' Hosea 2:20 NLT<br /><br /><p>You can be loved by many, but deep down you'll feel needy and insecure until you understand how God feels about you. The Bible says:</p>
<p>(1) <i>God wants you to be happy</i>. '...I have loved you, My people, with an everlasting love. With unfailing love I have drawn you to Myself. I will rebuild you...You will again be happy...' (Jeremiah 31:3-4 NLT) ( 2) <i>God will never walk out on you</i>. '...He Himself has said, &quot;I will never leave you nor forsake you.&quot;' (Hebrews 13:5 NKJV) You say, 'But what about my failures and shortcomings?' Nothing about you surprises God or changes His mind about you. He's totally committed to you. 'If we are unfaithful, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny who He is.' (2 Timothy 2:13 NLT) (3) <i>God thinks you are valuable</i>. '...Do not be afraid, for I have ransomed you. I have called you by name; you are Mine. When you go through deep waters I will be with you. When you go through rivers of difficulty, you will not drown. When you walk through the fire of oppression, you will not be burned up; the flames will not consume you. For I am the Lord, your God...you are precious to Me. You are honoured, and I love you. Do not be afraid, for I am with you...' (Isaiah 43:1-5 NLT) (4) <i>God never takes His eye off you</i>. 'There is no one like the God of Israel. He rides across the Heavens to help you...The eternal God is your refuge, and His everlasting arms are under you. He drives out the enemy before you...' (Deuteronomy 33:26-27 NLT) So live in God's love. It's the most secure place on earth!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Conquer evil by doing good.' Romans 12:21 TLB<br /><br /><p>It's easy to forget why God saved you, what He's called you to do, and how you're supposed to live. So here's a memo from Heaven: 'Don't just pretend that you love others: really love them. Hate what is wrong. Stand on the side of good. Love each other with brotherly affection and take delight in honouring each other. Never be lazy in your work but serve the Lord enthusiastically. Be glad for all God is planning for you. Be patient in trouble and prayerful always. When God's children are in need, you be the one to help them out... If someone mistreats you... pray that God will bless him. When others are happy, be happy with them. If they are sad, share their sorrow. Work happily together. Don't try to act big. Don't try to get into the good graces of important people, but enjoy the company of ordinary folks. And don't think you know it all! Never pay back evil for evil. Do things in such a way that everyone will see you are honest clear through. Don't quarrel with anyone. Be at peace with everyone, just as much as possible... never avenge yourselves. Leave that to God, for He has said that He will repay those who deserve it... Instead, feed your enemy if he is hungry. If he is thirsty give him something to drink and you will be heaping coals of fire on his head. In other words, he will feel ashamed of himself for what he has done to you. Don't let evil get the upper hand but conquer evil by doing good.' (Romans 12:9-21 TLB)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Bless the Lord...who forgives all your [sins]' Psalm 103:23 NKJV<br /><br /><p>We tend to forgive others more easily than we forgive ourselves. This is especially so when we fail in a major area like a marriage or career, or our actions have hurt others, or our habits have hurt us, or we know we are not doing what we should. So what should you do? (1) <i>Acknowledge it</i>. Don't be afraid to confess what you've done. You're not unique. You're not the first, and you won't be the last to fail. Once you've obtained God's forgiveness, get the support of a trusted friend. 'Confess your trespasses to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much.' (James 5:16 NKJV) (2) <i>Delete it</i>. Often it's not the offence itself, but the guilt and stress associated with remembering our actions that make us feel bad. Our reaction is the problem! Continually revisiting our failures doesn't help at all, and it disappoints God. So catch yourself doing it-and hit the delete button! Focus on the fact that God has forgiven you, then put it behind you. 'In Him we have...the forgiveness of sins...' (Ephesians 1:7 NKJV) (3) <i>Replace it</i>. Instead of guilt, choose gratitude. That's not hard to do; just begin to reflect on God's goodness. That's what David did: 'Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all His benefits: who forgives all your iniquities, who heals all your diseases, who redeems your life from destruction, who crowns you with loving-kindness and tender mercies.' (Psalm 103:2-4 NKJV) When you start to look for them, you'll find lots of things to thank God for.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['In Him we have...forgiveness of sins' Ephesians 1:7 NKJV<br /><br /><p>When God forgives you but you refuse to forgive yourself, you're spurning His grace and choosing to be miserable. When you do that: (1) <i>Your loved ones are at risk</i>. It's not just about you. When you wallow in guilt you tend to be more withdrawn and critical, and less open and affectionate. So your spouse, children, parents, co-workers, friends and even your pets suffer along with you. (2) <i>Your health is at risk</i>. Your mind affects your body. Doctors say bitterness generates chemicals that affect your vital organs. They increase your heart rate, raise your blood pressure, disrupt your digestion, tense your muscles, dump cholesterol into your bloodstream, and reduce your ability to think clearly. Each time you rehearse the past those bad feelings deliver more corrosive chemicals. Science is now confirming what God has said; namely, that those who don't forgive themselves, and others, are more prone to heart attacks, depression, hypertension and other serious illnesses. (3) <i>Your future is at risk</i>. The Bible says, 'You will again have compassion on us... You will...hurl all our iniquities into the depths of the sea.' (Micah 7:19 NIV) Stop dredging up what God has buried. Start looking ahead; otherwise you'll get mired in a bog of your own making. The Bible says, 'He is so rich in kindness and grace that He purchased our freedom with the blood of His Son and forgave our sins. He has showered His kindness on us, along with all wisdom and understanding.' (Ephesians 1:7-8 NLT) With God's forgiveness comes the wisdom and understanding to not only survive your past, but grow stronger as a result of it.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['We fasted and entreated...God' Ezra 8:23 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Ezra's assignment was rebuilding the temple in Jerusalem, and there were moments when it felt overwhelming. So here's what he did: 'We fasted and entreated our God for this, and He answered our prayer.' When you are willing to go without food and take the time to seek God with all your heart, He will respond to you. So, when should you fast? Let's observe three things Ezra fasted and prayed for: (1) '...To seek from Him the right way for us...' (Ezra 8:21 NKJV) Without God's guidance you are left to the mercy of your own best thinking, and that can get you into trouble you may not get out of in a hurry. God doesn't want you travelling blindly into the future, hoping for the best. His promise to you is, 'Ask Me and I will tell you remarkable secrets you do not know about things to come.' (Jeremiah 33:3 NLT) (2) '...and [for] our little ones...' (Ezra 8:21 NKJV) Because God Himself is a Father, this much is sure: when you petition Him on behalf of your children He gets involved in their lives! Samuel was moulded into one of Israel's greatest prophets by the prayers of a godly mother called Hannah. (3) '...and all our possessions.' (Ezra 8:21 NKJV) If unemployment, the rate of mortgagee sales, and the rollercoaster we call the stock market are anything to go by, you'd be wise to consult God before you make any financial decision. 'Has God promised to bless me financially?' you ask. Yes. But only when your heart is in harmony with His will and your desire is to do what pleases Him.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Carry each other's burdens, and...you will fulfil the law of Christ.' Galatians 6:2 NIV<br /><br /><p>If your desire is to bless others, you must ask yourself: (1) <i>What am I doing to invest in myself</i>? You can't give what you don't have. Unless you're committed to personal growth you'll have nothing of worth to give others. So, '...add to your faith...knowledge' (2 Peter 1:5 NIV) and keep adding! (2) <i>What am I doing to invest in others</i>? Success can cause you to be self-seeking. Although you make the most of your natural talent and work hard, you can still become a schemer who asks, 'What can I get from others?' Instead you must ask, 'What can I give to others?' In the book <i>Mother Teresa</i><i>-</i><i>Come Be My Light: The Private Writings of the Saint of Calcutta</i>, the little nun shares her thoughts with her superiors about her life and her calling to serve people. 'I don't know what the success will be...but if the Missionaries of Charity have brought joy to one unhappy home...made one innocent child from the streets keep pure for Jesus...one dying person die in peace with God...don't you think, Your Grace, it would be worthwhile offering everything...for just that one...because that would bring great joy to the heart of Jesus.' Mother Teresa inspired many of us, sat with presidents and kings, and modelled what servant-hood is to the world. Yet her dream of helping others started small, with the goal of affecting one unhappy home, one innocent child, or one dying person. The way in which you can bless the world around you is to do it-one life at a time.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I remember you in my prayers at all times' Romans 1:910 NIV<br /><br /><p>Charles Swindoll writes: 'We don't look, act, or dress alike. We have different tastes in food, books, cars and music. We work at different jobs...enjoy different hobbies ...but one thing we have in common. We know what it means to hurt. Suffering is universal. Tears are the same for Jews, Muslims, Christians, white, black, brown, children, adults, and the elderly. When life hurts and dreams fade we express our anguish in different ways, but each of us knows the sting of pain, heartache, disease, disaster, trials and suffering. A great preacher of yester-year once said to a group of aspiring young ministers, &quot;Preach to the suffering and you'll never lack a congregation.&quot; There's a broken heart in every pew. Suffering is the common thread in all our garments. When Peter wrote his first letter to fellow believers scattered throughout Asia he focused on the thing that drew them all together-suffering. These people were being singed by the same flames of persecution that would take the apostle's life in just a few years. Their circumstances were the bleakest imaginable. Yet Peter didn't try to pump them up with positive thinking. Instead, he gently reached his hand to their chins and lifted their faces skyward-so they could see beyond their circumstances to their celestial calling. Some people instinctively know what to say to encourage others; they're the ones we look for when we're going through hard times... Jethro encouraged Moses (Exodus 18); Epaphroditus ministered to Paul (Philippians 2:25-30). Ask God to make you the kind of friend whose presence brings comfort and encouragement.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...God...will fulfil His purpose for me.' Psalm 57:2 NLT<br /><br /><p>The Bible is full of people who used their talents to bless others: musicians, masons, seamstresses, ship-builders, teachers, farmers, fishermen, authors, architects, artists, administrators etc. God gives '...each of us the ability to do certain things well...' (Romans 12:6 TLB) Yet much of what He gives us goes unrecognised and unused. Mac Anderson says: 'Making a living is not the same as making a life... You can't fake passion; it's the fuel that drives any dream and makes you happy to be alive...The first step is to know what you love. We all have unique talents and interests, and one of life's greatest challenges is to match [them] with career opportunities that bring out the best in us. Sometimes we only find it through trial and error-but it's worth the effort... James Audubon...changed locations, partners and businesses, yet failed and became bankrupt. Not until he understood he must change did he have any shot at success... He loved the outdoors and was an excellent hunter and artist. He travelled the country observing and drawing birds, and earned a place as one of the greatest wildlife artists ever. More importantly, the work made him happy and provided the peace of mind he'd sought all his life.' The Psalmist says, 'I cry out to God...who will fulfil His purpose for me.' Pray and ask for God's direction. Begin to list your strengths and weaknesses. Get feedback from people who will be honest with you. Once you find your God-given purpose, build your life around it, and '...do it all for the glory of God.' (1 Corinthians 10:31 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Weep with those who weep.' Romans 12:15 NKJV<br /><br /><p>In 1883, poet Ella Wheeler Wilcox was travelling by train to an inaugural ball when she noticed a woman weeping across the aisle. Wilcox spent the rest of the journey comforting her, and when she reached her destination she was in no mood to celebrate. Later, remembering the woman on the train, she wrote the opening lines to her famous poem <i>Solitude</i>: 'Laugh, and the world laughs with you; weep, and you weep alone.' Holly Vicente Robaina says: 'We laugh...play...and celebrate together. Why's it so difficult to cry together?...When friends hurt, Christians say, I'll pray for you... In some cases God heals and restores, but sometimes there's no miracle...only profound sadness.' CS Lewis wrote about losing his wife: 'Where's God?...Go to Him when your need is desperate and what do you find? A door slammed in your face, and a sound of bolting and double-bolting on the inside.' I don't think Lewis would have been comforted by, 'God loves you...I'll pray for you.' While it's great to exhort, we need to evaluate our words before we speak. Are we using 'encouragement' to ignore somebody's pain because we don't want to deal with it? Do we mean what we say, or are we just rattling off polite clichés? Do we expect our words to fix everything? Are we acting like we can do a better job than 'the Comforter'? When we promise to pray for somebody, do we check on them later? Ever wonder why Jesus wept at Lazarus' tomb? He could just have [told] the mourners, 'Everything's ok, folks. God loves you,' and raised Lazarus. Instead He showed His love by crying with them.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I take joy in doing Your will' Psalm 40:8 NLT<br /><br /><p>Embarking on a rafting trip with friends, author John Blumberg observed: 'We had a hard time getting away from shore...there appeared to be enormous momentum keeping us grounded. Slowly it got easier and we decided to relax. And it was during our moment of pause that reality set in concerning our ever-so-gentle-drift out to sea. We immediately...grasped for safety, one arm holding the raft, the other aggressively swimming. Twenty minutes later we'd made minimal progress. A lifeguard in a kayak appeared, and, comforted by his presence, we lightly commented about our distance from shore. But he wasn't laughing! Orange [markers] had warned us not to go beyond them, but we ignored them and drifted five times further out than we should. The lifeguard didn't leave, but he didn't assist us either. Forty-five minutes later I walked ashore...shaking from exhaustion.' We don't run away from our values, we drift away and wake up in places we never meant to. Sin is subtle; it lulls you into thinking you have it all together, then one day you discover you're in over your head. God's Word is our safety marker. David said, 'I take joy in doing Your will...for Your instructions are written on my heart.' The Hebrew word for 'heart' means <i>gut</i>. It was used like we describe the heart as the core of our emotions. David's thinking and emotions were so sharpened by Scripture, it settled '...deep within...' (GWT) As a believer, God's Word should be so ingrained in your heart that you want to do what's right, and 'take joy' in doing His will.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...When it prospers, you will...prosper.' Jeremiah 29:7 GWT<br /><br /><p>Are you at a place in your life and you'd rather not be there? Well, God has a word for you, but it may not be one you want to hear. It's the same word Jeremiah brought to his people when they were slaves in Babylon, far from everything near and dear: 'You're not going home anytime soon, so change your attitude, dig in and make the best of it. Buy homes, plant gardens, let your children get married...and in addition, pray for the peace and prosperity of the city where you're living because when it prospers, you will prosper.' (Jeremiah 29: 5-7 paraphrase) The Israelites were in exile because God had allowed them to be taken captive. So, could it be that you are where you are today because God placed you there to bless those around you? Instead of putting your life on hold waiting for circumstances to change, start sowing into other people's lives what you want to come back as a harvest in your own. Why? Because when they are blessed, you'll be blessed too! How do we know? Because Jesus said, 'Give, and it will be given to you...the measure you use...will be measured to you.' (Luke 6:38 NIV) Martha Washington said, 'I am still determined to be cheerful and happy in whatever situation I may be. I have learned that the greater part of happiness or misery depends upon our dispositions, and not upon our circumstances.' That sounds just like Paul: '...I have learned [to be] content in...every situation...' (Philippians 4:12 NIV) If you want to go from surviving to thriving, make the most of where God placed you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...always pursue what is good both for yourselves and for all' 1 Thessalonians 5:15 NKJV<br /><br /><p>VJ Smith writes: 'I don't remember the exact date I met Marty. Like a lot of people...the line I was in wasn't moving as quickly as I wanted and I glanced towards the cashier...an affable-looking man in his seventies. ...For the next few minutes I watched him. He greeted every customer with the usual, &quot;How's it going?&quot; Then he did something different-he actually listened. ...he would respond to what they had said and engage them in brief conversation. <i>I had grown accustomed to people asking me how I was doing simply out of robotic</i><i> conversational habit...I could [reply], &quot;</i><i>I just found out I have six months to live,&quot;</i><i> and someone would reply, &quot;</i><i>Have a great day!&quot;</i> Then...the old cashier walked round to the customers, extended his hand, looked them in the eye and said, &quot;I want to thank you for shopping here today. Have a great day.&quot; The looks on their faces were priceless. There were smiles and sheepish grins. All had been touched by this simple gesture... Some walked away, paused...and looked back...they couldn't quite comprehend what had just happened...I wanted to take him home and feed him cookies!...I'd been in that store a hundred times and never walked away feeling like that.' A marriage counsellor asked a couple to list each other's good qualities. The husband listed twelve. His wife couldn't think of any! The Bible says, 'Look for the best in each other, and always do your best to bring it out.' That's hard to do when you're looking for perfection and focusing on the other person's shortcomings. The Bible says, 'Love...keeps no record of wrongs.' (1 Corinthians 13:4-5 NIV) In other words, look for the best in them!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['O You who hear prayer, to You all flesh will come.' Psalm 65:2 NKJV<br /><br />
<p>Mark records, 'Very early in the morning...Jesus got up...and...prayed.' (Mark 1:35 NIV) Jesus made deposits each morning so that He could make withdrawals throughout the day. Many of us don't, and it shows! RA Torrey said, 'We are too busy to pray, and so we are too busy to have power. We have a great deal of activity, but we accomplish little.' The pastor of a mega-church acknowledged that for many years he knew more about prayer than he ever practiced. One day God interrupted his schedule and told him to explore, study, and practice prayer until he fully understood it. The results were life-changing. He writes: 'It has been twenty years since I began taking time to pray. My life has been transformed. The greatest fulfilment hasn't been the list of miraculous answers to prayer I've received, although that has been wonderful; the greatest thrill has been the quality of difference in my relationship with God. When I started to pray I didn't know what was going to happen. God and I used to be rather casually related to one another. We didn't get together and talk very much. Now, however, we get together a lot, not talking on the run, but carrying on substantial, soul-searching conversations every morning for a good chunk of time. I feel as if I've gotten to know God a lot better since I started praying.' Martin Luther said, 'I have often learned more in one prayer than I have been able to glean from much reading and reflection.' Do you want to know God better? Start praying!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life' 1 John 2:16 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Temptation enters through three doors: 'The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life.' That's how it entered the Garden of Eden. 'When the woman saw that the tree was good for food (the lust of the flesh), that it was pleasant to the eyes (the lust of the eyes), and a tree desirable to make one wise (the pride of life), she took of its fruit...' (Genesis 3:6 NKJV) Satan has no new tricks, he just dresses up the same old temptations in new attire. 'The lust of the flesh' is anything you recklessly go into debt for, manipulate for, or violate your integrity for. 'The lust of the eyes' has to do with your perception. By the time you start seeing clearly, you've lost a great relationship or walked away from an opportunity, only to look back and say, 'I was foolish. If only I'd waited.' 'The pride of life' is the most subtle, therefore the most dangerous. You need a certain amount of pride to succeed in life. So when does pride cross the line? When you start exalting yourself; when you neglect God and think your success is the result of your own effort; when you can't admit you're wrong; when you're willing to go all the way to the bottom, fighting and blaming others. Someone who cannot repent cannot be restored. After his affair with Bathsheba, David wrote, 'The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, You will not despise.' (Psalm 51:17 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I will...tell you...things you do not know.' Jeremiah 33:3 NIV<br /><br /><p>In tough times we've a tendency to lower our expectations. As a result we end up settling for less than God wants. The Bible asks, 'Is anything too hard for the Lord?...' (Genesis 18:14 NKJV) Now it's easy to answer, 'No!' But what you do next proves whether or not you actually believe that. Jesus said: 'If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.' (John 13:17 NKJV) To walk in God's blessing every day you must do what He tells you. And He may tell you to do something different! The problem is, we get attached to methods which worked in the past and keep going back to them. But by always looking to the familiar, you limit God. He's much greater than any proven method, and He's never predictable. His Word says, 'Call to Me and I will...tell you...things you do not know.' The Living Bible says, 'I will tell you some remarkable secrets about what is going to happen.' What an offer! When God decided that Moses would lead the children of Israel out of Egypt, Moses never questioned God's ability, he just questioned whether God could do it through him. What was God's answer when Moses complained that he wasn't an articulate speaker? 'Now go; I will help you speak and will teach you what to say.' (Exodus 4:12 NIV) God is neither enhanced by your strengths nor inhibited by your struggles. There's more He wants to do through you than what you've experienced so far. So have high expectations of God and respond in faith to whatever He tells you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I gave her time to repent...and she did not repent.' Revelation 2:21 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Paul told the church at Ephesus, '...I have not hesitated to preach anything that would be helpful to you...' (Acts 20:20 NIV) A surgeon saves your life by cutting out what threatens you, and God's Word does that with us. One of Christ's warnings to the church at Thyatira was: 'I gave her time to repent of her sexual immorality, and she did not repent. Indeed I will cast her into a sickbed, and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation, unless they repent of their deeds.' (Revelation 2:21-22 NKJV) When you are heading over a cliff's edge, someone who truly loves you will try to stop you. And nobody loves you like the Lord! But you cannot keep ignoring His warnings. The Prodigal Son's father welcomed him back home, but he still lost his family inheritance. Every day you live, you put another building block in place. What are you building? One day you will stand at the Judgment Seat of Christ. Paul describes it: '...the fire will test the quality of each man's work. If what he has built survives, he will receive his reward. If it is burned up, he will suffer loss; he himself will be saved, but only as one escaping through the flames.' (1 Corinthians 3:13-15 NIV) Your friends may think your disobedience is no big deal. But God, who knows the extent of your ultimate loss, will 'get in your face' and tell you to repent while you still have time. Today, if He is speaking to you about a certain issue, listen to Him! Obey Him!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...if anything is excellent or praiseworthythink about such things.' Philippians 4:8 NIV<br /><br /><p>If you're not moving closer to your dream, you may not be tenacious enough in your pursuit of it. And the key to greater tenacity is not necessarily working harder at the same things, but being willing to change. Change what? (1)<i>Your thinking</i>. Are you convinced you can't succeed? Do you describe yourself and what you're doing in negative terms? Are you afraid to get started because conditions aren't favourable? Do you stop trying to move forward when you don't have the resources you need? If so, you need to change your mindset, to break the cycle of negative thinking. (2) <i>Your perspective</i>. Do you have a short-term mindset? Are you expecting success in days, weeks, or months? The greater your assignment, the longer it's likely to take. So recalibrate your expectations and create a more reasonable timetable for yourself; otherwise, you'll live in frustration and defeat. That's not God's will for you. Paul's desire was '...that I may finish my race with joy...' (Acts 20:24 NKJV) God wants you to experience joy in the pursuit of your goal. (3) <i>Your ways</i>. How are things going in your personal life and in your home life? Are you ready to deal with the habits and hang-ups that stand between you and success? What can you do today that will bring you closer to your dream-no matter how small the progress? Author and publisher Robert Collier says, 'Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...If another believer is overcome... help that person...' Galatians 6:1 NLT<br /><br /><p>It's ok to confront somebody you believe is in the wrong, but not with a self-righteous attitude. When church leaders insisted a woman '...caught in the act of adultery' be stoned (John 8:4 NLT), Jesus replied, '...let the one who has never sinned throw the first stone.' (John 8:7 NLT) Ouch! Lisa Harper writes: 'Are we aware of other people's mistakes because they confided in us, or have we appointed ourselves the &quot;moral police&quot; to justify examining the blemishes in everyone else's behaviour? Is our ultimate goal to help restore prodigals, or do we have a hidden agenda to elevate ourselves by condemning those around us?... I've been confronted twice by other Christians, the first was a red-faced stranger who was furious with me for wearing knee-high leather boots with a short skirt to her church. She called me a &quot;Jezebel.&quot; The second was a good friend who tenderly pointed out my pride in a specific situation. The name-calling left a bruise on my soul; the compassionate rebuke turned me toward the forgiving arms of our Heavenly Father.' God alone has the perfect combination of holiness and mercy to stand in judgment of the human heart. The Bible says, 'If another believer is overcome by some sin, you who are godly should gently and humbly help that person back onto the right path. And be careful not to fall into the same temptation yourself.' 'The only One who was worthy to condemn us, chose instead to pardon us and, in light of our own sinner-saved-by-grace [status], when the Holy Spirit impresses you to confront someone who's messed up, do it with honesty, compassion and humility.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...Run in such a way as to get the prize.' 1 Corinthians 9:24 NIV<br /><br /><p>William Arthur Ward wrote: 'Believe while others are doubting. Plan while others are playing... Decide while others are delaying. Prepare while others are daydreaming. Begin while others are procrastinating. Work while others are wishing. Save while others are wasting. Listen while others are talking. Smile while others are frowning... Persist while others are quitting.' To win in life requires three things: (1) <i>You must start</i>. That may seem obvious, but many of us are stuck in the starting blocks waiting for something to get us going. What has God called and equipped you to do? Step out and do it, and He will empower you! (2) <i>You must give it your all</i>. Divers in the Olympics don't save all their effort for their final dive. They concentrate on nailing every single one, increasing their chances for a gold medal. Don't settle for mediocrity at any stage of life (Philippians 3:14). (3) <i>You must never quit</i>. In the 1992 Olympics, Derek Redmond of Britain was competing in the 400 metre race when he suffered a torn hamstring and fell. As the other runners breezed past him, he began to struggle to his feet. His father, whose face was covered with tears, suddenly ran down from the stands to help him up. Slowly, agonisingly, they made their way around the rest of the track and crossed the finish line as the stadium in Barcelona burst into thunderous applause. Redmond didn't win a medal, but he won something more important-the respect of the world. The Bible says, 'Run in such a way as to get the prize.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.' Proverbs 15:1 NIV<br /><br /><p>Have you heard about the fightin' immigrant who landed in Australia and announced, 'If there's a government here, I'm against it'? We smile, but 'harsh words stir up anger.' If you want to avoid conflict, don't create it. The key to getting along with people who are upset or who don't share your viewpoint is to relax and try to empathise. That doesn't mean acquiescing to their every whim. But when you are clear about your position, you can let them be who they are. When you are ok with who you are, you don't need to make others wrong in order to feel right. Not only is it naïve to expect everybody to see things your way, you must recognise that they have their own thoughts, opinions and feelings. Jesus said, 'Settle matters quickly with your adversary...while you are... with him.' (Matthew 5:25 NIV) Talking to him will help you understand his viewpoint. Do you then have to agree with everybody? No, but 'Do all...you can to live in peace with everyone.' (Romans 12:18 NLT) Are there times when you must defend your position? Yes, but don't go around with a chip on your shoulder looking for arguments. Sometimes Christians are the worst offenders; we think because our cause is just, it doesn't matter who gets caught in the crossfire. 'Sensible people control their temper; they earn respect by overlooking wrongs.' (Proverbs 19:11 NLT) Make up your mind to extend to others the same grace God has extended to you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil.' 1 John 3:8 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Have you ever watched one of those TV shows where the police show up, surprise the criminal and say, 'You're busted,' then put them in handcuffs and take them off to jail? That's what Jesus did to Satan. This word 'destroy' implies 'to come un-glued,' or 'to fall apart'. Imagine the mortar crumbling and the wall coming down, or the spool running out of thread so that when the garment is picked up it falls apart. On what basis would you like to fight Satan? By the power of your own intellect, or by the power of God's Word? By your own will, or by knowing God's will, standing on it and enforcing its terms? Ever turn on the lights in a dark room and watch cockroaches run for cover? You didn't do anything, you just turned on the light! Every wall Satan builds to keep you locked in crumbles when exposed to the light of God's Word. Satan's act literally comes un-glued. And it happens fast, because light travels at over 299,000 kilometres per second. Satan's greatest weapon is your ignorance of God's Word. That's why he will fight you over Bible reading more than most other things. Jesus said, 'You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.' (John 8:32 NIV) The truth itself doesn't set you free; it's 'knowing' the truth, standing on it in times of trouble and trusting God to do what He has said, that empowers you not only to survive Satan's attacks, but to triumph over him.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['You shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.' John 8:32 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Satan is a deceiver, but Jesus is a revealer. So any time you bring Jesus into the situation, Satan is unmasked and his plans for your life are exposed and foiled. Satan is referred to in Scripture as 'darkness' and Jesus as 'light'. (Acts 26:18) The moment the light moves in, the darkness has to move out. So your first priority is not to conquer Satan, but to move closer to Jesus; to line up your will and your word with His will and His Word. Instead of just lying down, taking it, and saying, 'I guess there's nothing I can do about this,' rise up in faith and say, 'Satan, it is written...' Faced with a level of temptation none of us will ever be exposed to, that's what Jesus did to Satan in the wilderness. The Bible says, 'Then the devil left Him, and behold, angels came and ministered to Him.' (Matthew 4:11 NKJV)</p>
<p>In recent years we've witnessed bankers and brokers take people's money, lose it, then later come back and say, 'Here's another good plan; invest in it.' But now we know better, don't we? We no longer believe an investment is good just because somebody says so. Don't miss the spiritual analogy here. When you know the truth of God's Word and you use it as a weapon, Satan's walls crumble, his plans for you come un-glued, and his schemes fall apart. When you understand who you are 'in Christ', you are more than a match for the devil and he can no longer control your life.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Be an example...in love' 1 Timothy 4:12 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Jesus said: 'Love your enemies, do good, and lend, hoping for nothing in return; and your reward will be great, and you will be the sons of the Most High. For He is kind to the unthankful and evil. Therefore be merciful, just as your Father also is merciful.' (Luke 6:35-36 NKJV) Such words bring us to our knees, for we fall far short of practising them. The pastor of a large church tells of being on an elevator with a drunk man who was throwing up. The pastor couldn't wait to get off. All the way to his room he kept criticising the man. Later that night God spoke to him and said, 'You laughed at him, but I loved him enough to die for him.' Watch your attitude! The same sunshine that melts the butter hardens the clay. When you constantly deal with people's problems, it will make you either callous or compassionate. In spite of His disappointment in people, Jesus never lost His sense of compassion. Love isn't a virus that you catch, it's a virtue you're supposed to practice every day. And there's a divine dimension to this kind of love. '...the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us.' (Romans 5:5 NKJV) You can't reach into the well of your own emotions to find such love; you can only take the love of God that's been poured into your heart and share it with others. And if you are to serve God successfully, you must have regular transfusions of His love.</p>

<alias><![CDATA[temptation-2]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[ 'Each one is tempted...' James 1:14 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Notice the three areas in which Satan tempted Christ: (1) <i>Provision</i>. '...Command that these stones become bread.' (Matthew 4:3 NKJV) This addresses one of our greatest fears-that if we don't look out for ourselves nobody else will. So Jesus says: 'Do not worry, saying, &quot;What shall we eat?&quot; or &quot;What shall we drink?&quot; or &quot;What shall we wear?&quot;...your Heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. But seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.' (Matthew 6:31-33 NKJV) (2) <i>Protection</i>. Satan took Jesus to the pinnacle of the temple and said, 'If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down. For it is written: &quot;He shall give His angels charge over you...&quot;' (Matthew 4:5-6 NKJV) This addresses another of our core fears-that God may not protect us. Satan whispers, 'You're on the pinnacle of success right now, but you could easily go over the edge.' When you start thinking like that-claim this promise: 'In the time of trouble He shall hide me in His pavilion...' (Psalm 27:5 NKJV) (3) <i>Position</i>. 'The devil took Him up on an exceedingly high mountain, and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. And he said to Him, &quot;All these things I will give You if You will fall down and worship me.&quot; Then Jesus said to him, &quot;Away with you, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only you shall serve.'&quot;' (Matthew 4:8-10 NKJV) Now, there's nothing wrong with wanting provision, protection and position. The temptation is to try and get them through your own devices and for your own ends.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Jesus was...tempted...' Matthew 4:1 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Christ's temptation in the wilderness answers these two questions: (1) <i>Who is tempted</i>? Everyone! If Jesus was tempted, you'll be tempted too. Now, you can be victorious over temptation, but you can't pray temptation away. Satan tried different approaches with Jesus and he will do the same with you. Being tempted doesn't mean you're not in the will of God, it just means that Satan doesn't give up his rule in your life without a fight. The battle begins the moment you decide to serve God, and the attacks come at you every day. So, 'Put on the full armour of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes.' (Ephesians 6:11 NIV) (2) <i>When are you tempted</i>? When you have an important role to play in God's plan you're a high-value target to the devil. Matthew records, 'Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.' (Matthew 4:1 NKJV) But notice what had just taken place before this: 'When He had been baptised, Jesus came up immediately from the water; and behold, the Heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting upon Him. And suddenly a voice came from Heaven, saying, &quot;This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.&quot;' (Matthew 3:16-17 NKVJ) So temptation is a compliment; it proves you are called by God. And it's also a confirmation; it's evidence that you are walking in His will. Following His temptation, we read, 'Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee...' (Luke 4:14 NKJV) The power of God's Spirit is with you too!</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Do not worry' Matthew 6:31 NKJV<br /><br /><p>If you let them, two things will rob you of your peace of mind: (1) <i>The past</i>. We all make mistakes-even the people you admire and think never make mistakes. The Bible says, 'For each one shall bear his own load.' (Galatians 6:5 NKJV) We all struggle in certain areas. We all say and do things we wish we hadn't said or done. 'So what can I do?' you ask. Ask God to forgive you, then trust Him to make it work out all right. He can do that. He can help you clean up your mistakes and grow stronger through them. For example, when you say something you shouldn't, instead of obsessing about whether or not you offended somebody, ask the Lord to let them know your heart was right even though you put your foot in your mouth. Trust God to work on them and give you favour. That way you don't have to spend the next several days feeling anxious, or cringe when you meet them. (2) <i>The future</i>. God won't meet tomorrow's needs until tomorrow comes. So when you are having an attack of the 'what if's', stop and consider these words from the lips of Jesus: 'Therefore do not worry, saying, &quot;What shall we eat?&quot; or &quot;What shall we drink?&quot; or &quot;What shall we wear?&quot; For after all these things the Gentiles seek. For your Heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. But seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.' (Matthew 6:31-33 NKJV) Victor Hugo said, 'When you have...accomplished your daily task, go to sleep in peace; God is awake!'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['This is the day the Lord has made' Psalm 118:24 NKJV<br /><br /><p>God determines the number of your days, but you determine how they are spent. The Psalmist said, 'This is the day the Lord has made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.' Yesterday is a cancelled cheque, tomorrow is a promissory note, today is all you've got. And you can begin your life over today, if you live by these words: 'Today I will delete from my diary two days-yesterday and tomorrow. Yesterday was for learning; tomorrow will be a consequence of what I do today. Today I will face life with the conviction that this day will never return, that it may be the last opportunity I'll have to contribute because there's no guarantee I'll see tomorrow. Today I will be courageous enough not to let opportunity pass me by; my only alternative will be to succeed. Today I will invest my most valuable resource, my time, into my most important possession, the life God has given me. I'll spend each minute purposefully, making today a unique opportunity. I'll tackle each obstacle knowing that with God's help I can overcome it. Today I will resist doubt and pessimism and warm my world with a smile. I'll maintain a strong faith, expect nothing but the best, take time to be happy, see every task as an opportunity to honour the Lord, and endeavour to leave His footprints on the hearts of those I meet.' John Boykin wrote, 'Time is your life-nothing more, nothing less. The way you spend your hours and your days, is the way you spend your life.' So pray, 'Lord, help me to maximise this day.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I desire to do Your will, O my God' Psalm 40:8 NIV<br /><br /><p>Often when we're starting out, we dream of doing earth-changing things and the thought of tackling them intimidates us. That is yet another reason to start small. Don't try to help everyone, just try to help someone! Do that, and in time you may find yourself living what Francis of Assisi described when he said, 'Start doing what is necessary; then do what is possible; and suddenly, you are doing the impossible.' Even if you never get to do big things, you can find great fulfilment in doing right things. No act of kindness is too small to be worth doing.</p>
<p>John Maxwell writes: 'Little did I realise when I started with a desire to add significance to others, that it would add significance to me! Now I understand. We should not receive anything without giving, and we cannot give anything without receiving.' The truth is, your dream isn't worthy of your life if it doesn't bless others. President Woodrow Wilson stated: 'You are not here merely to make a living. You are here in order to enable the world to live more amply, with greater vision, with a finer spirit of hope and achievement. You are here to enrich the world, and you impoverish yourself if you forget the errand.' There's an old Middle Eastern blessing that says, 'When you were born, you cried and the world rejoiced. May you live your life so that when you die, the world will cry and you will rejoice.' And that will surely happen if you live by the Scriptural truth, 'I desire to do Your will, O my God.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Be an example' 1 Timothy 4:12 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Andrew Murray wrote, 'God has no more precious gift...than a man who lives as an embodiment of His will, and inspires those around him with the faith of what grace can do.' When Paul writes, 'Be an example,' he means 'be a role model.' The first car off the assembly line is a prototype of all that follows. Dressmakers study the pattern, and then design the garment accordingly.</p>
<p>The word <i>ideal</i> sounds lofty, and it is. But even if you don't achieve the ideal, it should still be your goal. What Paul was saying to young Timothy was, 'When you talk about Jesus, people should see so much of Him in your life that they desire to know Him. When you talk about faith, the evidence of it should be so compelling that they want to live by it.' </p>
<p>Bruce Carroll sings: 'I'd rather see a sermon than hear one any day; I'd rather one should walk with me than merely show the way. Actions speak much louder than all that words can say. That's why I'd rather see a sermon than hear one any day.' Lectures may be wise and true but it's better for people to learn through seeing it lived out, rather than hearing words spoken. Words may be misunderstood but a life of love is difficult to misinterpret.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Be an example...in...speech' 1 Timothy 4:12 GNT<br /><br /><p>It's nice to say, 'Be an example,' but in what specific areas? For the next few days let's look at some of them: 'Be an example...in speech.' Go back and read what Paul says to Timothy before this: 'Don't let anybody look down on you because...' When you speak, your credibility is at stake. Solomon says, 'Do you see a man hasty in his words? There is more hope for a fool than for him.' (Proverbs 29:20 NKJV) The trouble with words is, once they're spoken their impact is felt either positively or negatively-and you can't take them back! You can say you're sorry, but you may have to rebuild your credibility with the person you spoke to, or about. Here's the litmus test for your words, and it's a high standard: 'May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing to You, O Lord...' (Psalm 19:14 NLT) A poet wrote: 'A careless word may kindle strife; a cruel word may wreck a life. A gracious word may soothe the way, a joyous word may light the day. A timely word may lessen stress, a loving word may heal and bless.' So today let your words be faith-building, for people battle with doubt and fear. Let your words be comforting, for people have wounds you cannot see. Let your words be uplifting, for people get torn down by criticism and discouragement. Let your words be calming, for God has promised to bless you if you are a peacemaker. And let your words be character-building; that way you'll leave people better off than you found them.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Be an example...in conduct' 1 Timothy 4:12 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Seneca, the Roman statesman, said, 'I govern my life and thoughts as though the world were to see one and read the other.' You can always predict what a person of integrity will do in two areas: (1) In business. Saying 'no' to your boss usually isn't a good career move. But when faced with a choice between his career and his convictions, Daniel refused to eat the king's meat because it was a violation of God's law (Daniel 1:8-17). Joseph refused to sleep with the boss's wife (Genesis 39:6-12). Elisha refused to accept a rich man's money in exchange for healing (2 Kings 5:1-16). Getting the idea? (2) At home. Noah saved his family from destruction by listening to God (Hebrews 11:7). And the first thing he did when he emerged from the ark was to build an altar. Think about that! Noah had an altar before he had a home. Most of us have homes, but no prayer altar, and it shows! Lot, on the other hand, lost his wife and his sons-in-law to the destructive influences of Sodom (Genesis 19:14-26). Today issues of character that once raised alarm don't even raise an eyebrow. But they should. '...I plead with you to give your bodies to God because of all He has done for you. Let them be a living and holy sacrifice-the kind He will find acceptable. This is truly the way to worship Him. Don't copy the behaviour and customs of this world, but let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think. Then you will learn to know God's will for you, which is good and pleasing and perfect.' (Romans 12:1-2 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Be an example...in spirit' 1 Timothy 4:12 NKJV<br /><br /><p>In Bible times, Jews looked down on non-Jews. They actually referred to them as 'dogs.' So when Christ's disciples went in to a Samaritan village to find accommodation for the night, they were turned away. How did the disciples handle this? With understanding? Not a chance! '...They said, &quot;Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from Heaven and consume them, just as Elijah did?&quot; But He turned and rebuked them, and said, &quot;You do not know what...spirit you are of.&quot;' (Luke 9:54-55 NKJV) Check your spirit! You can be totally unaware of your attitude toward others. You can even use Scripture to justify yourself. The disciples thought that because Elijah called down fire on his enemies at Mount Carmel, they should be able to zap these poor Samaritans. Amazing! Christ had just got through telling them: 'Blessed are you when men hate you, and when they exclude you, and revile you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of Man's sake. Rejoice in that day and leap for joy! For indeed your reward is great in Heaven...' (Luke 6:22-23 NKJV) Only as you read the Scriptures and pray, can God shine the spotlight on your hidden biases and help you correct them. Often the look on your face has more impact than the words you speak. You can be arrogant and think you're being assertive. You can be insensitive and think you're a truth-teller. You can be purpose-driven and convince people that their only value to you is in what they contribute. When it comes to your 'spirit', you need a regular check-up.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Be an example...in faith' 1 Timothy 4:12 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Having the faith required to get answers to your prayers is an important truth. But that's not what Paul is speaking about here. He begins the chapter saying, '...some will depart from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits...' (1 Timothy 4:1 NKJV) He warns, stay anchored to the truth, or you'll be caught in the undertow of error. Here's a fact that should alarm us: 90 percent of all those who end up in cults started out in mainline churches. How come? Because they weren't grounded in the truth of Scripture! They are like the guy who was asked, 'What do you believe?' He replied, 'The same thing my church believes.' When asked, 'What does your church believe?' he replied, 'The same thing I believe.' When asked, 'What do you both believe?' he replied, 'We both believe the same thing.' Bottom line: he didn't know what he believed! You say, 'But doesn't God have more truth to reveal to us?' Yes. 'The path of the just is like the shining light, that shines ever brighter unto the perfect day.' (Proverbs 4:18 NKJV) But God doesn't destroy the foundations of truth, He builds on them. Sometimes Bible teachers with fresh revelation act like 'the party started when I arrived!' That's ego, not anointing! We are not called to be tasters of experience, but testers of truth. We must honour the ministry, but understand that just because a preacher says it, doesn't make it so. The Bereans '...received the word with all readiness, and searched the Scriptures daily to find out whether these things were so.' (Acts 17:11 NKJV) You must do that!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Be an example...in purity.' 1 Timothy 4:12 NKJV<br /><br /><p>This word 'purity' refers to that which is not polluted. Pollution causes disease and death. The products on the grocery store shelf may be beautifully packaged, but when food-borne illness results, we must go back to the source and find the problem. What is it? Careless, cost-cutting methods that not only permit disease but promote it. Consider this: some of the things that entertain us today would have shocked our parents and grandparents. Is that because we are more enlightened? Look around you and judge for yourself! While living under his father's authority the Prodigal Son was well off. But in search of enlightenment and entertainment, he ended up in a pigsty. Yes, he was forgiven and welcomed back home, but he lost a lot in the process. Today the world of politics, education and entertainment are battling for your mind, your attention and your allegiance. So here's a Scripture you need to think about carefully: 'Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus.' (Philippians 2:5 NKJV) In other words, submit your thoughts to God. If He approves them-they're ok. Paul writes: 'We are human, but we don't wage war as humans do. We use God's mighty weapons, not worldly weapons, to knock down the strongholds of human reasoning and to destroy false arguments. We destroy every proud obstacle that keeps people from knowing God. We capture their rebellious thoughts and teach them to obey Christ.' (2 Corinthians 10:3-5 NLT) If you don't 'capture' wrong thoughts and submit them to the test of Scriptural truth, they'll lead you in the wrong direction.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Nor give place to the devil.' Ephesians 4:27 NKJV <br /><br /><p>Satan is a force you'll contend with every day. And he's a master at reinventing himself. The Bible says he can transform '...into an angel of light.' (2 Corinthians 11:14 NKJV) And while his approach may be appealing, his intent is always to '...steal and kill and destroy...' (John 10:10 NIV) Destroy what? Your peace of mind, your destiny, your relationships, etc. How can you defeat him? In two ways: (1) <i>Don</i><i>'</i><i>t</i> <i>fear him</i>. 'The Lord shall preserve you from all evil...' (Psalm 121:7 NKJV) Throughout the New Testament we read that as believers we are 'in Christ.' So to get at you, Satan must first go through Him! (2) <i>Don</i><i>'</i><i>t give him access</i>. 'Nor give place to the devil.' Satan has no place in your life unless you open the door and give him one. And when Christ is enthroned in your heart, there's no room for the devil. But it's not enough to have a clean heart, you must have a spirit-filled heart. Jesus said: 'When an evil spirit leaves a person, it goes into the desert, seeking rest but finding none. Then it says, I will return to the person I came from. So it returns and finds its former home empty, swept, and in order. Then the spirit finds seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they all enter the person and live there. And so that person is worse off than before...' (Matthew 12:43-45 NLT) The best way to break bad habits is to replace them with good ones. The best way to defeat Satan is to make Jesus Lord of your life.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Always abounding in the work of the Lord' 1 Corinthians 15:58 NKJV<br /><br /><p>In the New Testament the word 'abounding' means 'to overflow.' Today let's look at three 'abounding' Scriptures and see what we can learn: (1) <i>Abounding iniquity</i>. 'Because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.' (Matthew 24:12 KJV) The word 'iniquity' means 'lawlessness'. Do you remember your life before you met Jesus? You had no boundaries. You were ruled by your impulses. You'd go anywhere, do anything, and say whatever you pleased. Now, we're not bringing up your past to make you feel bad, but to make you grateful and to show you how far God has brought you. And what was God's solution to your sin problem? (2) <i>Abounding grace</i>. '...Where sin abounded, grace abounded much more.' (Romans 5:20 NKJV) God's grace cannot be earned or merited. And that's a good thing, because we were all spiritually bankrupt. But as Martin Luther said, 'The recognition of sin is the beginning of salvation.' It's feeling bad about your sin that leads to feeling good about God's grace. Do you remember the day Jesus found you, saved you, brought you into His family and showered you with His blessings? What should your response to such grace be? (3) <i>Abounding in the work of the Lord</i>. 'Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.' You were saved to serve! When you don't, you'll feel like a fish out of water. So pray: 'Lord, today I give myself fully to You, to be used in Your service as You see fit.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them.' Colossians 2:15 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Standing on the deck of a US aircraft carrier at the end of the Pacific war, in an historic moment never to be forgotten, General MacArthur walked over to Tojo, the Japanese leader, and publicly stripped him of all his symbols of power. And that's what Jesus did for you at the cross. 'Having disarmed principalities and powers, He made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them.' First, Tojo wanted peaceful coexistence, then compromise, then concessions. But he got none, because he was powerless. In a card game an opponent with an empty hand will try to bluff and bully you. But when you know you have a winning hand you can face him down, because knowledge is power. And your power over Satan comes from knowing that he's a defeated foe. He was once known as the anointed cherub, but now Christ is the Anointed One. He was once known as an angel of light, but now Christ is the Light of the World. He was once known as the morning star, but now Christ is the Bright and Morning Star. He was once a heavenly worshipper, but now Jesus says, 'In the presence of the congregation, I will sing Your praises.' (Hebrews 2:12 NIV) He was once known as one of the sons of God, but now Jesus declares, 'I am the Son of God.' Satan is called the prince of this world, but Jesus is the King of Kings and Lord of Lords. Satan is called a roaring lion, but Jesus is the Lion of the tribe of Judah who has prevailed over him (Revelation 5:5). Rejoice, Satan is defeated!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The serpent...asked the woman, &quot;Did God really say you must not eat?&quot;...&quot;Of course we may...&quot;' Genesis 3:1-2 NLT<br /><br /><p>The only power Satan has over you is the power of persuasion. 'The serpent...asked the woman, &quot;Did God really say you must not eat?&quot;...&quot;Of course we may&quot;... &quot;You won't die...God knows that your eyes will be opened...and you will be like God&quot;...The woman was convinced. She saw that the tree was beautiful and its fruit looked delicious, and she wanted the wisdom it would give her. So she took some...Then she gave some to her husband...At that moment their eyes were opened, and they suddenly felt shame...When the cool evening breezes were blowing, the man and his wife heard the Lord God walking about in the garden. So they hid from the Lord God among the trees. Then the Lord God called to the man, &quot;Where are you?&quot; He replied, &quot;I heard You walking in the garden, so I hid. I was afraid because I was naked.&quot;' (Genesis 3:1-10 NLT) Never forget that story! And keep this in mind also: Satan is a talker, and you'll never out-talk him. The power of persuasion is an incredible thing. The fashion industry can persuade you to take a wardrobe you paid a small fortune for last year, and replace it with what they're selling now. Clothes you felt good about then, you don't even want to be seen in now. The trouble is, in a few years' time the clothes you wore last year will be back in fashion; you'll be poor, and the fashion moguls will be rich. Temptation is all about persuasion. But if Christ has already persuaded you, Satan can't make you do anything.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He set free all who have lived their lives as slaves to the fear of dying.' Hebrews 2:15 NLT<br /><br /><p>For many of us, death is our greatest fear. One comedian quipped, 'I don't mind dying, I just don't want to be there when it happens!' But we can't joke away the sobering reality the Bible describes as 'the last enemy'. So what's the answer? Jesus! '...only by dying could He break the power of the devil, who had the power of death. Only in this way could He set free all who have lived their lives as slaves to the fear of dying.' (Hebrews 2:14-15 NLT) Until Jesus came, Satan used the threat of death. Until then we all lived in fear of it. But because of the resurrection, all Satan has left are the lies he can tell about death. The word 'destroy' implies 'to reduce to zero' (1 John 3:8). Wow! By His death and resurrection, Jesus reduced Satan's power to zero. And today Jesus says to you, '...Do not be afraid; I am the First and the Last. I am He who lives, and was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore. Amen. And I have the keys of Hades and of Death.' (Revelation 1:17-18 NKJV) After destroying the prison of death, Jesus came out and said to Satan the jailer, 'I'll take those keys,' then He went back to Heaven.</p>
<p>We grieve the loss of a loved one, and that's a healthy thing to do. But you can handle the grief when you know you can live through it, and that you'll be reunited in Heaven with your loved ones. So even in death, we win and Satan loses.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Walk in wisdom...redeeming the time.' Colossians 4:5 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Nothing is more costly than wasted time. Every minute lost is gone forever. Today we have more time-saving devices than any other generation, yet we seem to have less time. To get control of your life you must first get control of your time. That means redirecting each lost minute toward a worthy purpose. We all have things we want to do, plan to do, and feel bad about not doing. Understand this: the difference in who you are right now and the person you'll be ten years from now, will largely be determined by your relationships and your reading habits. And the first book you should read is your Bible, the world's greatest wisdom manual. Here's a suggestion that will help you: instead of having an 'all or nothing' attitude to Bible reading, seize your 'in between time'. You'll be amazed how the wasted minutes in each day and week add up to hours of productive time. J. Oswald Sanders gives us three great insights: (1) <i>Stop leaks</i>. Let us not consider our day only in terms of hours, but in smaller areas of time. If we look after the minutes, the hours will look after themselves. (2) <i>Set priorities</i>. Much time is spent on things of only secondary importance. We give such undue attention to petty details that matters of major importance are squeezed out. This is especially so where spiritual things are concerned. (3) <i>Start planning</i>. Without a plan we all tend to drift. So in the attitude of prayer, ask, 'How can I best plan today?' Buy up the spare minutes as eagerly as a miser hoards money.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Teach us to realise the brevity of life' Psalm 90:12 NLT<br /><br /><p>Gordon MacDonald gives us some of the traits of a disorganised life. See if you recognise any: '(1) <i>Appointments/messages/deadlines missed</i>. I know I'm disorganised when there are a series of forgotten appointments, telephone messages to which I have failed to respond, and deadlines which I have begun to miss. The day becomes filled with broken commitments and lame excuses... (2) <i>Unproductive tasks</i>. If I am disorganised I tend to invest my energies in unproductive tasks; there is a tendency toward daydreaming and avoidance of decisions that have to be made, and procrastination... (3) <i>Lack of intimacy with God</i>. Disorganised Christians rarely enjoy intimacy with God. No one has to tell them that time must be set aside for the purpose of Bible study and reflection, for intercession, for worship. They know all of that. They simply are not doing it. They excuse themselves, saying there is no time. But they know it is more a matter of organisation and personal will than anything else... (4) <i>Shallow personal relations</i><i>hips</i>. Days pass without a significant conversation with my son or daughter. My wife and I will be in contact but our conversations may be shallow. I may become irritable, resenting any attempt on her part to call attention to things I have left undone or people I appear to have let down. (5) <i>Lack of self</i><i>-</i><i>esteem</i>. When we are disorganised in our control of time we just don't like ourselves, our jobs, or much else about our worlds. And it is difficult to break the destructive pattern that settles in. This terrible habit pattern of disorganisation must be broken, or our private worlds will quickly fall into total disorder.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I must work...while it is day...' John 9:4 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Time is like money; it must be budgeted. That means determining the difference between the fixed<i>what you must do</i>-and the discretionary<i>what you would like to do</i>. What caused Jesus to be such an organised person? (1) <i>He understood His mission</i>. During His final walk toward Jerusalem where He would be crucified, His ears picked up the voice of a blind man and He stopped, much to the consternation of His friends. They were irritated that Jesus did not appreciate that Jerusalem was still six or seven hours away and that they would like to get there to achieve their purpose, the celebration of the Passover (Luke 18:35-42). From where they were standing, it appeared that Jesus was misusing His time. But from where Jesus was standing, the time was well spent for it fitted the criteria of His mission. (2) <i>He understood His limits</i>. He knew what we so often forget: that time must be properly budgeted for gathering inner strength and resolve in order to compensate for one's weaknesses when spiritual warfare begins. Knowing His limits, such private moments were a fixed item on Jesus' time budget. And it was hard for even those closest to Him to fully appreciate this. (3) <i>He had His eye on the future</i>. Jesus spent the majority of His time training twelve men. He said, '...I will build My church...' (Matthew 16:18 NKJV) How did He plan to build it? Through others. So, the way to maximise your time-is to keep your life's purpose before you at all times and evaluate each decision in the light of it.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I have come that they may have life...to the full.' John 10:10 NIV<br /><br /><p>Sometimes when we achieve the things we strive for, we find they're not very fulfilling. As we look back we realise that our greatest joy was not in the goal we reached, but in the growth we experienced on the way to it. Scientist Koichi Tanaka describes this phenomenon and how it can come about during the enjoyable pursuit of a dream. As he worked on trying to create an ion with lasers, he says: 'I failed for weeks and months before I succeeded in making an ion. Why did I continue the experiment? Because I enjoyed it. It was fun for me to come to know something that I had never known before, and that fun enabled me to persist.' That persistence helped him to win a Nobel Prize in chemistry. You have the potential to make many wonderful discoveries in life, and none greater than what you discover about God, and yourself.</p>
<p>Leadership expert John Maxwell writes: 'The pursuit of my dream has taken me out of my comfort zone, elevated my thinking, given me confidence, and confirmed my sense of purpose. My pursuit of the dream and my personal growth have become so intertwined that I now ask myself, &quot;Did I make the dream, or did the dream make me?&quot;' When your mind accepts a new idea or learns a new truth, it's forever changed. And once stretched, it takes on a new shape and never goes back to its original form. When that happens, you experience true fulfilment. No wonder children's book author Elizabeth Coatsworth said, 'When I dream, I am ageless.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let the words of my mouth...be acceptable in Your sight' Psalm 19:14 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Ernest Hemingway quipped, 'It takes two years to learn to speak and sixty to learn to keep quiet.' The Psalmist prayed, 'Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in Your sight, O Lord.' A sin most often tolerated in the church, and sometimes even condoned, is the sin of gossip. Jesus condemns careless words, saying they '...come from an evil heart...' (Matthew 15:18 TLB) And how about words we speak without considering their effect on others? If you think God just turns a blind eye, think again! Jesus said, '...on the Day of Judgment people will give account for every careless word they speak...' (Matthew 12:36 ESV) Your words create or destroy, discourage or inspire, heal or hurt, so choose what you say carefully. Careless words are often just the meaningless chatter we engage in when we've nothing worthwhile to contribute. And the more you speak them, the more likely they are to deteriorate into gossip and hurt people. Solomon writes: 'Even fools are thought wise when they keep silent...' (Proverbs 17:28 NLT) Would you trust someone who had a frivolous comment for everything? No? Then stop and think about what comes out of your mouth! Would you get more respect and cause less confusion if you kept it shut? Or were more discerning about the kind of stories you tell? Or thought twice before you 'shoot from the hip'? The Bible says, 'Let your speech always be with grace...that you may know how you ought to answer each one.' (Colossians 4:6 NKJV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Take over the land...flowing with milk and honey.' Deuteronomy 11:89 NIV<br /><br /><p>When they were slaves in Egypt, the Israelites had to pump water from the Nile River to irrigate their crops and put food on their table. Can you imagine slaving every day on an old foot pump just to get by? But then things changed for the better. God told them, '...Go in and take over the land...flowing with milk and honey...not like the land of Egypt...where you planted your seed and irrigated it by foot...' (Deuteronomy 11:8-10 NIV) There's a lesson here. You can reach a place in your walk with God where you get 'off the pump and into the flow'; where you stop 'sweating it', because God's goodness flows into every area of your life. But this promise is conditional-it's for those who obey God: 'Observe therefore all the commands I am giving you today, so that you may have the strength to go in and take over the land...' (Deuteronomy 11:8 NIV) Obedience is like having the right access code. It enables you to make withdrawals on God's blessing because you are walking in His will. We all want to live in the flow of God's blessing, right? Yet too few of us do. Who are these 'blessed' people? (1) Those who act on God's instructions. (2) Those who confront the giants of fear in their life. (3) Those that refuse to be swayed by the 'wilderness mentality' of others. (4) Those with the faith to say, 'The Lord...will lead us into that land...and will give it to us...do not be afraid...' (Numbers 14:8-9 NIV) And you can be one of those people.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I will...exchange their sorrow for rejoicing.' Jeremiah 31:13 NLT<br /><br /><p>Tom was very depressed following his wife Elle's death. For an hour he poured out his heart. Now, catharsis is good; it can show you what needs to be dealt with. But talk alone doesn't change anything. So his counsellor asked, 'If the situation was reversed and you'd died first, what would you want Elle to do?' Immediately he replied, 'Go on and enjoy life.' The minute he verbalised it a light within him came on and he said, 'I've been feeling sorry for myself too long. We both hated it when people did that. I'm going to live, find purpose, and get back to church.' He did, and the next time Tom and his counsellor spoke he had begun to rebuild his life. The pain was still there, but he'd started to transcend it by taking action. Freud taught that the subconscious mind could be freed from painful memories by psychoanalysis. But his premise was faulty because memories, good and bad, remain part of you. Plus, his theory can lead you to believe that your problems can be talked to death without ever having to do anything about them. Some people get through their grief faster than others; sadly, some never do. But you don't have to be one of them! God said, 'I will turn their mourning into joy. I will comfort them and exchange their sorrow for rejoicing.' God can reframe your past and give it meaning. He can help you to look back with gratitude, then forward with confidence. How? By transforming painful memories into powerful motivators and sources of future wisdom. Ask Him; He will show you how!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['He has...conveyed us into the Kingdom of the Son.' Colossians 1:13 NKJV<br /><br />
<p>The King James Bible says God has 'delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of His dear Son.' The New King James Bible says, 'He has delivered us from the power of darkness and conveyed us into the Kingdom of the Son.' In one version it says we were 'conveyed,' in the other it says we were 'translated.' Both translations are correct; each just gives us a different slant on the truth. Let's look at each: (1) <em>Conveyed</em>. When a buyer purchases a house, the deed conveys ownership into the buyer's name. 'You were bought at a price; therefore glorify God...' (1 Corinthians 6:20 NKJV) God owns you, therefore He has the right to send you anywhere and ask anything of you. (2) <em>Translated</em>. We translate books from one language to another. As a result the words sound different. Understand this: you live in the new Kingdom, so stop speaking the language of the old one! When God's Word says you 'can' and you say you 'can't,' it's a signal to Satan that he can influence you. Or worse, control you! Your new birth calls for a new language. The Bible says that the power of life and death are in your tongue. So to thrive in God's Kingdom and enjoy its benefits you must learn to say what God's Word says about each situation you face. This is not easy, and it's not learned overnight. But if you steep yourself in the Scriptures each day, you'll get to the place where your first response will be to quote God's Word. When that happens your life will change for the better.</p>

<alias><![CDATA[be-holy]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Be holy in all you do.' 1 Peter 1:15 NIV<br /><br /><p>Holiness isn't a subject we hear much about these days. So, what does it mean to 'be holy'? First, let's understand what it doesn't mean: (1) It doesn't isolate you from the world, it insulates you against its negative influences. (2) It's not a scorecard for deciding who's close to God and who's not. It's having a heart that's aware of your shortcomings and praying, 'As the deer pants for streams of water, so my soul pants for You, O God.' (Psalm 42:1 NIV) Holiness means to be set apart in a special and exclusive way, as in Holy Communion where the bread and wine are set apart from everyday use to honour Christ's death. Or holy matrimony, where a couple promises to be faithful to each other to the exclusion of all others.

I'd only the memory of our standing together three years earlier before God and a minister who'd pronounced us husband and wife, setting us apart exclusively to each other for the rest of our lives. We were wed in June 1955, but regardless of how long ago it was, we stood together and committed ourselves to a holy intermingling of our lives. To be intimate with another woman would break that holy relationship, that exclusive oneness. Remembering that helped keep me faithful while we were apart those many months, and it still helps forty-one years later!'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Through love serve one another.' Galatians 5:13 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Jacques Cousteau, the famous French maritime explorer, said, 'If a man for whatever reason has the opportunity to lead an extraordinary life, he has no right to keep it to himself.' Jesus lived that way. He said, 'I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd gives His life for the sheep.' (John 10:11 NKJV) To be like Him, you must live for something greater than your own interests. In his book <i>Half Time: Changing Your Game Plan from Success to Significance</i>, author Bob Buford says, 'The first half of life has to do with getting and gaining, learning and earning... The second half is more risky because it has to do with living beyond the immediate.' By that he means living for a cause greater than yourself, and for others beyond yourself. The great men and women in Scripture were not great because of what they earned and owned; they were great because they gave themselves to people and causes that lived beyond them. Their dream was to do something that benefited others. Only a rare minority of people are able to hold closely to their dream to make a difference, and are willing to give up everything to make that dream come true. Of people like that it will never be said that when they died, it was as though they had never lived. Their dream lives on after them, because they lived for others. And it was in living for others and not for self that they found their greatest joy and fulfilment. Charles Meigs wrote: 'Others, Lord, yes others; Let this my motto be. Help me to live for others, that I may live for Thee.'</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...He prayed that he might die' 1 Kings 19:4 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Sometimes after 'giving it your all', you can end up totally drained. Look at Elijah. God used him on Mt. Carmel to call down fire from Heaven on the prophets of Baal. Yet he fell apart under Jezebel's threats. Fleeing for his life, he '...sat down under a broom tree... and said, &quot;It is enough! Now, Lord, take my life...&quot;' The moment his focus changed from God to the enemy, he became overwhelmed. So God spoke to him again. This time it wasn't in a spectacular display. Instead, He spoke in a '...still small voice' (1 Kings 19:12 NKJV), drawing him aside to rest and spend time with God. The next time the nation saw Elijah he was spiritually on top again. So answer this: has your focus shifted from God to all the 'stuff you have to do'? If so, you need time out, time alone with God. When He calls you aside to rest, do it! Vic Pentz says, 'Nothing fails quite so totally, as success without God.' The two-fold danger in the aftermath of any success is: First, spending too much time listening to the accolades of others. Secondly, presuming you have what it takes to succeed on your own. As a result you disconnect from God, who is the source of your strength. David said, '...The Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?' (Psalm 27:1). Fearlessness is foolishness, unless it's based on faith in God. And one more thought: God sent Elisha to assist Elijah, and He can send the right person to help you too. He knows what to do to get you moving again.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Rise up...take courage and do it.' Ezra 10:4 NIV<br /><br /><p>Terry Fox ran across Canada and raised twenty-four million dollars to fight cancer. What's amazing is that he did it with one leg; cancer had taken the other. He planned to run forty kilometres each day but because of severe headaches, snow and icy roads, after a month he'd only managed to struggle about twelve kilometres a day. So why did he keep going? Because the purpose in his heart was stronger than the pain in his body. They could amputate his leg, but not his spirit! Commitment is a willingness to do whatever it takes; it's a promise to yourself, from which you refuse to back down. There's a difference between interest and commitment. When you're interested you do it only when it's convenient, but when you're committed you accept no excuses-only results. Only you can decide whether the rewards are worth the effort, for there are trade-offs. You can't have a healthy body and live on junk food. A guaranteed salary is nonexistent when you start your own business. Mindless hours of watching television and straight A's are a rare combination. Commitment means paying your dues. It also means disregarding your critics. Jesus did that. 'But Jesus ignored their comments and said...&quot;Don't be afraid. Just trust Me.&quot;' (Mark 5:36 TLB) Ralph Waldo Emerson said: 'Whatever course you decide upon, there will always be someone to tell you that you are wrong. There are always difficulties arising which tempt you to believe that your critics are right. To map out a course of action and follow it to an end requires courage.'</p>

<alias><![CDATA[questions-about-your-vision]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...The word of the Lord came...in a vision' Genesis 15:1 NKJV<br /><br /><p>God promised Abraham, '...in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.' (Genesis 12:3 NKJV) That's a big vision! But God knew Abraham had the faith to embrace it. If you hate what you have to do in order to pursue your vision, something is wrong. Examine your motives. See if there are inconsistencies between who you are and what you're trying to accomplish. Have you taken ownership of the vision? Do you have the heart for it? If pursuing your vision causes you to violate your values, then you need to get another vision. Maybe the problem is your attitude. (1) <i>Are you too idealistic</i>? You must accept the way your vision is unfolding, and change your expectations concerning how long it'll take. Ninety percent of all disappointments stem from unrealistic expectations. (2) <i>Have you stopped dreaming daily</i>? You must let yourself dream a little bit every day, explore possibilities and embrace options. Be creative. Continuing to dream actually helps you to move forward. (3) <i>Do you appreciate each small step of progress</i>? One way to feel fulfilled is to celebrate each success. Recognise when you pass milestones. Thanking God for your progress will encourage you to keep moving forward. (4) <i>Have you made personal growth your goal</i>? The only way to fulfil a big vision is to grow with it. The bigger the vision, the bigger you have to be to achieve it. What is God revealing to you in your current situation? How can you grow? The greatest reward of pursuing a vision-is who you become as a result.</p>

<alias><![CDATA[weathering-the-financial-shake-up-1]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Only the things that cannot be shaken will remain.' Hebrews 12:27 NCV<br /><br /><p>Writing about a recent conversation, Rick Hamlin says: 'Another guy like me said, &quot;I dread going to work. All these layoffs are depressing. I keep thinking I'm going to be next. I've got a lot of work, and my clients appreciate what I'm doing, but I start worrying and there's no stopping.&quot; Worrying is the worst of it... The stories are starting to pile up; friends, friends of friends, people from church, neighbours, parents of our kids' friends. An early retirement here, a downsizing there, a severance payment, a pink slip, all put faces on the statistics and that gnawing fear can make every day an agony.' The chances are, you may be feeling some shots of discouragement yourself-daily arrows of frustration that wear you down and steal your joy. Satan's like a terrorist specialising in guerrilla warfare. He knows he'd lose big time if he went against the forces of Heaven, so he singles out individual believers. The question is, how do you stand firm when 'everything that...can be shaken' is shaking? Well, for starters, Isaiah says, 'You will keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on You...' (Isaiah 26:3 NKJV) If Moses had focused on his circumstances, he'd never have had peace standing between the Red Sea and the Egyptians. His peace came from knowing he was where God wanted him to be. Peace in and of itself isn't the goal; peace is a by-product of knowing: 'How great is Your goodness, which You have stored up for those who fear [honour] You, which You bestow in the sight of men on those who take refuge in You.' (Psalm 31:19 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.' Psalm 23:1 KJV<br /><br /><p>If you're in debt and worried about your job: (1) <i>Don</i><i>'</i><i>t panic</i>. Turn to the source of all wisdom and read these words: 'The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.' Repeat it to yourself throughout the day. Tape it to your bathroom mirror where you'll see it first thing each morning. (2) <i>Take inventory</i>. '...know the condition of your flocks... [finances].' (Proverbs 27:23 NIV) Many people don't know how much they owe or what their expenses are. List your debts and fixed expenses, set a goal to live on what you earn, and put some toward debt reduction. (3) <i>Be disciplined</i>. Head off problems before they arise by conquering the demon of instant gratification. When you don't know the state of your finances you're less likely to apply the brakes, and end up spending money you don't have. (4) <i>Be creative</i>. When God created Paradise He watered it with four different rivers, so start looking for other streams of income. Walt Disney was fired by a big newspaper for lack of ideas. After auditioning him, MGM told Fred Astaire that he couldn't act and wasn't much of a dancer. Beethoven's violin teacher declared him hopeless as a composer! It takes faith to see the opportunities, and courage to overcome the obstacles. (5) <i>Be a giver</i>. Hard times are the wrong time to stop giving to God. During a famine a widow gave what little food she had to God's servant, Elijah. Result? '...there was food every day for Elijah and for the woman and her family.' (1 Kings 17:15 NIV) It's hard to explain rationally, but your giving turns on the tap of God's supply.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Tell the next generation.' Psalm 78:4 NIV<br /><br /><p>What a father says to his children in the privacy of home isn't heard by the world, but it's <em>clearly</em> heard by posterity. A mega-church pastor writes: 'Years ago I was invited to the White House to meet the President and a few key religious leaders. It was the first such invitation this country boy ever received. However, when I called home I discovered my son's basketball game was rescheduled for that weekend, and I'd already missed one. The question became one of simple priority, &quot;What's most important?&quot; The government had been running without me for years, so I called the White House and said I wouldn't be coming. (They recovered from the news beautifully!) I went to the game and had the fun of seeing my son shoot the winning basket.' Paul said, 'Be...careful...how you live...making the most of every opportunity.' (Ephesians 5:1516 NIV) How you spend your time reveals your <em>real</em> values and priorities. Dad, are you spending quality time with your children?</p>
<p>Karl Marx said that to conquer a nation you just have to block the transfer of values, morals and beliefs between generations. Solomon said, 'The righteous man walks in his integrity; his children are blessed after him.' (Proverbs 20:7 NKJV) Dad, before you know it, they'll be gone but what legacy will they take with them? Your kids are like mirrors, they reflect what they see and it's hard for them to see God as their <em>heavenly</em> Father unless He's clearly visible in their <em>earthly </em>one. So: '...bring them up with the discipline and instruction approved by the Lord.' (Ephesians 6:4 NLT) 'Tell the next generation...of...His power, and the wonders He has done.' If you don't; who will?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Who works out everything in agreement with...His...will.' Ephesians 1:11 AMP<br /><br /><p>WA Criswell noted that before a stone was laid in St. Paul's Cathedral, Sir Christopher Wren saw it in his mind. Before he struck a chisel against marble, Michelangelo saw the mighty Moses and purposed it in his heart. Why should it surprise us then that the designer and architect of the universe should have a plan and purpose for His creation? The Psalmist said, '...you wove me [together] in my mother's womb.' (Psalm 139:13 NAS) Before you were even conceived God considered everything that could affect your life, including '...the course of world events...' (Daniel 2:21 NLT), decisions of political leaders (Proverbs 21:1), and how much hair you'd have (Luke 12:7). Think about that when you're having a bad hair day! Dr. Robert Jeffress says: 'God's design not only includes circumstances beyond your control, but those you assume are under your control. You may think you're in charge of your time, the route you drive to work, the items you purchase at the supermarket but 'the Lord decides what a person will do.' (Proverbs 20:24 NCV) All your choices, not just the good ones. If your conception resulted from the pre-marital liaison of two hormonally-charged teens, an affair, or even a rape, after reading Psalm 139, could you really say your birth was an accident? Somehow God was able to use the moral failure of others to accomplish His plan. And if He can use other people's mistakes for good, why are we surprised that He can use our mistakes to achieve His purpose? It's a mind-boggling thought and one that offers hope to anyone who has failed.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Trouble produces patience' Romans 5:3 NCV<br /><br /><p>How do you develop patience? Through trouble! When your honesty seems to go unnoticed, when your hard work seems to go unrewarded, when your kindness is rendered without thanks, when your helping hand is offered and ignored, when even love is refused-that's when patience shines in all its beauty. Paul writes, 'Trouble produces patience.' You've seen this principle at work in the development of children. One child, overly shielded and protected, may grow up into a weakling without ambition and courage, destined to failure. Another, left to fight their own battles, to struggle, to learn through trial and error, may grow into near-perfect maturity. The same principle applies to the Christian life when you realise that each storm brings its blessings and each trial produces its rewards. Let's look at three practical benefits of patience: First, <i>patience brings hope</i>. 'Such things were written in the Scriptures long ago to teach us. And the Scriptures give us hope and encouragement as we wait patiently for God's promises to be fulfilled.' (Romans 15:4 NLT) Secondly, <i>patience produces spiritual fruit</i>. 'And the seeds that fell on the good soil represent honest, good-hearted people who hear God's word, cling to it, and patiently produce a huge harvest.' (Luke 8:15 NLT) Thirdly, <i>through patience you receive what God has promised</i>. 'Then you will not become spiritually dull and indifferent. Instead, you will follow the example of those who are going to inherit God's promises because of their faith and endurance.' (Hebrews 6:12 NLT)</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['The hearing ear and the seeing eye, the Lord has made them both.' Proverbs 20:12 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Dr. Howard Hendricks, a church growth expert, was once asked to diagnose the declining membership in a certain church. After attending service for several weeks he met with the board of elders and said, 'Put a fence around it and charge admission, so people can come and see how church was done in the 1950s.' In other words, you're hopelessly behind! When our ego is on the line, we have a tendency to put a positive spin on things while ignoring all evidence to the contrary. The danger is that over time we lose sight of what's actually happening around us. Good leaders refuse to do that; they're relentless in their quest to know the score. They root out misinformation and refuse to reward those who deliver it. In so doing they create a culture that's transparent concerning what is, and what isn't, taking place. To ensure that they live this way, they live by these seven commandments: (1) Thou shalt not pretend. (2) Thou shalt not turn a blind eye. (3) Thou shalt not exaggerate. (4) Thou shalt not shoot the bearer of bad news. (5) Thou shalt not hide behind the numbers. (6) Thou shalt not ignore constructive criticism. (7) Thou shalt not isolate thyself. Attempting to make progress while turning a blind eye to reality is like treading water; it can only go on for so long. Eventually you drown. Whether it's in your church, your business or your personal life, be willing to face the truth regardless of how painful it is. And if you don't like what you see-start changing it!</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Go and be reconciled' Matthew 5:24 NIV<br /><br /><p>Sometimes the only way to get over your hurt feelings is to seek reconciliation. And if you are willing, God will help you do it. Dinah Craik wrote: 'Oh...the inexpressible comfort of feeling safe with a person; having neither to weigh thoughts nor measure words, but pouring them all out, just as they are, chaff and grain together; certain that a faithful hand will take and sift them, keep what is worth keeping, and then, with a breath of kindness, blow the rest away.' A college professor who was teaching on the high cost of unforgiveness asked each of her students to bring a sack of potatoes to class. For each person they refused to forgive, they had to select a potato and write the date on it beside that person's name. Then for a month, without fail, they had to carry that sack of potatoes with them everywhere they went. After lugging those sacks around for a while each student began to recognise how much weight they were carrying; the amount of energy it took to focus on their bag; and that they had to be careful not to leave it in the wrong place. Eventually, as the potatoes began to rot and stink, they realised that getting rid of them was the only smart thing to do. Jesus said, '...If you forgive anyone his sins, they are forgiven; if you do not...' (John 20:23 NIV) What happens to them? Good question! How would you like God to forgive you in the same way you forgive others? If that thought makes you uncomfortable, do something about it!</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Just say a simple...no' James 5:12 NLT<br /><br /><p>When you don't learn to say no, you end up disliking yourself, as well as the people you are trying to please. In some cases we have difficulty saying it because we're afraid people won't like us. In other cases we believe that to be 'a good Christian' we must always say yes. Jesus said, '...Let...your no be [a simple] no, so that you may not sin...' (James 5:12 AMP) Only when you have the courage to say no will you mature, be able to address your own unmet needs, and start respecting yourself. And in time, others will too. So do these three things: (1) <i>Think before you respond</i>. If you need to, say, 'Can I get back to you?' Don't make commitments without consulting God, your calendar, and your family. 'If you need wisdom, ask our generous God, and He will give it to you...' (James 1:5 NLT) ( 2) <i>When your plate</i><i>'</i><i>s full, say so</i>. Responding to so-called emergencies caused by somebody else's poor planning and sloppy habits won't do either of you any good. Limit what you say yes to, then stick with it. Don't take on more because you feel pressured, guilty or indispensible. You'll discover that you're only indispensible until you say no-or die! (3) <i>Go with your gifts</i>. God has given each of us unique talents. If you've to choose between singing in the choir or sitting on the finance committee, go where your talents will be best utilised. Is this always easy? No, but unless you learn to do it you'll end up investing too much time and energy in what seems urgent, and neglect what's important.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I sought for a man...who would...stand in the gap' Ezekiel 22:30 NKJV<br /><br /><p>JA Wallace said, 'Prayer...moves the hand that moves the world.' So you must give prayer its rightful place in your life-first place. In <i>Glorious Intruder</i>, Joni Eareckson Tada writes about Diane, who suffers from multiple sclerosis: 'In her quiet sanctuary Diane turns her head slightly on the pillow towards the cork board on the wall. Her eyes scan each thumb-tacked card. Each photo. Each torn piece of paper, carefully pinned in a row. The stillness is broken as Diane begins to murmur. She's praying. Some would look at her, stiff and motionless, and shake their heads: what a shame, her life has no meaning. But Diane is confident, convinced that her life is significant and that her labour of prayer counts. She moves mountains that block the paths of missionaries. She helps open the eyes of the spiritually blind in South East Asia. She pushes back the kingdom of darkness that blackens the alleys and streets of the gangs in east LA. She aids homeless mothers, abused children, despondent teenagers, and dying forgotten old people in the nursing home down the street from where she lives. Diane is an intercessor! She has heard the call of God, &quot;I sought for a man among them who would make a wall, and stand in the gap before me on behalf of the land.&quot;' So Diane is on the front lines advancing the Gospel of Christ, holding up weak saints, inspiring doubting believers, and delighting her Lord and Saviour. Are you 'standing in the gap' for someone today? Be encouraged. Your prayers will move God and He will come through for you. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...he struck three times, and stopped.' 2 Kings 13:18 NKJV<br /><br />
<p>When threatened by the Assyrian army, Israel's king turned to the prophet Elisha for help. Elisha told him to take some arrows and keep striking them on the ground. But the king did it only three times and stopped. So Elisha was angry with him and said, '...You should have struck five or six times; then you would have struck Syria till you had destroyed it! But now you will strike Syria only three times.' (2 Kings 13:19 NKJV) This is a story of partial victory, of what might have been if the king had put more into it. You see, it's not just the opportunity-it's often the attitude that meets the opportunity that determines the outcome. God will give you chances to win, but it's your commitment that determines the size of your victory. Paul writes, 'Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not men.' (Ephesians 6:7 NIV) The clock meant nothing to Paul because he was on a mission. 'I consider my life worth nothing to me, if only I may...complete the task the Lord Jesus has given me...' (Acts 20:24 NIV) People of impact live with that mindset. So here's the question: 'Is your heart in what you're doing? Are you giving it your all?' When Paul Hogan, who portrayed the movie character Crocodile Dundee, was asked how he became successful, he answered, 'The secret of my success is that I bit off more than I could chew, and chewed as fast as I could.' Visions don't come cheap or easy. The bigger your vision, the bigger the price-tag. The secret to fulfilling your vision is-just keep chewing!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Jesus, knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said...&quot;It is finished!&quot;' John 19:28-30 NKJV<br /><br /><p>From the moment of His birth to the hour of His death, Christ's life was predicted in detail by Old Testament prophets. He fulfilled about <i>forty</i> different prophecies during His lifetime. Statistically, the chances of that happening are less than one in a trillion! Why is it important to point this out? Because voices are being raised that question His virgin birth, His deity, His miracles, His resurrection, and His soon return. Evidently the same folks were around when Peter lived. He writes: 'I will work hard to make sure you always remember these things after I am gone. For we were not making up clever stories when we told you about the powerful coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. We saw His majestic splendour with our own eyes when He received honour and glory from God the Father. The voice from the majestic glory of God said to Him, &quot;This is My dearly loved Son, who brings Me great joy.&quot; We ourselves heard that voice from Heaven when we were with Him on the holy mountain. Because of that experience, we have even greater confidence in the message proclaimed by the prophets. You must pay close attention to what they wrote, for their words are like a lamp shining in a dark place-until the Day dawns, and Christ the Morning Star shines in your hearts. Above all, you must realise that no prophecy in Scripture ever came from the prophet's own understanding, or from human initiative. No, those prophets were moved by the Holy Spirit, and they spoke from God.' (2 Peter 1:15-21 NLT)</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Jesus said, &quot;Take away the stone.&quot;' John 11:39 NKJV<br /><br /><p>A big stone blocked the entrance to the tomb of Lazarus. And before Christ raised him from the dead, He said, 'Take away the stone.' There's a lesson here. God will restore what you've lost-when you're willing to remove the hindrances that stand in the way. What was behind that stone? A corpse, and it was stinking! John writes: 'If our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence toward God.' (1 John 3:21 NKJV) Your confidence in approaching God comes from knowing you've dealt with the stuff that separates you from Him. And it requires courage. But you'll never experience new life until you're willing to do it. God can give you back what life has taken. He can restore what you've lost. But only if you're willing to face the truth. </p>
<p>King David caused a big stink: adultery and murder. Now your issues may not smell that bad but before God can answer your prayer you must acknowledge them. A more contrite and consecrated David wrote: 'If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear. But certainly God has heard me; He has attended to the voice of my prayer.' (Psalm 66:18-19 NKJV) </p>
<p>This is why when you counsel an addict it's not just about what they're addicted to, but about what they're trying to cover up with their addiction. It may take months or even years of therapy, but change begins only when you're willing to 'take away the stone' and allow God to deal with what's behind it.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Launch out into the deep.' Luke 5:4 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Dr Robert Schuller's hobbies include raising koi fish. Asked why some grow big while others stay small, he replied, 'If a koi fish lives in a small tank it will never grow longer than five or six centimetres. In a larger pond they can grow up to 25 centimetres long-in ponds the size of mine they'll get to be 45 centimetres long-but if they live in a huge lake where they can swim and stretch, they can grow up to a metre long. The size of the pond determines the size of the fish. Similarly, little ideas in little-thinking minds produce little achievements. But little ideas embraced by big-thinking minds produce enormous achievements.' Jesus said, 'According to your faith be it unto you.' (Matthew 9:29 KJV) The size of your faith and your vision determines the outcome of your idea. Edison had to install electric lights for free in an office building before anyone even came to look at them. The first sewing machine invented was destroyed by a mob in France. Morse waited for ten years before the world showed any interest in his telegraph. And when the idea of travelling by railroad was introduced, people scoffed because it was widely believed that travelling at 50 kph stopped blood circulation in the human body. Ronald E. Osborn said, 'Undertake something difficult; it will do you good. Unless you try something beyond what you have already mastered, you'll never grow.' You attain in direct proportion to what you attempt, which is why Jesus said to His disciples: 'Launch out into the deep.'</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...I have...determined to do His will...' Isaiah 50:7 NLT<br /><br /><p>Isaiah said, 'I have set my face like a stone, determined to do His will.' You'll never have real success with anything until you become passionate about it. The Psalmist wrote, 'My heart is steadfast...' (Psalm 57:7 NKJV) The word 'steadfast' means to have a commitment that's as strong as rock. Henry Ford was passionate about automobiles. Thomas Edison was passionate about light. The Wright Brothers were passionate about flying. Paul was passionate about evangelism. You will only be remembered in life for what you were passionate about. The ultimate example is Jesus. Standing before Pilate, who tried to judge Him, Jesus said, '...For this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world...' (John 18:37 NIV) Twenty centimetre thorns would crush His brow. A spear would puncture His side. Spikes would be driven into His hands. Thirty-nine stripes would tear His back to shreds. What He felt most passionate about could only be achieved through pain. </p>
<p>You may feel insignificant. You may have to start out small. But when what you love begins to consume your mind, your thoughts, your conversation and your schedule-then you are headed for success. Do you dread going to work? Do you watch the clock? Does your mind wander to other places and things you would rather be doing? Then you won't succeed. Find something you feel passionate about, something that energises you, something worthy of building your life around. Jesus did and He won the world.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be kindly affectionate to one another...' Romans 12:10 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Often the reason a relationship fails is not because of a difference of opinion, but a lack of understanding. Why aren't we more understanding? For three reasons: (<i>1) Selfishness.</i> Somebody quipped, 'There are two sides to every question-as long as it doesn't concern me personally.' Paul writes: 'Be kindly affectionate to one another with brotherly love, in honour giving preference to one another.' (<i>2) Fear.</i> Prejudice is often the fear of what we're unwilling to try and understand. When it comes to new ideas you've two options: open your mind and grow, or reject them and stay the same size. We tend to compare what we don't understand with what we think we do-like the people who told Columbus the earth was flat. When it comes to building relationships you've got to be willing to do what you've not yet done. (<i>3) Differences.</i> It takes more than one colour to make a rainbow and more than one musician to make an orchestra. When you take time to appreciate the differences in people, you discover we all share the same hopes and fears. Harry Truman said, 'When we understand the other fellow's viewpoint and what he's trying to do, nine times out of ten he's just trying to do right.' Basically, we all share the same hopes and fears. Two of our most common problems are 'gift-envy' and 'gift-projection'. One happens when we compare our talents with others and feel inferior. The other happens when we expect others to feel equally passionate about what we do. The Bible says, 'There are different kinds of service...but we serve the same Lord.' (1 Corinthians 12:5 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus.' Philippians 2:5 NIV<br /><br /><p>Paul wrote: 'Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus: Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, but made Himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant...' (Philippians 2:5-7 NIV) In order to serve God you must focus on others rather than yourself. Much of what we do is self-serving. We serve to be admired, or to achieve our own goals. Some of what we do is more manipulation than ministry. We're really thinking about ourselves and how noble and wonderful we are. We even use serving as a bargaining tool: 'God, I'll do this for You if You'll do that for me.' No, true servants don't use God for their purposes, they let God use them for His. God is always more interested in your attitude than your achievements. King Amaziah lost God's favour because 'He did what was right in the sight of the Lord, yet not with a true heart.' (2 Chronicles 25:2 NRS) Self-forgetfulness is a daily struggle, a lesson we must learn over and over. You can measure your servant's heart by how you respond when others treat you like a servant. How do you react when you feel taken for granted, bossed around or treated as an inferior? Jesus said, '...If one of the occupation troops forces you to carry his pack one mile, carry it two...' (Matthew 5:41 GNT) You say, 'It's not fair. I keep giving to this person but they never give back.' Just keep serving, knowing '...the Lord will reward everyone for whatever good he does...' (Ephesians 6:8 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Serve the Lord with gladness...' Psalm 100:2 KJV<br /><br /><p>Paul writes: 'When people commend themselves, it doesn't count for much. The important thing is for the Lord to commend them.' (2 Corinthians 10:18 NLT) If your self-worth is based on anything other than God's approval, you won't serve with the right motives. Insecure people worry about how they'll be perceived by others. They hide their weaknesses beneath layers of protective pride. The more insecure you are, the more you need people to serve you, and the more you work for their acceptance. One Bible scholar writes: 'In order to be of service to others we must die to them; that is, we have to give up measuring our meaning and value by the yardstick of others...Thus we become free to be compassionate.' Your service should not be based on the response of those you are serving, but on obedience to God alone. True servants of God don't insist on having lofty titles. If their job description calls for it, they wear that badge with humility. Paul, the greatest of the apostles, wrote: 'You may brag about yourself, but the only approval that counts is the Lord's approval.' (2 Corinthians 10:18 CEV) If anybody had a chance to name-drop, it was James the half-brother of Jesus. What credentials; imagine growing up with Jesus as your brother! Yet he simply referred to himself in Scripture as 'a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ...' (James 1:1 KJV) Your service to Christ should be both your job and your joy: 'Serve the Lord with gladness.' Can you imagine what would be accomplished if we all got serious about our role as servants-and did it joyfully?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['What the law was powerless to do...God did by sending His own Son...' Romans 8:3 NIV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says: 'A certain ruler asked Him, saying, &quot;Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?&quot; So Jesus said...&quot;Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in Heaven; and come, follow Me.&quot; But when he heard this, he became very sorrowful, for he was very rich.' (Luke 18:18-23 NKJV) This man had already achieved the three P's of success: power, prosperity and prestige. He was a bottom-line guy: 'What must I do?' Even the way he worded the question suggests he thought he could get eternal life the way he'd gotten everything else-by self-effort. He mistakenly assumed that Heaven was just a payment away, but it's not. Only a cold-hearted God would sell salvation to those who can afford it. That's a hard concept to grasp since we're rewarded for our performance. But just as you wouldn't impress Picasso with your crayon sketch, so your character and good works don't qualify you for Heaven. Eternal life costs more than you can afford. That's why you don't need a résumé, you need a redeemer. Money wasn't this man's problem, self-sufficiency was. It wasn't his income that kept him out of God's Kingdom, but his ego. And it's not just the wealthy who have difficulty grasping this-so do the educated, the strong, the good-looking, the popular and even the religious. To receive salvation you must first acknowledge that you're spiritually bankrupt, your cupboard bare and your reputation worthless. You can't approach God demanding justice-you can only come pleading for mercy. And if you come today, that's what you'll get!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Faith without deeds is dead.' James 2:26 NIV<br /><br /><p>One day a man trying to lose weight stepped on the bathroom scales. His wife asked, 'How are you doing?' He replied, 'Ok, just one problem; according to these scales I ought to be 20 cm taller.' When it comes to demonstrating true discipleship, James puts us all on the scales: (<i>1) When it comes to feeding the hungry:</i> 'Suppose you see a brother or sister who has no food or clothing, and you say, &quot;Good-bye and have a good day; stay warm and eat well&quot;-but then you don't give that person any food or clothing. What good does that do? So you see, faith by itself isn't enough. Unless it produces good deeds, it is...useless.' (James 2:15-17 NLT) (<i>2) When it comes to loving people and treating them with respect: </i>'Suppose someone comes into your meeting dressed in fancy clothes and expensive jewellery, and another comes in who is poor and dressed in dirty clothes. If you give special attention and a good seat to the rich person, but you say to the poor one, &quot;You can stand over there, or else sit on the floor&quot;-well, doesn't this discrimination show that your judgments are guided by evil motives?' (James 2:2-4 NLT) (<i>3) When it comes to caring for the needy:</i> 'Pure and genuine religion in the sight of God the Father means caring for orphans and widows in their distress...' (James 1:27 NLT) Get your doctrine out of the deep freeze! Take your theology off the drawing board and start using it in a practical way. Come on-weigh yourself on these scales.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...I chose you...to go and bear fruit-fruit that will last...' John 15:16 NIV<br /><br /><p>Before leaving this world Jesus took His disciples aside to prepare them for the problems they would face after He was gone: 'I am the vine; you are the branches...apart from Me you can do nothing...I chose you...to go and bear fruit-fruit that will last.' (John 15:5&amp;16 NIV) Here Jesus teaches us two important things: (<i>1) You only discover who you are, in relationship to Christ.</i> 'Apart from Me you can do nothing.' When you forget that, you end up trying to do things only God can do, like solving your problems your own way or promoting yourself through clever strategies. You're not blessed in any endeavour because of your performance; you're blessed because of your connection to Christ. Unless you understand that, you'll waste your time chasing people who have no more power than you do. Your strength and success are in Christ, the Vine, so stay connected! (<i>2) Before you get the fruit that remains, you lose the fruit that's temporary.</i> 'He cuts off every branch that...bears no fruit.' (John 15:2 NIV) You can be a good branch, connected to a good vine, bearing good fruit, and suddenly God starts cutting back certain things in your life. Things you thought would always be there are taken away; now it feels like you're going backwards. It takes faith to believe that God would permit you to lose what you're proud of, and what you draw your security from in order to give you something better-fruit that lasts, enduring success. So, difficult though it may be, let it go. God has something better in mind for you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...God...will fulfil His purpose for [you].' Psalm 57:2 NLT<br /><br /><p>If you've been praying for God to send you the right partner or for a better job, or to change the heart of a rebellious child, remember, whether He changes the situation or changes you, He 'will fulfil His purpose for [you].' God sees the big picture, and He loves you so much that He works out 'all things for good in your life' (Romans 8:28). One author writes: 'It's hard to make sense of life's challenges when you're in the middle...you're too tired, your perspective's limited...you don't have the strength or vision to do this on your own... &quot;Trust the Lord with all your heart, and do not rely on your own understanding&quot; (Proverbs 3:5 GWT) means letting go of floundering attempts to manipulate people, circumstances or timing...and returning the reins to the One who knows the way. Think about it; if you knew what you were doing, would you be in this mess? We talk about waiting on God. But He also waits on us...until we're ready to receive...until we appreciate what we're asking for...until we've made sufficient preparations in our heart...until we're free from resentment and discontent...until our maturity level is appropriate and our understanding elevated...Sometimes He waits until we think He's forgotten us just to test and grow our faith... Remember, &quot;...With the Lord a day is like a thousand years...&quot; (2 Peter 3:8 NIV) Eternity is His backdrop...and He can solve a problem in a minute, or in two generations.' Isaiah says, 'The Lord longs to be gracious to you...Blessed are all who wait for Him!' (Isaiah 30:18 NIV) Wait! Don't get ahead of God and you'll experience His best.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I gave her time to repent, but she would not.' Revelation 2:21 NLT<br /><br /><p>God's patience is amazing! In one of the most extraordinary examples of it, He gave Jezebel time to repent. When her wicked husband Ahab humbled himself, God healed and restored him. Humbling yourself before God will turn things around in your life when nothing else will work. James writes: 'Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and He shall lift you up.' (James 4:10 KJV) Humble yourself- don't wait for God to do it! </p>
<p>The Bible says: 'Do not make light of the Lord's discipline, and do not lose heart when He rebukes you, because the Lord disciplines those He loves, and punishes everyone He accepts as a son.' (Hebrews 12:5-6 NIV) Notice two important statements in this Scripture: </p>
<p>(1) 'Do not make light of the Lord's discipline.' A 'nobody's going to tell me what to do' attitude cost Jezebel dearly, and it will cost you too! </p>
<p>(2) 'Do not lose heart when He rebukes you.' Don't see God's correction as rejection, see it as proof that you're His child and that He has great plans for you. Paul considered himself a bondservant to Christ. To be bonded means to be bound by certain obligations. In the Old Testament, God marked His priests by putting blood on the lobe of their right ear, the thumb of their right hand, and the big toe of their right foot. So the word for today is-your hearing, your talents, and your walk must honour God! As a bondservant to Christ, you can't 'do your own thing'; you're called to walk according to His instructions. If you're not-repent and get right with God! </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Are you in health, my brother?' 2 Samuel 20:9 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The principles of God's Word work like spiritual vitamins. For the next few days let's look at some:<i> never excuse in yourself what you accuse in others.</i> King David did that. In confronting him over his sin with Bathsheba, Nathan the prophet told David a story about two men. One had many cattle; the other had only one lamb. When a guest came to the rich man's house for dinner, he took the poor man's lamb. 'David's anger was greatly aroused against the man, and he said, &quot;...the man who has done this shall surely die! And he shall restore fourfold for the lamb...because he had no pity.&quot; Then Nathan said to David, &quot;You are the man!&quot;' (2 Samuel 12:5-7 NKJV) Nathan continued: &quot;Thus says the Lord God of Israel...I gave you your master's house and your master's wives...And if that had been too little, I also would have given you much more!...You have killed Uriah [Bathsheba's husband]...with the sword; you have taken his wife to be your wife...Now therefore, the sword shall never depart from your house...&quot;' (2 Samuel 12:7-10 NKJV) David didn't know it, but he pronounced his punishment with his own lips: 'He shall restore fourfold.' And David did. First, the child he fathered with Bathsheba died. Second, his son raped his daughter and he didn't have the moral authority to deal with it. Third, Absalom, the beloved son destined to inherit his throne, fomented war and died at the hands of his own people. Fourth, civil war broke out in Israel and thousands of people died as a result. The lesson is clear: never accuse in another what you excuse in yourself. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Are you in health, my brother?' 2 Samuel 20:9 NKJV<br /><br /><p>N<i>ever take God for granted.</i> Don't become so familiar with spiritual things you become contemptuous of them. Samson did that and he paid dearly. After discovering the secret of his strength: '[Delilah] lulled him to sleep on her knees, and called for a man and had him shave off the seven locks of his head...and his strength left him. And she said, &quot;The Philistines are upon you, Samson!&quot; So he awoke from his sleep... &quot;I will go out as before, at other times, and shake myself free!&quot; But he did not know that the Lord had departed from him. Then the Philistines took him...' (Judges 16:19-21 NKJV) It's a story of tragedy. Samson was born to lead Israel to victory. But instead he gave in to his lowest impulses, consorted with the enemy and thought he could get away with it. Listen to him: 'I will go out as before, at other times.' But this was one time too many. His disobedience hadn't robbed him of his supernatural strength before, but it did this time. He crossed a line and ended up losing his sight, his strength, his liberty, his credibility and his usefulness. Eventually he died a prisoner of the Philistines. You say, 'Today's devotion sounds a bit harsh.' No, it's protective! The Bible says, 'The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom...' (Proverbs 9:10 KJV) When you persist in disobeying what you know God has told you to do and think you can escape the consequences, you're headed for trouble.

<introtext><![CDATA['...Are you in health, my brother?' 2 Samuel 20:9 NKJV<br /><br /><p>N<i>ever allow life's disappointments to make you cynical.</i> If you live long enough people will disappoint you, including your family. Even spiritual leaders will let you down! Paul wrote: 'We wanted to come to you-even I, Paul, time and again-but Satan hindered us.' (1 Thessalonians 2:18 NKJV) Did you think Satan was going to send you a congratulatory card because you decided to serve the Lord? Not a chance! The walk of faith is one of delight-and difficulty. When you signed on for the first, you signed on for the second. Paul was on a sixteen-month missionary journey-one of miracles and church-building. But he ended up in prison on trumped-up charges and was left to rot there. How did he respond? 'Rejoice in the Lord always. Again I will say, rejoice!' (Philippians 4:4 NKJV) You say, 'How can somebody rejoice in prison?' When you see your disappointment as God's appointment, you start to understand its purpose. Paul had books to write that would change the world, so God needed to get him 'off the road'. Listen to what he wrote from prison: 'I want you to know...that everything that has happened to me here has helped to spread the Good News. For everyone here, including the whole palace guard, knows that I am in chains because of Christ. And because of my imprisonment, most of the believers here have gained confidence and boldly speak God's message without fear.' (Philippians 1:12-14 NLT) Hidden in some of your biggest disappointments, you will find treasures of truth that literally transform your life and your future.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Are you in health, my brother?' 2 Samuel 20:9 NKJV<br /><br /><p>N<i>ever forget the law of sowing and reaping.</i> God set in motion certain laws and they never change. One is the law of gravity. Another is the law of sowing and reaping. 'While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest...shall not cease.' (Genesis 8:22 NKJV) This law works both negatively and positively. If you sow good things you will reap good things; if you sow bad things you will reap bad things. Consider parenting. Eli the high priest was not only called to be a role model to the nation, but also to his two sons. Now, he may have been a great success in ministry but he failed badly on the home front. His sons, who were also priests, enriched themselves by taking bribes. They even slept with women in the temple courts. Pretty shocking, eh? So what did God say? '...I will judge his house...for the iniquity which he knows, because his sons made themselves vile, and he did not restrain them.' (1 Samuel 3:13 NKJV) As a result Eli's sons were killed at the hands of their enemies, and when the news of it reached Eli he dropped dead. That's the harvest law working negatively. But thank God it also works positively. Paul writes about it: 'Knowing that whatever good anyone does, he will receive the same from the Lord...' (Ephesians 6:8 NKJV) You say, 'What does that mean?' It means that whatever good you make happen for others, God will make happen for you. So whether it's a smile, a prayer, a gift or a helping hand, start sowing good seeds and you will reap harvests of blessing.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Are you in health, my brother?' 2 Samuel 20:9 NKJV<br /><br /><p>N<i>ever withhold because times are hard. </i>The Bible teaches that those who set their mind on 'getting' always lose, whereas those who set their mind on 'giving' always win. The story's told of a dog walking across a bridge with a bone in his mouth. When he looked down into the river and saw his reflection, he thought it was another dog with a bigger bone. So he jumped in to get it-and drowned. Paul dedicates two entire chapters in the Bible to the subject of money. Perhaps that's a good answer to those who say: 'All the church ever talks about is money.' Since money is congealed sweat, coined time, coined talent, negotiable you, it's one way in which you can give yourself to God. It's not the only way but it's a very important way. So Paul writes: 'Remember this-a farmer who plants only a few seeds will get a small crop. But the one who plants generously will get a generous crop. You must each decide in your heart how much to give. And don't give reluctantly or in response to pressure. For God loves a person who gives cheerfully. And God will generously provide all you need. Then you will always have everything you need and plenty left over to share with others...Yes, you will be enriched in every way so that you can always be generous...' (2 Corinthians 9:6-11 NLT) Unless you practice generosity, there's no point asking God for more money. He doesn't pour His blessing into pots, but into pipes; not into reservoirs, but into rivers that let it flow out. Getting the idea?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Jesus, knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said...&quot;It is finished!&quot;' John 19:28-30 NKJV<br /><br /><p>What made great intellectuals like CS Lewis commit their lives to Christ? His credibility! Observe some of the Old Testament prophecies Jesus fulfilled during His lifetime: (<i>1) He would enter into Jerusalem on a donkey:</i> '...Behold, your King...He is just and having salvation, lowly and riding on a donkey...' (Zechariah 9:9 NKJV) (<i>2) He would be betrayed by a friend:</i> '...My own familiar friend in whom I trusted...has lifted up his heel against Me.' (Psalm 41:9 NKJV) (<i>3) He would be sold for thirty pieces of silver:</i> '...So they weighed for My price thirty pieces of silver.' (Zechariah 11:12 KJV) (<i>4) They would gamble for His garments:</i> 'They divide My garments among them, and for My clothing they cast lots.' (Psalm 22:18 NKJV) (<i>5) Not one of His bones would be broken:</i> 'He guards all His bones; not one of them is broken.' (Psalm 34:20 NKJV) (<i>6) He would be buried in a rich man's tomb:</i> 'They made His grave with...the rich at His death...' (Isaiah 53:9 NKJV) (<i>7) That He would be raised again from the dead:</i> 'You will not leave My soul in Sheol, nor will You allow Your Holy One to see corruption.' (Psalm 16:10 NKJV) John records: 'After this, Jesus, knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, &quot;I thirst!&quot;' In full possession of His mental faculties, with His mind unclouded, He checked off the prophecies He was supposed to fulfil right down to the last one, and said, 'It is finished.' (v30 NKJV) Christ-He's totally credible, and you can trust Him!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['They shall bear the burden...with you...' Numbers 11:17 NKJV<br /><br /><p>You may be a great visionary, but you will not succeed until you learn to inspire others with your vision and transfer it to them. Now, while the ability to communicate is important in transferring your vision to others, it takes more than that. You must have credibility and conviction. People will only buy into your vision if you are sold out to it. Convincing others of the significance of your vision can happen only if <i>you</i> are convinced of its significance. That requires the right message, spoken by the right messenger, to the right people, at the right time, and in the right way. Psychologist and author Dr. Larry Crabb describes this convergence, saying: 'A vision we give to others of who and what they could become, has power when it echoes what the Spirit has already spoken into their souls.' That power can convince people to join you in the pursuit of your vision, and greatly enhances your chances of success. There is an interesting mathematical dynamic in the Bible which states that one person can put a thousand to flight, but two people can put ten thousand to flight (Deuteronomy 32:30). Yes, the Scriptures teach the power of synergy. When you get the right people involved, plus the blessing of the Lord, you'll accomplish more than you ever dreamed possible.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I am not able to bear all [this] alone...' Numbers 11:14 NKJV<br /><br /><p>One day Moses told God that the job was too big for him. So God told Moses to find seventy men with leadership ability. Then He said: 'I will take of the Spirit that is upon you and will put [it] upon them; and they shall bear the burden...with you.' (Numbers 11:17 NKJV) Understand this: you will never fulfil your dream as long as you are unable or unwilling to get others to buy into it. Don't think that because your dream is worthwhile, people will automatically line up to be part of it. It doesn't work that way. The same dream that will bless you, can bury you if you don't surround yourself with the right people. Moses said, 'I am not able to bear all these people alone, because the burden is too heavy for me. If You treat me like this, please kill me here and now...' (Numbers 11:14-15 NKJV) Don't wait till you're on the verge of a nervous breakdown or your family is falling apart before you reach for help. </p>
<p>When God calls someone He always calls others to stand with them. So start looking around you. You may need just one person or you may need many. Indeed, the greater your dream, the greater your team must be. But here's the good news: the size of your dream determines the size of the people who will be attracted to it. If you have a big dream, you have even greater potential for good people to help you. What you need to do is connect with them, invite them in, transfer the vision and then turn them loose. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will never pass away.' Matthew 24:35 NIV<br /><br /><p>One of the first books to come off the printing press when it was invented was the Bible. And it's still the world's best-selling book. An anonymous author has written: 'It contains the mind of God, the state of man, the way of salvation, the fate of sinners, and the happiness of believers. It is a light to direct you, food to nourish you, and comfort to cheer you. It is the traveller's road map, the pilot's compass, the soldier's weapon, and the player's game plan. It's a mine of incredible wealth, and a river of genuine joy. Its doctrines are holy, its precepts are binding, its histories are true, and its decisions are immutable. Christ is its grand subject, your good its design, and the glory of God its end. Read it to be wise, believe it to be safe, practice it to be spiritually healthy. Read it slowly, frequently and prayerfully. Let it fill your memory, rule your heart, and guide your steps. It is given to you in life, will be opened at the judgment, and be remembered for ever. It involves the highest responsibility, will reward the greatest labour, and judge those who trifle with its sacred contents.' The Bible is 'The Word of our God [which] stands forever...' (1 Peter 1:25 NIV) Most of us <i>respect</i> the Bible; the trouble is we don't <i>read</i> it daily and put it into practice. After hearing a discussion on various translations of the Bible, one man said: 'I prefer my mother's translation, because she translated it into everyday life.' Are you doing that?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I am the vine; you are the branches...' John 15:5 NIV<br /><br /><p>The Bible gives us two interesting pictures of our relationship with Jesus: (<i>1) A branch. </i>'I am the vine; you are the branches. If a man remains in Me and I in him, he will bear much fruit.' Jesus wants to be as close to you as a branch is to a vine. One is an extension of the other. It's impossible to tell where one starts and the other ends. The branch isn't connected only at the moment of bearing fruit. The gardener doesn't keep branches in a box and then, on the day he wants grapes, glue them to the vine. No, the branch constantly draws nutrition from the vine. Separation means certain death. (<i>2) A bride.</i> (2 Corinthians 11:2) Aren't we the bride of Christ? Haven't we made vows to Him, and hasn't He made vows to us? What does our marriage to Christ imply? For one thing, the communication never stops. In a happy home a husband doesn't talk to his wife only when he wants something. He doesn't pop in just when he wants a good meal or a clean shirt or a little romance. Healthy marriages have a sense of 'remaining'. There is tenderness, honesty, ongoing communication. Sometimes we go to God with our joys, sometimes we go with our hurts, but we always go. And the more we go, the more we become like Him. People who live long lives together eventually begin to sound alike, talk alike and even think alike. As we walk with Jesus we take on His thoughts, His principles, His attitudes. Indeed, we take on His heart. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The people did whatever seemed right in their own eyes.' Judges 17:6 NLT<br /><br /><p>You're never more vulnerable than when you can hide from others. Secrecy is the ideal breeding ground for deception, leading us into sin. Jesus points out that we love darkness rather than light because our deeds naturally gravitate toward evil (John 3:19). There is within us a propensity to sin, so we are called to 'walk in the light' where our motives and actions are transparent and we are encouraged to avoid sin (1 John 1:7). But to walk in the light and overcome sin requires people who will hold us accountable. 'Fools think their own way is right, but the wise listen to others.' (Proverbs 12:15 NLT) Our need for approval makes us want to hide our struggles. But our willingness to be genuine frees us to acknowledge our struggles and overcome them. But the person to whom you are accountable should be mature, know God's Word, keep your confidence, and love you enough to be honest with you. And you need to be open to hear what they tell you. King Rehoboam 'rejected the advice of the older men and instead asked the opinion of the young men who had grown up with him...' (1 Kings 12:8 NLT) He wanted to hear only what pleased him. So he turned to his equally immature friends who told him what he wanted to hear, leading him to a decision that caused a major rebellion in Israel. So build a relationship with someone who'll tell you what you <i>need</i> to hear, not just what you <i>want</i> to hear!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The people did whatever seemed right in their own eyes.' Judges 17:6 NLT<br /><br /><p>There's no better depiction of our ego-driven nature than this: 'The people did whatever seemed right in their own eyes.' Their philosophy was: 'Don't tell me what to do.' But that philosophy leaves you without checks or balances, exposing you to the dominating power of your flesh. We're all capable of becoming addicted to something. Recognising this is a necessary first step to overcoming it. '...The sin that so easily entangles...' (Hebrews 12:1 NIV) may be a weakness for food, money, sex, drugs, alcohol, popularity, toxic relationships, power, workaholism etc. When it strikes, you're much more likely to capitulate if you're alone and can act covertly. '...If you fall without having a friend nearby, you are really in trouble.' (Ecclesiastes 4:10 CEV) You need to 'turn on the light' immediately by connecting with your support system and sharing your situation. Don't allow the darkness of isolation to overpower you. 'If you fall, your friend can help you up...' (v10 CEV) The pride that drives you to hide your weakness will keep you permanently weak. The humility to acknowledge it and ask for help is the key to breaking the vicious cycle. God has blessed us with mature, caring people who recognise our common struggles and will help us deal with them. We are part of Christ's church, and 'if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; if one member is honoured, all the members rejoice with it.' (1 Corinthians12:26 NAS) God instructed Moses, 'Select...some...honest men who fear God...They will help you carry the load.' (Exodus 18:21-22 NLT) Accept the help God provides!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...You have great faith! Your request is granted.' Matthew 15:28 NIV<br /><br /><p>Matthew records: 'A Canaanite woman...came to Him, crying out, &quot;Lord...my daughter is suffering terribly from demon-possession&quot; ...He answered, &quot;I was sent only to...Israel...It is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs.&quot; &quot;Yes, Lord,&quot; she said, &quot;but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table.&quot; Then Jesus answered, &quot;Woman, you have great faith! Your request is granted.&quot;' (Matthew 15:22-28 NIV) This Gentile woman was an outsider, yet she pushed through and got what comfortable insiders often miss. Talk about hurdles! First, Jesus refused to answer her. Next, He said, 'What I have is only for the Jews.' Finally He said, 'It wouldn't be right to give the children's bread to dogs.' Most of us would have walked away offended. Not her! She cried, 'Have mercy on me.' She wasn't asking for what she deserved, she was crying out for what she needed! As a result, Jesus removed every obstacle and answered her prayer. And if <i>you</i> persist, He will do the same for you too. In reality, this woman told Jesus, 'Let the children have the bread, all I need are the crumbs.' Church folks can become so complacent that they neglect the bread, waste the bread, complain about the bread and sometimes don't even come to church to get the bread. But some desperate people pick up the crumbs and find life! They know that if there's power in the loaf, there's power in the crumb. And when a crumb is all you can get, a crumb is all you need. So what do you need from God today? How badly do you want it?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The younger son...journeyed to a far country...' Luke 15:13 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The story of the Prodigal Son is especially applicable to backsliders. It speaks to those who have been raised in church, know God's Word, have felt His presence, understand His claims, and once served Him. But like the Prodigal, they've 'gone to the hogs'. Notice, he's not called the Prodigal Sinner but the Prodigal Son, because he still belongs in the family. For the next few days let's look at why people leave the church. <i>First: because the blessings of Father's house become commonplace.</i> Notice, he didn't appreciate what he had until he lost it. Notice also, his father didn't kick him out of the house, he 'journeyed into a far country.' He left of his own free will and came back the same way. What's the point? If God's love can't hold you, His power won't force you! It's your willing obedience that God finds pleasure in, not conforming to a set of religious rules because you are afraid of going to hell. Jesus told the story of a king who planned a wedding feast and invited different guests. What a privilege. 'But they made light of it and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his business.' (Matthew 22:5 NKJV) Are you too busy for God? Are you so used to His blessings you want something different? Be warned, the road you are on leads to one place only: the pig pen. Stop, turn around, repent and come home while you still can. No matter how badly you have failed, your Father is waiting to take you back. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['We have come to believe and know...You...' John 6:69 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Sometimes<i> the rules of the Father's house seem too restrictive.</i> Many people want Christ's love but not His Lordship, His blessings but not His commandments. It's not that He offers them too little, but that the cost of serving Him seems too high. Maybe you are thinking that if you'd lived in the days of Christ, walked and talked with Him and heard Him preach, you'd be a better Christian. Think again! 'His disciples, when they heard this, said, &quot;This is a hard saying&quot;...From that time many of His disciples went back and walked with Him no more. Then Jesus said to the twelve, &quot;Do you also want to go away?&quot; But Simon Peter answered Him, &quot;Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life. Also we have come to believe and know that You are the Christ...&quot;' (John 6:60-69 NKJV) True discipleship doesn't result from attending a special service at church. No, it's progressive. It's the result of 'coming to believe and know' the Lord as you walk with Him on the mountaintop and in the valley, in the bad times as well as the good. That's why Peter wrote: 'Now to you who believe, this stone is precious. But to those who do not believe...A stone that causes men to stumble...' (1 Peter 2:7-8 NIV) Paul puts it this way: '...No man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.' (1 Corinthians 12:3 KJV) The purpose of the Holy Spirit working in your life is to bring you into submission to the will of God. And that involves a relationship-with rules!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let us not...judge one another anymore...' Romans 14:13 KJV<br /><br /><p>Here's another reason people leave the church: <i>because of the attitude of some church members.</i> The older boy in Christ's parable knew how to be a son, but he didn't know how to be a brother. If the jealousy and judgmentalism he showed toward his brother is anything to go by, it's little wonder his brother left home in the first place. Paul writes: 'Let us not therefore judge one another anymore: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brother's way.' The Bible says, 'He who loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no cause of stumbling in him.' (1 John 2:10 NKJV) Do your attitudes and actions strengthen others or cause them to stumble? Have you read about Diotrephes? John talked about him: 'I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to have the preeminence among them, does not receive us. Therefore, if I come, I will call to mind his deeds which he does, prating against us with malicious words. And not content with that, he himself does not receive the brethren, and forbids those who wish to, putting them out of the church.' (3 John 1:9-10 NKJV) Diotrephes was an opponent of authority who wanted only one thing-control! And John denounced him as 'evil', saying, '...he who does evil has not seen God.' (v11 NKJV) Only eternity will reveal how many people have been driven away from the church by critical, callous, controlling Christians. Make sure you're not one of them! </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The years...pass quickly, and then we are gone.' Psalm 90:10 NCV<br /><br /><p>Eileen Silva Kindig writes: 'We talk about lack of time...when what we lack is backbone to take responsibility for how we spend it... Instead of coming home, we're escaping to the office and assembly line to get away from household chores, childcare, and the demands of relationships...work gives us a buzz. Besides money and freedom, it provides the satisfaction of a job well done, an outlet for creativity, breezy, low-demand camaraderie, and intellectual stimulation... All this may be keeping us financially afloat...but the less time we spend with family, the messier our home life gets.' Time is so precious that God gives it to us a moment at a time. 'The years...pass quickly, and then we are gone.' So what will you have to look back on? Hours spent working overtime or hours spent with your loved ones? Kindig recommends: (<i>1) Remember who's in charge.</i> Manage your time, don't let it manage you. Think through commitments before you make them. Decide what's important. The urgent seldom is. (<i>2) Schedule in reverse.</i> Put your real priorities on the calendar first, then add the rest. (<i>3) Drop one thing from your schedule;</i> for example, spending two afternoons less a month volunteering frees you to enjoy lunch with your spouse. (<i>4) </i><i>Be,</i><i> rather than </i><i>do</i><i>.</i> Think. Pray. Relax in a chair. (<i>5) Get your spouse's perspective on how you're spending your time, and what may be stealing it. (6) Be honest about your limitations.</i> You can't manufacture time; we all get the same amount. (<i>7) Keep a list of your commitments by the phone so you think twice before adding to it.</i></p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Give thanks in all circumstances.' 1 Thessalonians 5:18 NIV<br /><br /><p>In order to have a grateful heart you must learn to be grateful for flawed people and imperfect gifts. Be grateful when your child attempts to make the bed, even though they make it imperfectly. Be grateful when your spouse expresses affection, even if they do it a little awkwardly. Be grateful that your body still moves around, even if it's more wrinkled and lumpy. Don't wait to feel thankful. The thinking and the doing leads to the feeling. 'Give thanks in all circumstances' calls for a decision and an act of your will, not an emotional response. It's why today is a day of Thanksgiving-not Thanksfeeling.</p>
<p>James Dodson wrote a moving book called <i>Final Rounds</i>, in which he talks about the last months of his father's life. They were both avid golfers, and when his father had been diagnosed with a terminal illness James took him to Scotland so they could play golf together at some of the world's most celebrated courses. At one point James' dad asked him about his marriage and family. James' answer was evasive; he was so consumed by his work that there was little time left over. These were the words of a dying father to his son: 'I wish I could slow you both down...The danger of great ambition is that you work so hard, you may someday wake up and find that the things you really wanted were the things you had all along.' </p>
<p>Paul writes, 'Wake up, O sleeper, rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.' (Ephesians 5:14 NIV) Every once in a while we do wake up. And when we do, what we wake up to is gratitude for the things we take for granted. </p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Everything in me will celebrate when you speak what is right.' Proverbs 23:16 NLT<br /><br /><p>Criticism will make you a better person if you do these three things: (<i>1) Look beyond the criticism and see the critic.</i> If it's someone you respect, listen to what they say. If it's someone who's constantly critical, don't place too much value on what they say; they're probably just projecting their frustrations onto you. The story's told of a twelve-year-old boy who hadn't spoken since he was born. After being served oatmeal for breakfast several weeks in a row, he shouted, 'Yuck, I hate this stuff!' His mother jumped up, hugged him and said, 'We thought you couldn't talk. Why haven't you ever spoken to us?' Bluntly he exclaimed, 'Because up until now everything's been ok.' Some folks only talk when they're upset. The important question is, does your critic sincerely want to help you? (<i>2) Try not to take yourself too seriously.</i> Let's face it, we all do things we regret. But when you can laugh at yourself and learn from it, you're growing into maturity. (<i>3) Know the difference between constructive and destructive criticism.</i> Learn how to interpret criticism by asking: (a) In what spirit is it given? If your critic's attitude is kind, rest assured it's meant to be constructive. (b) When is the criticism given? When somebody criticises you publicly, usually their intentions aren't the best. (c) Why is the criticism given? 'The purposes of a man's heart are deep waters, but a man of understanding draws them out.' (Proverbs 20:5 NIV) When people are hurting, they tend to hurt others. So always ask, 'Was this criticism given for my benefit or out of personal hurt?'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[  '...Christ...while being reviled...did not revile in return...' 1 Peter 2:21-23 NAS<br /><br /><p>When it comes to handling criticism the right way you must: (<i>1) Demonstrate emotional and spiritual maturity.</i> Exhaustion can affect the way you act when you're under pressure. Elijah slipped into depression because of it. Queen Jezebel hounded him relentlessly. Her opposition sapped his strength and caused him to say, '...It is enough; now, O Lord, take away my life...' (1 Kings 19:4 KJV) Satan will take advantage of your weariness. When you're fatigued you can become overly sensitive and miss the opportunity for growth that comes with the criticism. (<i>2) Realise that good people get criticised.</i> Jesus was called a glutton (Matthew 11:19); a drinker (Luke 7:34); a friend of disreputable characters (Matthew 11:19). People whose opinions are set and whose thinking is off won't understand behaviour based on obedience to God. So when your ideas and values clash with theirs, try to be gracious. (<i>3) Always keep a good attitude.</i> Your own attitude can be more detrimental to you than somebody else's. You know what they say: 'A chip on your shoulder usually indicates wood higher up.' Peter writes: 'You have been called for this purpose, since Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example for you to follow in His steps, who committed no sin, nor was any deceit found in His mouth; and while being reviled, He did not revile in return; while suffering, He uttered no threats, but kept entrusting Himself to [God] who judges righteously.' (1 Peter 2:21-23 NKJV) Give it to God, and press on!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['It is to a man's honour to avoid strife...' Proverbs 20:3 NIV<br /><br /><p>When it comes to criticism: (<i>1) Concentrate on your mission and change your mistakes!</i> Most of us do the opposite; when criticism comes we change our mission and concentrate on our mistakes. If you run every time you make a mistake, you will never accomplish anything. Instead you'll live in constant frustration. The only real mistakes are the ones from which you learn nothing. So instead of dwelling on your mistakes, count on making some, growing wiser and moving on to finish the job. There's an old Arabian proverb that says, 'If you stop every time a dog barks, your road will never end.' Don't let your failures become roadblocks-turn them into building blocks. Proverbs 27:17 NIV says, 'Iron sharpens iron...' So pray and grow sharper through criticism. (<i>2) Spend time with the right people.</i> When you have optional time spend it with those who build you up, not tear you down. Quality time with the right people will strengthen your faith and fortify you against the effects of the worst criticism. It will also keep you from becoming critical yourself. When crows attack a hawk, the hawk doesn't counter-attack. Instead, it soars higher and higher in ever-widening circles until the pests leave it alone. What a great strategy! Circle above your critics rather than stooping to their level: 'It is to a man's honour to avoid strife, but every fool is quick to quarrel.' If your attitude is to have any effect on people it will be because of your example, not your defensiveness.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...If God is for us, who can be against us?' Romans 8:31 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The moment you lift your head above the crowd you'll attract attention, and not always the kind you want. Learn from the duck. He stays calm on the surface, keeps paddling underneath, and lets the water run off him. Time is on your side. When Nathanael asked, concerning Jesus, 'Can anything good come out of Nazareth?' Philip answered, '...Come and see...' (John 1:46 NKJV) Nathanael did, and he ended up becoming a disciple. Often, as events unfold, the cause of the criticism will become clear and you'll be vindicated. But you must keep going. George Bernard Shaw, the Irish playwright, certainly had his critics-but he knew how to handle them. After one opening a critic stood up in the audience and shouted, 'It's rotten!' Shaw stood up and replied, 'I agree, but what are we against so many?' Nobody had more critics than Paul, yet he wrote: 'If God be for us, who can be against us?' Without courage we simply accumulate a collection of good ideas-and regrets. Most of our missed opportunities wouldn't have been missed if we had been willing to push through the criticism and embrace what could have been. All of us experience fear. But here's the difference: the winner's need for progress overwhelms their reluctance to take a risk. They can live more easily with the memory of having tried and failed, than not having tried at all. They know that failure is an inevitable part of success, and failure always brings criticism. And while others fear <i>stepping out</i> into a new opportunity, the winner fears <i>missing out </i>on it.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Created in Christ Jesus to do good works...' Ephesians 2:10 NIV<br /><br /><p>God had a plan for your life before you were born. Indeed, it's why He brought you into the world. Simply keeping you 'busy' was not His goal. He wants to see you doing the work He 'prepared in advance' for you to do. Joining a worthy cause and working hard is commendable, but you can end up as a square peg in a round hole, expending time and energy without achieving the you-shaped purpose God had in mind. He wants you to be purpose-driven, not work-driven! So: (<i>1) Ask Him to reveal His will to you.</i> 'It is God who works in you to will and to act according to His good purpose.' (Philippians 2:13 NIV) God will actually create desires within you that guide you toward accomplishing His purpose. It's not serendipity or super-spirituality, but God at the helm, steering your ship. (<i>2) Expect to do more than you are capable of.</i> Self-directed activity is self-limited activity. God-directed activity is unlimited activity. God never calls us to do what we can; He calls us to do what <i>He</i> can! '[He] is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to His power that is at work within us.' (Ephesians 3:20 NIV) Listen, act on His promptings, and all things become possible to you. (<i>3) When the work is demanding, draw on His indwelling power.</i> Paul says, 'I labour, struggling with all His energy, which so powerfully works in me.' (Colossians 1:29 NIV) How much divine energy is needed for your assignment? 'All His energy.' Awesome! And it is available to you today.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...you will know how to live in the family of God.' 1 Timothy 3:15 NCV<br /><br /><p>The church is like a garden; it has great potential for growth and beauty. But cultivating a garden calls for time and labour; it also requires being on the lookout for weeds and pulling them up before they grow and kill your plants. Two of the most common weeds in the church are: (<i>1) Favouritism.</i> 'Then Peter began to speak: 'I now realise how true it is that God does not show favouritism but accepts men from every nation who fear Him and do what is right. You know the message God sent to the people of Israel...' (Acts 10:34-36 NIV) Peter, who struggled with prejudice, said, 'I now realise...that God does not show favouritism.' How about you? Do you realise that too? Or do you mix only with 'your own kind'? Cliques in church are high treason to the King of Kings. If there's one lonely soul in your church, you have work to do! The Bible says that God 'gives families to the lonely.' (Psalm 68:6 TLB) When people are shy, wounded, insecure or lacking in trust, you must reach out and bring them into your circle of fellowship. (<i>2) Gossip.</i> 'Don't speak evil against each other, dear brothers and sisters...' (James 4:11 NLT) When you hear gossip about someone, stop it dead in its tracks. Unless you are willing to talk directly to the person, don't talk about them. And don't let anybody else talk about them either. Gossip is the art of saying nothing in a way that leaves practically nothing unsaid. If you want to promote harmony in the family, don't indulge in it.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Are you in health, my brother?' 2 Samuel 20:9 NKJV<br /><br /><p>N<i>ever forget, you're not home yet.</i> The story's told of an old steamship that pulled into Southampton harbour and the passengers got off. Helium-filled balloons rose into the air and the crowd went wild as a young Hollywood starlet walked down the gangplank to be greeted by her family and friends. The last person off the ship was an elderly man who had spent more than fifty years of his life as a missionary in India. All his earthly possessions were in a tattered suitcase he carried by his side. After getting to his room in a cheap boarding house, he knelt by his bed and prayed: 'Lord, I've served You all my life. I've sacrificed everything to tell others the good news of the Gospel and brought many to You. Yet there was no one to celebrate my arrival or welcome me home.' As he knelt there the voice of God spoke to him softly and said, 'Son, you're not home yet!' And redeemed child of God, neither are you! If God has blessed you with a nice house, thank Him and enjoy it. But don't get too settled. At best, it's only temporary accommodation. Paul thought often of Heaven: 'For I am hard-pressed between the two, having a desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better. Nevertheless to remain in the flesh is more needful for you.' (Philippians 1:23-24 NKJV) God has something 'far better' in mind for you. A great preacher once said: 'It is our main business in this world to secure an interest in the next.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Unless I wash you, you have no part with Me.' John 13:8 NIV<br /><br /><p>Jesus 'took off His outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around His waist...poured water into a basin and began to wash His disciples' feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped round Him. He came to Simon Peter, who said to Him, &quot;Lord, are You going to wash my feet?&quot;...Jesus answered, &quot;Unless I wash you, you have no part with Me.&quot;...When He had finished...He put on His clothes and returned to His place. &quot;Do you understand what I have done for you?&quot; He asked them, &quot;...I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you. I tell you the truth, no servant is greater than his master...&quot;' (John 13:4-16 NIV) Observe two things Jesus taught: (<i>1) In order to serve God, you must serve others.</i> When Peter objected, Jesus said, 'Unless I wash you, you have no part with Me.' To play your part in God's plan you must put others first. What you're doing right now may enrich you personally, but are you serving others and pleasing God? (<i>2) When it comes to serving, nothing should be beneath you.</i> Can you picture it? Jesus, who was God, stooping to wash the lowest, dirtiest and smelliest part of the body. Keep that picture firmly in mind next time you're asked to do something you don't want to do, or something you think is 'beneath you'. Christ saw so much value in the least, the lost, the last and the lowest that He came to redeem them. And today He wants us to go out of our way to serve one another.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Keep your conscience clear...' 1 Timothy 1:19 NLT<br /><br /><p>Speaking of conscience, Paul writes: '...I always try to maintain a clear conscience before God and all people.' (Acts 24:16 NLT) He lays it on the line to Timothy: 'Cling to your faith in Christ, and keep your conscience clear. For some people have deliberately violated their consciences; as a result, their faith has been shipwrecked.' (1 Timothy 1:19 NLT) Now a captain doesn't set out to wreck his ship. But if he falls asleep at the wheel or takes his eye off the compass, he will end up on the rocks anyway. The question is not, 'Can I get away with it?' No, the question is, 'Can I live with it afterwards? How will it affect my confidence before God? How does He feel about it? Will it prevent or promote His blessing in my life?'</p>
<p>Edgar Guest wrote: 'I have to live with myself and so, I want to be fit for myself to know; I want to be able as days go by, always to look myself in the eye. I don't want to stand with the setting sun, and hate myself for the things I've done. I want to go out with my head erect; I want to deserve all men's respect. Here in the struggle for fame and wealth, I want to be able to like myself. I don't want to look at myself and know, that I'm bluster and bluff and empty show. I can never hide myself from me, I see what others may never see; I know what others may never know; I can never fool myself and so, whatever happens I want to be, self-respecting and conscience free.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...If it is possible, let this cup...be taken away from Me...' Matthew 26:39 NLT<br /><br /><p>Sometimes in Christian circles when somebody is suffering we blame it on hidden sin. That way we think it can't happen to <i>us</i> because we're not guilty of that particular problem, right? How shortsighted, given the fact that Jesus, the sinless Son of God, exemplified suffering! In Gethsemane He didn't stand up with false bravado and say, 'Bring it on!' No, 'He...bowed...His face to the ground, praying, &quot;My Father! If it is possible, let this cup of suffering be taken away...Yet...Your will...be done, not Mine.&quot;' Jesus took pain and showed us how to glorify God in it. One Christian author observed: 'God never promised tornadoes would skip our houses on the way to our pagan neighbours, and microbes would flee from Christian bodies. We're not exempt from the tragedies of this world, just as God wasn't exempt. In fact, Peter earned the strongest rebuke when he protested against the need for Christ to suffer. [Jesus said, 'Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block...you do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men... If anyone would come after Me, he must deny himself...take up his cross and follow Me...whoever wants to save his life will lose it...whoever loses his life for Me will find it.' (Matthew 16:23-25 NIV)] God took the worst thing that could happen-the execution of His innocent Son-and turned it into the final victory over death...He turned the design of evil into the service of good.' It's by His wounds we are healed (Isaiah 53:5), and by His weakness that we are made strong.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...God...made Jesus perfect by suffering...' Hebrews 2:10 CEV<br /><br /><p>None of us has come close to experiencing what Jesus endured on the cross, yet we run from suffering. A lost job, a debilitating illness, a painful divorce-none of us escapes. Even 'Jesus...had to suffer before He could learn what it really means to obey God.' (Hebrews 5:8 CEV) Pain is a learning experience. The Bible says, 'God...made Jesus perfect by suffering.' Philip Yancey writes: 'God understood physical pain, having designed the marvellous nervous system that warns against harm... But had a Spirit ever felt physical pain? Not until the Incarnation. In thirty-three years on earth Jesus learned about hardship, rejection and betrayal. And He learned too about pain: what it feels like to have an accuser leave the red imprint of his fingers on your face...to have a crude iron spike pounded through muscle, tendon, and bone. On earth, the Son of God learned all that...and because of Jesus, God hears <i>our</i> cries differently. The author of Hebrews marvelled that, whatever we are going through, God has gone through: &quot;For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathise with our weaknesses, but...one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are-yet was without sin.&quot; (Hebrews 4:15 NIV) We have a high priest who graduated from the school of suffering and &quot;...is able to be gentle with those who do not understand and who are doing wrong things.&quot; (Hebrews 5:2 NCV)' We need no longer cry into the abyss, 'Hey, God, are You listening?' By joining us on earth, Jesus gave visible, historical proof that God hears our groans and groans along with us. (Romans 8:26) What a comfort!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...David inquired again of God...' 1 Chronicles 14:14 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says: 'David inquired again of God; and God said...&quot;When you hear a sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees...go out to battle: for God has gone out before you&quot; ...David therefore did as God commanded him: and they drove back the...Philistines...' (1 Chronicles 14-16 NKJV) Observe three things in this story: (<i>1) David refused to make a move until he first talked it over with the Lord.</i> Notice the words, 'David inquired again of God.' It wasn't just something he did occasionally or in times of crisis, it was something he did on a regular basis. (<i>2) David waited until he heard a certain sound:</i> 'A sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees.' Do you know God well enough to recognise the sound of His voice? With time and testing you can. 'You have an anointing from the Holy One, and you know all things.' (1 John 2:20 NKJV) Not only will you know what God wants you to do, He will actually create within you the desire to do it. 'It is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure.' (Philippians 2:13 NKJV) (<i>3) David went, knowing God had gone before him to deal with every obstacle that stood in his way.</i> The Bible says, 'If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally...' (James 1:5 NKJV) Wisdom is 'the ability to use knowledge so as to successfully meet the challenges of life.' You may acquire knowledge from books and schools, but this wisdom is a gift from God. Don't go until you get it!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Be it known...that we will not...' Daniel 3:18 KJV<br /><br /><p>Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego had achieved career success, so they had nothing to gain by challenging the king of Babylon. So, why did they? Because he ordered them to disobey God and violate their convictions by bowing down in worship before a pagan image. No doubt they could have reasoned, 'Better a live dog than a dead lion. If we stay alive, maybe we can do good for God and for others.' That philosophy would have convinced many of us, so why not them? Because they realised that Nebuchadnezzar was not the reason for their success. He may have been an instrument God used to promote them, but he was not the source of either their significance or their security. Those two things came from God-and they understood that you can't abandon the principles of God and walk in the blessings of God. You don't grieve the One who controls everything, just to get along with those who <i>think</i> they control everything. There will always be those who think they know what you should do. But these three Hebrew boys knew better: '...Our God whom we serve is able...' (Daniel 3:17 KJV) Able to do <i>what?</i> '...Able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think...' (Ephesians 3:20 NKJV) By refusing to bow, when bowing seemed like the expedient thing to do, they turned the hearts of a nation to God. Now, your influence may not be that widespread, but one thing you can count on: others are watching who will be influenced by the stand you take. So ask God to strengthen you, and do the right thing!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Be it known...that we will not...' Daniel 3:18 KJV<br /><br /><p>The higher you climb in life, the more certain people will try to assert control over you. Their threats can sound real, and the consequences of ignoring them, intimidating. Look at Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. Their commitment to God landed them in a fiery furnace heated seven times over. But it also promoted them to a place of great blessing and influence. Their story teaches us that for something to be an authentic test of character, it must be a situation in which the outcome is not in <i>your</i> hands. You simply make the choice to do what is right before God and leave the consequences to Him. It's a trial by fire, but it's a fire of refinement, and on the other side of it you come out stronger. Each time you do the right thing, choosing to embrace rather than escape the path God has called you to walk, you enter a new level of freedom. And as Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego discovered, three things happen: (1) You are set free from the 'Nebuchadnezzars' who claim to have control over the outcome of your life. (2) You are set free to say 'no' to those who would try to use and manipulate you. (3) You are set free to serve your all-powerful King and say 'no' to all the other pretenders who really have no power over you at all. In that moment you not only gain insight into <i>who</i> you are, but more importantly, <i>Whose</i> you are. And God will do one of two things: develop you in the fiery furnace or deliver you from it. Indeed, He may do both!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['There is another power within me that is at war with my mind...' Romans 7:23 NLT<br /><br /><p>Today let's talk about the second type of attack: <i>the enemy within.</i> Your old nature is like a fifth column, always looking for ways to sabotage you. It's the door through which Satan enters. You have two natures, an old one and a new one. They are opposite, and they are always on a collision course. A great illustration of this can be found in the birth of Jacob and Esau. '...Rebekah became pregnant with twins. But the two children struggled with each other in her womb. So she went to ask the Lord about it. &quot;Why is this happening to me?&quot; she asked. And the Lord told her, &quot;The sons in your womb will become two nations. From the very beginning, the two nations will be rivals. One nation will be stronger than the other; and your older son will serve your younger son.&quot;' (Genesis 25:21-23 NLT) Paul talks about his 'Dr. Jekyll' nature and his 'Mr. Hyde' nature. 'I love God's law with all my heart. But there is another power within me that is at war with my mind. This power makes me a slave to sin that is still within me.' (Romans 7:22-23 NLT) What's the answer? Starve your old nature and feed your new one! Again Paul writes: 'No one engaged in warfare entangles himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who enlisted him as a soldier.' (2 Timothy 2:4 NKJV) That means you must: (1) <i>Regularly communicate with headquarters through prayer</i>. (2) <i>Read God's Word to be sure you're obeying your Commanding Officer</i>. (3) <i>Keep your spiritual morale high</i>. (4) <i>Not get entangled with the wrong people or things</i>.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.' 2 Timothy 2:3 KJV<br /><br /><p>The new birth creates a battle between your old nature and your new one. When you were redeemed, you were recruited into this battle. And it begins the moment your eyes open each morning. The big question is, will you hold up or fold up? Victory depends on knowing your enemy's strategy and having a plan to deal with it. As a follower of Christ the attack you face each day is twofold. <i>First, there is the attack that comes from without.</i> '...Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.' (James 4:4 NKJV) Now that doesn't mean distancing yourself from your unchurched friends and denouncing all their activities. Nor does it mean adopting a holier-than-thou attitude toward them. It means that instead of the culture affecting you negatively, you engage and influence it positively, like light in darkness. Susanna Wesley defined 'worldliness' as four things: (1) 'Whatever dulls the sensitivities of my spirit toward God, or takes the fine edge off my thought of Him-must be ruled out for He is my Lord. (2) Whatever injures and weakens my body, or affects the mastery of it-must be ruled out for it is the temple of the Lord. (3) Whatever adversely affects the clearness of my witness to Jesus Christ before others-must be ruled out for it was His parting wish that I should be a witness of Him. (4) Whatever may cause my brother to stumble in his Christian life-must be ruled out for that would grieve Jesus.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Cross-examine me, O Lord...' Psalm 26:2 TLB<br /><br /><p>The story's told about a guy called Bill who telephoned his boss and said: 'I believe you're looking for an experienced, talented, hard-working manager for your front office. I'd like to apply for the job.' The boss replied, 'We already have someone in that slot and he's doing an excellent job. By the way, your voice sounds familiar. What's your name?' The guy replied, 'It's me, Bill; I was just checking up on myself!' You need to check up on yourself regularly. The Bible says, 'We must listen very carefully to the truths we have heard, or we may drift away from them.' (Hebrews 2:1 TLB) That word 'drift' should set off alarm bells. It doesn't happen overnight, but slowly and imperceptibly you drift off course and end up in places you never thought you would be-places you may not be able to get back from. A plane flying just one degree off its assigned flight plan can end up hundreds of kilometres from its destination. And if it's out of fuel, it's only going one place-down. Knowing his propensity to drift and to turn a blind eye to his defects of character, the Psalmist prayed: 'I have tried to keep Your laws and have trusted You without wavering. Cross-examine me, O Lord...test my motives and affections too. For I have taken Your loving-kindness and Your truth as my ideals.' (Psalm 26:1-3 TLB) Notice the words 'cross-examine'! Cross-examine what? (1) <i>Your </i><i>motives,</i><i> or your reasons for doing things</i>. (2) <i>Your </i><i>affections,</i><i> or the things toward which you are being drawn</i>. Are you drifting off course?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and your plans will succeed.' Proverbs 16:3 NIV<br /><br /><p>If all your life you've been warned about making bad decisions, fear can cause you to miss God-given opportunities. 'If the trumpet does not sound a clear call, who will get ready for battle?' (1 Corinthians 14:8 NIV) Now you're like the mule standing between two bales of hay. Unable to decide which one to eat and afraid of making the wrong choice, you starve to death. You must act! Your need to do things perfectly and your desire to control every possible outcome will keep you stuck. So: (<i>1) Stop trying to please everybody.</i> 'Fear of man is a dangerous trap, but to trust in God means safety.' (Proverbs 29:25 TLB) Once you know what brings you fulfilment, as long as it's God's will, chart your course accordingly and refuse to let the opinions of others stop you or colour your view. (<i>2) Remember, over time your goals can change. </i>What's needed today may not be right for you a year from now. So reassess your plans regularly and be willing to change direction. 'We should make plans-counting on God to direct us.' (Proverbs 16:9 TLB) When your spiritual gut says <i>no</i>, pay attention. (<i>3) When God is on your side, you'll prevail.</i> Somebody asked Abraham Lincoln if he was sure that God was on his side. He replied, 'I haven't thought much about it. I just want to know I'm on God's side.' It's normal to speculate about how you'd like things to turn out, but God alone controls the future. Just trust Him. 'Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and your plans will succeed.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['You have...put a wall of protection around him...' Job 1:10 NLT<br /><br /><p>When God praised Job for his integrity, Satan replied, 'You have always put a wall of protection around him...take away everything he has, and he will surely curse You.' So God gave Satan permission to test Job, but He placed limits on how far he could go (Job 2:6). There are times '...When the enemy comes in like a flood...' (Isaiah 59:19 NKJV) to attack your mind, your marriage, your ministry, and anything that's born of God in your life. When that happens, Isaiah says, '...The Spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard [shield] against him.' (Isaiah 59:19 NKJV) When you feel you're at breaking point and can't handle one more thing, the Holy Spirit lifts up the wall of the blood of Jesus and tells Satan, 'This far and no further!' Paul says, 'We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed.' (2 Corinthians 4:8-9 NIV) There's a wall of protection around you. There's also a time for your deliverance. '...In the time of My favour I heard you, and in the day of salvation I helped you.' (2 Corinthians 6:2 NIV) God will step in and intervene. The Psalmist said, '...When my heart is faint; Lead me to the Rock that is higher than I.' (Psalm 61:2 NAS) When your resources are depleted and you think you're going under for the last time, God has provided a refuge that's <i>higher</i> than your circumstances, a place where you're under divine protection and the enemy has no jurisdiction. All you have to do is lift your eyes and heart toward Heaven.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...O Lord; point out the road for me to follow.' Psalm 25:4 NLT<br /><br /><p>Even simple decisions can be stressful. Ever watch a child struggle to choose between chocolate or strawberry ice cream? And the bigger decisions-like whom to marry, which career to choose, whether to buy a house or to undergo high-risk surgery etc.-mean life can be nerve-racking! But you can reduce your stress level by following these Biblical principles: (<i>1) Do the research.</i> 'Anyone who answers without listening is foolish and confused.' (Proverbs 18:13 NCV) Get all the facts and avoid making decisions you'll regret. Knowledge has never been more accessible-through the internet, helpful books, and especially God's Word: 'Your commands...are my constant guide.' (Psalm 119:98 NLT) (<i>2) Talk to God.</i> 'Show me the right path, O Lord; point out the road for me to follow.' Consulting God helps prevent premature decisions, clarifies your priorities and prepares you to hear His counsel. Is God interested in your decisions? Yes. 'The Lord directs the steps of the godly. He delights in every detail of their lives.' (Psalm 37:23 NLT) (<i>3) Be open to new ideas.</i> Don't get trapped in old mind-sets. 'An intelligent mind acquires knowledge, and the ear of the wise seeks knowledge.' (Proverbs 18:15 NRS) Clinging to the familiar can be crippling. God may choose to lead you along a new path of fresh insight. So breathe deeply, seek His wisdom, and open up your heart to receive it. (<i>4) Get advice from trusted friends.</i> 'It's a hard road that's walked alone,' says an old Celtic proverb. So follow Solomon's counsel: 'A fool thinks he needs no advice, but a wise man listens to others.' (Proverbs 12:15 TLB)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Deliver us from the evil one...' Matthew 6:13 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Jesus taught us to pray: <i>'Do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one...' </i>Satan knows your areas of weakness and he will exploit them. But there's good news. It's your weaknesses, not your strengths, that draw you closer to God and make you lean on Him. Paul wrote: '...I am glad to boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may work through me.' (2 Corinthians 12:9 NLT) At first this verse doesn't seem to make sense. You want to be freed from your weaknesses, not boast about them. But Paul gives you several reasons:<i> (1) Your weakness prevents pride.</i> Paul writes: '...to keep me from getting puffed up, I was given a thorn in my flesh, a messenger from Satan to torment me and keep me from getting proud...' (2 Corinthians 12:7 NLT) You'll often find a weakness attached to strength, acting as a governor to keep you from becoming boastful or running ahead of God. Gideon chose 32,000 men to fight the Midianites, but God reduced his numbers to 300 (Judges 7). Why? So that Israel would know it was God's power and not their own that saved them. (<i>2) Your weakness creates fellowship.</i> Your struggles show you how much you need the support of others. Vance Havner said, 'Christians, like snowflakes, are frail, but when they stick together they can stop traffic.' (<i>3) Your weakness enables you to help others.</i> It's the broken who become masters at mending. Your most effective ministry can come out of your most painful experiences. The things you're most reluctant to share are often the very things God will use to help others.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Forgive us...as we forgive...' Matthew 6:12 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Let's clear up some misconceptions about the words, 'Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.' Satan will try to convince you that if your feelings haven't changed toward the person who wronged you, you haven't truly forgiven them. No, you can make the right decision and still have the wrong feelings! This is when you need faith to carry you through. You have done your part, now you are waiting for God to do His. God has the power to change your feelings toward the one who hurt you, and He will. Another misconception is that all you have to do is make a decision to forgive and then your job's finished. No, you are instructed to 'Invoke blessings upon and pray for the happiness of those who curse you, implore God's blessing (favour) upon those who abuse you...' (Luke 6:28 AMP) You say, 'Bless them? Are you serious?' Yes. The word 'bless' translates from a word meaning 'to speak well of'. You're extending mercy to those who don't deserve it. But isn't that what God does for you? The truth is, you cannot truly forgive without the Holy Spirit's help. So today why don't you pray, 'Holy Spirit, breathe on me and give me strength. I forgive _____________ [name] for what they did. I release them from this debt and ask You to bless them. I turn the situation over to You. I trust You for my total restoration. Help me, Lord. Heal my heart, in Jesus' name, Amen.' Now, by faith, leave it all in your Father's hands, move forward and anticipate His blessing. You won't be disappointed.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Give us this day our daily bread.' Matthew 6:11 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Jesus taught us to pray, <i>'Give us this day our daily bread.'</i> Notice the word 'daily'. You can't fight today's battles on the strength of yesterday's bread; you must have a fresh supply. In the wilderness God's people were only permitted to collect enough manna for one day. If they tried to collect more, it rotted. It's wonderful to talk about what God did yesterday and what He's going to do tomorrow, but all you've got is today. 'Give us this day our daily bread.' Only as you partake of what God's provided for you today will you be able to stand up to the challenges you face. This prayer is an expression of faith. The very fact that you ask means you believe God's got what you need and that He cares enough to provide for you. It says, 'I don't need to go to anybody else but You, Lord.' So hang up the phone, turn off the TV, shut the door, get down on your knees, approach God in faith and pray, 'Give me what I need for this day.' God knows what you need, you don't! As you partake of what He provides for you each day you'll be able to handle whatever life throws at you. </p>
<p>And one more thought. When people start getting on your nerves for no apparent reason or you start having all sorts of mood swings or you begin living by feelings instead of faith, it's probably because you're not eating right. If that's so, it's time to go back to your Source and say, 'Lord, I've come for my daily bread.'</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Therefore, pray: Our Father in Heaven...' Matthew 6:9 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Here's how Jesus taught us to pray: (<i>1) 'Our Father in Heaven.'</i> When you say, 'Father' you are acknowledging that you're 'family', that you have a special relationship with God which entitles you to go to Him at any time, confident you're loved, welcomed and assured of His favour. When you say, 'in Heaven,' you can go no higher. You're drawing what you need from the ultimate source of goodness, grace, mercy, provision, protection and authority. What a privilege! (<i>2) 'Hallowed be Your name.'</i> (Matthew 6:9 NKJV) This thought should always be uppermost in your mind: 'Whatever I do today, Lord, whether in thought, word or deed, let it honour You.' People should be able to look at your life and want to become acquainted with the One you serve. (<i>3) 'Your Kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in Heaven.'</i> (Matthew 6:10 NKJV) Each time you choose to say <i>no</i> to yourself and <i>yes</i> to God's will, you demonstrate to a watching world what it means to live as a citizen of His Kingdom. Note the words, 'as it is in Heaven.' Is anyone in Heaven fearful or doubting? Stubborn or disobedient? Critical or negative? When the enemy brings something to your door that's contrary to God's will, you have the authority to rise up and say, 'If it's not done and approved in Heaven it has no place in my life here on earth.' When it comes to disobedience, refuse to accept the package and sign the receipt. The one thing Satan hopes you never discover is that you have the God-given authority to restrict his movements in your life.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.' Romans 10:17 NKJV<br /><br /><p>If you are wise, when God talks you'll listen. And He will talk to you through the Bible. The reason the Bible has outsold every other book is because it is <i>God's</i> Word on the issue. It takes approximately 56 hours for most people to read the Bible through. If you read 40 chapters a day you would complete the Bible within a month. If you read nine chapters of the New Testament each day you would complete it within 30 days. But you must read it systematically, regularly, and expectantly. (If you use our <i>SoulFood</i> reading plan you will read your Bible in one year!) When Satan attacked Him in the wilderness, Jesus quoted the Scriptures to him. That's why the Psalmist said, 'Your word have I hidden in my heart, that I might not sin against You.' (Psalm 119:11 NKJV) The book of Proverbs has thirty-one chapters. Here's an idea: since there are thirty-one days in most months, why not read a chapter in this wisdom book every day. Can you imagine what you'd learn? The Word of God will build your faith. 'Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.' Your faith grows when you <i>hear</i> God speak, and it works when you <i>do</i> what He says. If you struggle to lead a victorious Christian life, read these words carefully: 'How can a young man cleanse his way? By taking heed according to Your Word.' (Psalm 119:9 NKJV) The solution to every problem you face is contained in Scripture. To be wise you must study it. To be strong in faith you must believe it. To be successful in life you must practise it.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and your plans will succeed.' Proverbs16:3 NIV<br /><br /><p>Here are two important things to remember when you're making an important decision: (<i>1) Believe that God is directing your steps.</i> Because He is! 'The Lord directs the steps of the godly...Though they stumble, they will never fall, for the Lord holds them by the hand.' (Psalm 37:23-24 NLT) God didn't say you wouldn't stumble. He just promised to pick you up, dust you off, correct you when you need it, and keep working with you. JI Packer says: 'A moment of conscious triumph makes one feel that after this, nothing will really matter; a moment of...disaster makes one feel like this is the end of everything. But neither feeling is realistic, because neither event is really what it's felt to be.' So don't get bent out of shape; by God's grace you'll handle it and come out wiser. (<i>2) Realise that God can bring good out of bad situations.</i> 'And we know that God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God and are called according to His purpose for them.' (Romans 8:28 NLT) In every success story you'll find struggles and setbacks. And you'll also find tenacious faith that refuses to give up. After listing a series of adversities that would make your worst day seem like 'a trip to the beach', Paul writes: '...None of these things move me...' (Acts 20:24 KJV) Where does such an attitude come from? It comes from knowing that God is working <i>in</i> you, He's working <i>with</i> you, and He's working <i>through</i> you. And as Ethel Waters used to say, 'My God don't sponsor no flops!'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['You must be born again.' John 3:7 NIV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says that 130 years after Adam first sinned, he was still fathering children 'in his own likeness'. (Genesis 5:3 NIV) And as Adam's descendants, we have all been born with the nature of fallen man. Sometimes people say, 'He's just like his dad.' Or we say, 'My dad was an angry man, now I've got his temper!' 'My dad couldn't stay with my mum, now I'm going through a divorce.' 'My dad was an alcoholic, now look at my drinking and drug-taking!' 'My dad was a workaholic, now I put in 14 hours a day.' 'My dad wasn't affectionate with us, now I don't know how to be loving toward my children.' History repeats itself over and over through our fallen nature. </p>
<p>Here's a fascinating example: 'Abraham said of his wife Sarah, &quot;She is my sister.&quot; So Abimelech king of Gerar sent for Sarah and took her.' (Genesis 20:2 NIV) Abraham was willing to sacrifice Sarah to save his own neck. What would you have done? Before you answer, notice that Isaac wasn't even born when his father did this. Yet years later, Isaac did exactly the same thing in the same place (Genesis 26:7). It's genetic! It's in our DNA.</p>
<p>But there's good news. When you receive Christ as your Saviour, He breaks that cycle. When you're 'born of the spirit', you get a new Father and a new nature (see John 3:3-6). You don't have to walk in the likeness of your earthly father any longer; you can walk in the likeness of your heavenly Father and become more like Him every day. Fed up with your old nature and ways? Ready for a new birth? Turn to Christ! </p>

<alias><![CDATA[are-you-being-tempted]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial...' James 1:12 NIV<br /><br /><p>You'll never be exempt from temptation. Each season of life just brings temptation in a different form. When you're young you'll struggle with things like the need for companionship and sexual fulfilment. In business you' might be tempted to distort the truth, cheat and pocket the money. When you become successful, if you're not careful you could become ego-driven, controlling and opinionated. The truth is, you never become so spiritual as to be exempt from temptation. After forty days of prayer and fasting, Satan tempted Jesus. Remember, you are as vulnerable to attack after a great spiritual experience as you are in your lowest moments. Satan understood Jesus' assignment and he was out to stop Him from accomplishing it. And he is out to stop you too! The battle you're in is not over the past, it's over the<i> future.</i> In the face of repeated temptation Jesus defeated Satan by using the Word of God, and you must too. Without it you have no defence. In what specific areas do you struggle? What's your strategy for victory? What percentage of the time are you successful? Which Scriptures have you memorised to help you conquer the tempter when he comes against you? Look at Samson, God's champion: blinded, chained, grinding corn like an ox in a Philistine dungeon. Sin has a blinding effect, a binding effect and a grinding effect. Prisons are filled with people who were too weak to stand up against Satan. Dreams crash daily on the rocks of temptation. Move the ship of your life away from those rocks while you still can.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...she prodded him day after day until he was tired to death.' Judges 16:16 NIV<br /><br /><p>When you're emotionally drained and under pressure, you're vulnerable to making serious mistakes. Samson did. Notice how Delilah brought him down: '...she prodded him day after day until he was tired to death. So he told her everything...' (Judges 16:16-17 NIV) You can attend church every week and read your Bible from cover to cover, but it will do you little good if you're running around physically and spiritually depleted. Furthermore, it's hard to live with such a person, and almost impossible to help them because their mind is in the grip of a negative force. You say, 'What's the answer?' (<i>1) Examine the company you're keeping.</i> When you need rest and relief go to the right people; when you're feeling down, reach for those who can lift you up. The Psalmist said, 'I am a friend to all...who follow Your precepts.' (Psalm 119:63 NIV) (<i>2) Check your fuel gauge.</i> Samson wore himself out in a good cause because he failed to replenish his soul. Are you doing that? One New Year's Day during the Tournament of Roses parade in California, a beautiful float suddenly sputtered and quit-out of petrol. The whole parade was held up until someone found a petrol can. The funny thing was that this float represented the Standard Oil Company. The Bible says, 'He gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak.' (Isaiah 40:29 NIV) As you spend time with God in prayer and the Scriptures, He will strengthen you and give you back your peace and stability. It's the ultimate therapy. It's also the ultimate protection!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...There is a greater power with us than with him.' 2 Chronicles 32:7 NIV<br /><br /><p>David was bringing food to his brothers at the battlefront when he saw Goliath. He wasn't thinking of becoming a hero, he just seized an opportunity other soldiers only dream about. Opportunities will catch you by surprise, and if you're not alert and ready, you'll miss them. What others discovered in David that day had been there all along! If you're a leader, you already possess the talent necessary to lead. But courage is what will establish you as a leader before others. The people we revere most, demonstrate courage-courage on the battlefield and in the boardroom, courage to defend the defenceless, or simply to attempt what nobody else thought possible. You say, 'But I don't have the money.' Don't worry, capital follows courage. <i>What</i> always precedes <i>how.</i> Don't be intimidated by the numbers. God is not moved by spreadsheets and market conditions, He's moved by faith. Don't let <i>how</i> intimidate you. It's because <i>how</i> is so challenging that it provides you with great opportunity. If the pathway to success were well lit it would already be crowded. If <i>how</i> wasn't a problem, someone else would already have figured it out. All progress begins with one question: <i>'What</i> needs to be done?' And somebody needs to be asking that question-why not you? The future belongs to those who have the courage to ask that question and the faith to hang in until they discover the answer. When the obstacles look too big and opposition seems too strong, stand on this Scripture: 'Do not be afraid or discouraged...for there is a greater power with us than with him.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Rise up; this matter is in your hands...take courage and do it.' Ezra 10:4 NIV<br /><br /><p>Pastor Andy Stanley writes: 'I keep a little card in my desk that reads: &quot;Dream no small dreams, for they stir not the hearts of men.&quot; More than once that simple statement has kept me from retreating from my dreams. I know from experience that it's impossible to lead without a dream. When leaders are no longer willing to dream, it's only a short time before followers are unwilling to follow. So dream! Dream big. Dream often. Somewhere in those random ideas that flood your mind, is one that will capture your heart and imagination. And that seemingly random idea may very well evolve into a vision for your life.' Every great accomplishment begins as a dream in someone's heart. All things are created twice: first in your mind, and then in your life. Dreamers allow their minds to wander outside the boundaries of what <i>is,</i> creating a mental picture of what <i>can</i> be. They are not always the most talented or best educated-just the ones who refuse to put brackets around their thinking or limit themselves to what others have done. Doing this requires courage, lots of it! On the heels of every dream there's a demon of doubt. No sooner is your dream conceived than your mind is suddenly filled with all the reasons why it may not work. And there will be folks around you who'll be quick to confirm those fears. In spite of that, you must forge ahead and dream; otherwise you'll spend the rest of your life fulfilling the dreams of others. 'Rise up; this matter is in <i>your</i> hands...take courage and do it.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Come, follow Me,' Jesus said, 'and I will make you fishers of men.' Mark 1:17 NIV<br /><br /><p>If you want to experience God's blessing in a new way, get ready to leave your comfort zone. When Jesus called His disciples they were on familiar turf, doing what they knew best: fishing. But they couldn't stay there and follow Him. Neither can you. The Bible records: 'As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net...for they were fishermen. 'Come, follow Me,' Jesus said, 'and I will make you fishers of men.' At once they left their nets and followed Him.' (Mark 1:16-18 NIV) Notice, they had to leave the security of the familiar in order to fulfil their destiny. And in case you think you are too old to try something new, Abraham was seventy-five when he left the comforts of home to go out and establish a new nation. Your age is not the issue, your faith is. Understand this: today you are just one step of obedience away from the next truth God wants you to learn about Him, so you can't afford to stay where you are. We all have a tendency to cling to the 'tried and true'. The trouble with that is, when you are no longer being stretched you begin to shrink, you become complacent, you think you can handle things on your own, and you stop growing. That's a dangerous place to be. If you feel restless at heart today and believe that God has more for you than you've been settling for, then it's time to confront your fears, walk through them and launch out into a new experience with Him.</p>

We want our friends to admire us, so we exaggerate. We want people to respect us, so we live in houses we can't afford and rack up bills we can't pay. Ananias and Sapphira sold a piece of property and gave a portion of the money to the church. But they lied, claiming the land sold for the amount of money they gave (Acts 5). Their sin was not in holding back some money for themselves; it was in misrepresenting the truth. And their deceit resulted in their deaths. You say, 'I'm glad God doesn't strike people dead today for lying.' Don't be so sure. Lying results in the death of: (<i>1) A marriage.</i> Falsehoods are termites in the trunk of the family tree. (<i>2) A conscience.</i> The tragedy of the second lie is that it's always easier to tell than the first. (<i>3) A career.</i> Just ask the employee who got fired for embezzlement. (<i>4) Faith.</i> Think: how can God use us if we won't tell the truth? Every American football team has a player assigned to carry the play from the coach to the huddle. But what if the player doesn't tell the truth? What if the coach calls for a pass but the player says the coach calls for a run? The coach won't call on him very long. God says if you are honest in small things He will trust you with greater things (Matthew 25:21). So, can God trust you?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...You desire truth in the inward parts...' Psalm 51:6 NKJV<br /><br /><p>According to <i>Psychology Today,</i> more people say they have cheated on their marriage partners than on their income tax returns or expense accounts. Nearly half say that if they scratched another car in the parking lot they would drive away without leaving a note, although 89 percent agree that it would be wrong. Perhaps the question shouldn't be, 'Why does God demand such honesty of us?' but rather, 'Why do we tolerate such dishonesty?' Jeremiah weighs in: 'The heart is deceitful above all things...' (Jeremiah 17:9 NIV) For many of us, our credo is, 'You shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you squirm.' At the age of three, when Mum asked, 'Did you hit your little brother?' we knew that honesty had its consequences. So we learned to rationalise: 'Uhhhh, well, it's not <i>really</i> lying.' And we learned to cover things up. 'Did I hit my baby brother? That all depends on how you interpret the word <i>hit.</i> I mean, sure, I made contact with him, but would a jury consider it a hit? Everything is relative, you know.' Or we excuse ourselves: 'Did I hit my baby brother? Yes, Mum, I did. But it's not my fault. Had I been born with nonaggressive chromosomes and had you not permitted me to watch television, it would never have happened. So I can say I hit my brother, but the fault isn't mine. I'm a victim of nurture and nature.' We might smile, but the Psalmist said, 'You desire truth in the inward parts, and in the hidden part You will make me to know wisdom.' And that's the truth about the truth.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Well done, good and faithful servant...' Matthew 25:23 NKJV<br /><br /><p>In <i>Discipleship Journal</i> Paul Thigpen writes: 'I remember coming home one afternoon to discover that the kitchen I had worked so hard to clean only a few hours before, was now a terrible wreck. My young daughter had obviously been busy &quot;cooking&quot; and the ingredients were scattered, along with dirty bowls and utensils, across the counters and floor. I was not happy with the situation. Then, as I looked a little more closely at the mess I spied a tiny note on the table, clumsily written and smeared with chocolaty fingerprints. The message was short-&quot;I'm makin sumthin 4 you, Dad&quot;-and it was signed, &quot;Your Angel.&quot; In the midst of that disarray, and despite my irritation, joy suddenly sprang up in my heart, sweet and pure. My attention had been redirected from the problem to the little girl I loved. As I encountered her in that brief note, I delighted in her. With her simple goodness in focus, I could take pleasure in seeing her hand at work in the situation that seemed otherwise disastrous.' In the parable of the talents, Jesus pointed out that the two servants who invested and multiplied what had been entrusted to them received the Master's highest commendation: 'Well done, good and faithful servant.' On the other hand, the servant who buried his gifts rather than risk and lose, received the Master's harshest condemnation: '...You wicked and lazy servant...' (Matthew 25:26 NKJV) Commendation or condemnation: which will you receive? God doesn't say, 'If you can't do it right, don't do it at all.' No, He's pleased when you try, make mistakes, learn from them and grow. So keep trying!</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Remember...those who are mistreated.' Hebrews 13:3 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Do you ever pray for persecuted Christians in other countries? You should, because they are your spiritual family. John writes: '...I saw...those who had been slain because of the Word of God and the testimony they had maintained.' (Revelation 6:9 NIV) Increasingly, believers around the world are giving their lives for the cause of Christ and the testimony they've maintained in the face of hostility. 'Are you trying to make me feel bad?' you ask. No, just: (<i>1) More prayerful.</i> 'Remember those in prison as if you were their fellow prisoners, and those who are mistreated as if you yourselves were suffering.' Next time you hit your thumb with a hammer and your whole body aches, remember this truth and pray for the great big worldwide body of believers, many of whom are still being mistreated, imprisoned, tortured, and even killed in Christ's name. (<i>2) More grateful.</i> You say, 'Grateful for what?' That your faith is so effective that you're on Satan's hit list; that he considers you a threat to his kingdom and his agenda in the earth.<i> (3) More faithful. </i>Richard Wurmbrand, who wrote <i>Tortured For Christ,</i> said, 'What a person really believes is not what he says in his creeds, but what he's willing to die for.' Now, the odds are that you will never be called upon to die for Jesus. But the question is, if you're not willing to die for Him, what are the chances you'll really live for Him? Before you can answer that question you must ask yourself, 'How much of my time, my treasure and my talents am I investing into His Kingdom?'</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...He will receive his reward.' 1 Corinthians 3:14 NIV<br /><br /><p>Read these three Scriptures: (1) '...The fire will test the quality of each man's work. If what he has built survives, he will receive his reward. If it is burned up, he will suffer loss...' (1 Corinthians 3:13-15 NIV) (2) 'No one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for Me and the Gospel will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age (homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children and fields-and with them, persecutions)...' (Mark 10:29-30 NIV) (3) 'When you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, and you will be blessed. Although they cannot repay you, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.' (Luke 14:13-14 NIV) These Scriptures clearly teach that God <i>records</i> your deeds and <i>rewards</i> you for them. Some of your rewards will come in this life, and some will come in the next. If you fail to understand that, you'll find yourself saying, 'I served God faithfully, so why am I still struggling? Doesn't God notice or care?' Yes, God notices and He cares. But He doesn't promise that the work you do for Him now will always result in gain from Him now. Many of the rewards God has for us are so great that it will take eternity to appreciate and enjoy them. Jesus said, 'Whoever gives you a cup of water to drink in My name...will by no means lose his reward.' (Mark 9:41 NKJV) No deed for God will be overlooked or go unrewarded-even a cup of cold water or a prayer in the middle of the night.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...He will receive his reward.' 1 Corinthians 3:14 NIV<br /><br /><p>How will God evaluate and reward what you did for Him during your lifetime here on earth? Based on three tests:<i> (1) The relationship test.</i> The life God rewards is not a life of performance apart from relationship with Him. Jesus pointed out that unless you abide in Him and obey His commandments, you will not bear fruit for Him (John 15:5). Jesus commended the church at Ephesus for their good works, then turned around and condemned them because they hadn't kept their love for Him alive. 'I know your works, your labour, your patience...Nevertheless I have this against you, that you have left your first love.' (Revelation 2:2-4 NKJV) (<i>2) The motive test.</i> Jesus said to the Pharisees, 'Take heed that you do not do your charitable deeds before men, to be seen by them. Otherwise you have no reward...in Heaven.' (Matthew 6:1 NKJV) Note the words 'to be seen'. What should our motive be? To serve God and bring glory to Him! Even simple things like eating and drinking can do that (1 Corinthians 10:31). On the other hand, your most religious actions are worthless if your motive is to enhance your own ego and reputation. (<i>3) The love test.</i> Christ said, 'Love your enemies, do good, and lend, hoping for nothing in return; and your reward will be great...' (Luke 6:35 NKJV) When it comes to good works, <i>why</i> is always more important than <i>what</i>. The Bible says, 'Look to yourselves, that we do not lose those things we worked for, but that we may receive a full reward.' (2 John 1:8 NKJV) So keep your heart pure and your motives right!</p>

<alias><![CDATA[the-benefits-of-making-jesus-lord]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...No one can say that Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit.' 1 Corinthians 12:3 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Making Jesus 'Lord' of your life means that He must have the first and last word in all things which concern you. It means you are called to walk with Him, to prove yourself valuable to Him, to please Him and do what He wants, when He wants it, and in the way He wants it done. Here are three great benefits that come from putting Jesus behind the wheel and making Him 'Lord'. (<i>1) When you don't know what to say, He will tell you.</i> 'The Sovereign Lord has given Me His words of wisdom, so that I may know how to comfort the weary. Morning by morning He wakens Me and opens My understanding to His will. The Sovereign Lord has spoken to Me, and I have listened. I have not rebelled or turned away.' (Isaiah 50:4-5 NLT) (<i>2) When you can't defend yourself, He will fight for you.</i> '...The Lord is my fortress, protecting me from danger, so why should I tremble? When evil people come to devour me...they will stumble and fall. Though a mighty army surrounds me, my heart will not be afraid. Even if I am attacked, I will remain confident.' (Psalm 27:1-3 NLT)<i> (3) When the burden feels too heavy, He will carry it for you.</i> 'Give your burdens to the Lord, and He will take care of you. He will not permit the godly to slip and fall.' (Psalm 55:22 NLT) And these three benefits are yours when you make Jesus 'Lord' over every area of your life.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...And they chose...Philip...' Acts 6:5 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says: 'We...came to Caesarea, and entered the house of Philip...this man had four virgin daughters who prophesied.' (Acts 21:8-9) Here's the second thing that qualified Philip for leadership in the church: <i>he knew how to build a strong family.</i> You say, 'Does that mean if I've failed in marriage God won't use me?' No, Samuel was one of Israel's greatest prophets, yet he failed with his children. David wrote Psalms, yet his family life was a shambles. Interestingly, neither Samuel nor David had much to say in Scripture about family life. When it comes to church leadership, to have credibility in God's house you must first have it in your own. So, pastor: (1) Don't sacrifice your family for your church. (2) Don't sacrifice your children for your congregation. (3) Don't sacrifice your spouse for your children. (4) Don't sacrifice the important for the urgent. The Bible gives us qualifications for leadership in the church. Paul writes that a leader '...must be faithful to his wife, and his children must be believers who don't have a reputation for being wild or rebellious... He must not be arrogant or quick-tempered; he must not be a heavy drinker, violent or dishonest with money... He must enjoy having guests in his home, and he must love what is good. He must live wisely and be just. He must live a devout and disciplined life. He must have a strong belief in the trustworthy message he was taught; then he will be able to encourage others with wholesome teaching and show those who oppose it where they are wrong.' (Titus 1:6-9 NLT) So, do you qualify?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...And they chose...Philip...' Acts 6:5 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Philip was one of seven men chosen to lead the New Testament church. Why? Because he had certain qualities. Let's look at two of them: <i>He had the ability to be Spirit-led. </i>Philip started out as a deacon working in the administration department of the church. But he went on to become an evangelist, conducting a city-wide crusade in Samaria. 'Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ to them. And the multitudes with one accord heeded the things spoken by Philip, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.' (Acts 8:5-6 NKJV) Now, the idea of staying there and building a great church must have been very appealing to Philip. But God had other plans. 'An angel of the Lord spoke to Philip... &quot;Arise and go toward the...desert.&quot; So he arose and went...' (Acts 8:26-27 NKJV) 'Go <i>where?</i> To the <i>desert?</i> Are You serious, Lord?' Here's a thought: when God speaks to you He may not tell you what you want to hear, or send you where you'd like to go. Have you considered that? Is that why you're not actively seeking His guidance? Big doors swing on little hinges. In the desert Philip met the Ethiopian eunuch, the secretary of the treasury, serving the Queen of Ethiopia. Philip's assignment was to introduce him to Christ and baptise him. After that the eunuch returned to Ethiopia and history records multitudes there were won to Christ as a result. But it only happened because Philip could leave his comfort zone, step out in faith and follow God. Bottom line: in order to lead others you must know how to be led by God.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Watch out that no...bitterness grows up...' Hebrews 12:15 NLT<br /><br /><p>Betrayal is something <i>others</i> do to you; bitterness is something <i>you</i> do to yourself. It's impossible to go through life without being hurt. It may be an unfaithful spouse, an employee who slanders you or a boss who fires you without explanation. Sitting at supper with His disciples, Jesus said, 'One of you will betray Me.' (Mark 14:18 NIV) Shortly after that, Judas betrayed Him with a kiss. Some folks will kiss you today and kick you tomorrow. But Jesus refused to become bitter. That's because He knew Judas' kiss would usher Him into His destiny. Nor did Jesus turn His back on Peter when he denied Him. Instead, Peter was the only one He mentioned by name when He arranged to meet His disciples for breakfast following the resurrection. Jesus saw Peter in the light of his potential, not his problems. What Peter did at one moment didn't keep Jesus from seeing what he would become when His grace touched Peter's life. And you must be that way too. This is why Paul wrote: 'Get rid of all bitterness... Instead, be kind to each other, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, just as God through Christ has forgiven you.' (Ephesians 4:31-32 NLT) So eliminate any words of bitterness from your conversation. Stop rehearsing the details of your past unless it's to teach and encourage others to rise above theirs. How often do you revisit your old issues? What are you doing to make sure no bitterness remains in your heart? God says, 'Do not remember the former things, nor consider the things of old. Behold, I will do a new thing.' (Isaiah 43:18-19 NKJV)</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['I delight to do Your will, O my God...' Psalm 40:8 NKJV<br /><br /><p>To keep your dream alive and find fulfilment in the pursuit of it, you must allow yourself to <i>keep</i> dreaming. God gave Joseph two dreams: in the first, other sheaves of wheat bowed down to his; in the second, other stars bowed down to his. Note, he dreamed progressively higher, from sheaves to stars. Most creative people intuitively understand the importance of dreaming as a process for inspiration, motivation and fulfilment. George Lucas, creator and producer of the <i>Star Wars</i> movies<i>,</i> says that one thing that kept him and his colleagues going during the difficult times was this: 'We were always dreaming of how it was going to be.' If you are not a naturally creative person, then you have to learn how to <i>keep</i> dreaming. And if you can do it with a sense of humour, that doesn't hurt. There's a story about a student riding a bicycle on a college campus. On his t-shirt was the message: 'I am going to be a doctor.' On the bike was a sign that also had a message: 'I am going to be a Mercedes.' That's somebody who had learned to keep dreaming! Andrew Carnegie, a Christian philanthropist during the early 1900s, said, 'If you want to be happy, set a goal that commands your thoughts, liberates your energy, and inspires your hopes.' In other words-keep your dream alive and it will keep you alive. When David said, 'I delight to do Your will, O my God,' he simply meant you'll find your highest fulfilment in doing what God put you on this earth to do.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Do not throw away your confidence; it will be...rewarded.' Hebrews 10:35 NIV<br /><br /><p>Consultant Dan Sullivan talks about the difference between our 'ideals' and our 'actuals'. He says, 'The ideal is a picture we create of future desirable events and situations that enables us to move forward in time. The ideal does not actually exist outside our minds, nor is it achievable.' Why? Because it depends on everything being perfect. Life is, at best, messy. It's filled with surprises-both good and bad. If you need your ideal dream to come into being in order to feel fulfilled, you will <i>never</i> be fulfilled. That doesn't mean you should cast aside your ideal vision. It is useful for helping you to establish goals, find internal motivation, and strive for excellence. However, you also need to temper it. Where idealistic dreams expect to be realised immediately, realistic dreams make you appreciate the time it takes for them to become a reality. Where idealistic dreams do not tolerate anything less than perfection, realistic dreams leave room for you to be human and imperfect. Where idealistic dreams set you up for disappointment, realistic dreams set you up for success. The man who never made a mistake, never made anything. The reason God doesn't whitewash His heroes in the Bible is to let you know that in spite of your flaws, He can use you to accomplish great things. You say, 'But am I not supposed to work on my weaknesses?' Yes, but you'll only succeed in what you're called to do by working from your God-given strengths.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['In due season He will honour you with every blessing.' Psalm 37:34 TLB<br /><br /><p>There is usually a huge gap between the birth of a dream and the achievement of that dream. The question you have to ask yourself is whether it will be a fulfilment gap or a frustration gap. If it's a frustration gap you'll be miserable most of the days you're in it. And every day that you're frustrated instead of fulfilled, you lessen the odds that you'll be able to keep moving forward toward your dream. Author Seth Godin calls this gap between when you set out to do something and when you actually start to see significant results 'the dip'. The dip represents the adversity you must face, the learning curve you must go through and the hard work you must be willing to invest between conception and realisation. If the dip you are in seems to be a road without end, here are some Scriptures you need to stand on: 'Don't be impatient for the Lord to act! Keep travelling steadily along His pathway and in due season He will honour you with every blessing.' (Psalm 37:34 TLB) 'Do not throw away your confidence; it will be richly rewarded. You need to persevere so that when you have done the will of God, you will receive what He has promised.' (Hebrews 10:35-36 NIV) 'So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.' (2 Corinthians 4:18 NIV) God has promised you more than just the <i>fulfilment</i> of your dream; He has promised <i>joy</i> in each step you take toward it.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord...' 2 Peter 3:18 NKJV<br /><br /><p>F<i>irst, make up your mind.</i> Spiritual growth doesn't happen by osmosis. You don't just wake up with it one morning; you have to set your heart on it and make it your highest priority. Otherwise it won't happen. The Bible says: 'Let not that man suppose he will receive anything from the Lord; he is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.' (James 1:7 NKJV) <i>Second, break up your will.</i> Until your will is surrendered to God and brought into alignment with His purposes, you will go in circles spiritually. Israel went in circles in the wilderness for forty years, yet they were only eighteen kilometres from the Promised Land. Don't let that happen to you. 'Now may the God of peace...make you complete in every good work to do His will, working in you what is well pleasing in His sight.' (Hebrews 13:20-21 NKJV) <i>Third, wake up your faith.</i> Obey the leadings of God's Spirit. Don't be afraid, He will not let you down. Just make sure you don't let Him down. 'Without faith it is impossible to please Him, for He who comes to God must believe that He is...a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.' (Hebrews 11:6 NKJV) <i>Fourth, take up your cross.</i> '...If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow Me. For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it.' (Matthew 16:24-25 NKJV) If you're serious about building a relationship with the Lord, do these four things.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Don't give up.' Galatians 6:9 NLT<br /><br /><p>James Watt spent twelve years perfecting the steam engine. William Harvey worked for eight years to demonstrate how blood circulated in the human body, then for another twenty-five years trying to convince the medical establishment. Most of us underestimate the time it takes to achieve anything of lasting value. You've got to be willing to pay your dues. Cutting corners is a sign of impatience and poor self-discipline. The secret of every breakthrough is to follow through. Albert Gray says, 'The common denominator of all success lies in forming the habit of doing things that failures don't like to do.' If you find yourself continually giving in to your moods, you need to change your <i>approach</i> to doing things. To do this, you must set standards for yourself that require accountability. Suffering a consequence for not following through will keep you on track like nothing else. Once your new standards are in place, work according to them, not your moods; that will get you going in the right direction. Self-discipline is a quality that's won only through practice. Successful people have learned to do what doesn't come naturally. They are willing to confront discomfort, distractions and doubt, and act in spite of them. RH Macy, founder of Macy's department stores, failed at five different professions-whaler, retail clerk, gold miner, stockbroker, real estate broker-before he finally succeeded. When asked what sustained him through failure after failure he replied, 'Purpose and persistence.' That's what separates those who achieve from those who merely dream! It's why Paul wrote: 'Don't get discouraged and give up, for we will reap a harvest of blessing at the appropriate time.' (Galatians 6:9 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Great is your reward in Heaven...' Luke 6:23 NIV<br /><br /><p>Read these three Scriptures carefully: '...He shall <i>reward</i> every man according to his works.' (Matthew 16:27 KJV) '...You will have <i>treasure</i> in Heaven...' (Matthew 19:21 NIV) '...You will be <i>repaid</i> at the resurrection...' (Luke 14:14 NIV) God is keeping track of what you do for Him each day. You have more to gain by serving the Lord than you ever imagined. Yes, He will bless and reward you in this life, but nothing by comparison to what awaits you in the next one. When you know that, simple decisions such as how you spend your time, your money and your energy suddenly become opportunities with great promise. Once you understand that, you begin to live with an unshakable certainty that everything you do today-matters forever. And that truth can change your life for the better! Jesus said: 'Blessed are you when men hate you...exclude you...and reject your name as evil...Rejoice in that day and leap for joy...' (Luke 6:22-23 NIV) Now Jesus didn't mean that when you're mistreated on His behalf, you'll be so happy you'll want to dance an Irish jig. No, He said, 'Great is your reward in Heaven.' Those six words reveal <i>why</i> you can rejoice in the worst of circumstances. You see, there's a direct connection between something you do for God on earth, and something 'great' He's going to do for you in Heaven. Jesus isn't asking you to enjoy misery on His behalf; that's masochism. He's saying that your rewards in Heaven, for certain actions on earth, will be so wonderful that simply <i>knowing</i> they're coming can transform how you live now. It can actually create spontaneous outbursts of joy!</p>

<alias><![CDATA[sharing-your-dream-1]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...That you may be perfectly united in mind and thought.' 1 Corinthians 1:10 NIV<br /><br /><p>To fulfil your dream you must know how to share it with others. And to do that successfully you must be able to connect with them in four ways. <i>First, you must connect with them logically.</i> What people don't believe, they don't buy into. So your first step is to gain credibility. If you don't, you will not be able to proceed any further. How do you do that? By communicating a realistic understanding of the situation as it is today. Every time you share your vision, one of the first things people will ask is: 'But what about...?' If they don't ask it out loud, they say it to themselves. And they will keep asking it until you have addressed all their concerns. This requires being extremely thorough when sharing your dream, and not dwelling on its positive benefits to the exclusion of the challenges. <i>Secondly, you must provide a sound strategy they can believe in.</i> If a dream seems too large and unattainable, people will become discouraged and quickly lose interest. When big dreams are broken down into smaller pieces and different pieces are given to talented individuals, the task seems more attainable and each person involved has an increased sense of personal ownership and involvement. There is a real art to communicating all this effectively, without getting bogged down in details or boring people. You have to give enough information to satisfy most people, but not so much that you lose them. All this takes skill, practice and God's help. But to share your dream with others, you must learn to do it.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...You...became my partners...' Philippians 4:15 TLB <br /><br /><p><i>Thirdly, you must share your dream emotionally.</i> Paul knew how to do this: '...You Philippians became my partners...what makes me happiest is the well-earned reward you will have...' (vv15-17 TLB) Get people excited about the rewards. So show them the dream from <i>their</i> perspective! Ralph Waldo Emerson struggled, trying to wrestle a young calf into his barn. He was ready to give up when an Irish servant girl walked over to the calf, stuck her finger in its mouth, and the calf, associating the sensation with its mother, followed the girl into the barn. Pushing and prodding people doesn't work. But if you help them to feel that they will benefit personally, they're likely to go along. People do things for their own reasons, not yours. And their reasons are almost always tied to their emotions. Don't be afraid to show people your heart. People buy into the dreamer before they buy into the dream. You may be able to communicate the idea of your dream in a few minutes, but it will take a lot longer to convince people of where your heart is. It will require patience. Of course you are enthusiastic, but you must adapt your stride to the slower pace of others. If you run too far ahead, you will lose your followers. Generally, people have to hear an idea at least seven times before they embrace it and call it their own. Ten percent of people are pioneers, 70 percent are settlers and 20 percent are antagonists. Make it your goal to win over the pioneers, to wait for the settlers and to leave the antagonists behind.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Lord, open his eyes so he may see...' 2 Kings 6:17 NIV <br /><br /><p><i>Fourthly, you must share your dream visually.</i> Only when people 'see it' will they buy into it. People are in search of significance; they want to feel like they are part of something bigger than themselves. Nora Watson observed: 'Most of us are looking for a calling, not a job. Most of us...have jobs that are too small for our spirit.' When a dream is truly great, it benefits everyone. Your job is to help people see what those benefits are. You need to help them connect with the opportunities for achieving personal growth, finding fulfilment and increasing their self-esteem. You need to provide them with every reason you have for joining. If you can't offer them plenty of legitimate reasons for doing so, then you have no business trying to recruit them in the first place. Will this be easy? No, it never is. Even people who say they desire a dream often don't want it. What they want is the <i>result</i> of the dream, not the <i>price</i> required to achieve it. Look at all the TV commercials for diets. People see before and after pictures, and they want the 'after'. But if you live your dream, practice integrity and achieve a degree of success, people will see what the dream has done for you and that will make them want it too. How will you know when you have successfully shared your dream with someone else? Because they will take ownership of it, add to it and want to make it even bigger and better. When that happens, your dream becomes bigger than you or your team.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['All these men of war...were of one mind to make David king.' 1 Chronicles 12:38 NKJV<br /><br /><p>David's 'mighty men' established his rule in Israel. Likewise, you are called to submit to the Lordship of Christ and demonstrate to the world what it's like to live according to the rules-and benefits-of His Kingdom. Jesus would not have taught you to pray, 'Your Kingdom come. Your will be done on earth...,' if it's a prayer God wouldn't answer (Matthew 6:10 NKJV). And He answers it through people like you. So, are you interested in becoming a mighty man or woman of God? Then let's look at King David's army. First: <i>They were balanced!</i> 'They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left...' (1 Chronicles 12:2 KJV) When you go to extremes and get out of balance, you hurt God's Kingdom rather than help it. For example, there are nine 'gifts' of the Spirit and nine 'fruits' of the Spirit listed in Scripture. The gifts are skill sets needed to get the job done. The fruits are Christ-like qualities that help us work together. And you must have both! Notice how God designed the garments of the high priest. On the hem at the bottom of his robe were pomegranates and bells-fruits and, surely, gifts. Why? Perhaps one reason is the bells would clang harshly against each other. So God placed pomegranates in between to keep that from happening. Getting the idea? If you're joyful at church but cantankerous at home, you're out of balance. If you can talk to Christians but you've nothing to say to non-Christians, you're out of balance. Spiritually speaking, you're supposed to be ambidextrous!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...A man leaves his father and mother and is joined to his wife...' Matthew 19:5 NLT<br /><br /><p>After arguing for hours, a couple drove along in silence. Suddenly they passed a barnyard filled with mules and jackasses. Sarcastically, the husband asked, 'Relatives of yours?' The wife replied, 'Yes, in-laws.'</p>
<p>Marriage was God's idea, and it was a good one. Picking up the theme, Jesus said, 'A man leaves his father and mother and is joined to his wife.' In marriage, 'two's company, three's a crowd!' So here are Ten Commandments for being a good in-law: (1) Thou shalt love, honour and respect the couple. (2) Thou shalt grant them independence, resisting the urge to show them 'a better way' of doing things. (3) Thou shalt be loyal and not criticise them, for, '[God] will apply to you the same rules you apply to others...' (Matthew 7:2 GNT) (4) Thou shalt not find fault: 'Do not judge others, so that God will not judge you...' (Matthew 7:1 GNT) (5) Thou shalt not outwear thy welcome, and always call before thou showest up at their dwelling. 'Don't visit...too often; they may get tired of you...' (Proverbs 25:17 GNT) (6) Thou shalt not expect them to visit thee too often. (7) Thou shalt refrain from giving unsolicited advice: 'Stupid people express [themselves] openly, but sensible people are patient and hold it back.' (Proverbs 29:11 GNT) (8) Thou shalt not talk about how thou wantest grandchildren unless they are already on the way. (9) Thou shalt respect their home decorating taste even when it differeth from thine. (10) Thou shalt pray for them daily and without fail. If you are an in-law who doesn't want to be viewed as an out-law, live by these commandments!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Above all else, guard your heart...' Proverbs 4:23 NIV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says: 'Above all else, guard your heart, for it is the wellspring of life.' The <i>position</i> you hold in life may cause people to take notice of you, but only your <i>integrity</i> will cause them to respect you and be willing to follow you. And integrity is only established when it becomes clear to everyone that progress, financial reward and recognition are not your gods; that you value something more, something you refuse to give up for profit or popularity. With integrity comes influence. You can manage people without integrity but you can't influence them without it. Talking one way and living another will wound you. And depending on time and circumstance, you may not be able to recover from it. You say, 'How I conduct my private life is nobody else's business.' Wrong! When people see a difference between what you demand of others and what you demand of yourself, it'll erode their respect for you every time. Your position may make you secure, but your influence with others will always remain fragile. At any given time you are only one decision, one word or one action away from destroying what it took years to build. Why is it important to keep this in mind? Because the fastest route from where you are today to where you will be tomorrow is not always the most honourable one. Leading and being the person you want to be doesn't come easy and doesn't always line up. It's in those moments, however, that you discover a great deal about yourself-you find out what you truly stand for!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...By my God I can leap over a wall.' 2 Samuel 22:30 NKJV<br /><br /><p>What 'wall' stands between you and God's blessing? Limited resources? Past failures? Does the job look too big and you feel too small? Rise up and say, 'For by You I can run against a troop; by my God I can leap over a wall.' Instead of accepting what your sight and your senses tell you, stand on the promises God has given you in His Word. On the other side of the wall there is victory for you. AB Simpson said, 'You will never learn faith in comfortable surroundings.' It was after the disciples came through the storm that they asked, 'What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey Him?' (Matthew 8:27 KJV) The One who commanded them to get into the boat knew there would be a storm, yet He sent them into it. Why? To develop their faith!</p>
<p>A little boy was crossing the ocean with his father, who was captain of the ship, when they ran into a terrible storm. The waves tossed them about like a cork and everyone was sick with fear. But he sat unafraid, his eyes directed toward a certain spot. When someone asked him why he was not afraid, he answered; 'I have my eye on that little window. Through it I can see the bridge, and on that bridge is my father. He's the captain of this ship. He has taken it through many storms and I know he will take it through this one too.' Rejoice, you will make it through this storm and get to the other side. God has promised it. Start saying, 'By my God I can.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...There is death in the pot!...' 2 Kings 4:40 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says: 'Elijah returned to Gilgal, and there was a famine in the land. Now the sons of the prophets were sitting before him; and he said to his servant, &quot;Put on the large pot, and boil stew...&quot; So one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered from it a lapful of wild gourds, and came and sliced them into the pot of stew, though they did not know what they were. Then they served it to the men to eat. Now it happened, as they were eating the stew, that they cried out and said, &quot;Man of God, there is death in the pot!&quot; And they could not eat it. So he said, &quot;Then bring some flour.&quot; And he put it into the pot, and said, &quot;Serve it to the people, that they may eat.&quot; And there was nothing harmful in the pot.' (vv38-41 NKJV) Notice what they threw into the pot to counteract the poison: 'flour' which represents God's Word, 'the bread of life.' Instead of letting your disappointments make you sour, reach for the Scriptures. Instead of letting resentment infect your attitude, turn to the Scriptures and let God show you how to deal with it. Don't let bad experiences leave a bad taste in your mouth. Who was threatened that day? 'The sons of the prophets'-those with great potential, those God planned to use. How can you keep your heart right and your future protected? Jesus answers, '[Now] you are already clean because of the Word which I have spoken to you.' (John 15:3 NKJV) </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Love never fails...' 1 Corinthians 13:8 NKJV<br /><br /><p><i>Fourth, a revival of love.</i> The Bible says, 'Love never fails.' Stop and think about that for a moment. Just about everything else in life fails, but love doesn't. There's a cute story about a lady who said to her husband, 'Will you love me when I'm old?' He replied, 'Yes, dear.' She said, 'But will you love me when my hair is grey?' He replied, 'Yes, dear, I've loved you through seven different shades already, why would I change my mind when you're grey?' You can score points for having high morals and have all your theological ducks in a row, but if you don't love people-in every circumstance of life-you've failed where it counts most. Paul writes: 'If I had the gift of prophecy, and if I understood all of God's secret plans and possessed all knowledge, and if I had such faith that I could move mountains, but didn't love others, I would be nothing. If I gave everything I have to the poor and even sacrificed my body, I could boast about it, but if I didn't love others, I would have gained nothing... Love never gives up, never loses faith, is always hopeful, and endures through every circumstance.' (vv2-7 NLT) It took a lot of commitment to be a Pharisee. Living according to the law of Moses demanded incredible discipline and dedication. Why did Jesus condemn the Pharisees so often? Because they had light in their heads but no love in their hearts! When we, the church, experience a revival of love we won't need to advertise; people will break down the doors to get in. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Your life is shaped by your thoughts.' Proverbs 4:23 GNT<br /><br /><p>Ever watch a food commercial on television and suddenly feel hungry? That's the power of suggestion. Whatever can grab your attention can capture you. Simply repeating, 'I must stop drinking, or smoking, or overeating, or lusting,' doesn't work because it just keeps you thinking about what you <i>don't</i> want. Instead of trying to remove those thoughts, replace them. Once your focus is on something good, evil begins to lose its grip. Only by reprogramming your mind can you keep it centred on the right things. The Bible says: 'Don't let evil get the upper hand but conquer evil by doing good.' (Romans 12:21 TLB) Satan can't get and keep your attention when your mind is given to something else. That's why Paul writes: '...Fill your minds with...good...' (Philippians 4:8 GNT) Fighting a thought is futile; it only strengthens the connection between you and it. By dwelling on it you actually reinforce it. Hit the remote; change the channel! Furthermore, you don't overcome temptation by fighting the <i>feeling</i> of it. The more you fight a feeling, the more it engages and draws you. Turn your attention to something better! Your <i>mind</i> is where the battle is won or lost. Start managing your mind and monitoring your media intake. The Bible says, 'Your life is shaped by your thoughts.' The Psalmist prayed, 'Keep me from paying attention to what is worthless...' (Psalm 119:37 GNT) Is this easy to do? No, it takes discipline and practice. But with time, and God's grace, you can change the way you think and overcome temptation</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...God is no respecter of persons.' Acts 10:34 KJV<br /><br /><p>Prejudice is the product of a lazy mind. It's contempt, prior to investigation. Your first impression of someone is incomplete and often inaccurate. Don't assume your intuition is always right. Don't make lasting decisions based on limited insights. Your success in life will be adversely affected by prejudice, fear and any form of discrimination you allow to colour your thinking. Jesus never determined a person's worth based on their race, gender, financial status or appearance. He was comfortable in the presence of fishermen and tax collectors. He was at ease with the rich and the poor. He knew that every person He met had potential and He never looked down on them because of their past. Born to a mother who conceived Him as a virgin, He knew what it meant to have a questionable background and be subject to the rumour mill. But He rose above it. And He broke tradition. The Samaritans were considered such a lower class of people that Jews wouldn't talk to them. But Jesus did. In fact, He went out of His way to meet with a five-times-married Samaritan woman, discussing the mysteries of worship with her and changing her life. When Peter, who struggled with prejudice, was called to introduce the Gospel to the first group of Gentiles, he had to acknowledge, 'I perceive that God is no respecter of persons.' That day God dealt with some of Peter's deep-seated biases. And He will deal with yours too! If 'God so loved the world' but you don't, how can you claim to be 'godly'?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['[God] has delivered us from the power of darkness...'Colossians 1:13 NKJV<br /><br /><p>History's crowning moment occurred when '...Christ died for the ungodly.' (Romans 5:6 KJV) He didn't just die for His friends and supporters; He died for people who despised Him. It was no quid-pro-quo deal where Jesus said: 'I'll accept you if you accept me.' No, it was a selfless, one-sided act of love. No conditions, nothing demanded in return. As a result, God 'delivered us from the power of darkness and conveyed us into the Kingdom of the dear Son.' Selah! Stop and meditate on these advantages you enjoy through Jesus' blood: (1) <i>You've been delivered</i>. The Greek word Paul used means <i>to rescue by drawing us to Himself</i>. Your deliverance was a deeply personal event to Jesus. By His shed blood He drew you to Himself. The distance sin had put between you and God was reversed and you were '...accepted in the beloved.' (Ephesians 1:6 KJV) (2) <i>You've been freed from the power of darkness</i>. That 'power' is Satan's tyranny over those living under his control. Christ's blood liberated you from the darkness, ignorance and blindness Satan uses to deceive and manipulate you. (3) <i>You've been translated into the Kingdom of God's Son</i>. The word 'translated' implies being transferred from one place to another. In Paul's day superpowers like Rome would annex other nations and make them part of Roman territory. Often the conquered were better off under Rome, enjoying such privileges as safety, food, mail service and travel protection. Christ's blood transferred you into His Kingdom to enjoy these advantages: guaranteed protection, abundant provision for all your needs, full status of sonship, and unlimited access to come before His throne.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['He has reconciled you to Himself through the death of Christ...' Colossians 1:22 NLT<br /><br /><p>Observe: () <i>You have been reconciled to God</i>. God wants unbroken, intimate friendship with us, as with Adam and Eve in Eden. But sin made us enemies of God. 'You who were once far away from God...enemies, separated from Him by your evil thoughts and actions.' (v21 NLT) Yet He never stopped pursuing that relationship, sending Jesus to restore it. He 'made peace by means of Christ's blood on the cross' (v20), resulting in your reconciliation to God. The Greek word for 'reconciliation' means <i>to be friends as we once were</i>. Now you can walk and talk with God as Adam did. Now God sees you as 'holy and blameless...without a single fault!' (v22 NLT) (2) <i>You are the Lord's redeemed</i>. At the Jordan River John saw Jesus and said, 'Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!' (John 1:29 NIV) It is in Jesus that '...we have redemption through His blood...' (Colossians 1:14 KJV) The word 'redemption' means <i>liberation from captivity by a ransom paid</i>. Not only are you purchased at the cost of Christ's life, you are also adopted by blood into God's family. (3) <i>You are forgiven of all sins.</i> 'In whom (Jesus) we have...the forgiveness of sins.' How did He accomplish the total removal of all our sins? 'Having cancelled the written code, with its regulations, that was against us...He took it away, nailing it to the cross.' (Colossians 2:14 NIV) He wrote in His blood 'paid in full' across your outstanding bill of indebtedness to God, nailing your 'cancelled debt notice' to His cross. You are forgiven. You owe nothing!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Jesus...showed them His hands...' John 20:19-20 NCV<br /><br /><p>Dr. Paul Brand, a brilliant surgeon who worked at the Christian Medical College in Vellore, India, wrote: 'I work with the marvels of the hand nearly every day...But one time of the year holds special meaning for me...When the world observes Passion Week...I reflect on the hands of Jesus...those hands that had done so much good were taken, one at a time, and pierced through with a thick spike...Roman executioners drove their spikes through the wrist, through the carpal tunnel that houses finger-controlling tendons and the median nerve...maiming the hand into a claw shape, and Jesus had no anesthetic...Later His weight hung from them, tearing more tissue, releasing more blood. Has there ever been a more helpless image? The disciples, who'd hoped He was the Messiah, cowered in the darkness or drifted away.' But that's not the last time we see Jesus' hands.The Bible says: 'When it was evening on the first day of the week, Jesus' followers were together. The doors were locked, because they were afraid of the elders. Then Jesus came and stood...in the middle of them and said, Peace be with you. After...this, He showed them His hands...His followers were thrilled when they saw the Lord.' Dr. Brand adds: 'For the remainder of His time here, Jesus chose [to minister through] scars in each hand. That's why I believe God hears and understands our pain...He kept those scars as a lasting image of wounded humanity. He knows what life on earth is like because He has been there. His hands prove it.' So bring your wounds to Jesus today and let Him make you whole; body, mind and soul.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...A man of two minds [is]...unstable and unreliable and uncertain about everything...' James 1:8 AMP<br /><br /><p>Do you have a compulsive need to find a solution to every problem, and to control everything? Do you always have a back-up plan in case things don't go the way you think they should? Have you noticed that the more you try to 'fix' things, the more anxiety you experience? The Bible says, 'The mind of the flesh [sense and reason] is death...But the mind of the...Spirit is life...' (Romans 8:6 AMP) 'Fixing' is the opposite of 'trusting.' Now God doesn't want you to be mindless or helpless, He just wants you to live by faith, not head knowledge. When you learn to trust God and operate in 'the mind of the Spirit,' you experience peace even when you're surrounded by tough circumstances. One of the pitfalls of human reasoning is that it causes you to become double-minded and stuck: 'A man of two minds [is] unstable and unreliable and uncertain about everything.' What frame of mind do you live in? Instead of always trying to figure everything out, learn to be comfortable not knowing and trust the One who does. Decide that each time you feel anxious you'll stop and pray: 'Lord, I'm not going to try to figure this out myself, I'm bringing it to You, trusting You for the answer.' When you stop struggling with the whens, wheres, whys and hows, you start experiencing God's peace in a way you never have before. You also put yourself in a position where God can intervene on your behalf. So stop trying to control everything.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Revive us again...' Psalm 85:6 NKJV<br /><br /><p>For the next few days let's talk about the revival we need in the church today. </p>
<p>, <i>a revival of life</i>. True revival begins with an honest recognition that we have become spiritually dull, dry and even dead. Ezekiel describes it this way: 'The hand of the Lord came upon me and brought me out in the Spirit of the Lord, and set me down in the midst of the valley; and it was full of bones...and indeed they were very dry...He said to me, Prophesy to these bones, and say to them, 'O dry bones, hear the word of the Lord!'...And as I prophesied, there was a noise, and suddenly a rattling; and the bones came together...and breath came into them, and they lived, and stood upon their feet, an exceedingly great army.' (Ezekiel 37:1-10 NKJV) Ezekiel's vision teaches us the following truths: (a) Revival begins with acknowledging we are not a healthy, connected, functioning body. (b) In many cases our church services have become too formal and dry. (c) We must hunger for God's Word. Otherwise we live in denial, excusing and rationalising our spiritual condition. God said to Israel, an agricultural people, 'Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for it is time to seek the Lord, till He comes and rains righteousness upon you.' (Hosea 10:12 NKJV) Notice the elements in a true revival: An emphasis on righteous living; showing mercy to one another; recognising our careless and cavalier attitude toward sin; crying out to God in sustained, heartfelt prayer, 'Revive us again, that your people may rejoice in You.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Your word is...a light for my path.' Psalm 119:105 NIV<br /><br /><p><i>Second, a revival of Light.</i> Your job takes up about ten hours of your day, including travel. Sleeping, eating, bathing and dressing take another ten. Your family and your hobbies etc, account for the remaining hours. Today a 'committed church member' is in church two to three times a month. Do the maths. Out of 168 hours in your week, about ninety minutes are given to spiritual growth-less than one percent! And what are the results? Spiritual ignorance and weakness. Divorce is as common inside the church as outside. Believers have as big a problem with pornography as unbelievers. The alcoholism and addiction rate is roughly the same. A recent news poll found that while certain churches are growing rapidly, many of the newcomers have an 'eclectic theology'. They believe in the resurrection, but they also think reincarnation is ok. They believe God guides through prayer, and also through horoscopes. While devout Muslims commit themselves to memorising the Koran, the average Christian doesn't read their Bible even once a week. As hard as your pastor may try, spoon-feeding you from the pulpit and burping you at the door won't make you spiritually mature. 'Your Word is...a light for my path.' You've got to put God's Word at the top of your daily 'to do' list. '...No longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men...but, speaking the truth in love, may grow up in all things into Him who is the head-Christ.' (Ephesians 4:14-15 NKJV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.' 2 Corinthians 3:17 NKJV<br /><br /><p><i>Third, a revival of liberty.</i> Is the Holy Spirit welcome in your church? Are you responsive to His leadings? It's ok to have a programme as long as you're willing to let God change it. Now that doesn't mean somebody can just jump up and interrupt the pastor's sermon. God is a God of order. You say, 'But I felt led by the Spirit to do it.' Really? The Holy Spirit is a gentleman; He won't speak through you when He is already speaking through God-ordained leadership. God works through structure. If you doubt that, look at how He planned the tabernacle in the wilderness and Solomon's temple. There were times when God's presence was so strong that the priests were unable to conduct the service as usual; all they could do was fall on their faces before Him. And we must pray for and welcome such times too. But liberty isn't licence to do as you please. Paul addresses the liberty/licence argument in these words: 'For you, brethren, have been called to liberty; only do not use your liberty as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.' The liberty Christ brings sets us free from the need to 'show off' and instead teaches us to 'serve one another'. Paul bottom-lines it: 'Now the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.' You say, 'What does that mean?' It means that when you make Jesus 'Lord', He sets you free to enjoy His presence in church, at home, in business and in every area of life. </p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...A wise person stays calm when insulted.' Proverbs 12:16 NLT<br /><br /><p>How can you tell constructive criticism from destructive criticism? By practising these principles from God's Word: (<i>1) Resolve that whatever it is, you'll handle it constructively.</i> 'A wise person stays calm when insulted.' Angry responses only short-circuit rational thinking and trigger emotion-driven reactions. 'If you listen to constructive criticism, you will be at home among the wise. If you reject discipline, you only harm yourself; but if you listen to correction, you grow in understanding.' (Proverbs 15:31-32 NLT) Always ask yourself, 'Can I learn something here? (<i>2) Consider the character of your critic.</i> 'An honest witness tells the truth; a false witness tells lies. Some people make cutting remarks, but the words of the wise bring healing.' (Proverbs 12:17-18 NLT) Is your critic trustworthy? Are their words meant to help you? If so, appreciate them and grow wiser. 'Better to be criticised by a wise person than...praised by a fool.' (Ecclesiastes 7:5 NLT) Are their words intended to demean you and damage your self-worth? Words that humble you have a godly purpose, but words that humiliate don't; so reject them. (<i>3) Check your conscience.</i> Paul wrote: 'My conscience is clear...It is the Lord Himself who will examine me and decide.' (1 Corinthians 4:4 NLT) If you're in the clear, leave the outcome with God. He alone sees the whole picture. (<i>4) If you are criticised because of your faith, consider yourself blessed.</i> 'If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are blessed, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you.' (1 Peter 4:14 NIV) Rejoice, your life is pleasing to God.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Love each other as I have loved you.' John 15:12 NIV<br /><br /><p>When Jesus said, 'Love each other,' the Greek word for 'love' used has a sense of self-sacrificing<i> nurture.</i> Think of a mother and her child: her love is constant and her greatest desire for her child is to thrive. You say, 'Isn't this the kind of love people should get at home, not from me?' Truth is, beneath the façade, some people in your life desperately need to be nurtured. And they'll be influenced most by those who make them feel best about themselves. One leader writes: 'Many people are very close to my heart because they believed in me when I didn't believe in myself. They listened to me without condemnation and loved me unconditionally, even when I wasn't very lovable. Without them, I wouldn't have possessed the hope I needed to keep pursuing my dream.' Now, you can't be like the little girl who came home from church and announced, 'I want to be like the man who stood up in the pulpit today.' Delighted, her mum said, 'You want to go into the ministry?' 'No,' she replied, 'I want to tell people what to do!' Hello! Some of us want to be authority figures so we can correct people and give them our so-called 'constructive criticism'. Most folks don't need a critic, they need a cheerleader. When you nurture them, they will welcome you to speak into their life-and they will listen. Goethe said, 'Correction does much, but encouragement does much more.' So think encouraging words and speak encouraging words. 'Anxiety in the heart of man causes depression, but a good word makes it glad.' (Proverbs 12:25 NKJV) </p>

<title><![CDATA[The Word for 'Worrywarts']]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[the-word-for-worrywarts]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Martha...you are worried and upset about many things.' Luke 10:41 NIV<br /><br /><p>Worry acts like a thief; it robs us of the joy God wants us to experience each day. Basically, all our worries come down to two things: that we won't get what we need or that we'll lose what we've got. Martha was a 'worrywart' and it showed up when Jesus came to dinner. She worked hard in the kitchen while her sister Mary sat listening to Jesus. In frustration Martha asked, '...Lord, don't You care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself?' (v40 NIV) Worry makes us forget who's servant and who's Lord. Notice three things in this story: (<i>1) Martha was busy serving, but she wasn't enjoying it.</i> No doubt she wanted to please Jesus; it's just that she allowed her work for the Lord to become more important to her than her relationship with the Lord. Has that happened to you? (<i>2) Satan didn't take Martha out of the kitchen; he just stole her purpose for being there. </i>Satan doesn't turn you against the church; he just makes you focus on yourself. He doesn't take away your ministry, he just discourages you by saying you're overworked and not appreciated. (<i>3) God values your attitude more than your actions.</i> 'Do everything without complaining...' (Philippians 2:14 NIV) A bad attitude spoils the gift you offer to God. Jesus said, 'Martha...only one thing is needed. Mary has chosen...it...' (Luke 10:42 NIV) What did Mary choose? Sitting at the feet of Jesus. He always prefers the quiet devotion of a sincere heart to the noisy attitude of a complainer. Think about it.</p>

<title><![CDATA[Spiritual Landmarks]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[spiritual-landmarks]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['This I call to mind and therefore I have hope.' Lamentations 3:21 NIV<br /><br /><p>You need to establish some spiritual landmarks in your life to remind you of the times when God intervened on your behalf. Someone said, 'We're not slow learners, just quick forgetters.' How soon we forget, or claim credit for things we had little to do with. When God parted the Jordan River for His people to cross over, He knew something they didn't-that on the other side they would face some big challenges, including the City of Jericho. That's when they would need 'reminders'. So He told them to collect twelve stones from the Jordan and build a monument, so they and their children would recall His past faithfulness to them. Samuel did the same after Israel defeated the Philistines. He took a stone and named it Ebenezer, meaning, 'Thus far the Lord has helped us.' (1 Samuel 7:12 NKJV) Before you give in to discouragement, doubt or defeat, stop and recall what God has done for you 'thus far'. Like the day you met Jesus, or the times He guided you, or the doors He opened that you thought were permanently shut, or the scrapes He brought you through. Keep a record of these events and refer to it often. It will help you to remember His goodness when you tend to forget it. It will give you a sense of gratitude for yesterday's blessings, and confidence to face whatever tomorrow brings. 'This I call to mind and therefore I have hope: Because of the Lord's great love we are not consumed, for His compassions never fail. They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness.' (Lamentations 3:21-23 NIV)</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['The fool has said in his heart, &quot;There is no God...&quot;' Psalm 14:1 NKJV<br /><br /><p><i>T</i><i>he atheistic fool.</i> It's said, 'An atheist can't find God for the same reason a thief can't find a policeman.' Sometimes pride is at the core of atheism. Without God, you become your own god, which means there's no higher power than yourself! But the God of the Bible proves His existence in three ways:<i> (1) Creation.</i> Many people are in prison today who weren't caught at the scene of the crime, and no one actually witnessed the crime. What proved they did it? Fingerprints! DNA! Creation carries God's fingerprints and DNA. 'Look up into the Heavens. Who created all the stars? He brings them out like an army, one after another, calling each by its name...' (Isaiah 40:26 NLT) (<i>2) Calvary.</i> In creation you see God's power, at the cross you see His love for you. In creation you see His hand, at the cross you see His heart. (<i>3) Conscience.</i> 'Gentiles...even without having heard it...demonstrate that God's law is written in their hearts, for their own conscience and thoughts either accuse them or tell them they are doing right.' (Romans 2:14-15 NLT) Conscience is like having the Ten Commandments in your soul; no one was born without one. Voltaire, the French atheist, said, 'It took twelve fishermen to build Christianity. I will show the world how one Frenchman can destroy it.' After Voltaire died, the home in which he had lived became Europe's most famous Bible distribution centre. Bottom line: Voltaire is dead; our God lives! Atheism is the greatest gamble of all. After all, what if there <i>is</i> a God and you stand before Him one day?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you...' Luke 12:20 NIV<br /><br /><p><i>T</i><i>he ambitious fool.</i> Jesus told the story of a successful farmer who said, '...I will pull down my barns, and build greater...' (Luke 12:18 NKJV) Evidently he was a good businessman and planner. But then he said: 'I will say to my soul, &quot;Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years; take your ease; eat, drink, and be merry.&quot; But God said to him, &quot;Fool! This night your soul will be required of you; then whose will those things be which you have provided?&quot; So is he who lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.' (Luke 20:19-21 NKJV) </p>
<p>This man had a plan for time, but none for eternity. He thought about himself, but not God. He paid attention to his body, but not his soul. It's said that the average body has enough phosphorus to make 800,000 match heads, enough sugar to go into 60 cubes, enough salt to cover 20 spoons, and enough iron to make about ten dollars' worth of nails. The rest is just dust and water. When you pamper, promote and protect the part of you that will only live 70 or 80 years and neglect the part of you that will live on in either Heaven or hell, God says you're a fool. This man told himself he had 'many years' but God said, 'This night your soul will be required of you.' Don't you realise that an accident, a blocked artery, a stray bullet, a plane with engine failure or a drunk driver could take you out in an instant? Wise up! The question is not will you die, but when? And are you ready to stand before God?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Should Abner have died as fools die?' 2 Samuel 3:33 NLT<br /><br /><p><i>T</i><i>he absolute fool.</i> Abner slew a man called Asahel, whose brother happened to be Joab, King David's number one general. So Joab was out to take Abner's life. The tragedy of this story is that Abner was within reach of Hebron, one of the six cities of refuge. But instead of running into that city and enjoying its protection, he allowed the enemy to catch him outside the gates and kill him. 'They buried Abner in Hebron... Then the king sang this funeral song, &quot;Should Abner have died as fools die?&quot;' (2 Samuel 3:32-33 NLT) Abner was the absolute fool. Why? Because unlike the atheistic fool who did not believe in God, or the ambitious fool who had no time for God, he knew what to do-but didn't do it. There were no rivers to cross, no mountains to climb, and no price to be paid. The gates of Hebron were open; all he had to do was go in and stay there. </p>
<p>Imagine being given a Gospel tract with these words on the cover: 'What must I do to be lost?' Then opening it and finding that page is-blank. You don't have to do anything to be lost! But you must do something to be saved: 'Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved...' (Acts 16:31 NKJV) </p>
<p>When Mary brought the newborn Christ to the temple, an old priest named Simeon held Him in his arms and said that he was ready to die, because he had seen the Saviour of the world. (Luke 2:25-32) In order to die right you must meet Christ, embrace Him, and acknowledge Him as your Lord and Saviour. Why don't you do it today! (Go to page 24 of this booklet.)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I prayed for this child.' 1 Samuel 1:27 NCV<br /><br /><p>Protectiveness is part of parenting. But unless you're careful you can shield your kids from the very things they need to mature. Sheila Wray Gregoire says we should <i>s</i><i>urrender them to God</i><i>. </i>We think we control their futures, but most of the time they turn out differently than we planned. Samuel's mother, Hannah, said: 'I prayed for this child...Now I give him back to the Lord.' (vv27-28 NCV) Whether He chooses to send them to the jungles of Africa, the inner city...or a house around the corner...God knows best. <i>Live with hope</i><i>:</i> not wishful thinking. Trust God to use them and guide them through life, even if He never reveals how or why. From this perspective it's easier to accept that circumstances don't determine the final outcome; they're just the tools God uses to shape character. <i>Encourage responsibility</i><i>:</i> letting kids experience consequence shows them what works and what doesn't. For example, a tumble off the swing set teaches them not to be reckless...and that failure to study results in poor grades. 'It is good for people to endure burdens when they're young.' (Lamentations 3:27 GWT) Kids who learn responsibility and independence early are better equipped to succeed. <i>Pray often and with purpose</i><i>:</i> Instead of praying for his 'spiritual children' to be spared persecution, Paul said: 'My prayer [is] that your love...abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight, so...you may be able to discern what is best and...be pure and blameless until the day of Christ.' (Philippians 1:9-10 NIV) Being a Christian doesn't mean life is always easy. But when you, the parent, demonstrate faith in God, your kids learn to trust Him too. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I will give you shepherds according to My heart...' Jeremiah 3:15 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Here's a sad statistic: over 50% of those who enter the ministry leave it within ten years because of discouragement. Make sure that doesn't happen to <i>your</i> pastor. Picture this: Joshua's soldiers are down in the valley fighting the Amalekites. Above him on a hilltop sits Moses with his hands raised toward Heaven. As long as his arms are raised the battle goes their way. But if you've ever tried to hold your hands up for long, you quickly grow weary and lower them. The moment Moses does that, the battle goes against Israel. So Aaron and Hur hold up his arms and the tide turns in favour of Israel. It wasn't just Joshua's ability to fight, it was Moses' ability to hold up his arms that won the day. Aaron and Hur kept a leader from fainting so an entire nation could be saved. God said, 'I will give you shepherds according to My heart, who will feed you with knowledge and understanding.' If God has given you pastors who love, lead and feed you, support them. Hold up their hands! In the Old Testament tabernacle the candlesticks had to be kept burning day and night because their light represented God's presence among His people. If a light so much as flickered, designated servants moved in immediately to refuel it and restore it to its original glow. Are you getting the idea? It's <i>your</i> responsibility to make sure the light doesn't flicker in your church or the fire go out in your pulpit. So pray for your pastors every day. And be sure to encourage them every chance you get.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['To Him who is able to do immeasurably more...' Ephesians 3:20 NIV<br /><br /><p>There are words in your Bible with so much power in them that they're more effective than any therapy. God can illuminate a Scripture that goes back into the past and heals your wounds, gives you direction in the middle of despair and provides hope for the future. Satan will try to fill your mind with so much junk that you don't have an appetite for God's Word. That's because he knows the Scriptures unmask him, and release the potential lying dormant within you. Before Jeremiah rose to national prominence as a prophet, God told him two things: (1) '<i>Before I formed you in the womb I knew you...</i>' (Jeremiah 1:5 NIV) Your parents didn't get the first look at you, God did. Nothing about you surprises Him. In spite of what you've been through, He hasn't changed His mind about who you are or what you're destined to become. (2) '<i>Before you were born I set you apart</i>...' (v5 NIV) You say, 'I've always felt different.' That's because you are. Celebrate it! Stop looking for acceptance where you don't belong. You're on a mission for God; that's why the enemy has tried so hard to take you out. Once you understand that, your struggle will begin to make sense. As you study God's Word you'll begin to experience the mind-renewing, life-changing power He's deposited within you. 'Now to Him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, <i>according to His power that is at work within us.'</i> So start drawing on that power today.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...If you listen to correction, you grow in understanding.' Proverbs 15:32 NLT<br /><br /><p>Saying the right thing the wrong way usually backfires. So here is 'a word to the wise'. If you cannot receive constructive criticism, don't try to give it. Before you criticise, ask yourself: (<i>1) 'Am I interested in this person's good?'</i> Or do you just need to look good, to have all the answers, to control people, and to gain acceptance and prestige? You can't help others while you're focused on your own ego needs. (<i>2) 'Am I blame-oriented and judgmental?'</i> If so, you'll come across that way to others. '...Let us stop passing judgment on one another...' (Romans 14:13 NIV) To avoid blaming and judging you have to stop talking about why they did it, or who is to blame, or how stupid and selfish and crazy it was, or what's wrong with them etc. That's problem-focused and polarising, and doesn't help.<i> (3) 'Am I pointing the person toward solutions?'</i> God is a God of solutions. When He found us lost in sin He didn't give us a critical reminder of our weakness. Instead, '...When we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly.' (Romans 5:6 NIV) He didn't give us an analysis of our problem, but a remedy. So prayerfully suggest: 'I wonder if you might not get a more satisfying result by...' then let God drive it home! (<i>4) 'Am I speaking truth in love?'</i> Even your sincerest ideas need to reflect that you care. 'Speaking the truth in love...' (Ephesians 4:15 NKJV) opens their heart and prepares them to trust you. Love asks, 'Because I value you, I'd like to offer a suggestion. Would that be all right?'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Whoever does not bear his cross...cannot be My disciple.' Luke 14:27 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Brenda Goodine says, 'My friend decided it was time to talk to her bright four-year-old son, Benji, about receiving Christ. &quot;Benji,&quot; she asked quietly, &quot;would you like to have Jesus in your heart?&quot; Benji rolled his blue eyes and answered seriously, &quot;No. I don't think I want the responsibility.&quot;' Now, you may not like Benji's answer, but you have to admire his honesty. He wasn't just thinking about the rewards of discipleship, he was thinking about the responsibilities it brings. Brother Lawrence of the Resurrection put it this way: 'Let us think often, that our only business in this life is to please God.' Imagine asking yourself before each action, word or attitude, 'Is this pleasing to the Lord?' How different would your life be? How would your decisions impact the people around you? Jesus said, 'Whoever does not bear his cross, and come after Me, cannot be My disciple.' Crosses were not made to live on, but to die on. Every morning when you wake up, go into the bathroom, look in the mirror and say, 'Today, you've been called to die to self-indulgence, self-interest, and self-promotion.' Tom Landry, coach of the Dallas Cowboys, once said, 'The job of a football coach is to make men do what they don't want to do, in order to achieve what they've always wanted to be.' And <i>that</i> is the essence of discipleship. Furthermore, Jesus said if you are not willing to do it, you 'cannot' be His disciple. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['All these men of war...were of one mind to make David king.' 1 Chronicles 12:38 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Here's another quality that set David's 'mighty men' apart from others: <i>They understood the importance of connection, unity, and strong relationships. </i>'All these men of war, who could keep ranks, came to Hebron with a loyal heart, to make David king over all Israel.' Did you know that when Roman soldiers went into battle, their shields, which protected them from chin to toe, were linked to one another forming a wall of defence? What a picture! The Bible instructs us to pray for one another, defend one another, strengthen one another, sharpen one another, bear one another's burdens, and yes, lovingly confront one another when it's called for. When you have a stubborn habit you can't conquer on your own, you need someone to support you and keep you accountable. You only mature spiritually as you connect with spiritually mature people. Paul addresses those who couldn't work with anybody and always wanted to go off and do their own thing: 'There should be no schism in the body, but...the members should have the same care for one another. And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; or if one member is honoured, all the members rejoice with it. Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually.' (1 Corinthians 12:25-27 NKJV) Disconnected from other believers you are like a body part without the benefit of a brain, a blood supply, a source of nutrition, a system that eliminates toxins, etc. Literally, you are incapable of getting anywhere or accomplishing anything worthwhile. So the word for you today is: 'Keep rank!'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['All these men of war...were of one mind to make David king.' 1 Chronicles 12:38 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Here's a second quality found in David's 'mighty men': <i>They understood the situation and had wisdom to deal with it.</i> 'The sons of Issachar...had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do...' (v32 NKJV) You are not called to avoid the world or denounce it, but to engage it and say, 'God has a solution to your problem.' Jesus promised: 'I will give you words and wisdom that none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict.' (Luke 21:15 NIV) When you walk with the Lord you won't just see what's happening around you, He will tell you what to do about it. Furthermore, when you are going the wrong way He will redirect you onto the right path... 'They tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit did not permit them.' (Acts16:7 NKJV) That night God gave Paul a vision directing him to go to Macedonia and preach. God even gave Paul a warning that the ship he was on was heading into a storm that would result in great loss. Unfortunately, nobody would listen to him (Acts 27:9-11). God not only told Joseph how to prepare for seven years of recession, but how to prosper and come out of it stronger. A lot of us have discovered that if we simply follow the advice of people and don't consult God, it can cost us dearly. Stop compartmentalising your Christianity or confining it to Sunday mornings at church. The Bible says, '...The Lord gives wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding.' (Proverbs 2:6 NKJV) </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Let us run...the race marked out for us.' Hebrews 12:1 NIV<br /><br /><p>Look what Jesus endured: (<i>1) Temptation.</i> We imagine the wilderness temptation as three isolated events scattered over a forty-day period. No: 'The devil tempted Jesus for forty days...' (Luke 4:2 NCV) Every step, whispering in His ear; every turn of the path, sowing doubt; forty days of non-stop temptation! When it was over Satan would flee, angels would come and strengthen Him, and He would leave the wilderness to go out and minister as no one ever has. But first He had to get through the temptation. So do you. And the good news is, strengthened by God's grace, you can. (<i>2) Accusation.</i> '...Some said, &quot;He is a good man.&quot; Others replied, &quot;No, He deceives the people.&quot;' (John 7:12 NIV) 'The people retorted, &quot;You...devil! Didn't we say all along that you were possessed by a demon?&quot;' (John 8:48 NLT) They accused Him unfairly, but Jesus kept running. You must too. (<i>3) Rejection.</i> His family thought He was mad. The neighbours treated Him badly. When He returned to His home town they tried to throw Him off a cliff (Luke 4:29). But Jesus kept running. So must you. (<i>4) Shame.</i> At the cross He became 'sin' personified (2 Corinthians 5:21). Though He never stole, lied or lusted, He bore the shame of every thief, liar and adulterer. How did Jesus do it? What kept Him going? The Bible answers: '...Who for the joy set before Him endured...' (Hebrews 12:2 NIV) Jesus had already lived in Heaven, and knowing what awaited Him enabled Him to endure and finish the race. And the same joy awaits you too.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['You have laid Your hand upon me.' Psalm 139:5 NIV<br /><br /><p>A London bus driver was assigned to shuttle passengers to special crusade services with Billy Graham at Wembley Stadium. When one of them invited him in to listen he declined. The following year he moved to New York, and when Billy was speaking at Madison Square Garden the man's job again was shuttling people to the meetings. As he got off the bus a lady asked if he'd like to join them. Once more he politely declined. He married an Australian lady and eventually ended up working in Sydney where, surprisingly, he was again assigned to drive people to the stadium where Billy was preaching. This time when he was invited he figured there was no escape, so he gave in. Looking back he says, 'No matter where I went I was confronted with Billy Graham, so I went to hear him and committed my life to Christ. It was the best decision I ever made.'</p>
<p>The Psalmist said, 'You hem me in...You have laid Your hand upon me...Where can I go from Your Spirit? Where can I flee from Your presence? If I go up to the Heavens, You are there ...in the depths, You are there...on the far side of the sea...Your right hand will...hold me fast.' (Psalm 139:5-10 NIV) </p>
<p>Isn't grace amazing? Peter said, 'God is patient...He wants everyone to turn from sin and no one to be lost.' (2 Peter 3:9 CEV) God will follow you to the ends of the earth to give you another opportunity to surrender your life to Him. How many opportunities has He already given you? Isn't it time you stopped running and surrendered your life to Him?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Word of the Lord stands forever.' 1 Peter 1:25 NIV<br /><br /><p>Let's read what some of the most notable leaders in history have said about the Bible. William Gladstone, a Prime Minister of the UK: 'There is but one question of the hour: how to bring the truths of God's Word into vital contact with the minds and hearts of all classes of people.' Goethe: 'I consider the Gospels to be thoroughly genuine; for in them there is the effective reflection of a sublimity which emanated from the person of Christ; and this is as divine as ever the divine appeared on earth.' President Ulysses S. Grant: 'Hold fast to the Bible as the anchor of your liberties. Write its precepts in your hearts and practise them in your lives. To the influence of this book we are indebted for the progress made, and to this we must look as our guide in the future.' President Woodrow Wilson: 'A man has deprived himself of the best there is in the world, who has deprived himself of this: knowledge of the Bible. When you have read the Bible you will know that it is the Word of God because you will have found it the key to your own heart, your own happiness, and your own duty.' President Abraham Lincoln: 'I have only to say that it is the best gift God has given to man.' Like the law of gravity, the Bible will never become redundant. Whittier wrote: 'We come back laden from our quest, to find that all the sages said, is in the Book our mothers read.' Your Bible-read it every day.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will never pass away.' Matthew 24:35 NIV<br /><br /><p>Let's look again at what some of the most notable leaders in history have had to say about the Bible. Napoleon: 'What happiness the Bible procures for those who believe it! What marvels it bestows upon those who reflect upon it!' Daniel Webster: 'There is no solid basis for civilisation but in the Word of God. If we abide by the principles taught in the Bible, our country will continue to prosper. I make it a practice to read the Bible through once every year.' William Lyon Phelps (once referred to as the most beloved professor in America-of Yale University): 'I thoroughly believe in a university education for both men and women, but I believe knowledge of the Bible without a college course, is more valuable than a college course without knowledge of the Bible.' Sir William Jones: 'The Bible contains more pure sensibility, more exquisite beauty, more pure morality, more important history, and finer strains of poetry and eloquence than can be collected from all other books in whatever age or language they may be written.' Robert E. Lee: 'The Bible is a book, in comparison with which all other books are of minor importance. In all my perplexities and distress, the Bible has never failed to give me light and strength.' Sir Isaac Newton: 'There are more sure marks of authenticity in the Bible than in any profane history.' George MacDonald: 'The Bible is to me the most precious thing in the world just because it tells me the story of Jesus.' Your Bible-read it every day.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The grass withers and the flowers fall, but the Word of our God stands forever.' Isaiah 40:8 NIV<br /><br /><p>Let's look once more at what some of the most notable people in history have had to say about the Bible. Matthew Arnold: 'To the Bible men will return because they cannot do without it. The true God is, and must be pre-eminently the God of the Bible, the eternal, who makes for righteousness from whom Jesus came forth, and whose spirit governs the course of humanity.' George Washington: 'It is impossible to rightly govern the world without God and the Bible.' Thomas Jefferson: 'The Bible is the cornerstone of liberty.' Horace Greeley: 'It is impossible to mentally or socially enslave a Bible-reading people.' Patrick Henry: 'This is a book worth more than all other books which were ever printed.' William McKinley: 'The more profoundly we study this wonderful book and the more closely we observe its divine precepts, the better citizens we will become and the higher will be the destiny of our nation.' Charles Dickens: 'The New Testament is the very best book that ever was or ever will be known in the world.' Billy Graham: 'The word of God hidden in the heart is a stubborn voice to suppress.'

<introtext><![CDATA['...Joshua...summoned all the men of Israel and said...&quot;Put your feet on the necks of these kings...&quot;' Joshua 10:24 NIV<br /><br /><p>When Israel entered the Promised Land there were five kings with armies determined to stop them. But God helped Joshua to defeat them and all five kings ran and hid in a cave. So Joshua told his soldiers to bring them out and put their foot on each of their necks. That day God's Word to His people was: '...Be strong and of good courage, for thus the Lord will do to all your enemies against whom you fight.' (v25 NKJV) What a promise! Are the forces of fear trying to take up residence in your mind today? Are they causing you to think the worst instead of believing God for the best? Are they telling you that you're unworthy to receive what He has promised, that you'll never fulfil the destiny God has in mind for you? With God, your victory is assured, but you have a part to play in it. You must go into that dark cave, bring each king out, place your foot on their neck and put them to death. These five kings represent your five natural senses: seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and touching, and God doesn't want you to live according to their dictates. Your senses are susceptible to every negative thing going on around you, but your faith can lift you above it and give you victory. But you can't just sit down and do nothing. Your passivity gives them the right to rule you. They have no power over you, except the power you give them. So put your foot down!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...So they came forward and placed their feet on their necks.' Joshua 10:24 NIV<br /><br /><p>Upon entering the Promised Land and encountering five well-entrenched kings, God told Israel, '...Do not be...dismayed...' (v25 NKJV) The word 'dismayed' implies being 'torn down by fear' and 'falling apart'. Today Satan wants to tear you down by robbing you of your peace, your joy and your confidence. He will keep pouring on the pressure in the hope that you will fall apart. That's why God told Joshua to bring each king out of the cave and deal with him decisively by standing on his neck and then hanging him on a tree. Satan often works through our five senses but God has given us a sixth sense: faith. The Bible says, 'We walk by faith, not by sight.' (2 Corinthians 5:7 KJV) Faith says, 'In spite of what I see, in spite of what I hear, in spite of what I feel, in spite of what I taste, in spite of what I smell, I believe everything's going to be all right because God is with me.' Your senses, which are susceptible to all that's going on around you, can be faith-killers. And unless you put them under your foot they will steal your dream, your confidence and everything else God has promised you. Emotions are problem-driven, but faith is purpose-driven. If you allow your emotions to rule your life you will be up one minute and down the next. You say, 'But I thought life is supposed to be an up and down experience.' No, God's plan for you is to get <i>down</i> on your knees to pray, then get <i>up</i> in faith and do what He's told you to do.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Whatever the Father does, the Son does likewise.' John 5:19 NRS<br /><br /><p>Jesus acted as a translator. He got His message from the Father, then translated it to those around Him. He heard a voice others were missing. And because He could hear it, He acted differently. Remember when everyone was troubled about the blind man? Jesus wasn't. Somehow He knew that this situation would reveal God's power (John 9:3). Remember when everyone was distraught about Lazarus' illness? Jesus wasn't. Rather than hurry to His friend's bedside, He said, 'This sickness will not end in death...it is for God's glory...' (John 11:4 NIV) How could a relationship be more intimate? Jesus had unbroken communion with His Father. How did He do it? He rose in the pre-dawn hours to pray. He communed with His Father through the night while others slept. He turned from the incessant demands and expectations of others to be sure that His agenda lined up with God's agenda. Do you suppose the Father desires the same for you? Absolutely. Paul says that you have been 'predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son.' (Romans 8:29 NRS) Such a lifestyle is promised, but it's not guaranteed. It comes at a price. Are you prepared to pay that price? John writes: 'We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard, so that you also may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ.' (1 John 1:3 NIV) Only when you have spent time in God's presence, when you have 'seen and heard', will you be able to talk about Jesus in a way that compels others to listen.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Lord, through all the generations You have been our home!...' Psalm 90:1 NLT<br /><br /><p>At the end of a hard day it feels good to come home to a place you know-a place where you can kick off your shoes, run around in your bathrobe and not worry about what anybody thinks. And reverently speaking, God's presence can become equally comfortable to you too. With time, you can learn to go there for <i>strength,</i> for <i>protection,</i> and for <i>guidance.</i> God wants you to be at home in His presence and aware of His nearness at all times. We think of God as a deity to discuss instead of a place to dwell, but God wants us to see Him as the One in whom '...we live and move and have our being...' (Acts 17:28 NIV) When God led the children of Israel through the wilderness, He didn't just show up once a day and then disappear. No, the pillar of fire was present with them all night and the cloud of smoke was present with them all day. God never leaves us. Jesus promised, '...I am with you always...' (Matthew 28:20 NIV) The Psalmist said, 'The one thing I ask of the Lord-the thing I seek most-is to live in the house of the Lord all the days of my life...' (Psalm 27:4 NLT) 'That's nice,' you say. 'I'd love to live in God's house too, but I'm stuck in the real world.' No, just the opposite; you are just one <i>decision</i> away from your Father's presence. You don't need to change your address-just your perception. Wherever you go today, whatever you face today, remind yourself: 'He is with me!'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...We will receive...grace to help us when we need it.' Hebrews 4:16 NLT<br /><br />
<p>No matter how spiritually mature you become you will never outgrow temptation. When you conquer it on one front it attacks you on another. And the closer you get to God the more Satan will try to tempt you. Paul explains it this way: 'The sinful nature wants to do evil, which is just the opposite of what the Spirit wants...These two forces are constantly fighting each other...' (Galatians 5:17 NLT) So what's the answer? Here are two ways you can overcome temptation: First, <em>honest about it</em>. Ask yourself, 'When am I tempted most?' Usually we are most vulnerable when we are under stress: when we are hurt, angry, worried, alone, bored, tired or after a big success or spiritual high. Learn to identify your patterns: 'God's people...protect themselves by watching where they go.' (Proverbs 16:17 CEV) Secondly, <em>for God's help</em>. 'Call on me in times of trouble. I will rescue you...' (Psalm 50:15 GWT) So why don't we call on God more often? Because sometimes we just want to do what we want to do, right? Or we are embarrassed because we keep giving in to the same temptations. Don't be discouraged; God won't give up on you. His Word says, 'Let us...come before God's throne where...we [will] receive...grace to help us when we need it.' (Hebrews 4:16 NCV) If you have to cry out for God's help every hour of the day, He will be there for you! Just as the roots of a tree deepen when storms come, each time you stand up to a temptation you become stronger.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Your words...were my joy and my heart's delight...'Jeremiah 15:16 NIV <br /><br /><p>Together they built and pastored a great church. The husband was a gifted preacher and musician who wrote songs and led worship. His wife was a Bible teacher who knew God and taught His Word skilfully. But when he died, she experienced months of depression before eventually bouncing back. Someone who says, 'If you really love God and walk according to His Word you will never get depressed,' has clearly never read the Scriptures or ever been depressed. Elijah called down fire from Heaven in a spectacular victory, yet he became so depressed in the aftermath that he wanted to die. '...It is enough! Now, Lord, take my life...' (1 Kings 19:4 NKJV) That's major-league depression! When you try to act super-spiritual and allow people to think you never battle in areas like fear, failure, finances, family or feelings, you give them a complex and cause them to walk away feeling they're not spiritual or mature enough to be used by God. Jesus uncovered Himself and washed His disciples' feet. Then He told them to do the same for one another. You are never more effective than when you are transparent. Knowing that leadership decisions had to be made concerning the future of their church, this pastor's wife felt overwhelmed and prayed, 'Lord, I don't know how to make all these decisions.' God told her, 'I have already made every decision concerning you and the church. My will was established in the counsels of eternity. All you have to do is decide today what I have already decided yesterday, and tomorrow you will walk in My blessings and benefits.'</p>

<alias><![CDATA[dont-give-in-to-bitterness]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Stop being bitter and angry and mad at others...' Ephesians 4:31 CEV<br /><br /><p>When it comes to bitterness, here are two things you need to keep in mind: <i>First, it is contagious.</i> You are a part of the body of Christ. So what happens to you, and in you, affects those you are connected to both positively and negatively. The Bible says, 'If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honoured, every part rejoices with it.' (1 Corinthians 12:26 NIV) A snake bite doesn't just affect the body part that gets bitten; the venom spreads through the entire system. 'See to it that no one misses the grace of God and that no bitter root grows up to cause trouble and defile many.' (Hebrews 12:15 NIV) Don't get upset and leave the church God has placed you in. You need them and they need you. By overcoming bitterness you spread God's blessing to others. <i>Secondly, it can be overcome</i>. Here's how: (a) Acknowledge and admit it. (b) Don't rehearse it in your mind or recite it to others. (c) Repent and renounce any attitude that's not Christ-like. (d) Ask God to give you self-control, then submit to His leadership. (e) Don't infect others and don't let them infect you. (f) Without waiting for admissions or apologies, verbalise to yourself, God and a trusted friend, your decision to forgive all wrongs against you. 'Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.' (Ephesians 4:32 NIV) This will set you free to enjoy your relationship with God, yourself, and others. (g) Look for practical ways to 'be kind...[and] tenderhearted' toward those who hurt you. (Ephesians 4:32 NKJV)</p>

<alias><![CDATA[fire-and-soap]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...He is like a refiner's fire and like launderers' soap.' Malachi 3:2 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Soap cleanses the outside, fire cleanses the inside. And the Spirit of God does both! When you sin, repent! In-depth repentance brings in-depth cleansing. Don't feel bad about feeling bad, feel good about it. Be glad your conscience is still sensitive and responsive to God. What you never want to hear God say is what He said about Ephraim: 'Ephraim is joined to idols, let him alone.' (Hosea 4:17 NKJV) The fact that God is convicting you of sin is proof of His love for you. God can forgive your sin but He cannot overlook it. Unconfessed sin disrupts your fellowship with Him. Forgiveness is about more than just escaping the penalty of sin, it's about restoring your fellowship with God. You say, 'Won't God get tired of me sinning and repenting?' If Jesus told Peter to forgive his brother 'seventy times seven' would He do less for you? The Bible says: 'Come now, and let us reason together, says the Lord, though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall be as wool.' (Isaiah 1:18 NKJV) When you sin and try to hide from God you only prolong your misery. So the moment you become aware of your sin, confess it, then leave His presence confident that He has forgiven you. You're not a loser, you're a learner. Alexander Pope said: 'A man should never be ashamed to own he has been in the wrong, which is but saying, in other words, that he is wiser today than he was yesterday.'</p>

<alias><![CDATA[dealing-with-uncertainty-3]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['I will instruct you...in the way you should go; I will guide you...' Psalm 32:8 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Dr. John Maxwell points out that in order to thrive in uncertain territory you must be able to do the following things: (1) <i>Understand your certainty quotient</i>. Think back to your last big decision that turned out right. How certain were you? Eighty percent? Fifty percent? If your best decisions are usually made at the 75 percent mark, that's your 'certainty quotient.' When you reach that point, it's time to stop debating and start moving. (2) <i>Express your uncertainty with confidence</i>. Never look at successful people and assume that single-handedly and with no hesitation, they fearlessly navigated the currents of uncertainty. No, they just understood that with each step, answers would be given. So instead of pretending to know more than you do, begin to encourage a culture of transparency that fosters the free exchange of ideas. When you don't know, just say, 'I don't know, but I'll try to find out.' (3) <i>others</i>. King Solomon wrote more about seeking counsel than any other writer in the Bible. Do kings need good input? Yes, absolutely! And only those with the humility to acknowledge it ever prosper. (4) <i>Measure your success by the scoreboard, not the playbook</i>. Every good coach goes into the game with a plan, but he is willing to change it in order to win. Pencil in your plans, but write your vision in ink! Good leaders, like good coaches, are often forced to abandon or amend some of their plans in order to deliver on the vision. The ones who do are the ones who reach their destination.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...We shall reap if we do not lose heart.' Galatians 6:9 NKJV<br /><br /><p>There's a legend about a soldier being court-martialled before Alexander the Great. Believing the verdict was unjust, the soldier asked to appeal it. The conqueror informed him that there was no one higher to whom he could plead his case. 'In that case,' the soldier replied, 'I appeal my case from Alexander the Small to Alexander the Great.' In each of us there is a lesser self and a greater self struggling for supremacy. Your lesser self says, 'Not enough people believe in me. I'll never make it.' Your greater self says, 'My faith in God and in myself is enough; I can make it.' Your lesser self says, 'It's taking too long to realise my dream.' Your greater self says, 'Dreams are realised one day at a time.' Your lesser self says, 'Enough is enough! I've taken too many hits.' Your greater self says, 'I've come too far to give up now.' Your lesser self says, 'I don't have the strength to hold on to my dream.' Your greater self says, 'Hold on a little longer; the darkest hour is just before the dawn.' After speaking about being shipwrecked, stoned, imprisoned, betrayed, hungry, thirsty, sleepless, cold and naked, Paul, who was resolute in his purpose and relentless in the pursuit of it, writes: 'Who is weak, and I am not weak...' (2 Corinthians 11:29 NKJV) Where does that kind of strength and tenacity come from? God! The assignment God gives you will never be greater than the grace He provides. So draw on His strength, keep pressing ahead, pursue your goal and you will prevail.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.' Joshua 1:9 NIV<br /><br /><p>When Moses passed the torch to Joshua, a lot of things had changed. For forty years Joshua had been taught to navigate and survive in a wilderness, but now it was time to enter the Promised Land. And what worked in the wilderness didn't necessarily work in the Promised Land. Can't you hear Joshua's thoughts: 'I know a lot about wandering, but not much about warfare'? So God told him, 'Be strong and courageous...for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.' Why would God tell Joshua to be strong and courageous? Because he must have felt anxious! Everything about his new situation reeked of uncertainty. The only thing Joshua knew for sure was that God had said, 'Go.' So, 'Joshua commanded the...people, saying, Prepare...yourselves, for within three days you are to cross this Jordan...[and] possess the land...' (vv10-11 NAS) Can't you imagine the people's thoughts? Question: 'But Joshua, how are we going to get across the river?' Answer: 'I'm not sure, but in three days be ready to go.' Question: 'But Joshua, what are we going to do when we get to the other side?' Answer: 'I'll tell you when we arrive. Just be ready to move out.' Are you getting the picture? As a leader you will always be uncertain about many things, especially when you go into new territory. But you can never afford to be unclear or in doubt about your calling, your vision, and your ultimate victory. And where does such confidence come from? God's promise, 'I am with you.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.' Joshua 1:9 NIV<br /><br /><p>When Moses passed the torch to Joshua, a lot of things had changed. For forty years Joshua had been taught to navigate and survive in a wilderness, but now it was time to enter the Promised Land.

<introtext><![CDATA['...We do not know what to do, but we are looking to You for help.' 2 Chronicles 20:12 NLT<br /><br /><p>As a leader you'll be called upon to make decisions regarding relationships, money, time, values, opportunities and disputes. And your decisions will show up on the bottom line. There, in the clear light of day, your leadership will be judged. And there's something else you need to know; in that realm it takes longer to recognise your brilliance or stupidity because you're forced to lead for long periods of time without the benefit of knowing if you made the right call. By the time your crop starts coming in, it's too late to change your agricultural procedure. You have to wait until the next season of planting. When it comes to leadership, uncertainty is a permanent part of all progress; it never goes away! Furthermore, uncertainty isn't an indication of poor leadership, it just underscores the need for it; it's the environment in which good leadership is most often discovered. As a leader you may think you should always know what to do, but in reality there will be few occasions when you are absolutely certain. It's why King Jehoshaphat prayed, 'We do not know what to do, but we are looking to You for help.' Since you'll constantly be called on to make decisions with limited information, your goal should not be to eliminate uncertainty but to develop the ability to trust God and be courageous and clear in spite of it. It's not your job to remove uncertainty; it's your job to inspire clarity, faith and progress in the midst of it. When you can do that, you are learning to be a leader.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Then Jesus...said, All authority in Heaven and on earth has been given to Me.' Matthew 28:18 NIV<br /><br /><p>Billy Graham said: 'The Bible is concerned only incidentally with the history of Israel or a system of ethics. It's concerned primarily with the story of redemption as it is in Jesus Christ. If you read the Scriptures and miss the story of salvation, you have missed its message and meaning. There have been those who have gone through the Bible and traced the story of Jesus: In Genesis He is the seed of the woman. In Exodus He is the Passover Lamb. In Leviticus He is the Atoning Sacrifice. In Numbers He is the Smitten Rock. In Deuteronomy He is the Greatest Prophet. In Joshua He is the Captain of the Lord's Host. In Judges He is the Deliverer. In Kings He is the Promised King. In Nehemiah He is the Restorer of the Nation. In Esther He is the Advocate. In Job He is my Redeemer. In Psalms He is my Shepherd. In Proverbs He is my Pattern. In Ecclesiastes He is my Goal. In the Song of Solomon He is my Satisfier. In the Books of the Prophets He is my Coming Prince of Peace. In the Gospels He is the One who came to seek and to save us. In Acts He is our Risen Lord. In the Epistles He is our Representative at the Father's right hand. In Revelation He is our Returning Lord.' In an age of pop psychology and eclectic theology, the bedrock of our faith is still Christ's virgin birth, His sinless life, His atoning death, His victorious resurrection, His work of mediation and His visible return as King of Kings. Christ-there's no one like Him!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Follow Me, and I will make you...' Mark 1:17 NKJV<br /><br /><p>If you think you're not qualified to be used by God, start changing the way you think! When Elijah called Elisha he was ploughing. When Jesus called Peter he was fishing. To follow God, Elisha had to leave farming and Peter had to leave fishing. Can you imagine a disciple's wife saying, 'How are we going to pay the bills?' Following God is like stepping out on tissue paper and discovering solid rock underneath. But you'll never discover the rock unless you're willing to step onto the tissue paper. When God asks you to walk away from a security base that's been part of your life, you take your talents with you. Matthew, an accountant, took his pen and wrote the first book of the New Testament. When David went to Saul's palace he took his harp, and went on to write psalms we still sing today. That's why it's important to know that it's God who's calling you, and to have it confirmed by trusted leadership. If you run before the starter fires the gun you'll be disqualified from the race. When God calls you, keep these four things in mind: (1) There's a price to be paid. If you're willing to pay it, you can have God's best. (2) There's a path to be walked. Each step is a step of faith. (3) There are principles to be observed. You've got to do God's will, God's way, in order to be blessed. (4) There's a promise to sustain you. '...do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.' (Joshua 1:9 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Then David got up...' 2 Samuel 12:20 NIV<br /><br /><p>David committed adultery with another man's wife, got her pregnant, then arranged to have her husband put to death in an attempt to cover it up. Then he married her and thought everything would be ok. But the child became critically ill. Desperately wanting to save the baby's life, David '...fasted and went into his house and spent the nights lying on the ground. The elders of his household stood beside him to get him up from the ground, but he refused, and he would not eat any food...' (vv16-17 NIV) In spite of all his praying, the child died. Why did God let this happen? Was it because the child deserved better parents? Or because the Bible says that to depart and be with the Lord is 'far better' (Philippians 1:23)? We don't have a clear answer. But this much we know: when you have repented of your sin and experienced God's forgiveness, you must get up and go on with your life. And that's what David did. 'Then David got up from the ground...washed, put on lotions and changed his clothes...went into the house of the Lord and worshipped. Then he went to his own house, and...they served him food, and he ate.' (2 Samuel 12:20 NIV) We discover three important things in this story: (1) Until you are willing to make things right with God and those you've hurt, you can't go forward with confidence. (2) Until you process your emotions in a healthy way, whether guilt or grief, you will remain stuck and forfeit the joy of what God has for you next. (3) When you've done these two things, get up and get on with your life.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Nothing can ever separate [me] from God's love...' Romans 8:38 NLT<br /><br /><p>Overcoming the fear of loneliness requires understanding God's commitment to you. His Fatherhood isn't based upon mood, sentiment or emotion; it's based on His unchanging character and faithfulness. 'For the sake of His great name the Lord will not reject His people, because the Lord was pleased to make you His own.' (1 Samuel 12:22 NIV) Notice two things in this Scripture: Concern for His good name and the pleasure He takes in being your Father are reasons why He will never turn His back on you. Your problems don't mean that God is judging or disowning you. Satan would love to convince you of that. He will tell you that you've failed God, or that God has failed you in order to make you feel unworthy, hopeless, disowned by God and abandoned. No, generations of believers have sung through their soul's dark night, 'Great is thy faithfulness, O God, my Father.' In your circumstances and suffering, '...His compassions never fail. They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness...' (Lamentations 3:22-23 NIV) Suffering and adversity don't cancel His faithfulness, He's 'the same yesterday, today, and forever.' (Hebrews 13:8 NKJV) He can't love you once, and not love you always. 'After you suffer for a short time, God, who gives all grace, will make everything right. He will make you strong and support you and keep you from falling...' (1 Peter 5:10 NCV) Today declare, 'Nothing can ever separate me from God's love.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Lord...will never leave you nor forsake you.' Deuteronomy 31:6 NIV<br /><br /><p>To overcome the fear of loneliness you must: () <i>Understand who you are</i>. Let scientists argue about whether or not there was a 'big bang.' If there was, you were not the result of it! Nor did you descend from an amoeba in a pond. You are 'fearfully and wonderfully made' (Psalm 139:14). Made 'in His own image' (Genesis 1:27). God didn't assign your creation to His most powerful angels. You're a hands-on, made-to-order, one-of-a-kind product. As a redeemed child of God you are His '...workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works...' (Ephesians 2:10 NIV) Believe that and stand on it-regardless of your feelings or your social status. (2) <i>Understand who God is</i>. He calls Himself your 'Heavenly Father', not just your creator and designer. Your creator and designer refer to what He does; your Father refers to who He . 'He will be called Wonderful Counsellor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.' (Isaiah 9:6 NIV) These aren't His roles, they're His proper names. They are capitalised in Scripture because they are what you are to call Him! When Jesus taught us to pray He didn't begin with 'O, omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient God.' Yes, He's all of those, but when it comes to us He wants to be recognised and called 'Father' (Matthew 6:9). That's how He thinks about us, and wants us to think and to feel about Him. 'Father' is meant to convey warmth, security, acceptance, concern, compassion, protection, assurance, provision etc. He's your Father-when you grasp the truth of that you will begin to overcome the fear of loneliness.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...We have seen His glory...' John 1:14 NIV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says: 'The Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us. We have seen His glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came...full of grace and truth.' To know the Lord Jesus Christ personally is to love Him, to love Him is to serve Him, and to serve Him is to experience life's highest joy and fulfilment. An unknown author wrote the following poem about Jesus. If you know Him as your Lord and Saviour it will resonate in your heart. If you don't, it's our prayer you will want to accept Him today as your Lord and Saviour:</p>
<p>'I walked life's way with an easy tread, had followed where comforts and pleasures led; until one day in a quiet place, I met the Master face to face. With station and rank and wealth for my goal, much thought for my body but none for my soul; I entered to win in life's mad race, when I met the Master face to face. I met Him, and knew Him, and blushed to see that His eyes full of sorrow were fixed on me. And I faltered and fell at His feet that day, while my castles melted and vanished away. Melted and vanished, and in their place, naught else did I see but the Master's face; And I cried aloud, O, make me meet, to follow the steps of Thy wounded feet. My thought is now for the souls of men; I have lost my life to find it again; e'er since one day in a quiet place, I met the Master face to face.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Work...as though you were working for the Lord...' Colossians 3:23 NLT<br /><br /><p>Can you imagine a nation without a leader, a workplace without a boss or an army without a general? It would be chaotic. Structure creates order; without it no progress can be made. That's why you don't park your car in the bedroom or sleep in the garage. Learn to respect those in authority over you. Honour those who have lived longer than you because they possess a wealth of knowledge. Listen to them and grow. Until you learn to take orders you will never be qualified to give them. Jesus understood this. He was the Son of God. He knew more than any other human being, yet He honoured the authority of the government in power. When the Pharisees asked Him His opinion on paying taxes He answered, '...Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's...' (Mark 12:17 NKJV) Are you speaking words of doubt about your own organisation? Are you belittling those in authority over you? Stop it now! True, they are not perfect. (Perhaps that's why they can tolerate you.) If you rebel against every instruction you are given, don't complain when those around you rebel against your words and opinions. The law of reciprocity states that if you want to be treated with respect, you must respect others. That includes those you don't agree with, or even like. Jesus did. Pray, 'Father, I know that respect for authority is taught in Your Word. So remind me today that my success depends upon my attitude toward those You've placed in leadership over me. As I honour them, I believe You will honour me.'</p>

<alias><![CDATA[stop-condemning-yourself]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...There is no condemnation for those who belong to Christ Jesus.' Romans 8:1 NLT<br /><br /><p>The word for you today is-stop condemning yourself! God says, 'I, even I, am He who blots out your transgressions for My own sake, and I will not remember your sins.' (Isaiah 43:25 NKJV) When God says He forgets your sin and you insist on remembering it, it's like saying your standards are higher than His. That's akin to idolatry! The Bible says, '...God in Christ forgave you.' (Ephesians 4:32 NKJV) In the Old Testament when someone sinned they brought a lamb to the priest and he would shed its blood on the altar as payment for their sin. Once that was done the record was expunged and the issue was settled. You say, 'But I don't feel forgiven.' Forgiveness comes by faith, not feelings. As long as you live by feelings Satan has a weapon he can use against you at every turn. You say, 'But what I did was so wrong.' As long as you truly repent whatever you have done can be pardoned. You say, 'But Satan keeps bringing it up.' That's because he is called the 'accuser' (Revelation 12:10). But notice how you overcome Satan the accuser: 'They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony...' (v11) Next time Satan accuses you, say, 'I'm glad you brought that up.' Then tell him what the blood of Jesus has accomplished on your behalf. If you do that, he will flee. Learn from your failure, grow stronger through it, use it to bless others, move on with your life and stop condemning yourself!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[‘Let us not grow weary while doing good...’ Galatians 6:9 NKJV
<p>One of the great themes of the Bible is—<em>perseverance</em>. Paul, who refused to quit, wrote: ‘Let us not grow weary while doing good, for in due season we shall reap if we do not lose heart.’ Ralph Waldo Emerson said, ‘The great majority of men are bundles of beginnings.’ Are you merely a starter, or are you also a finisher? When the enthusiasm for a new idea fades, when the odds against you increase and the results diminish, when it looks as if success is impossible, you must keep forging ahead. Admiral Robert Peary attempted to reach the North Pole seven times before he finally succeeded. Oscar Hammerstein produced five shows on Broadway that were flops before staging Oklahoma, which was seen by almost five million people during a record–breaking run of 2212 performances. Quitting is more about who you are, than where you are or what you’re up against. We all have our excuses. The truth is, external things don’t stop us; it’s what happens to us on the inside! Most of us stop ourselves from reaching our potential. We can pretend that people, things and situations outside of ourselves are to blame, but in reality most failures are just the result of a lack of bulldog–like tenacity. Leonardo da Vinci said, ‘Obstacles cannot crush me. Every obstacle yields to stern resolve. He who is fixed to a star, does not change his mind.’ You must have a mindset to tenaciously pursue your dream. The only guarantee for failure is to stop trying. There is no insurmountable barrier, except your own inherent lack of purpose and persistence.</p>

<alias><![CDATA[keep-your-sense-of-gratitude]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Forget not all His benefits.' Psalm 103:2 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Author Philip Yancey writes, 'remember my first visit to Old Faithful in Yellowstone National Park, rings of...tourists surrounded the geyser... A large, digital clock stood beside the spot, predicting...the next eruption. My wife and I passed the countdown in the dining room of Old Faithful Inn... When the geyser went off, we tourists oohed and aahed and clicked our cameras; a few spontaneously applauded. But, glancing back...I saw that not one single waiter or busboy...looked out the huge windows. Old Faithful, grown entirely too familiar, had lost its power to impress them.' So here's the question: Why do we lose our sense of gratitude and begin to overlook God's goodness? For three reasons: </p>
<p>(1) <i>Problems</i>. If you close one eye and hold a coin close enough to your other eye, you can actually block out the light of the sun. Getting the point? (2) <i>Pressures</i>. Sometimes the perks we thought would bring us pleasure end up wearing us down. (3) <i>People</i>. When they disappoint us we turn sour and forget all that God has done for us. What's the solution? 'The unfailing love of the Lord never ends...Great is His faithfulness; His mercies begin afresh each morning.' (Lamentations 3:22-23 NLT) God's mercies begin each morning, and your gratitude should too. Indeed, your days should be saturated in it. Continual gratitude comes from looking beyond your blessings to their unfailing source, the Lord. His love, His faithfulness and His mercy are already at work when your eyes open each day.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['He...was strengthened in faith...' Romans 4:20 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Have you read the story of Isaac blessing his two sons when he was old, almost blind, and nearing death (Genesis 27)? When Jacob, the younger son, wanted his older brother Esau's part of the family inheritance, which was twice as much (Deuteronomy 15:17), his mother Rebekah helped him steal it. Here's how she did it. Esau was hairy and Jacob had smooth skin. So Rebekah wrapped Jacob's arms and neck in goat hair and gave him some of Esau's clothes to wear. When Jacob went in to his ageing father pretending to be Esau, his father asked him to come near so that he could feel him. His father told him that he sounded like Jacob but he felt like Esau, so he decided to trust what he felt over what he heard. As a result, he gave the birthright that was destined for his firstborn, Esau, to his second-born son, Jacob. Bottom line: he was deceived by what he felt. Now we know God was at work in all this. But the point here is, you can't always trust your feelings because they don't always line up with God's Word and they can deceive you. You say, 'I got my feelings hurt so I haven't spoken to my family in over a year.' Get over it! Learn to forgive. Refuse to remain offended. Practice love. If you let feelings rule your life they will mess you up. Feelings are like spoiled children: the more you indulge them the more they will control you. You shouldn't suppress your feelings or deny them, but you must not be led by them.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Hezekiah...spread it before the Lord.' 2 Kings 19:14 NKJV<br /><br /><p></p>
<p>When bad news comes don't allow it to panic you and cause you to act in haste. Stop, think rationally and get the facts before you arrive at a conclusion or make a decision. Prayerfully ask, 'Lord, what can I do about this situation?' If you can do it for yourself, God won't do it for you. Joyce Meyer quotes: 'We cannot do His part and He will not do our part.' Faced with a well-armed, vastly superior force there was nothing Hezekiah could do to save himself. So he went to the house of God and spread out his need before the Lord. That's always a wise move. When you respond in faith, a crisis becomes an opportunity for God to demonstrate what He can do on your behalf. The truth is, when you've nothing left but God-you've got enough! Enough to handle the situation, enough to get through it and enough to bounce back. Ask yourself, 'Is this problem really mine?' Yes, we're supposed to bear one another's burdens (Galatians 6:2) but you're not supposed to let everybody dump their problems on you. Sometimes in our eagerness to rescue others we get in God's way when He's dealing with them. And stop listening to round-the-clock news. If you do you'll begin to think negatively, 'Things are bad everywhere, so I guess I can't expect any better.' What has God said about you, and  situation? God doesn't respond to your need, He responds to your faith! So get into the Scriptures and discover what God has to say, then stand on it. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Hezekiah...spread it before the Lord.' 2 Kings 19:14 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says: 'Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up to the house of the Lord, and spread it before the Lord. Then Hezekiah prayed before the Lord, and said: O Lord God of Israel, the One who dwells between the cherubim, You are God, You alone...have made Heaven and earth. Incline Your ear, O Lord, and hear; open Your eyes, O Lord, and see...save us...that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You are the Lord God, You alone.' (vv15-19 NKJV) Hezekiah was in a hopeless situation. An army of 185,000 soldiers was amassed against him, planning to destroy him. But in answer to prayer, God sent an angel to wipe every one of them out. Sometimes bad news comes in the form of a letter, an email or a telephone call. It can come as the sound of screeching tyres and broken glass, a lump in your breast, a court date or a redundancy notice at work. Bad news knows no class lines, gender or age. It comes to us all. So what should you do when you have a problem you can't resolve and can't escape? Do what Hezekiah did: take it to the Lord in prayer. Spread it out before Him. But go to Him first, not last. When you do that you honour Him as 'Lord' of the situation and He will respond to you. God's promise is: 'He shall call upon Me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.' (Psalm 91:15 NKJV)</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...the smell of fire was not on them.' Daniel 3:27 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Deliverance is when God brings you out of a fiery trial that was meant to destroy you. Total deliverance is when, like the three Hebrew children, He brings you out without even the smell of smoke on you. You see, it's possible to be delivered but still be 'damaged.' You can hear it in what a person says. They speak only of the past because they stopped living at a certain point. They survived the trauma, but because they haven't dealt with it the right way they constantly refer back to it. When they talk, part of them is still 'in the fire'. Now we are not talking about some 'quick fix,' or a 'one size fits all' form of healing. Your temperament, your faith level, and the depth of your pain at the time are all determining factors in how long it takes to recover and become whole. But this much is clear: whatever was binding the three Hebrew children when they went into the fiery furnace, wasn't binding them when they came out of it. And that's what God wants to do for you too. Does that mean you're not supposed to talk about what you've been through? No, but don't talk like a victim, talk like a victor! David said: 'He also brought me up out of a horrible pit (<i>the past</i>)...and set my feet upon a rock (<i>the present</i>)...He has put a new song in my mouth-praise to our God; many will see it and fear, and will trust in the Lord.' (<i>the future</i>) (Psalm 40:2-3 NKJV) Your experience may be old, but your song will be new.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to tend and keep it.' Genesis 2:15 NKJV<br /><br /><p>For generations the church was silent on the sin of slavery. That's because it was popular and economically advantageous; not to mention that some church leaders had slaves of their own. But when the church finally acknowledged its wrong, it helped lead the way to reform. Today we can't even imagine life any other way! Well, some of us are waking up to the fact that caring for God's creation is not just something 'tree huggers' do. A resolution at the Southern Baptist Convention condemning those responsible for the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico illustrates this. Southern Baptist theologian Russell Moore, in an eloquent statement about how the oil spill would devastate his hometown of Biloxi, Mississippi, acknowledged: 'For too long we evangelical Christians have maintained an uneasy ecological conscience. I include myself in this indictment.' Then he asked, 'Will people believe us when we speak about the One who brings life, and that abundantly, when they see we don't care about that which kills and destroys?' The same God who put potatoes in the ground for us to eat, put oil in the ground for us to use. But He surely isn't happy when we pollute His oceans and kill His creatures in our attempt to get it. 'You have made him to have dominion [management and stewardship] over the works of Your hands...even the beasts of the field, the birds of the air, and the fish of the sea...' (Psalm 8:6-8 NKJV) Just because we are going to Heaven doesn't mean we can 'trash' God's beautiful earth!</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Building yourselves up on your...faith...' Jude 1:20 NKJV<br /><br /><p>This word 'building' is an architectural term that means <i>to renovate</i>. It implies tearing down what's not working for you and building up what will. When you don't understand that, you are left to believe that whatever life has handed you is just the way it is, and you have to take it. You'd be surprised at the number of people who go to church every week just to get a word to help them survive. They sing about faith and talk about it. But when you ask them, 'How are you doing?' they say, 'I'm just hanging on. I'm just hoping I can make it through.' Yes, there are times when that will truly be the case. But that should be the exception, not the rule. The Bible says, '...we are more than conquerors...' (Romans 8:37 NKJV) To be a conqueror means to fight a battle and win it. But to be more than a conqueror means to win a battle-without even having to fight it. Jesus has already fought and won the battle for you. And today He is saying, '...I give...you power...over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.' (Luke 10:19 NKJV) You say, 'How do I get this power?' Jude says we can access this power for living by '...praying in the Holy Spirit.' (v20) And you can do it anywhere: in your car on the way to work, on your treadmill or even in your bathroom. You just need a place where you can be alone with God, praying and reading His Word, building up your faith.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Building yourselves up on your...faith...' Jude 1:20 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The apostle Jude writes, 'But you, beloved, building yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit.' Jude places the responsibility of building yourself up spiritually and strengthening your faith where it belongs-squarely on you. There are two kinds of faith: mechanical faith and intentional faith. Each time you flip on a light switch you're exercising mechanical faith. But when you face the unknown, the untried and the undone, you need intentional faith-faith that believes God to do '...exceedingly abundantly above all that [you] ask or think...' (Ephesians 3:20 NKJV) If you're proactive, your faith will grow. If you're passive, it won't. Like the action of water rushing against a riverbank, there's an erosion of faith that comes simply from living every day. If you don't do anything to secure and strengthen your faith it begins to deteriorate. Christ told the church at Ephesus to remember the heights from which they had fallen (Revelation 2:5). What a strange thing to say! If you fell from a significant height, don't you think you'd remember it? Not if the fall was so gradual that you didn't notice it. So ask yourself: 'Have those who know me best begun to notice the gleam has gone out of my eye, the joy out of my step, the peace out of my spirit and the Word of God out of my conversation?' Faith is like a muscle; if you don't exercise it consistently it will atrophy and become powerless. So the word for you today is: '...Strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die...' (Revelation 3:2 NKJV)</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['A bruised reed He will not break, and smoking flax He will not quench...' Matthew 12:20 NKJV<br /><br /><p><i>Reeds</i>. Few things are more fragile than a bruised reed. In Christ's day, children playing beside the river made music pipes out of them. They were hollowed out and holes bored in them. But afterwards they were bruised and discarded. Perhaps you once stood tall and strong, nourished and rooted in the riverbed. But now you are hidden in the rushes, bruised by hurtful words, a friend's betrayal, your own failure or harsh religion. <i>Wicks</i>. Nothing is closer to extinction than a smouldering wick. When the oil in primitive lamps was gone and the wick burned low, it was extinguished, thrown away as worthless and replaced. Did you once burn with faith, lighting the path for others until the icy winds of criticism, unforgiveness and judgmentalism left you in darkness? What do all these people have in common: A woman trembling before an angry mob threatening to stone her? A house surrounded by people and a paralysed man on a stretcher, his friends not giving up until they get him to Christ? A blind man crying out for his sight and disciples telling him to be quiet? They are all bruised reeds and smouldering wicks that Jesus refused to give up on. The world thinks it knows what to do with you-break you off and snuff you out! But not Jesus: 'He does not crush the weak, or quench the smallest hope' (TLB). No matter how far gone you may feel today, you're not beyond the reach of God's grace. Come, He will treat you gently. He will make you whole again.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Troublemakers listen to troublemakers...' Proverbs 17:4 CEV<br /><br /><p>The moment somebody begins to gossip, stop them and ask, 'Why do I need to know this? Have you talked to the person you're talking about?' Wise up; people who gossip can't be trusted! The Bible says that when you listen to gossip you are a troublemaker: 'Troublemakers listen to troublemakers.' And Jude adds: 'These are the people who divide you, people whose thoughts are only of this world...' (Jude 1:19 NCV) Those are serious charges. And the internet has only made the problem worse because now you can spread gossip faster and wider, and remain anonymous while you are doing it. Paul speaks about those who 'devour one another...[and your whole fellowship]...' (Galatians 5:15 AMP) He says they should be avoided and disciplined. When was the last time you saw that happen in church? Solomon said, 'A gossip reveals secrets; therefore do not associate with a babbler.' (Proverbs 20:19 NRS) In other words, 'keep clear of them.' The quickest way to end gossip is to confront those who are spreading it. The church is not a 'tell all' television show where we expose people and hang out their dirty linen for all the world to see. Quite the opposite: 'Fire goes out for lack of fuel, and tensions disappear when gossip stops.' (Proverbs 26:20 TLB) Jesus taught us how to deal with personal difficulties when they arise: (1) 'Go privately and point out the offense.' (2) '...if you are unsuccessful, take one or two others...and go back again.' (3) 'If the person still refuses to listen, take your case to the church...' (Matthew 18:15-17 NLT) That's Christ's way, and it must be our way too.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...We stopped relying on ourselves and learned to rely only on God...' 2 Corinthians 1:9 NLT<br /><br />
<p>Jesus said, 'Here on earth you will have many trials...' (John 16:33 NLT) You solve one problem, and another one comes along to take its place. They're not all big, but they're all necessary to your spiritual growth. How do you assess the strength of something? By testing it! The Bible says: 'Don't be...shocked that you are going through testing...It will prepare you...' (1 Peter 4:12-13 CEV) Some of your most life-enriching experiences will come during your worst moments-when your heart is broken, when you feel abandoned, when you're out of options, when your pain levels go through the roof-and you turn to God. That's when you learn to pray heartfelt, honest-to-God prayers. When you're in pain you don't have the energy for superficial ones. And that's when you discover, 'The Lord is close to the brokenhearted.' (Psalm 34:18 NLT) God could have kept Joseph out of prison, Daniel out of the lions' den, Jeremiah out of the slimy pit and Paul from being shipwrecked-but He didn't. As a result, each one of them was drawn closer to God and impacted the world around them. Your problems force you to look to God and depend on Him instead of yourself. This is especially hard on super-achievers, like Paul. 'We...saw how powerless we were to help ourselves; but that was good, for then we put everything into the hands of God, who alone could save us...' (2 Corinthians 1:9 TLB) You'll never know what God can do until God is all you've got. So place your needs into His capable, loving hands, and watch what happens.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Unless the Lord builds the house, they labour in vain who build it...' Psalm 127:1 NKJV<br /><br /><p>In God's Kingdom, centre stage is not for those who think they've got their act together and deserve public recognition. Nor is it limited to those in leadership and public ministry. It's a call to action, to you, whoever and wherever you are today. When you trust God's timing He grooms you for bigger and better parts. But there are some things you must, and must not do: (1) <i>Don't try to make it on your own</i>. Popular wisdom says, 'Fake it till you make it,' and you'll be tempted to debut in your own strength. Don't do it! If you do, you will get in the way of a much greater production. The Bible says: 'Unless the Lord builds the house, they labour in vain who build it.' Trust God, and when your moment comes He will give you your cue. (2) <i>the shadows</i>. Are you ready to transform 'acting' into an authentic performance that reveals the real you? Fear of rejection is powerful. It takes courage to be yourself. But you gain strength from the struggle and power from the pain when you are willing to risk moving from the shadows into the light. (3) <i>Confront your inner critic</i>. We are all subject to the little voice within that says, 'You'll never be smart enough, rich enough, pretty enough or good enough to stand in the spotlight.' But when God raises you up, nobody can put you down. So remind your inner critic of God's promise: '...You shall go to all to whom I send you, and whatever I command you, you shall speak.' (Jeremiah 1:7 NKJV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Whoever makes himself great will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be made great...' Matthew 23:12 GNT<br /><br /><p>Do you remember Rosa Parks, the black woman who refused to surrender her seat to a white man and move to the back of the bus? There was more at stake that day than just a ride home from work. By simply being herself, Rosa suddenly moved to centre stage. She wasn't playing games. She was the real thing, and God shone a light on her soul that day that changed history. That's how it works: when God's light shines on your efforts, little becomes much. Jesus said that everyone 'who learns to be humble will find promotion.' (Matthew 23:12 PHPS) Now, since God is the only One who knows when your time will come, you must be prepared. 'How do I do that?' you ask. The Bible answers: '...don't be proud. Put yourselves under God's mighty hand. Then He will honour you at the right time.' (1 Peter 5:6-7 NIV) Allow the Holy Spirit to be your agent and advance man. Don't get ahead of Him. Just be faithful; when the time is right God will shine His spotlight on the next stage and assign you an even bigger role. And when the moment comes for you to stride confidently into the spotlight and fulfil your God-given role, try to remember that there's no room for self-importance and pretence. This moment calls for: stripping away all lesser roles you've acted out and settled for; discovering who you are and what your life is really about; depending totally on God to help you give the most authentic performance of your career.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...You shall go to all to whom I send you...' Jeremiah 1:7 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Jeremiah told God, '...I cannot speak, for I am a youth.' (v6 NKJV) Sound familiar? Have you been saying, 'I don't have what it takes'? God told Jeremiah, 'Do not say, I am a youth, for you shall go to all to whom I send you, and whatever I command you, you shall speak. Do not be afraid of their faces, for I am with you...' (vv 7-8 NKJV) When actors audition for a part, the director conducts what are known as 'callbacks'. At that point the actor either gets the part or it goes to somebody else. But when an actor is experienced and well-known, sometimes the director offers them the part without them even auditioning for it. Understand this: God doesn't do auditions and callbacks! That's because He's already designed a role for you that nobody else could fill. Even if others were to study you endlessly they still couldn't be you. When God says, 'I know you by name and you have found favour with Me' (Exodus 33:12 NIV), be careful about responding to any other call except the one that comes from Him. Since God designed you with all the built-in qualifications you need, you don't have to compromise your convictions, manipulate, drop names or do special favours. The part is yours! And don't be jealous or intimidated by anybody else no matter how talented they are. In God's eyes there are no other contenders; you're it! You're the only one who can fill the slot because He created it with you in mind. When you feel insecure and unqualified, remind yourself of that.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...This is what [God] requires...to do what is right...' Micah 6:8 NLT<br /><br /><p>Focusing solely on what you can , without first deciding what kind of person you should , is a mistake. Your talent may make your name known, but your character will determine what people associate with it. Your talent may dictate your potential, but your character will determine your legacy. What is character? It's the will to do what's right, even when it is not easy. It's deciding ahead of time what's truly non-negotiable. Count on it, the day will come when so-called 'progress' calls for compromising your convictions. In that moment, what hangs in the balance is your moral authority. So you must be clear about your convictions. You'll be tempted to believe that once you reach a certain level of success, these challenges disappear. No, success doesn't make anything easier, it just raises the stakes. What was once applauded is now simply expected. It's a lot easier to win the title than defend it. Furthermore, with success comes the inclination to see yourself as the final authority on right and wrong. Look around you and you'll see that it's not uncommon to find leaders playing by a different set of rules. Everything really does look different at the top! Once intoxicated by success, you start to believe that the rules don't apply to you. And that can be fatal. In the final analysis your reputation is how you're known before men but your character is how you're known before God. You say, 'But why cling to something that's outdated or has the potential to slow me down?' The Bible answers: 'This is what [God] requires...to do what is right.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Cast me not off in the time of old age...' Psalm 71:9 KJV<br /><br /><p>Sometimes we joke about getting older and say things like, 'I'm thirty-nine, and holding,' meaning we don't want to turn forty and be considered 'old'. As long as you have a dream in your heart you will never be old. The Psalmist said: 'I was young and now I am old, yet I have never seen the righteous forsaken or their children begging bread.' (Psalm 37:25 NIV) The main fear about ageing is ending up lonely, needy and unwanted. As living costs go up and pensions go down it's wonderful to be able to say, 'My God shall supply all [my] needs...' (Philippians 4:19 NKJV) Your golden years can be the greatest years of your life. All the things you wanted to do when you didn't have time are now available to you. 'I wish I had more time to read.' Now you can. 'I wish I had more time to spend in prayer.' Now you can. So many things: travel, ministry, grandchildren, hobbies, visiting friends; now you have time to enjoy them. Job 5:26 speaks of going to the grave in a full age. Judges 8:32 speaks of a good old age. Genesis 25 speaks of old men and women, full of years. You can die-full of years! That word 'full' means filled to the brim and running over. How good is that? Senior Citizen, God has a word for you today: 'Even to your old age...even to grey hairs I will carry you!...' (Isaiah 46:4 NKJV) Do you remember that old commercial for coffee, '<i>Good to the last drop</i>'? Make that your life's motto!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The time has come, He said...' Mark 1:15 NIV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says: 'After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming...The time has come...The Kingdom of God is near...' (vv14-15 NIV) The average preacher takes three years to prepare for a ministry that will last thirty years or so. Jesus did the reverse. He took thirty years to prepare for a ministry that would last just over three. What's the point? The quality of your preparation determines the quality of your performance. The world's greatest pianists invest hundreds of hours into practice before a concert. That's because they know those gruelling hours of preparation will allow them to give their best performance. World champion boxers don't become champions in the ring; they are merely recognised in the ring. Their 'becoming' is a result of their daily routine. Something important is happening at each stage of your development. For example, God can introduce you to someone today who will play a major role in your life twenty or thirty years from now. If you're in a hurry you may not stop long enough to connect with them. Think what a loss that would be. Waiting also reveals the weakness in your plans. Haven't you looked back and said, 'Thank You, Lord, for saving me from that!' Each chapter and season of life has a benefit and a product if only you will look for it. Before Christ launched His ministry, we read: 'Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.' (Luke 2:52 NIV) Jesus understood the value of timing and training.

<introtext><![CDATA['...This man welcomes sinners...' Luke 15:2 NIV<br /><br /><p>Let's look at two sinners Jesus welcomed: <i>, Matthew</i>. As a tax collector working for the Romans, he was hated by his own people, the Jews. But Jesus had special plans for him. Because he was skilled in keeping records Jesus not only saved his soul but salvaged his talents. As a result he ended up writing the first of the four Gospels. Do you still think God can't use you? Not a chance. The fact Matthew invited Jesus over to his house for dinner is surprising. The fact Jesus accepted was truly amazing, given the times. They didn't understand why 'This man welcomes sinners.' <i>Second, Zacchaeus</i>. Zacchaeus wanted to see Jesus so badly that he climbed up a tree. He was willing to go out on a limb to find God. 'When Jesus reached the spot, He looked up and said to him, Zacchaeus, come down immediately. I must stay at your house today. So he came down at once and welcomed Him gladly. All the people...began to mutter, He has gone to be the guest of a sinner. But Zacchaeus...said to the Lord...Here and now I give half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anybody...I will pay back four times the amount. Jesus said to him, Today salvation has come to this house...' (Luke 19:5-9 NIV) The Bible says that God '...is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.' (Hebrews 11:6 KJV) So be diligent in your search. Be persistent in your quest and relentless in your pilgrimage. Turn away from the puny pursuit of possessions and positions and seek the Lord. You will not be disappointed!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Who are you to judge someone else's servant?...' Romans 14:4 NIV<br /><br /><p>It is always a lot easier to stand on the sidelines and take pot-shots than to get involved and try to help. The Bible repeatedly warns us not to criticise, compare, or condemn one another. When you judge what someone else is doing in sincere faith, you are on dangerous ground with God. 'What right do you have to [judge] someone else's servants? Only their Lord can decide if they are doing right...' (Romans 14:4 CEV) Since you are not their 'lord', you need to exercise wisdom and restraint. Refuse to stand in judgment on those whose opinions differ from yours. Here Paul weighs in: 'Why, then...criticise your brother's actions, why...try to make him look small? We shall all be judged one day, not by each other's standards or even by our own, but by the judgment of God.' (Romans 14:10-11 PHPS) </p>
<p>Whenever you take it upon yourself to analyse, scrutinise and categorise one of God's children, four things happen: (1) You upset their Father. (2) You display your ego and insecurity. (3) You set the standard by which you yourself will be judged. (4) You alienate people. When you get a reputation for being critical, people will avoid you like a plague. They know that if you criticise others you will criticise them too. The Bible says: '...let us try to do what makes peace and helps one another.' (Romans 14:19 NCV) Someone said, 'The largest room in the world is room for improvement.' If you doubt that, look at the disciples Christ picked and promoted-then look in the mirror.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'If anyone goes outside your house...his blood will be on his own head...' Joshua 2:19 NIV<br /> <br />She was safe as long as she stayed in the house.Before conquering Jericho, Joshua sent two spies in on a reconnaissance mission. That's when they met Rahab and she befriended them. As a result they told her to let a scarlet cord hang from her window, identifying her house as 'off limits' to the invading army. But notice the instructions that were given to her: 'If anyone goes outside your house into the street, his blood will be on his own head.' There's a lesson here: if you're a procrastinator the lesson is: 'Get into the household of faith while you still have time!' If you're drifting away from God the message is, 'Don't leave the house.' When it comes to the importance of staying under God's protection, here are two great Bible illustrations: First, 'You shall take a bunch of hyssop, dip in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two doorposts with the blood...And none of you shall go out of the door of his house until morning.' (Exodus 12:22 NKJV) Secondly, 'Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, Unless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved.' (Acts 27:31 NKJV) Are you getting the message? Stay in church. Stay in God's Word. Stay in the place of prayer. Stay in the company of those who can build you up spiritually. The hour is too late and the attack is too great. 'He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.' (Psalm 91:1 NKJV)<br /><br />SoulFood: Heb 1-4, Matt 20:1-16, Ps 66:13-20, Pr 6:23-25</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...When I am old...You shall increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.' Psalm 71:18, 21 NKJV<br /><br /><p>When do the golden years begin? With your first grey hairs? When somebody says you remind them of their father instead of their brother? If you can still sleep-dream. If you can still work-plan. Take on new projects, make new friends, learn new skills, venture into a new ministry, take a short-term mission trip, volunteer for a worthy cause. Your golden years are not to be wasted, they are to be invested.</p>
<p>With God, there is no generation gap. 'Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and old together...' (Jeremiah 31:13 KJV) The Psalmist said, 'When I am old...You shall increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.' They say young people aren't interested in older people. Don't you believe it! Young people are looking for those with wisdom and experience. They trust them when it comes to counsel and guidance, and you can be such a person. Don't be like the old man who said, 'It's not hard to tell when your youth has been spent, 'cos your get-up-and-go has got up and went.' Get up and go after it! Caleb was climbing mountains and slaying giants in his last years. And Caleb's God is your God! At a hundred and twenty, Moses' eyes were not dim and his strength had not gone (Deuteronomy 34:7). And Moses' God is your God! Paul was an old man when he announced, 'I am eager to come to...Rome...to preach the Good News.' (Romans 1:15 NLT) And Paul's God is your God! Keep the torch burning brightly, then hand it on to the next runner before you go.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Even to your old age...will I carry you...' Isaiah 46:4 KJV<br /><br /><p>Growing old graciously should be one of your life's goals. You don't need to fear ageing, or try to gloss over your uneasiness about approaching it or attempt to cover up your anxiety. The story is told of a lady buying a new hat. When she tried one on, her friend said, 'My, that hat makes you look ten years younger.' Quickly she put it back on the shelf and said, 'I don't want that one. I'd hate to look ten years older every time I took it off!' 'Mother Nature' and 'Father Time' may have brought you backaches, baldness and bifocals, but you don't have to act old. And you don't have to  old. Instead of trying to add years to your life, try adding life to your years. Instead of resenting the fact you are getting old, think how much you would resent being denied the privilege. When asked how he felt about turning eighty, President Dwight D. Eisenhower replied, 'It sure does beat the alternative!' If you are still alive, God kept you around for a reason. Find out what it is, then pour every day and every ounce of energy you've left into it. You can be 'old' at twenty-five and 'young' at eighty-five. You are only old when you feel old; or feel like you know all there is to know; or find yourself saying, 'I'm too old to do that,' or think that tomorrow holds no promise, or take no interest in the activities of youth, or would rather talk than listen, or long for the 'good old days', feeling they were the best.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Draw your strength from Him...' Ephesians 6:10 AMP<br /><br /><p>Don't be surprised when God calls you to step out in faith and do something you don't feel qualified to do. That tends to be His standard operating procedure. He does it so that you will lean more on Him, and less on yourself. Does that mean you won't make mistakes? No, it means you probably will. But instead of being discouraged, you'll see them as part of the learning curve and go on to greater things. Often we look at a task and think, 'There's no way I can do that.' Hold on there; you're looking through the wrong end of the telescope! You're looking at yourself instead of . When God called Joshua to take the place of Moses, He promised Him, '...As I was with Moses, so I will be with you...' (Joshua 1:5 NKJV) Now if God promises to be with you-and He does-then that is all you need. His strength is actually showcased through your weakness (2 Corinthians 12:9). Whatever ingredients you lack in the natural realm, you can withdraw from your account in the spiritual realm: 'Be strong in the Lord [be empowered through your union with Him]; draw your strength from Him [that strength which His boundless might provides].' What kind of might is available to you? Boundless might! And where do you draw it from? The ultimate source-God! You are empowered and equipped as you work with Him, so stop selling yourself short. Armed with His might you have more capabilities than you think, and you are able to do a lot more than you've done in the past. So put your confidence in God and stop doubting yourself.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...It would not be right for us...' Acts 6:2 NIV<br /><br /><p>The New Testament church grew so fast that the apostles couldn't keep up with it. So they said, 'It would not be right for us to neglect the ministry of the Word of God in order to wait on tables. Brothers, choose seven men from among you who are known to be full of the Spirit and wisdom. We will turn this responsibility over to them and will give our attention to prayer and the ministry of the Word.' (Acts 6:2-4 NIV) As a result the Word of God spread, the church kept growing, and key leaders in the city of Jerusalem were won to Christ. It's vital that you discover the area where you add the most value-and stay there. Why don't we? (1) <i>Turf guarding.</i> We think, 'This is myjob; nobody does it but me.' Just because you've always done a particular job doesn't mean you should keep doing it. What if God wants to write a new chapter in your life? (2) <i>Being overloaded.</i> People with too much on their plate tend to reject the very thing that will help them, thinking it's just one more burden to carry. (3) <i>The martyr complex.</i> When complaining about your lot in life gets you the attention of others, you make it a lifestyle. But it doesn't work. People begin to avoid you because they don't see you doing anything to change the situation. (4) <i>Not knowing what's 'right' for you.</i> Only when the apostles delegated the administrative side of things to others and got back to what they were called to do, did things start to go right.

<introtext><![CDATA['...Three times a day he got down on his knees and prayed...' Daniel 6:10 NIV<br /><br /><p>Your habits either work for you or against you. Take any habit you practice, multiply it by 365 days, then multiply it by seventy or eighty years and you can write your own obituary. Simply stated: great people have great habits. One billionaire says, 'I arrive at my office at seven a.m. It is a habit.' A best-selling author says, 'I get up at the same time every day. I start writing at eight a.m. and quit at four each afternoon. I do it every day. It is a habit.' Jesus had habits. 'And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up: and, as His [habit] was, He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day...' (Luke 4:16 KJV) Daniel prayed three times a day. His prayer life was so predictable that his enemies used it to trap him. When measured by the same standard, how is your prayer life?</p>
<p>It's said that if you can do something consistently for twenty-one days you have proven that you can do it for twenty-one years. Will you slip at times? Sure, you're only human. But once you have tasted success it's hard to be satisfied with less. Jesus said, 'If you continue in My Word, then you are truly disciples of Mine.' (John 8:31 NAS) Note the word 'continue'-it's the secret of true greatness. Your success can be found in your daily routine. If you're serious about changing your life you must stop practicing bad habits and start instituting good ones.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['We walk by faith, not by sight.' 2 Corinthians 5:7 KJV<br /><br /><p>It's not that you don't know this, it's that you keep forgetting it and need to be reminded of it: <b>God can use </b><b>you!</b> Yes, the same God who worked through Moses and Esther, Deborah and Paul, works today through imperfect people like you and me. He can give you victory in the place of defeat and turn last year's humiliation into this year's celebration. All the great achievers in the Bible had one thing in common: they were just ordinary people who took risks in obedience to God, believed Him and ended up doing amazing things.</p>
<p>Can you imagine trying to fill Moses' shoes? God had used him to dry up the Red Sea, wipe out the Egyptian army, receive the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai and feed millions of Israelites every day in the wilderness. How would you like to follow someone like that? The thought of it must have shaken Joshua to his core. But God reassured him: 'No man shall be able to stand before you...as I was with Moses, so I will be with you...' (Joshua 1:5 NKJV) Once he heard those words he had the confidence needed to pick up where Moses left off. The Bible says, 'We walk by faith, not by sight.' The devil doesn't mind you speaking words of faith as long as you don't take steps of faith. So trust God. When He says something to you it's always for a good reason. When He tells you to do something, He will give you the strength and resources to do it. What's God asking you to do? Step out in faith and do it!</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['If anyone suffers...' 1 Peter 4:16 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says, 'Let none of you suffer as a murderer, a thief, an evildoer, or as a busybody in other people's matters. Yet if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this matter. For the time has come for judgment to begin at the house of God...' (1 Peter 4:15-17 NKJV) When Satan attacks you for doing God's will, it's both a compliment and a sign of respect. Clearly, you're a high-value target and you represent a threat to his kingdom. But when you suffer as a result of your own foolishness, there's only one thing to do: acknowledge it and repent. Don't say you're being attacked for being a Christian when you're really being attacked for being a 'busybody'. Note the words 'murderer' and 'busybody', and make the connection! When you speak evil of someone and are persecuted for it, you're not suffering for the Lord, you're suffering the consequences of your own behaviour. So what should you do? Go back and deal with it; say, 'I was wrong.' Don't try to act 'spiritual' and say, 'Well, I just don't understand why they don't like me.' Yes, you do! You can't do what's wrong, try to vindicate yourself and then claim God's promises. It doesn't work that way. 'The time has come for judgment to begin at the house of God.' It begins with <i>you.</i> Simply put, there are some things that God wants you to fix yourself. Don't wait for consequences to bring you to your knees.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...God has appointed another [future] for me...' Genesis 4:25 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Satan's plan was to infect Adam with the virus of sin before his first son was born; that way he could get all the rest of us. And it almost worked. Cain, Adam's first son, murdered his brother Abel. But God wasn't finished. 'Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and named him Seth, For God has appointed another seed for me instead of Abel.' For everything you've loved or lost, God has something else. For everything that's been stolen from you, God has something else. Your 'seed' is your future<i>,</i> and God has another one in mind for you. The situation you are in right now is not the end of the story; God wants to write a new chapter. The devil knew God had a plan for you; that's why he tried so hard to wipe you out. He doesn't want you to live long enough to fulfil it. But the fact that you're still here and able to read this says he failed, and that God's not through with you! Notice the word 'appointed'. There's an appointment on God's calendar with your name on it. 'God has appointed another [future] for me.' There's something good just over the horizon-something for your life, your marriage, your family, your career, your ministry. God has an appointed <i>task</i> for you to accomplish, and appointed <i>blessings</i>for you to enjoy. He has called you with an 'eternal purpose' and He will bring it to pass.</p>

<title><![CDATA[Is God Disciplining You?]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[is-god-disciplining-you]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['The Lord disciplines those He loves...' Hebrews 12:6 NLT<br /><br /><p>The Bible says: 'Don't make light of the Lord's discipline, and don't give up when He corrects you. For the Lord disciplines those He loves...God is treating you as His own children. Who ever heard of a child who is never disciplined by its father? If God doesn't discipline you...it means that you are illegitimate and are not really His children at all. Since we respected our earthly fathers who disciplined us, shouldn't we submit even more to the discipline of the Father of our spirits, and live forever? For our earthly fathers disciplined us for a few years, doing the best they knew how. But God's discipline is always good for us, so that we might share in His holiness. No discipline is enjoyable while it is happening-it's painful! But afterward there will be a peaceful harvest of right living for those who are trained in this way.' (Hebrews12:5-11 NLT)</p>
<p>Is God disciplining you? If He is: first rejoice, it means you are truly His child and that He has plans for your life. Secondly repent, and the season of your discipline will be shortened. Thirdly, recognise that God's discipline is for your good and not to harm you. After he disobeyed her, a little boy's mother said to him, 'I'm spanking you because I love you.' In tears, he replied, 'I wish I was big enough to return your love.' Don't resent God's discipline, and don't resist it. Recognise that it's for your good. And one more thought: Don't allow some well-meaning person to 'rescue' you from God's dealings. God's goal for us in discipline is 'that we might share in His holiness.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['By faith the harlot Rahab did not perish...' Hebrews 11:31 NKJV<br /><br /><p>For the next few days let's look at the story of Rahab the harlot. She lived in a doomed civilisation. God told Abraham, 'I give to you and your descendants...all the land of Canaan...' (Genesis 17:8 NKJV) Since Rahab lived on the 'wall' of Jericho, in a sense she lived on the 'brink of doom'. So do we. Today leaders scramble to stop the spread of nuclear weapons because in the wrong hands they have the power to destroy the world. The Bible speaks of a rider on a red horse with a weapon of such destructive potential, it could remove peace from the earth (Revelation 6:4). Could that be a nuclear device? Peter writes: 'But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the Heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat; both the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up. Therefore, since all these things will be dissolved, what manner of persons ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness, looking for and hastening the coming of the Day of God...?' (2 Peter 3:10-12 NKJV) Should we be frightened? No, the death throes of this old order are just the birth pangs of a new one. 'Nevertheless, according to His promise, we look for new Heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells. Therefore, beloved, looking forward to these things, be diligent to be found in Him in peace, without spot and blameless.' (2 Peter 3:13-14 NKJV) What God has in store for His redeemed people is awesome!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I know the plans I have for you, says the Lord. They are plans for good...' Jeremiah 29:11 NLT<br /><br /><p>While everybody else was preparing to fight, she was preparing to surrender. Somehow Rahab had heard about the things God had done for Israel; how He'd turned the Red Sea to a red carpet, converted rocks into drinking fountains, made breakfast for them every morning in the wilderness and dried up the waters of the Jordan River. Rahab may not have been wise when it came to her body but she was wiser than everybody else in town when it came to her soul. She wasn't about to fight God, for she knew it's a fight you can't win. For her the path to victory was surrender! And that is the right path for you too. If only you'll stop trying to 'run the show' and turn your life over to Christ, He will take you to places of blessing you've always dreamed of, longed for, but didn't know how to get to. God had a great future for Rahab. He planned to make her a progenitor to King David, and also our blessed Lord Jesus. How's that for recycling? And God, who loves both the rich and the down-'n'-out, will do the same for you regardless of the spiritual condition you may be in today. Read this: 'For I know the plans I have for you,' says the Lord. 'They are plans for good and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope. In those days when you pray, I will listen. If you look for me wholeheartedly, you will find me...I will end your captivity and restore your fortunes.' (Jeremiah 29:11-14 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...You were redeemed from the empty way of life...with the precious blood of Christ...' 1 Peter 1:18-19 NIV<br /><br /><p>What she trusted in, stood, when what everybody else trusted in, fell. What did Rahab trust in? Her morality? No, the Bible says she was a harlot. Her nationality? No, she was a Gentile, and therefore excluded from the blessings of Abraham. So what did she trust in? A scarlet cord! What a beautiful picture of the power and protection afforded us by Christ's shed blood. 'You know that it was not with perishable things such as silver or gold that you were redeemed from the empty way of life handed down to you from your forefathers, but with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or defect.' Notice what the blood of Jesus has rescued you from: 'The empty way of life.' Do you remember when you had no interest in church because your soul was at war with God; the God who brokered peace between you and Himself? 'And you, who once were alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now He has reconciled.' (Colossians 1:21 NKJV) How did it happen? '...Having made peace through the blood of His cross.' (Colossians 1:20 NKJV) You say, 'But I still fall far short of God's standards.' We all do. And God has made provision for that: 'If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.' (1 John 1:9 NKJV) When Joshua's troops saw the scarlet cord flying from the window of Rahab's home it meant she was accepted by God. And Christ's blood does that for you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['You will spread out to the right and to the left...' Isaiah 54:3 NIV<br /><br /><p>Has all the gloom and doom in the news caused you to become fearful and begin to pull back? Take a moment and read this: 'Sing, O barren woman, you who never bore a child...shout for joy, you who were never in labour; because more are the children of the desolate woman than of her who has a husband...Enlarge the place of your tent, stretch your tent curtains wide, do not hold back; lengthen your cords, strengthen your stakes. For you will spread out to the right hand and to the left...Do not be afraid; you will not suffer shame. Do not fear disgrace; you will not be humiliated. You will forget the shame of your youth and remember no more the reproach of your widowhood.' (Isaiah 54:1-4 NIV) Satan will try to plant all kinds of fear in your mind about things that are not even likely to happen. He will tell you that your children are going to be lost; that because cancer, Alzheimer's or heart disease runs in your family, you too are going to get it. His goal is to stop you dead in your tracks. He knows God's plan for you is to 'spread out to the right and to the left,' not pull back. 'How long will this attack last?' you ask. Quite possibly as long as the longest stand you've taken against Satan in the past! What can you do? 'Take up the whole armour of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day...' (Ephesians 6:13 NKJV) Stand squarely on God's Word and refuse to pull back.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['He gives more grace.' James 4:6 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Nancy and Ed Huizinga were at church rehearsing for the Christmas programme when their home burned down. It wasn't their first tragedy that year. Three months earlier when a friend, a widow with two children, died of cancer, the Huizingas took her kids to live with them as part of the family. So when their house was destroyed it wasn't just their home they lost, it was home to two children who'd already lost their parents. The following week as they sifted through the ashes they found a slip of paper that survived the fire. On it they read these words: '<i>Contentment: Realising God has already provided everything we need for our present happiness</i>.' God gives you 'more grace' when you walk through fiery trials. Charles Swindoll says: 'Our whole perspective changes when we catch a glimpse of the purpose of Christ. Take that away, and it's nothing more than a bitter, terrible experience. Suffering comes in many forms, but His grace is always there to carry us beyond it. I've endured a sufficient number of trials to say without hesitation that only Christ's perspective can replace resentment with rejoicing. Jesus is the central piece of suffering's puzzle. If we fit Him into place, the rest begins to make sense.' Donna VanLiere writes: 'When life blindsides us...abuse, foreclosure, disease, divorce, death, job loss or financial collapse brings us to our knees...grace says there's more love after infidelity, more joy after the diagnosis, and more life after financial ruin...grace is real...an indomitable gift with power to change your life. But it does come with one condition-like any gift, you have to hold out your hand and accept it.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Oh, the joys of those who are kind to the poor!...' Psalm 41:1 NLT</p>
<p>Even in a bad economy most of us are still better off than others, and better off than we have ever been. We may lack the latest, the biggest, the finest and the fastest, but we seldom lack the necessary, right? God doesn't 'guilt-trip' us, but He does want us to 'Consider [remember, be mindful of] the poor.' The Bible says, 'He who shuts his ear to the cry of the poor will also cry himself and not be answered.' (Proverbs 21:13 NAS) Could this be a key to your prayers getting answered? To be comfortably provided for is a blessing, but you must not forget those in need.</p>
<p>What is God'sattitude toward the poor? And what does He expect of us?'If there is a poor man among your brothers...do not be hardhearted or tight-fisted toward [him]...and give him nothing...you will be found guilty of sin.' (Deuteronomy 15:7-9 NIV) Helping others is an obligation, not an option. In Scripture the tithe took care of God's work and God's servants, but it was also to be shared with '...the alien, the fatherless and the widow, so that they may eat...and be satisfied.' (Deuteronomy 26:12 NIV) God said: 'If one of your countrymen becomes poor...unable to support himself...help him as you would an alien or a temporary resident, so he can continue to live among you.' (Leviticus 25:35 NIV) The truth is, we've been called to feed, shelter and clothe the needy (Isaiah 58:5-12). God is compassionate and generous to the poor, and He asks us to follow His example.<br /><br />SoulFood: Num 4:34-6:27, Matt 14:1-12, Ps 141, Pr 4:18-19</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Arise...go...to the land which I am giving to [you].' Joshua 1:2 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Joshua had already tasted the joys of the Promised Land. But then he had to go back and wait until Moses died and every doubter in Israel was buried. Observe: (1) <i>Some of our old ways must die.</i><i> </i>Moses represented the old system. It was good for then, but not now. When you align yourself with what was, instead of what is, you're not ready. There are still too many people you need to impress. You're so bound by certain philosophies that, when God says it's time to move, you have to consult somebody else. When God told Joshua, 'Moses My servant is dead...arise, go over this Jordan, you and all this people, to the land which I am giving to them,' there was only one correct response: 'Yes, Lord!' You must honour the past, but not get stuck in it. You must stand on the truth, but seek God for fresh instructions and insights if you're to reach your destiny. (2) <i>Your doubts must be buried. </i>Only two out of the twelve spies who went into the Promised Land believed God would give it to them. The other ten saw giants, caved in to doubt, died and were buried in the wilderness. And every doubt that's holding you back has got to die and be buried too, including the voice of your low self-esteem, your childhood fears, your anxieties and your critics. Gather them up, put them in a box, bury it, stand on top of it and say, 'Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.' Before you can move ahead you must understand and live by these principles.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Jesus wept. Then the Jews said, See how He loved him!' John 11:35-36 NIV<br /><br /><p>Some of us are like a closed book; people never get to know what's on the inside of us. Jesus was not afraid to be vulnerable. He wept openly at the grave of His friend Lazarus. So, can you show honest emotion? Do you talk of the trophies you have won but not the tears you have shed? When you speak only of your success but fail to share what you went through to achieve it, you leave people feeling like they'll never be able to rise as high as you have. Is that what you want? Jesus was infuriated when the strong took advantage of the weak; it's why He threw the moneychangers out of the temple. Yet He wept over the people of Jerusalem because He knew what the consequences of their rejection of Him would be. Now we're not talking about displays of uncontrolled temper, or dissolving into tears each time trouble comes. But unless you have the ability to show an appropriate level of empathy and transparency, you will have no credibility. The Bible says: 'For everything there is a season, a time for every activity under Heaven...A time to cry and a time to laugh. A time to grieve and a time to dance.' (Ecclesiastes 3:1,4 NLT) If you are able to be tough but not tender, people may admire your achievements and comply with your instructions, but they will keep you at a distance. And you will be lonely. But it's a self-imposed loneliness brought on by your unwillingness to open up and let them in. Jesus showed honest emotion; you must too.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Lord, by this time he stinketh.' John 11:39 KJV<br /><br /><p>Sometimes when we have a problem we do what Mary and Martha did with their deceased brother Lazarus. We bury it and roll a stone in front of it. Then Jesus comes along and tells us to roll the stone away so He can deal with it and make us whole again. It takes honesty, humility and courage to roll away the stone on a stubborn or shaming issue. But you will never become healthy and whole until you are willing to do that. Can you imagine the state Lazarus was in after four days in the grave? Martha said, 'He stinketh.' Yet Jesus said, '...If you [will] believe you [will] see the glory of God.' (John 11:40 NKJV) The great thing about this story is that no matter how far gone your situation may be or how unpleasant it is, Jesus can turn it around for you. But you must be willing to roll the stone away and allow Him to work. If you'll let Him, He can give you back what life has taken from you. People may give up on you but Jesus won't. Have you ever changed a baby's nappy? If anything else smelled that bad you would throw it in the trash, right? But not your child; you love them and you know that with a little help they are capable of outgrowing it and becoming something good. Like Mary and Martha, you may think it's too late for a miracle, but it's not. Your finances may stink, your relationship may stink, your prospects for the future may stink but, if you will believe, you will 'see the glory of God.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['He who observes the wind will not sow.' Ecclesiastes 11:4 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Too many of us stand on the dock waiting. We want the ship in place, the gangplank perfectly positioned, the weather right and an engraved invitation before we're willing to launch out. It will never happen! Dreams don't move toward us, we have to move toward them. It's time to quit waiting for the ideal circumstances, perfect timing and hundred percent guarantees. John Maxwell suggests that instead of saying, 'We've never done it before,' say, 'We have the opportunity to be first.' Instead of saying, 'We don't have the resources,' say, 'Necessity fuels invention.' Instead of saying, 'There's not enough time,' say, 'We'll change how we work.' Instead of saying, 'We've already tried that,' say, 'We learned from experience.' Instead of saying, 'We don't have the expertise,' say, 'Let's network with those who do.' Instead of saying, 'Our vendors and customers won't go for it,' say, 'Let's show them the opportunities.' Instead of saying, 'We don't have enough money,' say, 'Maybe there's something we can cut.' Instead of saying, 'We're understaffed,' say, 'We're a lean, hungry team.' Instead of saying, 'It'll never get any better,' say, 'We'll try one more time.' Instead of saying, 'Let somebody else deal with it,' say, 'I'm ready to learn something new.' Instead of saying, 'It's not my job,' say, 'I'll be glad to take the responsibility.' Instead of saying, 'I can't,' say, 'By God's grace I can!'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Faith is being sure of what we hope for.' Hebrews 11:1 NIV<br /><br /><p>Successful people do not spend the majority of their time thinking about what must be done. Instead, they spend twice as much time reflecting on what they have already accomplished, and on how they are capable of accomplishing what they set out to do. Football coach John Wooden said, 'Things turn out best, for the people who make the best of the way things turn out.' Pursuing a God-given dream is a bumpy ride, as every leader in the Bible found out. And only those who think right succeed. The greatest gap between successful people and unsuccessful people is the thinking gap. This is especially so when it comes to failure. Successful people see failure as a regular part of success, and they get over it. Jonah Salk, the developer of the polio vaccine, said: 'As I look upon the experience of an experimentalist, everything that you do is, in a sense, succeeding. It's telling you what not to do, as well as what to do. Not infrequently, I go into the laboratory, and people would say something didn't work. And I say, Great, we've made a great discovery! If you thought it was going to work, and it didn't work, that tells you as much as if it did. So my attitude is not one of pitfalls; my attitude is one of challenges and what is nature telling me?' Such tenacity only comes from right thinking, and it is the hallmark of all successful people. They keep trying, keep learning and keep moving forward. They win the battle in their minds, and then it overflows into what they do.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He kept his eyes on the one who is invisible.' Hebrews 11:27 NLT<br /><br /><p>There is a strong relationship between our movement toward our dreams, and the resources we need becoming available to us. Too often we want to see the resources, or have them in hand before we start moving forward. When we do that, we have neither the resources nor the movement. We need to be like the snail that started climbing up the apple tree one cold day in August. As he inched his way upward, a worm stuck his head out from a crevice in the tree and said, 'You're wasting your energy. There isn't a single apple up there.' The snail kept on climbing, and replied, 'No, but there will be by the time I get up there!' Over and over in Scripture God sent people out with what seemed like inadequate resources. But when they got to where God wanted them to be, the resources needed to get the job done were in place waiting for them. Vision doesn't follow resources, it happens the other way around. First we have a dream, then we have to move forward. Then-and only then-do people and resources follow. Then the plan God has given to us begins to fall into place. A wise man once said, 'Effort only fully releases its reward after a person refuses to quit.' People who succeed 'see' what others don't. It's what keeps them moving forward. 'It was by faith that Moses left the land of Egypt, not fearing the king's anger. He kept right on going because he kept his eyes on the one who is invisible.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['You are precious to Me. You are honoured, and I love you.' Isaiah 43:4 NLT<br /><br /><p>Are you able to look in the mirror today and say, 'Thank You Lord, You did a good job?' If you can't, you're in danger of settling for anyone who can give you what you're incapable of giving yourself-a sense of worth! You've got to find a healthy balance somewhere between martyrdom and narcissism. Until you do, everybody else's needs and opinions will be more important than yours. When that happens, you end up resentful and living without things you don't have enough self-esteem to ask for, because you don't think you deserve them.</p>
<p>If you don't believe in yourself and respect your own opinions, you'll finish up living to please everyone else. One wrong look or one critical word from them and you'll say, 'I'll never do that, say that, or wear that again.' Talk about feeling worthless and insecure! Thank God you don't have to live that way. Peter writes, 'The God of all grace...[will make you]...perfect, establish, strengthen and settle you.' (1 Peter 5:10 NKJV) God wants to give you a sense of self-esteem-built on His esteem. Will you let Him? Once others have heard you sing confidently, they'll want to hum along. Just make sure they're in harmony when they do. You train others to treat you by how you treat yourself. The buyer will pay no more than the seller demands. </p>
<p>So go to God today, ask Him to tell you who you are and what you're worth. He will say, 'You are precious to Me. You are honoured, and I love you.' That's God's opinion-make it yours! </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Jesus went...to a place called Gethsemane...' Matthew 26:36 NIV<br /><br /><p>The word  means <i>crushed olives</i>. And from crushed olives comes oil that heals, illuminates and nourishes. We all have our Gethsemane. To understand and embrace yours, look at the night Christ spent there before going to the cross: 'Jesus went with His disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and He said to them... My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch [pray] with Me. Going a little farther, He fell with His face to the ground and prayed, My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from Me. Yet not as I will, but as you will.' (Matthew 36-39 NIV) Notice: (1) Gethsemane is where your prayers are not answered as you'd like them to be. God understands how you feel, and He has a better plan in mind. () Gethsemane is where those closest to you cannot help. Like Christ's disciples, they will pray with you for a while but then grow tired and give up. At this point, you pray alone. You go on alone. (3) Gethsemane is where you feel the full weight of God's will. The Old Testament prophets spoke of 'the burden of the Word of the Lord.' Luke tells us that in Gethsemane Jesus was 'in anguish' and that 'his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground.' (Luke 22:44 NIV) We used to sing in church, 'All that I have, all that I am, all I shall ever be; cannot repay the love debt I owe; I surrender to Thee!' If you're finding it easier to sing than to surrender, you're in Gethsemane!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Lord, open his eyes so he may see...' 2 Kings 6:17 NIV<br /><br /><p>The Bible records: 'When the servant of the man of God got up and went out early the next morning, an army with horses and chariots had surrounded the city. Oh, my lord, what shall we do? the servant asked. Don't be afraid, the prophet answered. Those who are with us are more than those are who are with them. And Elisha prayed, O Lord, open his eyes so he may see. Then the Lord opened the servant's eyes, and he looked and saw the hills full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.' (2 Kings 6:15-17 NIV) By God's power, the servant saw angels. And God can help you to see His hand at work in what you're going through today. He never promises to remove us from our struggles, but He promises to change the way we look at them. After listing many of his problems, Paul writes: 'In all these things we have complete victory through Him...' (Romans 8:37 GNT) We'd prefer another phrase. We'd opt for 'apart from all these things,' but Paul says, 'In all these things.' The solution is not to avoid trouble, but to change the way we see it. God asks, 'Who gives a person sight?' Then answers, 'It is I, the Lord.' (Exodus 4:11 GWT) God let Elisha's servant see an army of angels, Jacob see a ladder that went into Heaven, and Saul of Tarsus see Jesus on the road to Damascus. The blind man said to Jesus, '...I want to see,' (Mark 10:51 NIV) and he walked away with clear vision. Today ask God to let you see His hand in it.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['He who gives to the poor will lack nothing...' Proverbs 28:27 NIV<br /><br /><p>When it comes to charitable giving some people say, 'That's Old Testament doctrine. What's the New Testament teaching?' Glad you asked! Jesus launched His ministry saying: 'The Spirit of the Lord is on Me, because He has anointed Me to preach Good News to the poor...' (Luke 4:18 NIV) And it didn't stop with Jesus. The New Testament church carried out Christ's mission of mercy on a daily basis. 'All the believers...shared everything they had. They sold their property and possessions and shared the money with those in need.' As a result, they experienced 'great joy.' (Acts 2:44-46 NLT) You say, 'Won't that leave me financially strapped?' No. Because of their compassion and generosity: 'There was not a needy person among them...' (Acts 4:34 NAS) The giver and receiver were both blessed. The rules of God's Kingdom are: 'Give freely and become more blessed; be stingy and lose everything. The generous will prosper; those who refresh others will themselves be refreshed.' (Proverbs 11:24-25 NLT) It seems counter-intuitive, especially when you are struggling financially, but God promises that the generous will prosper. This isn't about buying God's favour. We don't give in the selfish motive of expecting a reward (that's not generosity, it's greed!) instead we give out of faith. The Bible says, 'The Lord blesses everyone who freely gives food to the poor.' (Proverbs 22:9 CEV) 'He who gives to the poor will lack nothing.' Next time God nudges you to show compassion and give, do it. Then when you have a need, pray, 'Lord, I have honoured You, now I believe You will honour me.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...They gave themselves...to the Lord and then to us...' 2 Corinthians 8:5 NIV<br /><br /><p>Have you ever encountered a homeless person, given them some money, watched them shuffle away and wondered, 'Have I just paid for their next drink or rewarded laziness?' In some cases you may be right, in other cases wrong. So what should you do? In 2 Corinthians 8, God gives us a plan we can understand and follow. The Macedonian church did it this way: (1) <i>Both the well-off and the needy participated</i>. They all gave, even those in 'extreme poverty welled up in rich generosity...[and] gave as much as they were able, and even beyond their ability.' (vv2-3 NIV) (2) <i>They gave gladly, not under pressure</i>. '...Entirely on their own, they urgently pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing...' (vv3-4 NIV) (3) <i>Their giving flowed from their devotion to Christ</i>. 'They gave themselves first to the Lord and then to us.' (v5) They didn't give to impress others or for a tax deduction or to get the preacher off their backs or because they 'felt bad' for the needy. No, it was a natural response to being in love with Jesus. (4) <i>church leaders received, oversaw and distributed their collective giving</i>. They didn't give naely, trusting the integrity of the unknown and unproven. Their leaders handled and distributed their gifts openly, consistently and with accountability. They knew the finances were handled honestly '...in the eyes of the Lord but also in the eyes of men.' (v21) Bottom line: you can give without loving, but you can't love without giving to those God loves.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let me...glean...after him in whose sight I may find favour...' Ruth 2:2 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Ruth turned her life around when she was bereaved, broke and barren. How? <i>First: By choosing the right mentor.</i> She told Naomi, '...wherever you go, I will go...' (Ruth 1:16 NKJV) The fact that Naomi was a Jew and Ruth a Gentile, or that Ruth was young and Naomi was older, didn't put Ruth off one bit. Doubtless, there were times they didn't see eye-to-eye or relate to each other at all. But when God wants to stretch you He will put somebody into your life with different experiences and insights. Naomi was Ruth's eyes and ears in a world she didn't know; she was her tutor and guide in getting Ruth to her destiny. God is raising up leaders with solutions for today's problems. If you hope to be called for duty, recognise those He sends to prepare you. Whether they come to cheer, comfort, counsel or correct you, remember the words of Jesus, '...he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me.' (John 13:20 NKJV) <i>Secondly: By getting into the right field. </i>Ruth said, 'Let me...glean...after him in whose sight I may find favour.' Things were bad in Moab but good in Bethlehem. So Ruth left the comfort of the familiar, stepped out in faith, and not only ended up surviving, but thriving. In the end she married Boaz, the owner of the field, and went on to become part of the family of King David and our Lord Jesus Christ. How's that for a turnaround? God's plan for your future involves connecting with the right people, and being in the right field. So ask Him to guide you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Your faith has made you well.' Luke 17:19 NKJV<br /><br /><p>We become so engrossed in what we see, feel and hear, that we operate within our natural senses rather than our spiritual ones. 'Through your faith, God is protecting you by His power.' (1 Peter 1:5 NLT) Your 'faith' is what activates the power of God. Before a stone becomes a diamond it's just carbon put under extremely high pressure. The Bible says, 'These trials will show that your faith is genuine.' (v7 NLT) Trouble not only places a demand on your faith, but reveals the depth of it. You don't really know much about your faith when your bills are paid, your body is healthy, your children are acting right and your marriage is intact. But when all hell is breaking loose and you trust God to bring you through it, you know you've got faith. </p>
<p>Sometimes we think we're doing better spiritually than we are. But often the enemy has not ceased to attack, he's just moved from doing it in the natural realm to doing it in the spiritual realm. He's attacking your mind, your rest, your peace, your emotions and your thought life. So what can you do? Lift up the shield of faith and stop his flaming arrows. Take the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God, and use it to drive him back. (See Ephesians 6:17.) Put your faith to work. Say, 'Enough is enough,' and begin to take back what the enemy has stolen from you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Your faith has made you well.' Luke 17:19 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The Syrian army had surrounded the city of Samaria and its population was dying of starvation. Having lived off scraps of bread that folks threw over the wall each day, four lepers quickly assessed that they were in trouble. They said, 'Why sit here until we die?' (2 Kings 7:3 TLB) So they went into the enemy's camp, only to discover God had worked a miracle, causing the Syrians to flee in terror, leaving behind them food, water and riches. What do we learn from these four lepers? When you put your faith into action, God will go to work on your behalf. But you have to rise up and say, 'If I'm going to die, I'm going to do it reaching for something, building something, going after something.' When it feels like you are down for the count of ten, you have to rise up and say, 'I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the Lord.' (Psalm 118:17 NKJV) That kind of faith gets God's attention every time.</p>
<p>When you get desperate enough you won't care who God uses, you'll be willing to receive any help He sends your way. Naaman the leper, a five-star general in the Syrian army, humbled himself and became willing to listen to a girl who washed dishes and made beds in his house. (That's because she had an answer from God!) He was even willing to dip seven times in the dirtiest river around, in order to come up clean. (2 Kings 5:1-19) Faith says, 'I don't care where I have to go, what I have to do or who I have to listen to, whatever God says, I'll do it.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Your faith has made you well.' Luke 17:19 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Luke records: 'As He...passed through...Samaria...there met Him ten...lepers, who... lifted up their voices and said, 'Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!' So when He saw them, He said...'Go, show yourselves to the priests.' And so it was that as they went, they were cleansed.' (Luke 17:11-14 NKJV) In Christ's day lepers were social outcasts, so they lived together in a colony. But the problem is, you can't get well hanging around people who are as messed up as you are. That's why you need to bring the problem to Jesus. Notice the words, 'He passed through.' Jesus didn't go to the leper colony, He was just passing through. What do you do when you're losing your life, your family, your joy, your finances etc, and Jesus doesn't seem to be looking in your direction? You can get frustrated when it feels like He's blessing everybody but you, and wonder, 'Lord, when is <i>my</i> turn coming? I've served You faithfully, yet it seems like everybody else is the object of Your attention.' It's time to cry out, 'Jesus, have mercy on me!' Away with dignity and decorum, desperate people pray desperate prayers and God responds to their prayers. Notice, when Jesus was passing by these lepers did not shout, 'Unclean,' as the law required. No, they broke protocol. When you're in a bad situation, sometimes you have to break <i>out</i> in order to break <i>through.</i> You've got to do what David did: 'I cried to the Lord with my voice, and He heard me from His holy hill.' (Psalm 3:4 NJKV) Come on, if you want an answer, put your faith to work!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Your faith has made you well.'  Luke 17:19 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Let's look again at the ten lepers Jesus healed. In the final stages of their disease the flesh wasted away. But notice, Jesus didn't lay hands on them or pray for them. He didn't even address their leprosy. Instead He commanded them to go and show themselves to the priest. How odd. To some of us it might even seem ridiculous. But before God will do the miraculous, sometimes He'll ask you to do the ridiculous. Indeed, when He tells you to do something it may not seem like it's even related to what you're praying about at all. When that happens, you have a decision to make: doubt Him or obey Him. Instead of discussing the issue endlessly, just do what He's told you to! Sometimes God will give you 'a word' and it looks like it's not working but it is, even when it doesn't look like it. The faith that God responds to does not require explanations. 'And so it was that as they went, they were cleansed.' (Luke 17:14 NKJV) Note the words, 'as they went.' The Bible says, 'The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord.' (Psalm 37:23 NKJV) When God tells you something, step out on it. Try to imagine this: while they are walking, their toes are growing back. As they move in obedience to His word, a stub turns back into a finger. Don't stop now. Keep walking. '...He who has begun a good work in you will complete it...' (Philippians 1:6 NKJV) Rise up in faith and declare, 'I'm coming back!'</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...forgive whatever grievances you may have against one another...' Colossians 3:13 NIV<br /><br /><p>To start the New Year right, you must let go of any old grudges that are weighing you down. Philip Yancey describes forgiveness as an unnatural act and says, 'You don't find dolphins forgiving sharks for eating their playmates. It's a dog-eat-dog world...not a dog-forgive-dog world.' Bitterness comes naturally when you've been hurt, whereas forgiving is supernatural and requires God's enabling grace. But remember, Jesus said, 'If you do not forgive...your Father will not forgive your sins.' (Matthew 6:15 NIV) Humanly speaking, there is not one single reason God should forgive your sins, yet the offences He pardons you for every day far outweigh anything you will ever be asked to forgive others for. By forgiving, you change the whole dynamic. You open the door of a prison where you are both prisoner and jailer, setting yourself and the other person free. Grudges not only isolate you from people who were once friends, they actually shorten your life by producing deadly enzymes that contribute to a host of physical ailments. One man told his counsellor, 'I wish my brother could come to my wedding, but we haven't spoken in years.' The counsellor asked, 'How come?' Pausing, the man replied, 'It sounds ridiculous now, but I don't even remember.' Drifting apart is the natural result of an unforgiving spirit; forgiveness reverses the trend by restoring and healing broken relationships. It's a medical certainty that forgiveness adds years to your life. As a general rule, when you talk to people who've passed the eighty-year mark you find they are at peace with themselves- because they've learned to forgive and let go.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.' Luke 5:4 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Someone has said that mediocrity is just the best of the worst and the worst of the best. Is that what you want this year? If not, you must be willing to leave the safety of where you are, and go where God wants to take you. After fishing all night and catching nothing Jesus told His disciples, 'Launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.' In other words, leave the safety of the shoreline and be willing to face the fury of the storm, knowing that God is with you. Helen Keller, who overcame incredible challenges, reportedly said, 'Security is a myth. The reason we don't experience it is because it doesn't exist. Avoiding danger or failure is no safer in the long run than out-right risk. Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all.' Launching out means setting goals, establishing a plan to reach them, and becoming accountable. It requires staying in sync with God's will, confronting your fears and discovering the rewards that lie on the other side of them. It demands looking in the mirror, and respecting or correcting what you're becoming. It calls for devoting your life to something greater than yourself, even when others don't understand. It's having an 'I will fear no evil for You are with me' attitude, and attempting great things for God. As you enter this New Year, stop and recall God's goodness. Check the price tag on His will for your life against what you're already paying, and compare the rewards of both. Then, 'launch out' and don't look back!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['With God nothing will be impossible.' Luke 1:37 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says: '...God is working in you, giving you the desire to obey Him and the power to do what pleases Him...' (Philippians 2:13 NLT) Often the dream that won't let go of you, and the challenge that consumes you, is God 'willing and working' in you. If you have the faith to answer His call you'll achieve things you never thought possible. Thomas Edison said, 'If we did all the things we were capable of doing, we would literally astonish ourselves.' Don't let your background, your preconceived ideas, your present difficulties, your past failures, your self-doubt or the opinions of others keep you from becoming all that God wants you to be. In <i>If It Ain</i><i>'</i><i>t Broke...Break It!</i> Robert J. Kriegel and Louis Patler write, 'We don't have a clue as to what people's limits are. All the tests, stop-watches and finish-lines in the world can't measure human potential. When someone is pursuing their dream they'll go far beyond what seems to be their limitations. The potential that exists within us is limitless and largely untapped...When we think of limits, we create them.' Israel did that; they 'limited' God. '...They did not remember His power...' (Psalm 78:42 NKJV) As a result, they died in the wilderness. Sharon Wood, one of the first women to climb Mount Everest, said: 'It wasn't a matter of physical strength but...inner strength. The conquest lay within my own mind. I had to penetrate those barriers of self-imposed limitation and get through to the good stuff-the stuff called potential, 90 percent of which we rarely use.' The Scripture, 'With God nothing will be impossible' is not just a nice sentiment, it's the absolute truth!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Devote yourselves to prayer...' Colossians 4:2 NAS<br /><br /><p>Each night a little girl threw one of her shoes under the bed before going to sleep. When her mum asked why, she replied, 'My Sunday school teacher said if I have to get down by my bed in the morning and look for my shoe, it'll remind me to say my prayers while I'm there.' If it helps, throw your shoe under the bed! Prayer is the life force that sustains us spiritually. David wrote: 'As the deer pants for streams of water, so my soul pants for You...My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When can I go and meet with God?' (Psalm 42:1-2 NIV) </p>
<p>In his book, <i>The Power and Blessing,</i> Pastor Jack Hayford writes: 'I had gone on vacation, and I needed it! It was delightful to get to the beach. But about the fourth day...I found I was feeling empty inside. Then it occurred to me that for four days I hadn't read a word of Scripture, prayed a prayer or sung a song of praise. It was just kind of 'Let's get away from it all.' We were so involved with church that we didn't want to do anything 'godly' for a while. But suddenly I was called back by the inner hollowness I felt. Through that experience I learned that I can't recover at a physical or emotional level, if I neglect the spiritual level.' The Bible says: 'Devote yourselves to prayer, keeping alert in it with an attitude of thanksgiving.' Only when you've spent time in God's presence and drawn strength from Him, will you be equal to the challenges you face on any given day.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...But who do you say I am?' Matthew 16:15 NLT<br /><br /><p>Matthew writes: 'One day the Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus, demanding that He show them a miraculous sign from Heaven to prove His authority.' (Matthew 16:1 NLT) The Pharisees were bound by <i>tradition</i>, so they opposed anything new. The Sadducees were bound by <i>reason,</i> so they opposed anything supernatural. Since Christ brought a new revelation of God and a new dimension of His power, both the Pharisees and Sadducees opposed Him. So Jesus warned His disciples: 'Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.' (v6 NLT) In a culture where people used yeast to make bread, Christ's point came through loud and clear. Just as yeast works silently and spreads slowly, so doubt and unbelief work the same way in our hearts and minds. </p>
<p>Then Christ asked His disciples two questions. First: 'Who do <i>people</i> say that the Son of Man is?' (v13 NLT) He wanted them to know when their thinking was being negatively influenced by those around them so that they would be on guard against it. Secondly: 'Who do <i>you</i> say I am?' Immediately Peter answered, 'You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.' (v16 NLT) Jesus replied, 'You are blessed, Simon son of John, because My Father in Heaven has revealed this to you. You did not learn this from any human being.' (v17 NLT) There are things that people can teach you and if you're wise you will listen. But there are things that only the Lord can reveal to you and if you're wise you'll listen and do what He says.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Now there were...shepherds...' Luke 2:8 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The Christmas story goes like this: 'There were...shepherds...keeping watch over their flocks by night. And behold an angel of the Lord stood before them...The angel said to them, 'Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which will be to all people. For there is born to you this day in the city of David a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord. And this will be a sign to you: You will find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.' (Luke 2:8-12 NKJV) Have you ever wondered why the angel first talked to shepherds, a job considered lowest on the social ladder? Think about it: if he'd talked to church leaders they'd have had to consult their doctrinal texts books and denominational boards. If he'd appeared to celebrities they'd have had to check and see who was watching. If he'd appeared to chief executives they'd have had to consult their diaries and spreadsheets. So he gave the greatest news story in history to those with no axe to grind, no reputation to protect and no ladder to climb; people with humble hearts and open minds; people with simple, child-like faith. Getting the idea? Outside Bethlehem there is a church marking Jesus' birthplace. Behind the altar is a cave with a symbolic star embedded in the floor. You can enter the cave, but with one requirement-you must kneel. The door is too low to get in standing up! God still operates that way. You will find Him among the commonplace.

<introtext><![CDATA['I can die in peace...I have seen the Saviour.' Luke 2:29-30 TLB<br /><br /><p>The Bible says: 'There was a man named Simeon who lived in Jerusalem. He was a righteous man and very devout...and he eagerly expected the Messiah to come...The Holy Spirit had revealed to him that he would not die until he had seen the Lord's Messiah. That day the Spirit led him to the Temple. So when Mary and Joseph came to present the baby Jesus to the Lord as the law required, Simeon was there. He took the child in his arms and praised God, saying, &quot;Lord, now I can die in peace...I have seen the Saviour.&quot;' (Luke 2:25-34 TLB) The story of Simeon teaches us three important truths: <i>First: No matter how long it takes, if you seek the Lord you will find Him</i>. Or better yet, He will find you and reveal Himself to you. <i>Secondly: God, not you, chooses the time and the manner in which He will come to you.</i> Simeon didn't get to see Christ's amazing ministry during His three and a half years of supernatural power. He only saw the newborn baby in Mary's arms. But he saw God, and that was enough for him. <i>Thirdly: Even though he was </i><i>'</i><i>very devout</i><i>'</i><i>, Simeon realised that he was only ready to die when he met the Lord and embraced Him.</i> Some of us don't want to die until we've seen the world. Simeon didn't want to die until he had seen the Redeemer of the world. So the question you must answer is-have you met the Lord? Is He your personal Saviour? Only when you have the right answer, are you ready to die.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let us go on...and become mature...' Hebrews 6:1 TLB<br /><br /><p>Spiritually, some of us haven't grown up. 'You...ought to be teaching others, but instead you...need someone to teach you...until you become...mature...' (Hebrews 5:12-6:1 TLB) Just as there are signs of physical growth, there are hallmarks of spiritual maturity like the ones mentioned in 1 Peter 3:8 AMP: <i>(1) </i><i>'</i><i>Be...united in spirit.</i><i>'</i> Now unity isn't the same as uniformity where everybody has to think alike or even unanimity where we have to agree about everything. Unity is focusing on what unites us, instead of the petty issues that divide us. <i>(2) </i><i>'</i><i>Sympathising with one another.</i><i>'</i> The Greek interpretation of the word <i>sympathy</i> is 'to feel for' others. 'When [they're] happy, be happy with them...when they are sad, be sad.' (Romans 12:15 CEV) When you become more concerned about others than you are about yourself, you're starting to mature. <i>(3)</i><i> </i><i>'</i><i>Loving each other.</i><i>'</i> We all need friends to love and support us. The president of Taylor University said one of his greatest hopes is to end up with eight friends who'll attend his funeral without once checking their watches! <i>(4) </i><i>'</i><i>Be...compassionate.</i><i>'</i> In a high-tech age it's easy to tune out those in need. When Jesus saw people, '...He felt compassion...because they were distressed and dispirited...' (Matthew 9:36 NAS) Hurting people touched His heart, and they should touch ours too. <i>(5) </i><i>'</i><i>Be...</i><i>humble.</i><i>'</i> Charles Swindoll says, 'Look for opportunities to give...to build up rather than tearing down, to serve rather than being served, to learn from others rather than clamouring for the teaching stand.' So, how are you doing so far?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let us go on...and become mature...' Hebrews 6:1 TLB<br /><br /><p>Peter writes: <i>'</i><i>Never return...insult for insult...</i><i>'</i> (1 Peter 3:9 AMP) When you're under fire, instead of defending yourself with caustic comments and clever comebacks designed to put the other guy in his place, pray 'for their welfare, happiness, and protection...that you may...inherit a blessing [from God].' (v9 AMP) <i>'</i><i>Keep [your] tongue... from evil.</i><i>'</i> (v10 AMP) Some people never learn this lesson. There's an old English headstone that reads: 'Beneath this sod, this lump of clay, lies Arabella Young; who on the 24th of May began to hold her tongue.' During the French Revolution the king and queen were beheaded, leaving the crown prince orphaned. There was talk about beheading him too, until somebody allegedly said, 'If you kill him you'll just send his soul to Heaven. Instead, turn him over to Old Meg and she'll teach him vile, filthy words so his soul will be damned forever!' The story goes that, when they turned the prince over to this woman of the streets who tried to teach him all kinds of profanity, he said: 'I was born to be a king and I will not say it!' Bottom line, when you're the child of the King your words should reflect it.<i> </i><i>'</i><i>Seek peace.</i><i>'</i> (v11 NKJV) It takes courage to be the peacemaker. Everywhere you look people are angry about the economy, taxes, unemployment benefits and just about anything else you can think of. Being a peacemaker isn't the same as being a peacekeeper. Peacekeepers look for ways to keep the peace by maintaining a delicate balance between both sides. Peacemakers plough into the middle of the conflict and help them make peace with each other.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...outwardly...wasting away...inwardly...being renewed...' 2 Corinthians 4:16 NIV<br /><br /><p>You know you're getting older when: your knees buckle and your belt doesn't; you argue about which denture adhesive is best; you sit in a rocking chair and can't make it go; by the time you've lit the last candle on your birthday cake the first one has burned out; you no longer think 'getting older' jokes are funny. Getting older isn't for the faint-of-heart, so the Bible gives us glimpses of what it entails. Isaac's eyesight gave out. (Genesis 27:1) David was always cold. (1 Kings 1:1-4) Paul referred to himself as 'Paul, the aged' (Philemon 1:9 NAS) and talked about the physical and emotional pains of old age-of feeling abandoned and lonely, being disappointed by fellow workers, and saying goodbye to friends he might never see again. (2 Timothy 4:9-21) Jon Walker writes: 'On my most recent birthday my sister sent me this message: 'The bad news: <i>outwardly we are wasting away.</i><i>'</i><i> </i>(Did I mention this is my older sister and, as I like to remind her, she'll always be my older sister!) Then she added, 'The good news: <i>We do not lose heart...</i><i>even though outwardly we are wasting away...the inward man is being renewed every day</i>.' If you have creaky joints, arthritic hands, weakened eyes, a slow step, an ear that struggles to hear, or a heart that beats to the sound of a cholesterol drummer, be encouraged! God is preparing a...celebration for the day you arrive in Heaven, where you'll no longer age because you'll be home in the land of the ageless.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Consider it all joy...when you encounter various trials.'James 1:2 NAS<br /><br /><p>James writes: 'Consider it all joy...when you encounter various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance...that you may be perfect and complete.' (vv2-4 NAS) Peter writes: '...don't be surprised at the fiery trials you are going through, as if something strange were happening to you.' (1 Peter 4:12 NLT) Trials are the common thread that unites us. When you get through with one, chances are there's another one coming up the road. That's why James didn't say, '<i>if</i>,' but '<i>when</i> you encounter...trials.' Observe:<i> (1) Trials come </i><i>in various categories. </i>They're physical, emotional, financial, and relational; it's not a one-size-fits-all deal. Some are shocking, like the unexpected loss of a loved one; others are more drawn out, like an acrimonious divorce or a prolonged illness. Some play out in public while others take place in your own private hell. Some are due to your own, or other people's mistakes; others have nothing whatsoever to do with human shortcomings. <i>(2) Trials test our faith.</i> They bring us back to basics and remind us where our priorities should lie. Charles Swindoll says, 'During...intense trials I go back to...what I really believe...elementals such as prayer and dependence...getting quiet and waiting on God. Trials...force us back to the bedrock of faith upon which our foundation rests, and this becomes a refining and necessary process.' <i>(3) Trials mature us.</i> When we're suffering there's a tendency to try to look for the quick way out. Don't do that. Trials are designed to make us 'complete'. By letting them do their work, you end up stronger.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['A righteous man may fall seven times and rise again...' Proverbs 24:16 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Until you overcome the fear of failure, you'll be immobilised at the prospect of taking a risk. The important thing to remember when you fail is not to quit. History shows that failure can actually become a bridge to success. In school, Napoleon was forty-second in a class of forty-three, yet he went on to build an army that conquered much of the world. George Washington lost two-thirds of his military battles, yet against overwhelming odds he won the Revolutionary War and changed American history. Albert Einstein was such a slow learner that it was suggested he switch studies from physics to some other topic, yet he's considered the father of the atomic age. When you recall these names you don't remember their failures but their contributions to the world. Only when you consider your failure to be final, are you finally a failure. Failure is not an event, only an opinion, and as long as it's not <i>your</i> opinion you can come back and succeed. 'A righteous man may fall seven times and rise again.' In his first inaugural address Franklin Roosevelt told the nation, 'The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.' Failure is not fatal; you can begin again. But the fear of failure could prove fatal to your goals by keeping you from trying again. After cataloguing every possible scenario that could come against us, such as tribulation, distress, persecution, famine, nakedness, peril, sword, Paul writes: 'Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us.' (Romans 8:37 NKJV) So the word for you today is-don't be afraid of failure.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['A righteous man may fall seven times and rise again...' Proverbs 24:16 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Star baseball players only hit the ball about three out of every ten times. How do they live with such a high failure rate? By focusing on the law of averages. They know that if they just keep swinging the bat, they'll get on base. In 1952 Roger Bannister ran in the Olympics and finished in fourth place, failing to win any kind of medal. But he refused to quit. Up until this time many experts considered it humanly impossible to run the mile in under four minutes. Yet that was Bannister's goal. And on 6 May 1954, he became the first man to do it. Now runners do it regularly. What's the point? If you refuse to quit when you fail, you'll ultimately succeed. You just have to be willing to get back up and keep moving forward. In 1832 Abraham Lincoln was defeated for the State Legislature. In 1833 he failed in business. In 1835 his sweetheart died. In 1836 he had a nervous breakdown. In 1838 he was defeated for Illinois House Speaker. In 1843 he was defeated for nomination to Congress. In 1854 he was defeated for the US Senate. In 1856 he was defeated for nomination for Vice President. In 1858 he was defeated again in a US Senate race. But today he is considered one of America's greatest presidents. A wise man concluded: 'It's a mistake to suppose that people succeed only through success; they often succeed through failures.' And you're not defeated until the past takes your focus off the future. So don't be afraid of failure.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['A righteous man may fall seven times and rise again...' Proverbs 24:16 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The Psalmist wrote: 'Before I was afflicted I went astray, but now I keep Your Word.' (Psalm 119:67 NKJV) By doing it the wrong way, he eventually learned to do it the right way. The truth is, when you fail in one area, it can drive you to explore other areas. Most of life's successes are based on the principle of trial and error. Often failure is not falling short of your goal, it's simply not making the effort. Failure can actually help you discover your area of success. For example, when you hate your job you will likely fail in it. Yet it's in losing that hated position that you may be pressed to pursue what you really like to do, and are called to do. </p>
<p>Another benefit of failure is that it makes you less judgmental of others. When you've experienced failure you become more sympathetic. Instead of pointing an accusing finger, you see the need to extend a helping hand. Instead of saying foolish things like, 'I can't believe you did that,' you remember the pit God dug you out of and say with gratitude and humility, 'Been there, done that, got the t-shirt.' You know how it hurts to fail, and you feel their pain because of what you've been through. This makes you a better friend, a better mentor and a better example of grace. Jesus told Peter: '...Satan has asked for you, that he may sift you as wheat. But I have prayed for you, that your faith should not fail; and when you have returned to Me, strengthen your brethren.' (Luke 22:31-32 NKJV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['A righteous man may fall seven times and rise again...' Proverbs 24:16 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Solomon writes: 'Without oxen a stable stays clean, but you need a strong ox for a large harvest.' (Proverbs 14:4 NLT) If you insist on always having a nice neat stall, you'll have an empty stall. If you want a big harvest, you'll need a big ox with a big appetite who creates big messes. For example, if you decide to have children you'll have lots of joy, and lots of messes to clean up. Within minutes, children can take a house that looks like it belongs in <i>Better Homes and Gardens</i> and make it look like a trial run for the battle of Armageddon. So you've an option: live by yourself and enjoy a less complicated life, or accept the problems that come with having a family. Even in the dictionary, the words <i>striving</i> and <i>struggle</i> come before the word <i>success</i>. Dr. John Maxwell says, 'At some point you have to make a transition from believer of the dream, to buyer of the dream. No dream comes true without somebody paying for it.' And part of the price you will have to pay is in learning from the mistakes you make. You can attend every success seminar, read every success manual and follow every success mentor, but the price must always be paid in messes and mistakes. There isn't a single person in the world who has achieved anything without paying a price for it. Some pay with their lives or their freedom. Others pay by giving up options or finances or relationships. But one way or another, everybody pays.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Be strong and of good courage...' Joshua 1:6 NKJV<br /> <br />Joshua discovered four reasons why you need to be strong and demonstrate courage. Yesterday we looked at the first two. Today let's look at the next two: (3) For the sake of others. People are watching you. They want to know if you'll face the situation with courage or buckle before it in fear. Your ability to demonstrate faith in the midst of difficulties will give them courage. The battle is not just about you, it's about those God has planned to bless through you. You may not have money or fame, but you have influence. The attitudes you display and the decisions you make will influence your children and your grandchildren. You say, 'But I am afraid.' We all experience fear. But the Psalmist declared, 'Whenever I am afraid, I will trust in You.' (Psalm 56:3 NKJV) (4) For your enemies' sake. David wrote: 'You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies...' (Psalm 23:5 NKJV) God will not only fight for you, He will vindicate you in the eyes of your critics. It's good to have critics and competitors. Sometimes a foe can press you into victory where a friend cannot. Who would ever have heard of David, without Goliath? Who would have known about Moses, if there had been no Pharaoh oppressing God's people? And what would have been known about Esther, without Haman's evil plot against the Jews? What's your dream? Is there an enemy standing between you and its fulfilment? Maybe God is waiting for you to confront them so they become an instrument in His hand to press you into your destiny.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Don't ever forget kindness and truth...' Proverbs 3:3 NCV<br /><br /><p>A consultant says, 'I remember the call like it was yesterday...my boss said I was being let go. At the time I thought my life was over. Looking back, I realise it was just beginning.' Unfortunately redundancies are happening more frequently but there are ways to deal with them. Let's look at some of them.<i> If you are the employer:</i> Being a general calls for different talents than being a foot soldier. Redundancies aren't just about the people you're letting go; the ones staying on are watching to see if you're compassionate, trustworthy and transparent. If your actions tell them otherwise, your redundancies will cause morale, productivity and performance to plummet. If you create a crisis of confidence it can have a disastrous effect on the company. So how should you handle redundancies? (a) Communicate! Communicate! Communicate! Get out with your people and provide as much information as possible; (b) Explain the situation and the finances; let them know where the organisation stands. Explain why you have to let workers go. Once people understand, they're more likely to accept it; (c) Be honest. Let employees know where they stand. They'd rather know than not know. They'd rather have certainty than uncertainty-even if it's bad news; (d) 'Don't ever forget kindness and truth.' Never treat those you're laying off like a number. Treat them right and your other employees will treat you right. Offer support, guidance, coaching, encouragement and hope; (e) Don't prolong the agony with multiple rounds of redundancies. If possible, do it just once.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Stay away from complaining and arguing.' Philippians 2:14 TLB<br /><br /><p><i>If you are not the one being laid off:</i> Implement the 'No Complaining Rule.' Chances are, there'll be people around you looking for opportunities to grumble about the company. Don't be one of them. 'Stay away from complaining and arguing.' Don't let other people's negativity influence you. Work at tuning out pessimism and focusing on doing your best every day. Make yourself indispensable by working hard, staying positive and contributing to the overall success of the company. <i>If you are the one being laid off:</i> It's ok to let yourself feel angry, sad and upset for a few days. Then let it go. Jesus said, '...forgive anyone you are holding a grudge against, so that your Father in Heaven will forgive your sins, too.' (Mark 11:25 NLT) Maturity is having the ability to bear an injustice without wanting to get even. Forgive the company. Forgive your boss. Release the bitterness. You can't create the future by dwelling on the past. Ask yourself what you can learn from the experience and use the challenge to look for new opportunities. John Gardner said, 'We are not at our best perched at the summit; we are climbers at our best when the way is steep.' Who knows, your next move may lead to a new and more rewarding career or more time with your family or a better location. 'We...make our plans, but the Lord determines our steps' (Proverbs 16:9 NLT); 'Commit your actions to the Lord, and your plans will succeed.' (Proverbs 16:3 NLT) '...with God all things are possible.' (Matthew 19:26 KJV) You are the only one who can limit your future!</p>

<alias><![CDATA[conformed-or-transformed-3]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Do not be conformed...but be transformed...' Romans 12:2 NKJV<br /><br /><p>What does it mean to give yourself fully to God? <i>(1) It</i><i>'</i><i>s an act of worship.</i> 'Offer your bodies...this is your spiritual act of worship.' (v1 NIV) Worship isn't just attending Sunday service, singing praises and saying prayers. '...this people...honour Me with their lip service, but they remove their hearts far from Me...' (Isaiah 29:13 NAS) It calls for surrendering your heart to God twenty-four hours of every day; whether you're alone or in a crowd, at work, enjoying recreation, spending family time, at school, on a date or just walking the dog. If your heart isn't moving you, your behaviour will only be an act of reluctant compliance rather than one of joyful commitment. Surrendering to God isn't a part-time thing done for your own benefit; it's a full-time act of worship done for God's benefit. <i>(2) It</i><i>'</i><i>s a response to God</i><i>'</i><i>s generosity.</i> '...in view of God's mercy...offer your bodies...' (Romans 12:1 NIV) God doesn't say, 'If you don't surrender I will punish you.' There's no arm twisting. You don't submit through clenched teeth because of fear; no, it's a response to a debt. Everything God asks is initiated by His giving. Your repentance is a response to His love. Your tithe is a response to His blessing. Your obedience is a response to His promises. God's grace is never 'a deal', it's the 'free gift' of His love to the undeserving. (Romans 5:18) Therefore 'in view of'-as a rational response to-His mercy, 'offer your bodies as living sacrifices.' It's your 'reasonable service' and it will be 'acceptable to God.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Do not be conformed...but be transformed...' Romans 12:2 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Each time we offer our bodies as 'living sacrifices' to God, our stubborn nature will rebel. But with Christ in control we can break its grip. 'Do not conform...to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.' (NIV) We have the option; be conformed or transformed! Deciding 'I will not conform to the world' leads to a transformed lifestyle. Your old nature naturally conforms, enslaving you to worldly influences. JB Phillips' translation says: 'Don't let the world around you squeeze you into its own mould.' Conforming to the world's values, like sensuality, pride, control etc, will rob you of the liberating power of Christ living in you, resulting in a recurring cycle of guilt, failure and discouragement. Choosing not to conform to this world is what opens the door to your transformation. Unlike conformity, which is externally initiated, your walk with God will become an <i>outer</i> expression of an <i>inner</i> change. The tadpole's life is transformed into the frog's life, and the caterpillar's into the butterfly's. You become transformed from the inside out. How does it happen? '...greater is He that is in you, than he that is in the world.' (1 John 4:4 KJV) Add to your <i>decision</i> not to conform, your <i>commitment</i> to 'the renewing of your mind' which in Greek text means you think God's thoughts instead of your old thoughts, then watch as a Holy Spirit-empowered transformation begins to take place in your daily life. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Why are you crying out...Tell the Israelites to move on.' Exodus 14:15 NIV<br /><br /><p>Imagine yourself undertaking an important assignment. Things go well and God blesses your efforts. Then circumstances change, you face difficulties, discouragement sets in, those you counted on start blaming you, and now you wish you'd never undertaken the project. Welcome to Moses' world! (vv10-20) God told him to lead Israel out of Egyptian slavery into the land He promised them four hundred years earlier. But faith gave way to fear when they were stuck between the Red Sea and the pursuing Egyptian army. So they turned on Moses, blamed him for their dilemma and wanted to return to Egypt. What was Moses' reaction? Whatever he felt, he still believed what God had promised. So to calm the people he said to them, 'Stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord.' (v13 NKJV) That's good counsel. But God had more to say. 'Tell the Israelites to move on.' Instead of allowing them to rest, God redirected their energy by calling them to action. Anybody attempting an assignment for God encounters similar challenges. So what should you do? Ask God for directions, and don't consult anxiety-driven people. Have you been standing still, waiting for improved circumstances when God wants you to move on? Get going! While you are walking God will be working. He will neutralise the enemy without and the 'white-ants' within. Refuse to be depressed, deflected or derailed. The Red Sea will part, the enemy will be defeated, and you will sing the new song in the new land.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...he persevered because he saw Him who is invisible.' Hebrews 11:27 NIV<br /><br /><p>When you have a dream, there are certain things you must be willing to give up. You can't keep all your options open; you have to narrow your focus to what's most important. John Maxwell says: 'Many people do the opposite. Rather than focus on their dream and let go of less important things, they want to keep every option open. But when they do, they actually face more problems because decision-making becomes overly complicated...at first it's fun to have so many possibilities...But as time goes by, you can't make progress because you spend all your time preserving options rather than moving forward...When you expend your time and energy on the few things that make a difference...tasks that aren't exciting or immediately rewarding take on added value. Each activity becomes an important piece in that bigger picture.' When God gives you a vision He doesn't show you the whole picture up front. He does it in stages so you won't get overwhelmed. For example, when He shared with Moses His vision for delivering Israel, Moses had to wait for each part to download. By faith he left Egypt. By faith he kept the Passover so the enemy wouldn't touch the firstborn of Israel. By faith the Israelites walked through the Red Sea and their enemies drowned trying to pursue them. By faith he kept the Israelites moving for forty years through the wilderness until he stood, an old man, overlooking the Promised Land. What kept Moses going even after God told him he'd never enter the Promised Land? Simply this: he stayed focused on doing the will of 'Him who is invisible.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I insist on paying the full price...' 1 Chronicles 21:24 NIV <br /><br /><p>Dale Winbrow wrote: 'When you get what you want in the struggle for self, and the world makes you king for a day; just go to the mirror and look at yourself, and see what that man has to say. For it isn't your father or mother or wife, whose judgment upon you must pass; the fellow whose verdict counts most in your life, is the one staring back from the glass. He's the fellow to please; never mind all the rest, for he's with you clear to the end. And you've passed your most dangerous, difficult test, if the man in the glass is your friend. You may fool the whole world down the pathway of years, and get pats on the back as you pass. But your final reward will be heartache and tears, if you've cheated the man in the glass.'</p>
<p>The story's told of a small-town barber who was doing well until a big hair salon moved in across the street. They blitzed the area with signs: 'EVERYTHING FOR A DOLLAR. Dollar haircuts! Dollar perms! Everything for a dollar!' In despair he hired an advertising expert, who called a billboard company and told them to put up a big sign on top of the barber's shop. 'And what do you want us to put on the sign?' they asked. The expert replied, 'In big, bold letters put the words: 'WE FIX DOLLAR HAIRCUTS!' David said, 'I insist on paying the full price. I will not take for the Lord...a burnt offering that costs me nothing.' In order to fulfil your God-given destiny in life, you've got to pay full price.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Turn us back to You, O Lord, and we will be restored...' Lamentations 5:21 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Any habit you cannot break, or that you refuse to break, is a habit that has the power to break you. Are you dealing with appetites that are out of control? Do you struggle with compulsions that bring moments of pleasure followed by days of remorse? Do you go through periods of abstinence, only to be followed by seasons of indulgence that leave you defeated and condemned? Christ can set you free! The Bible says, 'God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil...' (Acts 10:38 NKJV)</p>
<p>It's not what you go through in life that messes you up; it's what you keep going back to! Are you tired of saying, 'I'm not going to look at it, I'm not going to listen to it, I'm not going to do it,' only to go out and repeat your old patterns over and over? Here's a prayer for you to pray, a prayer God will answer: 'Turn us back to You, O Lord, and we [I] will be restored.' Ask God to turn your heart back to Him, because the truth is, you can't do it for yourself! You say, 'But my friends have given up on me.' God won't. The Psalmist wrote: 'Many are they who say of me, &quot;There is no help for him in God.&quot;...But You, O Lord, are a shield for me, my glory and the One who lifts up my head. I cried to the Lord with my voice, and He heard me.' (Psalm 3:2-4 NKJV) Christ can set you free, so turn to Him today.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be strong and of good courage...' Joshua 1:6 NKJV<br /><br />
<p>Why did God say to Joshua, 'Be strong and of good courage'? For four reasons: <em>(1) For Joshua</em><em>'</em><em>s own sake.</em> God had a lot invested in Joshua; the future of an entire nation rested on his shoulders. And since God has a lot invested in you too, you must believe that it's His will for you to succeed. If you grew up in a family or church where you felt unworthy of God's favour and unentitled to His blessing, you must reprogramme your mind with the Scriptures. '...then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success.' (Joshua 1:8 NKJV) <em>(2) For the Lord</em><em>'</em><em>s sake.</em> God told Joshua, '...do not be afraid...for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.' (Joshua 1:9 NKJV) God's reputation was on the line. The nations in Canaan had heard how He delivered the Israelites from slavery, drowned the Egyptian army in the Red Sea and fed His people with food from Heaven every day. Had Joshua failed to conquer the Promised Land it would have brought reproach to God's name and made His people a laughing stock. The Lord had a bigger stake in Israel's success than anyone else. His plan to bring forth the Messiah depended on their success. His desire was to turn a bunch of slaves into the greatest nation on earth-one that served the true and living God. And Joshua had a big part to play in it. Where did Joshua's strength come from? This promise: '...the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.' (Joshua 1:9 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be strong and of good courage, and do it...' 1 Chronicles 28:20 NKJV<br /><br />
<p>In 1955 Rosa Parks was arrested in Alabama for refusing to give her seat on the bus to a white man. Boycotts and bloodshed followed until the US Supreme Court ruled segregation unconstitutional. Later Rosa wrote: 'Knowing what must be done does away with fear. When I sat down on the bus that day I'd no idea history was being made, I was only thinking about getting home. But I had to make up my mind. After many years of being a victim...not giving up my seat, and whatever I had to face afterwards, wasn't important...I felt the Lord would give me the strength to endure whatever I had to face. It was time for someone to stand up-or in my case, sit down.' Courage is displayed at unexpected moments; what you do in such moments can change you, and those around you. The story's told of a spy who was sentenced to death by a general in the Persian Army. The general had a strange custom of giving condemned criminals a choice between the firing squad and 'the big door'. When the general asked, 'What will it be?' the spy chose the firing squad. Turning to his aide the general said, 'They always prefer the known to the unknown, yet, we gave them a choice.' The aide asked, 'What lies beyond the big door?' The general replied, 'Freedom.' Then he added, 'Few are brave enough to take that door.' The dividing line between mediocrity and success is courage.

<introtext><![CDATA['Her children rise up and call her blessed...' Proverbs 31:28 NKJV<br /><br />
<p>At age six, Henry John Heinz began helping his mother tend the small garden behind their family home. At twelve, he was working one and a half hectares of garden, using a horse and cart for his three-times-a-week deliveries to grocery stores throughout the city of Pittsburg. He went on to found his own company and named it <em>57 Varieties.</em> The Henry John Heinz Company was incorporated in 1905, and today, over one hundred years later, it sells more than thirteen hundred products worldwide, ranging from tomato sauce to baby food. But there are other things you need to know: Henry John Heinz loved Jesus and was deeply involved in the promotion of Sunday school in Pittsburg and around the world. His company was noted for pioneering safe and sanitary food preparation and for being ahead of its time in employee relations. He provided free medical benefits, swimming and gymnasium facilities, and promoted women to positions of greater responsibility, making them supervisors. He earned a reputation for enhancing the working and living conditions of his workers. In his will, Henry John Heinz said: 'I desire to set forth at the very beginning of this will, as the most important item in it, a confession of my faith in Jesus Christ as my Saviour. I also desire to bear witness to the fact that throughout my life, in which there were unusual joys and sorrows, I have been wonderfully sustained by my faith in God through Jesus Christ. This legacy was left to me by my consecrated mother, a woman of strong faith, and to it I attribute any success I have attained.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The Good Shepherd...lays down His...life for the sheep.' John 10:11 AMP<br /><br />
<p>There are two ways in which we are like sheep: <em>(1) Without a shepherd to guide us, we get into stuff that hurts us.</em> God has no 'super-sheep'. The Bible says: 'All of us, like sheep, have strayed...We have left God's paths to follow our own...' (Isaiah 53:6 NLT) Like sheep, sometimes we are clueless and headstrong, choosing things that turn out badly unless God intervenes. <em>(2) Sh</em><em>eep aren</em><em>'</em><em>t smart enough to hide their shortcomings.</em> Indeed, their willingness to be what they are is one of their strengths. FB Meyer said, 'I used to think God's gifts were on shelves, one above the other, and the taller we grew the more easily we could reach them. I now find they're on shelves, one beneath the other, and it's not a question of growing taller but stooping lower.' Solomon said, '...with humility comes wisdom.' (Proverbs 11:2 NLT) Since God already knows everything about you, why bother pretending? Plus, the things you refuse to acknowledge and deal with just stunt your growth and limit your usefulness to God. That's too high a price to pay! God values truth and He expects you to be truthful with Him, other people and yourself. Paul writes: '...express truth [in all things, speaking truly, dealing truly, living truly]...' (Ephesians 4:15 AMP) And James adds: 'Confess your [faults] one to another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed...' (James 5:16 NKJV) We all have our pluses and minuses. But when you give God all that you are (and aren't!), He will bless and use you in spite of yourself.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['The virgin will...give birth to a son...' Matthew 1:23 NIV<br /><br /><p>Heaven announced the birth of Jesus in these words: 'The virgin will...give birth to a son, and...call Him Immanuel-which means, 'God with us.' Isn't it ironic that the first people to question the miracle of the virgin birth were religious leaders? The Pharisees said to Jesus, 'We were not born of fornication...' (John 8:41 NKJV) Their insinuation was clear and cruel. After all, Jesus couldn't point to Joseph and say, 'He's my father.' Understand this: Jesus had to be man in order to die, and He had to be God in order to save. You are the child of an earthly father, so you were 'born in sin'. But Jesus was the child of a heavenly Father, so He broke the genetic cycle of sin before He was born. In the Old Testament a sacrificial lamb had to be without blemish (birth defect) or spot (something picked up along the way). Since Jesus had neither inherited sin nor practised sin, He qualifies as '...the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.' (John 1:29 NAS) The virgin birth is true because: (a) The angel of the Lord announced it (Matthew 1:20); (b) Mary's husband-to-be accepted it (Matthew 1:24); (c) Elizabeth, her cousin, received it by divine revelation (Luke 1:41-42); (d) The story was written by a well-respected medical doctor who knew the character of all concerned: '...since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for you...that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.' (Luke 1:3-4 NIV) </p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Do not be conformed...but be transformed...' Romans 12:2 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Transformation: <i>(1) Requires personal sacrifice.</i> It's not easy, natural or automatic. It calls for becoming a 'living sacrifice'. The problem with 'living' sacrifices is their tendency to keep escaping the altar, having to be led back repeatedly to be sacrificed again and again. Salvation is an instant, once-for-all experience, but there can be no instant, once-for-all 'living sacrifice'. It's a day-by-day, moment-by-moment recommitment which means bringing our stubborn nature back to the altar, surrendering it to God as often as necessary. Don't wait for your old nature to improve or to agree to die before concluding your sacrifice is truly genuine. And don't let it discourage you in your battle for victory; your old nature and your regenerated spirit are mutual enemies, '...constantly fighting each other, so you are not free to carry out your good intentions.' (Galatians 5:17 NLT) Your job isn't to obliterate the flesh but to crucify it each time it wants to take over, refusing to let it curtail or cripple your commitment to spiritual growth. <i>(2) Is a two</i><i>-</i><i>sided issue.</i> '...offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God.' (Romans 12:1 NIV) That involves a resolute decision of mind and will, because our bodies don't surrender themselves. Until you deliberately choose to 'offer your [body]...to God,' your flesh will act unrestrained. '...Just as you...offer the parts of your body in slavery...to ever increasing wickedness, so now offer them in slavery to righteousness leading to holiness.' (Romans 6:19 NIV) When you surrender to your lower impulses, you reap sin. When you surrender to God, you reap His blessing.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Do not be conformed...but be transformed...' Romans 12:2 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Chuck Swindoll said, 'We like to imagine ourselves a race of rugged individuals-the Patrick Henrys, Davy Crocketts and Lone Rangers. The truth is, we hate to appear different lest we be ostracised, branded fanatics and rejected. So, we conform. You'll see it in the child eager to please; the adolescent aligning with peer pressure; the adult breaking their back to keep up with the Joneses.' Just being different for its own sake is likely to be worthless, even counterproductive. What God wants from us is our willingness to be radically transformed. 'Therefore, I urge you...to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God-this is your spiritual act of worship. Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.' (Romans 12:1-2 NIV) Here are two important observations to help you reach that goal: <i>First: Transformation belongs to believers.</i> The unbeliever can't break the world's control over them without Christ, but believers are promised: '...the Spirit who lives in you is greater than the spirit who lives in the world.' (1 John 4:4 NLT) God's indwelling Spirit enables you to resist the world's pressure to conform you to its ways. <i>Secondly: God</i><i>'</i><i>s appeal is urgent.</i> 'I urge you, brothers.' Words like <i>beg, plead, beseech</i> are used in some translations because the appeal isn't secondary or optional. It's vital, a divine imperative! God is seeking for surrendered vessels that are ready to be transformed for His use. Are you willing to say, 'Yes, Lord, use me!'</p>

<alias><![CDATA[grace]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...we have all received...one grace after another...' John 1:16 AMP<br /><br /><p>God's grace comes to us free and clear, with no strings attached. In fact, He's more tolerant and less judgmental than any of us are. We weren't worthy and didn't deserve it but because we belong to Christ, 'Out of His...(abundance) we have all received...one grace after another...spiritual blessing upon spiritual blessing...favour upon favour and gift [heaped] upon gift.' Richard J. Neuhaus said, 'The moralising and legalising of the Gospel of God's grace is a dull heresy peddled to disappointed people who are angry because they have not received what they had no good reason to expect.'</p>
<p>When you truly grasp the concept of grace: (1) You will gain a fresh appreciation for God's gifts to you-things like salvation and forgiveness, the gift of life, health, laughter, music, beauty and friendship. (2) You will be less critical and less concerned with what other people do. Ever heard the saying, 'I'm ok with me.'? When you operate in the freedom that comes with grace, you're ok letting other people chart their own course and make decisions you may not make. (3) You will become more tolerant and less judgmental. Instead of focusing on appearance based on religious performance, you will look for authenticity and a genuine love for God. (4) You will grow spiritually. David said, 'He brought me out into a spacious place...' (Psalm 18:19 NIV) Grace expands your horizons so you can never go back to where you once were.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...God, the source of hope, will fill you...with...peace...' Romans 15:13 NLT<br /><br /><p>We often use the word 'hope' when we want something to happen but we're not sure it will. We <i>hope</i> fixing the car won't cost too much. We <i>hope</i> our children graduate. We <i>hope</i> the medical test goes well. But our hope isn't wishful thinking; it's trusting God. So how do you keep hope alive when you're out of work? 'God, the source of hope, will fill you...with...peace because you trust in Him.' Jon Gordon says: 'The media is creating a frenzy of panic...that is negatively impacting [our] collective psychology...people are more stressed than ever...like a horror movie, what you fear starts to happen...However, the economy isn't some abstract entity...Our thoughts and behaviours create it. So how can we trust...when everything we've trusted in is falling apart? My answer: we've put our faith in the wrong things...and the cracks have been exposed. It's a wake-up call. As Charles West says, &quot;We turn to God for help when our foundations are shaking, only to learn that it is God who's shaking them.&quot; Security is an illusion. There's no power in a bank account...no peace in an investment portfolio...our true purpose isn't in a retirement plan...We're meant to trust God...true power exists not in what seems strong and secure, but in what is silent and unseen...Instead of starting your morning watching TV, take a walk of prayer; instead of looking down at the newspaper, look up to Heaven.' Prayer: '<i>Lord, sometimes my hopes are just wishes, but hoping in You is different; You give me solid ground. Today my hope is based on Your faithfulness and Your p</i><i>romise to meet my every need. Thank You; I know You</i><i>'</i><i>ll do it. Amen.</i><i>'</i></p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...You gave me room when I was in distress...' Psalm 4:1 NRS<br /><br /><p>When God wants to make you a bigger person, He does it through 'distress'. The way to build stronger muscle is to lift more weight. Now when a muscle is put under stress, you groan. But if you persist, that muscle grows stronger and what you were groaning about last week you are smiling about this week. Who said the Christian life was supposed to be easy? Not God! His Word compares it to a battlefield, not a bed of roses. '...endure hardness, as a good soldier...' (2 Timothy 2:3 KJV) Satan's number one target is your faith! Jesus said to Peter, '...Satan has asked for you, that he may sift you as wheat. But I have prayed for you, that your faith should not fail...' (Luke 22:31-32 NKJV) In the same way you separate wheat from chaff, Satan wants to separate you from your faith. Not only did Peter survive this attack, he grew through it and wrote: 'Beloved, do not think it strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you.' (1 Peter 4:12 NKJV) Because we tend to be shocked when trials come our way, Peter deals with our <i>attitude</i> toward attack. He wants us to know how to <i>think</i> when we're under attack, to understand the <i>appropriateness</i> of the battle we are in. Satan may attack your health but he's after your faith. He may attack your finances but he's after your faith. If he can destroy your confidence in God and His Word, he wins and you lose. So the word for you today is: 'Strengthen your faith.'</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['How great is the love the Father has lavished on us...' 1 John 3:1 NIV<br /><br /><p>God knows everything there is to know about you, including your past, present and future. He doesn't miss a thing. He knows your name: 'Fear not, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by your name; you are Mine.' (Isaiah 43:1 NKJV) He also knows your address: 'I know...where you dwell...' (Revelation 2:13 NKJV) And here's the most amazing part. With full knowledge of you, He loves you! He doesn't say, 'I love you, if.' There are no 'ifs' in God's heart. His love for you existed before you were born and it will exist after you're gone. 'How great is the love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are!' Does that mean God doesn't care what we say or do? No, to love without condition doesn't mean to love without concern. Sometimes we confuse unconditional love with unconditional approval. God doesn't approve of betrayal, selfishness, pride, dishonesty, lust, resentment or any other form of sin. These are the opposite of the love God wants to instil in our hearts. God's unconditional love just means He <i>continues</i> to love us even when we blow it; that He <i>waits</i> for us like the father waited for the return of his prodigal son. It's important that we hold to the truth that God never stops loving us even when He's grieved by what we do. 'Why is that so important?' you ask. Because God's love is the magnet that will draw us back to Him every time.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The name of the Lord is a strong tower...' Proverbs 18:10 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Martin Niemoller, a former U-boat captain, was among those in Germany who spoke out against Hitler. Predictably, he was arrested and imprisoned. En route to face his accusers in court he was walking through an underground tunnel when he heard these words: 'The name of the Lord is a strong tower; the righteous run to it and are safe.' Niemoller was shocked. There was nobody around who could have said them. Had God spoken to him audibly? In the end it didn't matter because God used His Word to strengthen and encourage one of His own. Apparently a Christian guard, who knew the acoustics inside the tunnel would allow somebody to whisper into the wall and be heard up ahead, had quoted the verse. Niemoller was acquitted but he was still imprisoned for another seven years. When the prosecutor asked, 'How can we imprison a man who's been acquitted?' Hitler replied, 'Because he's my personal prisoner!' Jesus said, '...when people...persecute you and falsely say...evil against you because of Me, rejoice...great is your reward in Heaven...' (Matthew 5:11-12 NIV) Charles Swindoll writes: 'When you're punished for doing the right thing, you've a &quot;great cloud of witnesses&quot; surrounding you (Hebrews 12:1)...faithful men and women who extended the Kingdom and made the world a better place...at great personal cost...Take courage...you fight for the winning side.' The Bible says: '...everyone who wants to live a godly life...will suffer...' (2 Timothy 3:12 NLT) The second that prison-cell door slammed shut, Niemoller joined a distinguished league of saints willing to endure hardship in this life in order to reign with Christ in the next one.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...we have not stopped praying for you...' Colossians 1:9 NIV<br /><br /><p>When it came to those he loved, notice what Paul prayed for: <i>(1) That they would understand the will of God.</i> 'Asking God to fill you with the knowledge of His will through all spiritual wisdom and understanding.' Rome was not an easy place to be a Christian, yet Paul wrote: 'Everyone has heard about your obedience...' (Romans 16:19 NIV) Obedience to God's will should be your number one priority. When your name is mentioned, no one should have any doubt as to the level of your commitment to Jesus. <i>(2) That their lives would be pleasing to God.</i> 'That you may live a life worthy of the Lord and may please Him in every way...' (Colossians 1:10 NIV) When you stand before God to be rewarded you won't hear the words 'well said' or 'well planned' but, 'Well done, good and faithful servant...' (Matthew 25:21 NKJV) <i>(3) That they would prosper in the work God had given them.</i> '...bearing fruit in every good work...' (Colossians 1:10 NIV) Nothing brings joy to the heart of a parent like seeing their child succeed. And God feels the same way about you. <i>(4) That they would persevere by drawing on His strength.</i> 'Being strengthened with all power according to His glorious might so that you may have great endurance...' (Colossians 1:11 NIV) Like a light bulb, you depend on power from another source. So unless you stay connected to God you'll be spiritually weak. <i>(5) That they would praise God.</i> 'Giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints...' (Colossians 1:12 NIV) In other words, live with an attitude of gratitude and a heart of praise.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['The word of the Lord came to Abram...saying, &quot;Do not be afraid.&quot;' Genesis 15:1 NKJV<br /><br /><p>God asked Abraham to do a very difficult thing: '...&quot;Leave your country...and your father's household and go to the land I will show you. I will make you into a great nation and I will bless you; I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing...&quot; So Abram left, as the Lord had told him.' (Genesis 12:1-4 NIV) If you're afraid of changing jobs, houses or locations, stand on this Scripture because as a redeemed child of God you are entitled to the blessing of Abraham. All our fears basically come down to these two questions: First: 'Lord, will You protect me?' Secondly: 'Lord, will You provide for me?' With Abraham, God addresses both: 'Do not be afraid...I am your shield, your very great reward.' (Genesis 15:1 NIV) The words, 'very great reward,' literally mean, 'I am your unfailing, inexhaustible, ever increasing source of supply.' Awesome! You don't have to go to anybody else for protection or provision; God's got you covered! And notice what happened next. God entered into a covenant with Abraham (Genesis 15:18); He said to him: 'I'll take care of you and your descendants as long as you live.' But there was a problem. 'Then birds of prey came down on the [sacrifice], but Abram drove them away.' (Genesis 15:11 NIV) There's a lesson here. Even though God has promised to take care of you, you must drive away the worries Satan sends to prey on your mind. How do you do that? By standing squarely on the promises God has made to you in His Word.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The word of the Lord came to Abram...saying, &quot;Do not be afraid.&quot;' Genesis 15:1 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Researchers have found that about forty percent of the things we worry about never happen. Thirty percent are in the past and can't be helped. Twelve percent involve the affairs of others that are not even our business. Ten percent relate to sickness, real or imagined. That means <i>only</i> <i>eight percent</i> of the things we worry about are even likely to happen! Scientists at Yale University have actually identified a 'worry gene'. But they say that while you may have inherited it, you can overcome it. Somebody has said that 'worry is just interest paid on trouble before it comes due.' And in most cases it never comes due. Think; when you worry, there's a <i>ninety</i><i>-</i><i>two percent</i> chance you're paying interest on a debt that's not even yours! How foolish is that? Take the fear of flying, for example. You would have to fly every day for nineteen thousand years before the probability of being in a plane crash approaches 100%. Yet it is one of the six most feared causes of death. Someone has said that there are three hundred and sixty-five 'fear nots' in the Bible-one for every day of the year. When you worry, you doubt God and give the devil an entry point into your life. How long have you been doing this? When are you going to stop it? Knowing that Abraham was leaving his comfort zone and his security base, God said, 'Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your very great reward.' (Genesis 15:1 NIV) And today God's saying the same to you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The word of the Lord came to Abram...saying, &quot;Do not be afraid.&quot;' Genesis 15:1 NKJV<br /><br /><p>William Shakespeare's romantic comedy, <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i>, has a title connected to the Biblical story of Jesus raising the daughter of Jairus from the dead. When Jairus went to Jesus for help, his daughter was critically ill. While he was walking with Jesus toward his home the little girl died. At that point Jesus told the devastated father, 'Do not be afraid; only believe.' (Mark 5:36 NKJV) When they arrived at the house everybody was weeping. At this point Jesus asked, 'Why make ye this ado?' (Mark 5:39 KJV) The word 'ado' means 'commotion, clamour and uproar.' Then Jesus took the child by the hand and told her to get up. And to everyone's amazement, she did. Now if Jesus can raise the dead, surely you don't have a problem He can't solve! The miracle was set in motion the moment Jairus went to Jesus. And by doing the same thing, you are positioning yourself to get the results you need. Are you going to make a great 'ado' or are you going to pray in faith, believing God to come through for you? How much energy and emotion are you wasting over things that will never materialise? Or things you can't control? How many more nights are you going to lie awake, staring at the ceiling, thinking about all the things that could possibly happen? Can you imagine how that makes God feel? Claim this promise: 'I will lie down and sleep in peace, for You alone, O Lord, make me dwell in safety.' (Psalm 4:8 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The eyes of all look expectantly to You...' Psalm 145:15 NKJV<br /><br /><p>When God introduced Himself to Abraham He went by the name El Shaddai, which means <i>God Almighty, the all-sufficient, the provider of all.</i> And today God is saying to you, 'I will be all you need!' Now you know that God is able, but don't you sometimes wonder if He's willing? Simply having a revelation of God's ability is not enough; you must also believe that He <i>will,</i> in order to put a solid foundation under your faith. </p>
<p>One day a leper came to Jesus saying, 'If you will, you can heal my disease.' Jesus revealed His heart by saying, 'I will.' (Mark 1:40-42 NKJV) Don't allow Satan to convince you that God may or may not take care of you. The Bible says, '...God <i>shall</i> supply all your need...' (Philippians 4:19 NKJV) Notice, the Bible doesn't say, 'God is power,' it says, 'God is love.' It focuses on His willingness to use His power, rather than the power itself. Because God has a heart of love, He will use His power to meet your needs. </p>
<p>God actually gets great pleasure out of meeting your needs. 'The Lord is gracious and full of compassion, slow to anger and great in mercy. The Lord is good to all, and His tender mercies are over all His works...The eyes of all look expectantly to You, and You give them their food in due season. You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living thing.' (Psalm 145:8-9; 15-16 NKJV) God may not answer your prayer in the <i>way</i> you think He should or <i>when</i> you think He should, but if you trust Him He will answer in the way that's <i>best</i> for you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Without faith it is impossible to please Him...' Hebrews 11:6 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says, 'But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.' Do you know what God expects of you? Faith! He wants you to trust His Word, His character and His track record of faithfulness. It is impossible to please Him if you don't.</p>
<p>The difficulty you're dealing with right now may have to do with <i>where</i> you are in your faith walk with God. That doesn't mean if you're going through trouble, you don't have faith. But while it may not be a lack of faith that got you into trouble, it's the strength of your faith that will bring you through it. You say, 'But shouldn't I be rational?' Yes, but don't be so rational that you fail to leave room for the supernatural. Narcissism involves the worship of self, including our own intellect. We say, 'If I don't understand it, I don't believe it.' Then, in essence, you are your own god! You don't really believe in God, you believe in <i>you</i>. What are you going to do when life hands you a problem you can't solve?</p>
<p>Before Christ raised Lazarus from the dead He asked Mary and Martha to take Him back to the grave, the place where they stopped believing, the point at which they gave up because of human limitation. Why? Because only when you reach that point, do you discover that God '...is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that [you] ask or think...' (Ephesians 3:20 NKJV)</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Pray...that...words may be given me...' Ephesians 6:19 NIV<br /><br /><p>Paul wrote to the believers in Ephesus: 'Pray...that whenever I open my mouth, words may be given me...that I will fearlessly make known...the Gospel.' Do you pray for your pastor? You should! After Wilbur Chapman's first sermon at Bethany Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia, a man said, 'You're pretty young to be pastor of this great church. We've always had older men. I'm afraid you won't succeed but, since you preach the Gospel, I'm going to help you all I can.' Chapman thought, 'What a crank.' But the man continued, 'I'm going to pray for you, and a few others have covenanted to join me.' Later, Chapman wrote, 'I didn't feel so bad when I learned that they were going to pray for me. Soon the three became fifty, and the fifty became two hundred who met before every service to pray for me. In another room eighteen elders knelt so closely around me that I could put out my hand and touch them. I always went into my pulpit confident that I would have God's anointing in answer to the prayers of those people. It was easy to preach, a real joy. And what was the result? Eleven hundred people were saved and joined the church in the next three years, and six hundred of them were men. It was the fruit of the Holy Spirit in answer to prayer. Church members have much more to do than go to church as curious, idle spectators to be amused and entertained. It is their business to pray mightily that the Holy Spirit will clothe the preacher with power and make his words like dynamite.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Who [with reason] despises the day of small things?...' Zechariah 4:10 AMP<br /><br /><p>Everything big begins with something small, and your attitude in the beginning often determines your success in the end. The Bible says, 'Who [with reason] despises the day of small things?' Delight in what God gives you to start with, because He does! Thank Him for your small beginnings. Before the drought ended and the rains came, Elijah saw a cloud the size of a man's hand (1 Kings 18:44). That's pretty small, but he rejoiced over it because it was a sign of bigger things to come. Don't destroy your seed by doubting its potential. God gives you a seed of hope, something small-but something is better than nothing. Take that seed and plant it, praying over it and believing God for increase. A lot of us throw our seed away. When we 'despise' something we diminish its potential; we take no notice of it, we don't care for it. When we don't take care of what God gives us, we lose it. And if we lose our seed we never get to enjoy our harvest. Hebrews 13:5 AMP tells us to be content with what we have, then goes on to say, 'For He [God] Himself has said, I will not in any way...let [you] down.' That's why you can be content during your small beginnings. You know that what God commences, He completes. So be patient, be expectant, and keep moving forward. 'Do not cast away your confidence, which has great reward. For you have need of endurance, so that after you have done the will of God, you may receive the promise.' (Hebrews 10:35-36 NKJV)</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['[The] One who breaks open the way will go up before [you]...' Micah 2:13 NIV<br /><br /><p>Are you thinking, 'If I don't get a breakthrough, I'm not going to make it?' Try to understand these two things. First, your problem is just an opportunity for God to work on your behalf. You are positioned to experience the truth of these words: '[The] One who breaks open the way will go up before them; they will break through the gate and go out. Their king will pass through before them, the Lord at their head.' By God's grace you can prevail over your circumstances. You can rise above discouragement and the self-defeating mentality that says: 'Nothing's going to change for the better'. You say, 'But I tried and failed!' Fine, mark that off your list and say, 'Now I know what <i>doesn't</i> work.' Rejoice, God knows the way, and He's going before you! Second, before you experience a breakthrough there's usually a shake-up. Chuck Yeager, the World War II hero who broke the sound barrier, fractured his ribs in a horse-riding accident the day before he hopped into the cockpit and attempted to do what had never been done with a plane before. His friends said, 'You're in too much pain. Don't do it.' His fears told him, 'Nobody's ever done it before. You won't either.' At 1100 km/hr the plane began to shake violently. Then suddenly he broke through into what he described as 'a great calm'. That's how it is when you're about to experience a breakthrough. When everything around you starts to shake and your fear level skyrockets, you're not about to crash and burn, you're on the threshold of a breakthrough!</p>

<title><![CDATA[Heart Revelations]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[heart-revelations]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...try me, and know my thoughts.' Psalm 139:23 KJV<br /><br /><p>Our character is not revealed just by our actions, but by our reactions. Actions can be planned, but reactions are spontaneous. They give us a glimpse of what's really in our heart. At that point we can look at it and deal with it. Who among us would readily admit that at times we're greedy, lustful, controlling or insecure? Or resentful of the blessing of God that's evident in the lives of others? When the Psalmist prayed, 'Try me, and know my thoughts', he was inviting God to create the circumstances that would bring to the surface in him all the 'junk' at the bottom of the lake of his subconscious, hidden from view-not only from the eyes of other people but also from his own eyes. Paul writes to the believers in Galatia and says, 'My dear children! I feel as if I'm going through labour pains for you...and they will continue until Christ is fully developed in your lives.' (Galatians 4:19 NLT) Note the words 'until Christ is fully developed in your lives'. That calls for a re-sensitised conscience and a redirected will. During the reign of Oliver Cromwell the English government ran low on the silver it needed to make coins. So Cromwell sent his men into the cathedrals to search for some. They reported back that the only silver they could find was in the statues of the saints standing in the corners. 'Good,' Cromwell reportedly said, 'let's melt down the saints and put them into circulation.' That's what we need, isn't it? To be melted by God, filled with His Spirit, and put into circulation.</p>

<alias><![CDATA[ask-god-to-give-you-a-dream]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Your old men shall dream dreams...' Joel 2:28 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says, 'Your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions.' When God gives you a dream, He gives you the resources and relationships needed to fulfil it. Not everybody will believe in your dream. Paul writes, 'What if some did not believe? Will their unbelief make the faithfulness of God without effect? Certainly not! Indeed, let God be true but every man a liar...' (Romans 3:3-4 NKJV) If your dream is from God, disregard the naysayers and give yourself fully to it. Just be sure your dream is from God. It can't be born out of somebody else's wishes. Sometimes your dream is actually somebody else's desire for you. Parents do this. They want to relive some part of their life through you, so they push you to do something they themselves always wanted to do. That sets you up for a lifetime of trying to please your father and mother, to get their approval even though you're now an adult. Then one day you wake up and realise you're trying to live somebody else's dream. It may actually have been God's plan for your mother or father, but now you're stuck with it. Get unstuck! Ask God for your own dream! Your dream can't be born out of wrong motives such as pride, jealousy, anger, rejection or competitiveness. Are you trying to prove something to somebody? Are you trying to win their admiration and respect? Are you trying to make up for being rejected? Acknowledge your motives, ask God to heal your heart, then ask Him for a dream that He will back up!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Cast out the bondwoman and her son...' Galatians 4:30 KJV<br /><br /><p>Ishmael was born as a result of Abraham attempting to hurry up the plan of God and fulfil it through human effort. Are you doing that? We all have our 'Ishmaels': a good idea that was not God's idea, and it can complicate your life. You say, 'But didn't God love Ishmael too?' Yes, and He blessed him (Genesis 17:20). But God said He would only fulfil His plan through Isaac. When you run ahead of God, or try to replace His will with your will not only do you suffer, but the people you love suffer too. Spiritually speaking, when God says to you, 'Cast out the bondwoman and her son', He's saying, 'It's time to deal with your past and clean out your cupboard.' But notice something else in this story.</p>
<p>Like Isaac and Ishmael, sometimes your miracle and your mistake can grow together under the same roof. Things can be so bad in one area, yet so good in another. Today God may be saying to you, 'Because of the destiny I have in mind for you, you've got to put this thing out of your life.' It's painful letting go of something your flesh creates, but you have no choice. Here are your options. You can be moved by their pleading and miss God's best. Or you can say, 'As much as I love you, I love God more.' When you're willing to walk away from something you love because you love God more, that's called the sacrifice of praise (Hebrews 13:15). And when you offer it up to God, you position yourself to receive the fullness of His blessing in your life.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...[God] wrestled...with him until...' Genesis 32:24 KJV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says, 'Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man [the angel of the Lord]...until the breaking of the day.' When God decides to deal with you He will get you alone. Notice, Jacob was 'left'. When surgery is required, only the patient is allowed in the operating room. Something in you must be dealt with or you won't make it. Notice also, 'There wrestled a man with him <i>until</i>'. Others may give up on you, but not God. 'He who has begun a good work in you will complete it <i>until</i> the day of Jesus Christ.' (Philippians 1:6 NKJV) 'Until' Jacob becomes Israel, 'until' you begin to walk, talk and live in such a way that everybody around you knows you've been touched by God. God's not going to let you get by with stuff He used to overlook. When you're running out of time He will wrestle with you and show you that you're wasting your life. He will wrestle with you over your careless attitudes, words and actions. He will wrestle with you over your ingratitude and help you see how blessed you are. He will wrestle with you over your double-mindedness and unwillingness to make a commitment. You've changed jobs, changed relationships and changed churches; <i>when</i> are you going to let God plant you permanently somewhere so that you can bear fruit? There are two 'untils' in this story. First, God wrestled with Jacob until he said yes. Second, Jacob wrestled with God until He blessed him. At that point Jacob's name changed, his past ended, and the future God had in mind for him began.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Do not despise these small beginnings, for the Lord rejoices to see the work begin...' Zechariah 4:10 NLT<br /><br /><p>Have you heard about the butterfly effect? In physics, it describes how tiny changes in initial conditions (such as the flap of a butterfly's wings) can affect weather thousands of kilometres away. Imagine-a fragile butterfly can alter weather patterns on another continent! Had it not flapped its wings, the trajectory of the weather system might have been vastly different. What can you learn from this? You may feel insignificant at times, as fragile as the butterfly. It may seem like you're just flapping your wings when you are standing alone for truth and honesty in the workplace or the home. You say, 'What can I do in the face of a problem this big?' More than you think! Your faith, your words, your deeds, your prayers, your example, your kindness and persistence can release the power of God and activate the forces of Heaven to go to work in that situation. God loves to use things that we consider to be insignificant, like Moses' rod which parted the Red Sea, or David's slingshot that brought down a giant, or a boy's lunch that fed a multitude. Your flapping wings can initiate changes that will influence lives around you for all eternity. Jesus said, 'If you have faith as a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, &quot;Move from here to there,&quot; and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you.' (Matthew 17:20 NKJV) It's not about the size of the seed you sow, but about the God Who can make it grow. It's not about the prayer you pray but about the greatness of One Who answers prayer.</p>

<alias><![CDATA[whats-your-excuse]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['But they all...began to make excuses...' Luke 14:18 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Let's look at some of the excuses we offer for not pursuing the dream God has given us. <i>First</i>-'<i>Dreams don</i><i>'</i><i>t come true for ordinary people like me.</i><i>'</i> The Wright brothers wanted to fly. Winston Churchill envisioned a free Europe. Dr Martin Luther King Jr. dreamed of racial equality. But you don't have to be a world figure to have a dream. No, the pursuit of a dream is what makes the difference between ordinary and extraordinary people. Ordinary people live extraordinary lives when they follow their dream. Why do we say that? Because a God-given dream will motivate you to make important changes in your life. You won't just change who you are in order to live out your dream; you pursue your dream, and the process changes who you are and what you can accomplish. In other words, your dream is both your goal and your change-agent. <i>Secondly</i><i>-</i><i>'</i><i>If the dream isn</i><i>'</i><i>t big it</i><i>'</i><i>s not worth pursuing.</i><i>'</i> Size doesn't determine significance. Your dream doesn't have to be big; it just has to be bigger than you. Mother Teresa said, 'We can't all do great things, but we can all do small things with great love.' <i>Thirdly</i><i>-'</i><i>Now is not the right time to pursue my dream.</i><i>'</i> Permission to pursue your dream comes from two sources: God and yourself. Novelist George Eliot said, 'It's never too late to become what you might have been.' The timing will never be perfect for you to pursue your dream so you might as well start now. If you don't, next year you'll be one year older and not a step closer to it.</p>

<title><![CDATA[How to Become 'Righteous']]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[how-to-become-righteous]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['With the heart one believes unto righteousness...' Romans 10:10 NKJV<br /><br /><p>To be 'saved' you must put your trust in Christ, and nothing else. You say, 'But what if I clean up my act?' No, there are people who live better by accident than you do on purpose. Our distinction as Christians is that we have placed our trust in the shed blood of Jesus Christ, and nothing else. Paul lays it clearly on the line: 'If you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.' (Romans 10:9-10 NKJV) Salvation is the result of what you believe in your heart about the finished work of Christ, and what you confess with your lips. Those two elements, believing and confessing, bring you into a state of 'righteousness' in the eyes of God.</p>
<p>Have you ever gone to a grocery store with a coupon cut out from a newspaper? You want a bag of flour or sugar, but you've no money. Yet they give it to you. Why? Because with the coupon, they give you credit as though you had the money. Getting the idea? You have no righteousness to bring before God in exchange for salvation, but He has set up a coupon system called redemption and said, 'Once you place your trust in Christ, I will view you as righteous from that moment on.' The word 'righteous' simply means 'to be in right standing with God.' What a way to live! What a well of joy! What a source of confidence!</p>

<alias><![CDATA[lessons-from-lazarus-1]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany...' John 11:1 NKJV<br /><br /><p>From the story of Jesus raising Lazarus from the dead, we learn certain lessons. <i>The first lesson is about reason.</i> You cannot have radical faith until you've exhausted all reasonable solutions. Mary and Martha didn't send for Jesus until they'd done everything they themselves could do for Lazarus. Be reasonable; if you can do it for yourself, God won't do it for you. For example, unless you are willing to change your diet and start eating right, how can you go to God with confidence for healing? Unless you are willing to put the needs of your spouse above your own, what's the point in praying for a happy marriage? James writes: '...Show me your faith without your works, and I will show you my faith by my works.' (James 2:18 NKJV) <i>The second lesson is about relationship.</i> Some people only turn to God when they have a crisis. Prayer is a foreign concept to them until they have a car crash or their marriage falls apart or they lose their job. Then, incredibly, they say, 'God, why did You let this happen?' It's hard to go to someone when you're in trouble, if you've spent no time building a relationship with them. Jesus often spent time at the home of Mary and Martha, eating at their table. They were givers, not takers. 'It was that Mary who anointed the Lord with fragrant oil and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.' (John 11:2 NKJV) When you love the Lord to that extent, you can go to Him in faith knowing your needs will be met.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany...' John 11:1 NKJV<br /><br /><p><i>The</i><i> third lesson is about relinquishment.</i> As long as you believe you can handle the problem on your own, you will not reach for the miracle-working power of God. You have to be in a situation so bad that you pray the prayer of relinquishment: 'Lord, I've done all I know and things aren't getting any better. So I'm through trying to fix it. I turn it completely over to You. I don't know how You're going to handle it, but I know You love me and want only what's best for me. So here it is, Lord; it's all Yours.' This is not a prayer of defeat, it is one of total trust. David wrote: 'Though I am surrounded by troubles...the Lord will work out His plans for my life-for Your faithful love, O Lord, endures forever...' (Psalm 138:7-8 NLT)</p>
<p>The pastor of a great church tells of running out of money when they were only halfway through the construction of their new building. The congregation was growing and there was no doubt that they needed the extra space. But the bank wouldn't give them any more funds. So the pastor prayed and said, 'Lord, personally speaking, I don't need this big building. I already have a place for all my children. You need a place for Yours. I don't know how You're going to take care of this, but those are Your kids, Lord, so I'm turning it over to You.' God answered, the money came through, and within a few years they were worshipping in a beautiful building, debt free. So give your problem to God and don't take it back!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany...' John 11:1 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Before leaving the story of Jesus raising Lazarus from the dead, here are two more lessons: <i>The fourth lesson is about radical faith.</i> When somebody is dead and buried, that's as 'final' as it gets. To believe God in the face of such a situation requires radical faith. Until this moment Martha had 'if only' faith. 'Lord, if [only] You had been here, my brother would not have died.' (John 11:21 NKJV) But then she began to realise what Jesus could do, and moved to 'even now' faith. She said to Jesus, 'But even now I know that whatever You ask of God, God will give You.' (v22 NKJV) Radical faith says, 'Lord, I believe that my future can be greater than my past, that You can turn the situation around and snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, that nothing is too hard for You.' Radical faith in the face of radical circumstances brings radical results. <i>The fifth lesson is about restoration.</i> 'Therefore the sisters sent to [Jesus], saying, &quot;Lord...he whom You love is sick&quot; ...Then...He said to the disciples, &quot;Let us go to Judea.&quot;' (vv3 &amp; 7 NKJV) You'll never know what the Lord can do until you invite Him into your situation. He can give you back what you have loved and lost. He can restore what life has taken from you and more! It's not too late. Send for Jesus. No matter how bad your situation may be, pray, 'Lord, even now I know that whatever You ask of God, God will give You.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...There is wonderful joy ahead, even though you have to endure...trials...' 1 Peter 1:6 NLT<br /><br /><p>In the 1950s Mary Kay Ash was the first woman to sit on the board of directors at the World Gift Company. But it wasn't all smooth sailing! Although she'd earned a place in the corporate world, her associates refused to take her seriously and accused her of 'thinking like a woman'. Frustrated, she retired in 1963 to write a book designed to help women in business. Sitting at her kitchen table, she listed all the positives about the companies where she'd worked, as well as the things that could be improved. In doing so she created a marketing plan for her ideal company. Her accountant and her attorney discouraged her but with her husband's support she created a new cosmetic line and recruited and trained an all-female sales force. Her motto was, 'God first, family second, career third.' When her husband died unexpectedly, she stayed on track and launched her new company. From a storefront in Dallas USA and a $5000 investment, Mary Kay Cosmetics earned $200000 the first year, quadrupled it the next and, when it went public in1968, sales were over $10 million. Mary Kay wrote three best sellers, her business model is taught at Harvard, <i>Fortune Magazine</i> named her company one of the Ten Best Companies for Women, as well as one of the 100 Best Companies to Work for in America. When she died in 2001 she had 800000 independent beauty consultants in 37 countries with annual sales over $2 billion. Never underestimate someone with vision and determination! When you face adversity don't give up. 'There is wonderful joy ahead.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I will give them an undivided heart...' Ezekiel 11:19 NIV<br /><br /><p>Successful people allow their God-given passion and talent to guide them in life. They have a single focus and an undivided heart. God doesn't create you to be talented in an area, then ask you to give yourself to some unrelated area. There's always a potential alignment of talent and passion, if you have the courage to pursue your life's purpose and take risks. Po Bronson, author of <i>W</i><i>hat Should I Do With My Life?</i> writes, 'I'm convinced that business success in the future starts with the question, &quot;What should I do with my life?&quot; Yes, that's right...people don't succeed by migrating to a &quot;hot&quot; industry or by adopting a particular career-guiding [motto]. They thrive by focusing on the question of who they really are and connecting to work they truly love (and, in so doing, unleashing a productive and creative power they never imagined).' Carly Fiorina said, 'Love what you do, or don't do it...Make the choice to do something because it engages your heart as well as your mind. Make the choice because it engages all of you.'</p>
<p>Don't unwittingly become a slave to someone else's dream because once you own a dream that dream can also own you. Being a slave to someone else's dream could quickly become a nightmare. Paul writes: '...But they are only comparing themselves with each other...How ignorant...We will boast only about what has happened within the boundaries of the work God has given us...' (2 Corinthians 10:12-13 NLT) If you are confused, out of focus or going in circles, pray, 'Lord, give me a clear vision and an undivided heart.' That's a prayer God will answer.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...first the blade, then the head, after that the full grain...' Mark 4:28 NKJV<br /><br /><p>If you're waiting for a promise God has given you to be fulfilled, observe the words of Jesus: 'The Kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed on the ground, and should sleep by night and rise by day, and the seed should sprout and grow, he himself does not know how. For the earth yields crops by itself: first the blade, then the head, after that the full grain in the head. But when the grain ripens, immediately he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.' (Mark 4:26-29 NKJV) Before you receive what God has promised, you often go through certain stages. Let's look at them:</p>
<p>First there's the 'I don't know' stage. Your seed is in the ground; when it will produce a harvest is entirely up to God. But His Word assures you it will. Next comes 'the blade' stage. It's just a tiny blade blowing in the breeze but it's enough to encourage you and let you know that the answer is on the way. Next comes 'the head' stage. Now it's starting to look like what you prayed for. Hopefully you've been watering it with prayer, fertilising it with God's Word and protecting it from any negative force that would try to uproot it. Finally you enter 'the full grain' stage. This is when God says: 'Put in the sickle, because your harvest has come.' At this point it's crucial to recognise your harvest and begin to reap it. Whatever stage you're at today, stand on God's promise and keep trusting Him. He will not disappoint you.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...all forsook me... But the Lord stood with me...' 2 Timothy 4:16-17 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Read these words slowly and carefully: 'Until I am committed there is a hesitancy, a chance to draw back. But the moment I definitely commit myself, then God moves also and a whole stream of events begin. All manner of unforeseen incidents, meetings, people, and material assistance of which I never dreamed, begin to move towards me.' So commit yourself! When others refuse to go with you, commitment means going on alone. Daniel dined and prayed alone. Elijah sacrificed and witnessed alone. Jeremiah prophesied and wept alone. Paul said, 'No one stood with me, but all forsook me... But the Lord stood with me and strengthened me... and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.' It's at the point of commitment, and not before, that God intervenes on our behalf. When the three Hebrew children made a commitment not to bow to the king's idols, God brought them out of the fiery furnace without even the smell of smoke. Indeed, King Nebuchadnezzar was so impressed that he said, '...there is no other god who is able to deliver in this way.' (Daniel 3:29 NAS) What do you believe God has called you to do with your life? Obey Him. Step out in faith and do it. If you're afraid, read these words: 'I'd rather be ashes than dust. I'd rather my spark burn out than that it should be stifled by dry rot. The proper function of my life is to live, not exist. So I shall not waste my days in trying to prolong them. I shall use every moment.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The just shall live by faith.' Romans 1:17 KJV<br /><br /><p>God wants you to move from a survival mentality to a position of ruling and reigning; from just getting by, to really believing Him 'to do exceedingly abundantly above all that [you] ask or think...' (Ephesians 3:20 NKJV) You're not told to <i>cope</i> with the devil, you're told to <i>resist</i> him and he will flee from you (James 4:7). The Greek word for <i>flee</i> means 'to run in terror'. Picture yourself waking up in the morning and the devil saying, 'Help, they're up again!' Paul writes, '[Don't] give place to the devil.' (Ephesians 4:27 NKJV) Satan has no place in your life unless you give it to him! His goal is to separate you from your faith, because faith is what pleases God (Hebrews 11:6). Faith makes you an overcomer (1 John 5:4). Faith brings answers to your prayers. '...when you pray, believe that you receive...and you will have them.' (Mark 11:24 NKJV) If you really believe that, you'll act on it. The Bible says, 'Fight the good fight of faith...' (1 Timothy 6:12), so there must be enemies of our faith. And one of faith's biggest enemies is your ignorance of God's Word. 'My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. Because you have rejected knowledge, I will also reject you...' (Hosea 4:6 NKJV) Medical science teaches that you can be exposed to a disease and not get it because you've been inoculated against it. Likewise, religiosity can inoculate you against real faith. Negative people can do that too. You say, 'How can I strengthen my faith?' The Bible says, 'Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.' (Romans 10:17 NKJV) So live in God's Word.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['We are labourers together with God...' 1 Corinthians 3:9 KJV<br /><br /><p>Did you hear the story about the little boy who was selling ten-cent pencils door-to-door to raise the money to build a $30 million hospital in his community? One woman said to him, 'Son, that's a mighty big goal for just one little boy selling pencils for 10 cents.' With a big smile he replied, 'Oh, I'm not doing it alone. See that boy across the street? He's my partner; we're doing it together.' Now if he had that kind of faith in a partner who was only his equal, shouldn't you have confidence in a God whose power is unequalled, and whose partnership guarantees success? The Bible says, 'We are labourers together with God.' When you truly believe those words you'll begin to live like a 'no limit' person.</p>
<p>When Robert Morrison sailed as a missionary to China, the ship's captain constantly criticised him and gave him a rough time. As Morrison left the ship, the captain said to him, 'I suppose you think you're going to make an impression on China?' Morrison replied, 'No, but I believe God will!' There it is; when you're in partnership with God your potential is unlimited. Here's a prayer for you: 'Disturb me, Lord, when my dreams come true only because I dreamed too small. Disturb me, when I arrive safely only because I sailed too close to the shore. Disturb me, when the things I've gained cause me to lose my thirst for more of You.

<introtext><![CDATA['Casting all your care upon Him, for He cares for you.' 1 Peter 5:7 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Jesus said, 'Do not worry, saying, &quot;What shall we eat?&quot; or &quot;What shall we drink?&quot; or &quot;What shall we wear?&quot; For [non-believers] run after all these things...' (Matthew 6:31-32 NIV) One author writes: 'The other day I was worrying about something when I heard a minister say, &quot;Worry is a lack of trust in God.&quot; So then I began to worry over the fact that I was worrying. Then someone else said, &quot;Just don't worry about it.&quot; Sounds simple enough, but I come from a line of people who speak faith, but act out of fear. Then a friend came up with this novel idea: &quot;Why don't you try this worry coupon. It entitles you to worry as much as you like, but only if: (a) it will feed and clothe you; (b) it will add to your life instead of taking from it; (c) it will make tomorrow better; (d) you don't mind acting like a non-believer!&quot; Then he said, &quot;If that doesn't work make a list of all the things you're worrying about, place it in a box and put it up on a shelf where you can't see it. If God is either unwilling or unable to take care of it, you can always go get the box and start worrying again but at least give Him a chance. And while you are waiting for Him to answer, pray, stand on His Word and don't give your worries a voice.&quot;' The Amplified Bible says: 'Casting the whole of your care [all your anxieties, all your worries, all your concerns, once and for all] on Him, for He cares for you.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...each part...helps the other parts grow...' Ephesians 4:16 NLT<br /><br /><p>None of us enjoys confronting others, but sometimes it must be done. So be honest and direct. Tenderness is not a matter of being diplomatic or tactful, or using euphemistic language, or 'beating around the bush' and softening the blow. Don't do that.

But a word of caution here: don't use words such as 'love' and 'transparency' to disguise a judgmental attitude. People get screamed at, chewed out and verbally abused in the name of love.

It is far more Christ-like to confront another person through tears than with a voice raised in anger. At all points, the listener should never be in doubt as to your love and acceptance. Genuine love says, 'I've got something to tell you. I know this won't be easy for either of us, but I respect you enough to give it to you straight.

<introtext><![CDATA['...each part...helps the other parts grow...' Ephesians 4:16 NLT<br /><br /><p>When you confront somebody, be specific, and don't generalise. For example, don't say, 'You're always abrupt and unfriendly.' Instead, being specific, say, 'I feel you were rather abrupt with Mrs Jones yesterday.' Generalisations sound and feel like an attack on who the person is, instead of constructive reproof on what the person does. Plus, the vagueness of such generalisations doesn't give the learner a clue what he or she should do to grow and change. Remember to show empathy. An effective mentor always tries to put themselves in the learner's place. Novelist John Erskine observed, 'We have not really budged a step...until we've taken up residence in someone else's point of view.' Assure them that you're their advocate, not their adversary, and that your only desire is to see them succeed. Why do people have such a hard time accepting and processing criticism? Because they get caught up in a shame spiral, going all the way back to their childhood. They never felt valued, they felt like they were always being criticised and told how useless and stupid they were, and now they instinctively give too much power to criticism. Only when you understand that will you be able to approach them the right way. Build on their strengths, gifts and character through encouragement. Earn the right to confront. Make sure you affirm 97 per cent of the time, so that when it's time to be tough in the remaining 3 per cent, your love and encouragement will be credible. How will a person know you're on his or her side if the only evaluation you ever pass on is a negative one?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...each part...helps the other parts grow...' Ephesians 4:16 NLT<br /><br /><p>A good mentor will affirm in public, and correct in private. Your goal should be to help, not hurt. When you rebuke someone in public you humiliate them, destroying their self-esteem. But when you affirm them in public you build their self-esteem, confidence and incentive. Of course, your praise should be genuine, not just empty words. By affirming sincerely and publicly, you plant the seeds of growth and greatness in the learner. A good mentor will also build an allegiance to relationships, not issues. We tend to build an allegiance either to relationships, or to issues. We become primarily concerned about other people, their feelings, and the relationship, or we become focused on rules, agendas, quotas, tasks and results. A good mentor always puts relationships ahead of issues. In his book <i>Mentoring: The Strategy of the Master</i>, Ron Lee Davis writes, 'My father was that kind of mentor, both in his own family and in the church he pastored for twenty-five years. Many times I heard him say, The individual is always more important than the issue.' He lived this principle daily and he built it into my life. Today, I try to pass on this principle to others.' God has called each of us to run our race and finish it successfully. He has also called us to keep the torch lit and hand it over to the next runner. Don't merely be satisfied with doing the job, make sure the job keeps getting done by teaching and training someone else. Jesus, the Master-mentor, said, '...the works that I do [you] will do also; and greater works than these will [you] do...' (John 14:12 NKJV)</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['I don't mean to say that I have already achieved...perfection!' Philippians 3:12 NLT<br /><br /><p>If you let it, perfectionism will rob you of peace, plus the joy of whatever you've accomplished so far. The sportswear manufacturer Fila took out a full-page ad in a newspaper to honour its NBA All-Star spokesman, Grant Hill, and, at the same time, take a swipe at the pressure young people feel today to be perfect. The ad pictures Hill surrounded by this text: 'This year Grant Hill led his team in scoring, rebounding, assists and steals, led his team back into the playoffs, led the league in All-Star balloting, earned a place on the Olympic team, didn't punch an official, didn't demand a contract extension, was never tardy, was always cordial, didn't dump his high school friends, listened to his mother, remembered the doorman at Christmas, made his bed daily, promised to take shorter showers in an effort to conserve water, got plenty of sleep, didn't hurt a fly, organised his thoughts, chose paper over plastic, appeared fully clothed in interviews, improved his vocabulary, counted his blessings, said nice things about his teammates, fed coins into other people's parking meters, kept his thermostat at [20 degrees], practised what he preached, actually paid attention to the stewardess's emergency flight instructions, donated a kidney-and vowed to do better next year.' Now, let's get serious. There will <i>always</i> be areas of your life that need improvement; you will never 'arrive'. But that doesn't mean you can't stop and savour the moment, or celebrate the distance already covered and say to yourself, 'I'm not all that I should be, but I'm better than I used to be. I'm all right, and I'm on my way.'</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'And He...said, &quot;Behold, I make all things new...&quot;' Revelation 21:5 KJV<br />Observe: (1) Change means accepting risk. Your anxiety will kick in and say, 'What if I don't get the job? What if the economy fails? What if I make the effort to change but they don't?' We like ironclad guarantees. The predictable feels less threatening than sticking our necks out. But the price of our security often means remaining stuck with the status quo. Sometimes your greatest risk is taking no risk at all! God often requires you to leave the path that feels and looks safe, for the one that feels and looks risky. 'Now faith is the assurance (the confirmation, the title deed) of the things [we] hope for...the proof of things [we] do not see...' (Hebrews 11:1 AMP) Your faith is foolproof assurance, God's confirmation, the title deed guaranteeing that the change you want will take place if you act on it. (2) Change will happen if failure is not allowed to stop you. Fear of failing often stops us from trying, yet many of God's best people experienced failure on their way to success. Consider Abraham, Moses, Elijah, David etc. All of them succeeded only after dealing with personal failure. Indeed, the richest, most profound change often happens after we've tasted failure. Until then we tend to be cocky and of not much use to God. Peter failed the Lord miserably, and at the most crucial moment. (Matthew 26:72) But he grew, becoming Christ's choice to lead His newly empowered church on the Day of Pentecost, winning three thousand souls. (Acts 2) Don't let failure stop you!</p>

<p>Observe: <em>(1) Change means accepting risk.</em> Your anxiety will kick in   and say, 'What if I don't get the job? What if the economy fails? What if I   make the effort to change but they don't?' We like ironclad guarantees. The   predictable feels less threatening than sticking our necks out. But the price   of our security often means remaining stuck with the status quo. Sometimes   your greatest risk is taking no risk at all! God often requires you to leave   the path that feels and looks safe, for the one that feels and looks risky.   'Now faith is the assurance (the confirmation, the title deed) of the things   [we] hope for...the proof of things [we] do not see...' (Hebrews 11:1 AMP)   Your faith is foolproof assurance, God's confirmation, the title deed   guaranteeing that the change you want will take place if you act on it. <em>(2)   Change will happen if failure is not allowed to stop you.</em> Fear of failing   often stops us from trying, yet many of God's best people experienced failure   on their way to success. Consider Abraham, Moses, Elijah, David etc. All of   them succeeded only after dealing with personal failure. Indeed, the richest,   most profound change often happens after we've tasted failure. Until then we   tend to be cocky and of not much use to God. Peter failed the Lord miserably,   and at the most crucial moment. (Matthew 26:72) But he grew, becoming   Christ's choice to lead His newly empowered church on the Day of Pentecost,   winning three thousand souls. (Acts 2) Don't let failure stop you!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I will guard my ways that I may not sin with my tongue...' Psalm 39:1 NAS<br /><br /><p>We all fail from time to time, even the best of us. When John D Rockefeller ran the Standard Oil Company one of his senior executives made a mistake that cost over $2 million. The other executives thought Rockefeller would come down heavy on him and probably fire him. But he didn't. Before he called the man in, he sat down, took a notepad and wrote across the top of it: 'Points in favour of this man'. Then he listed the man's strengths, including how he'd once helped the company make the right decision and earn them millions of dollars. One of the senior executives who witnessed it later said, 'Whenever I am tempted to rip into someone, I force myself to sit down and compile a list of the good qualities they have. By the time I have finished, I have the right perspective. And best of all, my anger is under control. I can't tell you how many times this habit has prevented me from committing one of life's costliest mistakes-losing my temper. I recommend it to anyone who must deal with people.' So before you jump to conclusions about someone, stop and ask God for wisdom, then sit down and make a list of their best qualities. If you do you'll often come to a different conclusion. One thing is for sure, you'll approach them with the right attitude and you won't say things you'll later regret. Obviously the Psalmist had learned that lesson: 'I will guard my ways that I may not sin with my tongue.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...everyone's work will be put through the fire...' 1 Corinthians 3:13 TLB<br /><br /><p>One day an ox said to a mule, 'Let's pretend to be sick.' The mule said, 'No, we need to get this work done.' The ox feigned illness, and the farmer brought him fresh hay. When the mule came in from ploughing, the ox asked how things went and the mule said, 'All right.' The ox asked, 'What did the farmer say about me?' The mule replied, 'Nothing.' The next day the ox pretended to be ill again. When the mule came home the ox asked, 'How did it go?' The mule said, 'All right.' After a week of this, the ox asked, 'Did the farmer say anything about me today?' The mule replied, 'Well, he said nothing to me personally, but he stopped and had a long talk with the butcher!' Understand this: you were born to fulfil a divine purpose. When you don't, there are consequences, both here and in eternity. Paul focused on his calling. Shortly before he was executed he wrote, 'I have finished the race...' (2 Timothy 4:7 NIV) Notice, Paul didn't retire, he 'finished'! In the parable of the talents, the man who buried his talent paid a high price. That's because in God's eyes the greatest failure of all is failure to invest the time, talent and treasure He's given you into His purposes. One day your life will be audited. It's called 'the judgment seat of Christ'. Paul writes, everyone's work will be put through the fire to see whether or not it keeps its value. If the work survives the fire, the builder will receive a reward. But if the work is burned up, the builder will suffer great loss (1 Corinthians 3:13-15).</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['While I was busy doing something else...' 1 Kings 20:40 NLT<br /><br /><p>This is what Scripture says about being <i>busy</i>. 'While I was busy doing something else, the prisoner disappeared!' In this story, God judges someone for forgetting what's important and taking their eye off the ball. In 1992, <i>Fortune</i> magazine featured 'The biggest business goofs of 1991'. In an act of corporate cooperation, AT&amp;T reached an agreement with Con Edison, the power company in New York City. The contract stated that whenever power demands exceeded the utilities' grid, AT&amp;T would lessen their demands on the electric utility by throwing a switch, unplugging some of its facilities and drawing power from internal generators at its 33 Thomas Street station in Lower Manhattan. On September 17, AT&amp;T acted in accordance with its agreement. But when AT&amp;T's own generators kicked in, the power surge kicked out some of their vital rectifiers which handled 4.5 million domestic calls, 470000 international calls, 1174 flights across the nation carrying 85000 passengers and the total communications systems linking air traffic controllers at La Guardia, Kennedy and Newark airports. It was a giant mess! The alarm bells at the 33 Thomas Street station rang unheeded for six hours. Why? Because the AT&amp;T personnel in charge of the rectifiers were away-attending a one-day seminar on how to handle emergencies! The Bible says, 'Stay alert! Watch out for your great enemy, the devil. He prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour.' (1 Peter 5:8 NLT) If Satan can't 'devour' you with a frontal assault, he'll settle for diverting you with things that ultimately don't matter. So, don't get diverted.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...you will lift up your face without shame...' Job 11:15 NIV <br /><br /><p>Many of the world's most successful people were at one time considered to be failures. A banker in Iowa laughed and told Alexander Graham Bell to remove that 'toy' from his office. The toy he referred to was the telephone. Talk about missing an investment opportunity! A movie producer once scrawled 'reject' on the screenplay of <i>Gone with the Wind.</i> In 1906, the man who was Henry Ford's greatest investor asked that his stock be sold because he didn't believe the company would go anywhere. Imagine living with that memory! Mr Roebuck sold his part of the Sears and Roebuck Company for $25 000 because he said it would 'never fly'. But it did, and in its heyday it was selling $4000 worth of goods every second. Understand this: you have everything every winner in history had-plus God. The God of the Red Sea, the lion's den and the walls of Jericho is your God! So get your eyes out of the rear-view mirror and start looking ahead. Celebrate the fact that you survived. The devil may have tried to destroy you, but the good news is that he failed. In spite of all you've been through you're a walking, talking, living, breathing miracle of God's grace. He must have kept you around for a reason, so find out what it is and pour your life into it. You say, 'I've got more troubles than Job.' Maybe, but Job trusted God and came out on top! His book reads, 'If you devote your heart to [God]...you will lift up your face without shame; you will stand firm and without fear.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['His divine power has given us everything we need...' 2 Peter 1:3 NIV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says, 'His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness... For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge; and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness; and to godliness, brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness, love. For if you possess these qualities...they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive...' (2 Peter 1:3-8 NIV) Here are ten Scriptural principles to help you live, as God intended: (1) Guard your tongue. Always say less than you think and others will respect you. (2) Make promises sparingly, keep them faithfully, and people will trust you. (3) Never let an opportunity pass to say a kind word, and some day you will look back with joy and not regret. (4) Be genuinely interested in others; show it by listening attentively and expressing your appreciation. (5) Be cheerful. Don't dwell on your aches and pains; everybody has trouble. There are people in the nearest hospital who would gladly swap places with you. (6) Keep an open mind and try to get all the facts. Discuss, but don't argue. Learn to disagree without being disagreeable. Give other people the benefit of the doubt. (7) Discourage gossip; it's destructive. (8) Be sensitive to the feelings of others. If you do, people will consider you to be wise. (9) Pay no attention to ill-natured remarks about you. Live so that nobody will believe them. (10) Don't worry about getting the credit, just keep giving your best and be patient. God records and God rewards!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['..Let us cross over to the other side.' Mark 4:35 NKJV<br /><br /><p>One day Jesus said to His disciples, 'Let us cross over to the other side... And a great windstorm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that it was already filling.' (Mark 4:35-37 NKJV) The devil doesn't want you to get through this storm and reach the other side. He doesn't mind you going to church, singing in the choir or serving on the board; he just doesn't want you to reach your God-ordained destiny. But what's waiting for you on the other side is worth everything you're going through at the moment. You are up against a formidable opponent who knows God has a plan for your life. But he cannot sink the man or woman who has Jesus on board with them, who prays and stays close to Him. So today make a commitment to stand in God's strength regardless of what you're facing or how hard you've been hit. Spiritual progress doesn't come easy. Paul writes, 'When I was a child...I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things.' (1 Corinthians 13:11 NKJV) It's time to stop thinking like a child and grow up! If you don't, you won't experience what God has in store for you. What do you need to take a fresh look at today? Your schedule, to make room for God? Your friends, because they're taking you in the wrong direction? Your habits, because they're draining and defeating you? Your words, because you're speaking doubt instead of faith? Turn to God; He'll bring you through this storm and get you to the other side.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...when you are tempted...[there's]...a way out...' 1 Corinthians 10:13 NIV<br /><br /><p>Often we make excuses for our weaknesses, or blame others. The poet wrote, 'An enemy I strove to know, he dogged my steps where'er I'd go. My plans he baulked and blocked my way, to lofty goals he answered Nay! Till I from him the veil did draw, I looked and lo-myself I saw.' When John Wesley's students met each week they would ask each other these four questions: (1) What sins have you committed since we last met? (2) What temptations have you faced? (3) How were you delivered? (4) What have you thought, said or done, of which you are uncertain whether it is sin or not? Those four questions will keep you spiritually alert, and on track. Paul writes, 'When you are tempted, [God] will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it.' In her essay <i>A Way Out</i>, Portia Nelson writes, 'I walk down the street. There's a hole in the pavement and I fall in. I'm lost; it isn't my fault. It takes me forever to get out. I walk down the street again. There's a hole in the pavement but I pretend I don't see it, so I fall in again. I can't believe I'm in the same place; still, it isn't my fault. I walk down the street again. There's a hole in the pavement. I see it, but I still fall in-it's a habit. But now my eyes are open and I know where I am. It is my fault. I get out immediately. I walk down the street. There's a hole in the pavement. I walk around it. Finally, I walk down a different street!'</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus...' Romans 1:1 NAS<br /><br /><p>When Paul called himself 'a bond-servant' of Christ he was referring to an Old Testament law under which you served your master faithfully for six years. However, in the seventh year the law said that you had to be set free. But if you turned back when you were released and said, 'Master, I'm not serving you because I have to but because I want to,' then your master took you before a judge and pierced your ear, signifying that you belonged to him forever; that you were committed to listening to him and obeying him. (Exodus 21:6) Today pray, 'Lord, I'm not serving You because I have to but because I want to. Pierce my ear, mark me as Yours, bond me together with You so that I can never belong to another.'</p>
<p>When ministry loses its passion it becomes an empty profession. The very word 'minister' is a verb, not just a noun. It's what you <i>do,</i> not what you claim to <i>be</i>. The word 'servant' also referred to a third-level galley slave chained to an oar on a Roman ship. Day and night you rowed to the drumbeat of the ship's master, whether you were in battle or in merchant service. And you expected to die chained to that oar. What a picture! It's what Paul had in mind when he wrote: 'I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.' (Romans 12:1 NKJV) When you think of what Christ has done for you, is it too much to ask?</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['I don't mean to say that I have already achieved...perfection!' Philippians 3:12 NLT<br /><br /><p>If you let it, perfectionism will rob you of peace, plus the joy of whatever you've accomplished so far. The sportswear manufacturer Fila took out a full-page ad in a newspaper to honour its NBA All-Star spokesman, Grant Hill, and, at the same time, take a swipe at the pressure young people feel today to be perfect. The ad pictures Hill surrounded by this text: 'This year Grant Hill led his team in scoring, rebounding, assists and steals, led his team back into the playoffs, led the league in All-Star balloting, earned a place on the Olympic team, didn't punch an official, didn't demand a contract extension, was never tardy, was always cordial, didn't dump his high school friends, listened to his mother, remembered the doorman at Christmas, made his bed daily, promised to take shorter showers in an effort to conserve water, got plenty of sleep, didn't hurt a fly, organised his thoughts, chose paper over plastic, appeared fully clothed in interviews, improved his vocabulary, counted his blessings, said nice things about his teammates, fed coins into other people's parking meters, kept his thermostat at [20 degrees], practised what he preached, actually paid attention to the stewardess's emergency flight instructions, donated a kidney-and vowed to do better next year.' Now, let's get serious. There will <i>always</i> be areas of your life that need improvement; you will never 'arrive'. But that doesn't mean you can't stop and savour the moment, or celebrate the distance already covered and say to yourself, 'I'm not all that I should be, but I'm better than I used to be. I'm all right, and I'm on my way.'</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...I do not seek My own will but the will of the Father who sent Me.' John 5:30 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The relationship Jesus had with His Father is the kind of relationship that He wants you to have with Him. Three things describe that relationship. For the next few days let's look at each of them: First: <i>Intimacy.</i> Jesus said, 'The Father loves the Son and shows Him all He does...' (John 5:20 NIV) You interact with many people throughout the day, but you only share your heart with those you trust, and with whom you have a close relationship. So, how close are you to God right now? Close enough to hear when He speaks to you? Close enough to know when you've said or done something which has grieved Him? Close enough to feel the warmth of His presence? The truth is, you are as close to God right now as you desire to be, decide to be, and discipline yourself to be. Nothing is born unless there is first an act of intimacy between two people, and intimacy is based on one word: 'desire'. How much do you desire God? David said, 'O God, you are my God, earnestly I seek You; my soul thirsts for You...' (Psalm 63:1 NIV) Do you desire His house? 'They feast on the abundance of Your house; You give them drink from Your river of delights.' (Psalm 36:8 NIV) Do you desire His Word? 'I have not departed from the commands of His lips; I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my daily bread.' (Job 23:12 NIV)</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...I do not seek My own will but the will of the Father who sent Me.' John 5:30 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Three things describe Christ's relationship with His Father: intimacy, dependency and obedience. Today let's look at His <i>depe</i><i>ndency</i> on God. 'The Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He sees the Father do; for whatever He does, the Son also does in like manner.' (John 5:19 NKJV) Jesus knew He couldn't do anything without His Father, so He didn't bother to try. We, on the other hand, sing, 'Without Him I can do nothing,' then go out and act like it all depends on us. If we succeed, we often become so conceited that nobody can stand us. And if we fail, it's usually because we collapsed under the weight of an assignment God didn't give us in the first place. Have you ever wondered why Jesus never struggled with insecurity or battled the fear of failure like we do? Because it never even occurred to Him that He couldn't do something which His Father had already assured Him He could do. When you know you have heard from God you can face any obstacle or enemy with confidence. God will never give you an assignment that does not require His wisdom and undergirding strength. Indeed, every act of God in your life is designed to increase, not decrease, your dependence on Him. You say, 'But I have talent. I can do a lot of things!' Yes, but you can do nothing that matters in God's eyes. So before you begin your day, kneel and pray, 'Lord, I'm counting on You, and I don't have a backup plan!'</p>

<alias><![CDATA[hows-your-relationship-with-god-3]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...I do not seek My own will but the will of the Father who sent Me.' John 5:30 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The third thing that describes Christ's relationship with His Father is <i>obedience.</i> Jesus said: 'As I hear, I judge; and My judgment is righteous, because I do not seek My own will but the will of the Father who sent Me.' Jesus neither considered nor consulted His own will in the matter. Instead He focused like a laser on one thing-doing the will of God, no more and no less. Note the words, 'As I hear.' When you have heard from God the discussion is over; it's time to act. God's not going to change His mind, so you need to start changing yours and 'get with the programme.' </p>
<p>When you make Jesus the Lord of your life, you give up three basic rights: (a) What it will cost you; (b) Where it will take you; (c) The extent to which it will change you. In order to enjoy a relationship with Jesus similar to the one which He had with His Father, that's the price tag! You say, 'That sounds very demanding.' Yes, but it's also very protective. When God told His people to do something, He also told them why: '...that it might go well with you...' (Deuteronomy 5:33, 6:3, 12:28) God's not trying to cramp your style, make your life hard or put you in a straitjacket. He's a Father who wants only the best for His children. Isn't that what every good parent wants? So when you walk in obedience, God's best is what you will get.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['If by grace, then it is no longer by works...' Romans 11:6 NIV<br /><br /><p>Paul writes: 'And if by grace, then it is no longer by works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace.' Dr. Gerald Mann tells the fascinating story of how he got his doctorate in Greek. There were only six students in his class. The professor had never given anyone an A. On the first day he held up a Greek textbook and to their amazement he announced, 'I have already written your grades and no matter how much you study or what you score, I have given every one of you an A!' Dr. Mann said, 'Out of six students, five of us learned more Greek in that class than we ever thought possible. The other fellow just got by and never really applied himself.' Understand this: Grace is the power to excel or licence to just get by. Either way, you're accepted and considered righteous in God's eyes the moment you trust in Christ. Why would God arrange it that way? Because the love He gives us is unconditional, and only a response of love can satisfy Him. What an amazing truth; God makes Himself vulnerable to the rejection of people like us! Perhaps you're wondering, 'How can I prove that I truly love God?' That's easy: you'll love your brother and sister. (1 John 4:21) You'll love God's Word. (Psalm 119:97) You'll love spending time in prayer. (Jeremiah 29:12) Grace, rightly understood, doesn't prevent holiness, it produces it. 'The grace of God that brings salvation...teaches us to say &quot;No&quot; to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives...' (Titus 2:11-12 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Lord God called to the man, &quot;Where are you?&quot;' Genesis 3:9 NIV<br /><br /><p>The first recorded question God ever asked was, '[Adam]...Where are you?' And it's a question you need to stop and ask yourself today: 'Where am I-really?' If you don't know the answer, or you do but you don't like it, then today's devotion is for you. When God asked Adam, 'Where are you?' he responded by saying, 'I heard You in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid.' (Genesis 3:10 NIV) It's amazing the lengths we will go to in order to hide. We'll bury ourselves in work or get involved in an affair or build a wall around our hearts-anything but face the truth. God wasn't trying to find Adam; He just wanted Adam to find himself. Until you do that, you're truly lost. And the problem is, when you hide you become a phoney. Have you any idea how much emotional energy it requires to keep up a charade for others? Only two things are worse: being a phoney with yourself and being a phoney with God. Furthermore, you'll find it difficult to be honest with others or look them in the eye. Why? Because you'll be afraid they might look into your heart and see the real you. Is that where you are today? Afraid to look into your own heart? The good news is, Adam was naked but God clothed him; he was guilty but God cleansed him; he was anxious but God comforted him. And if you come to Him today God will cleanse you, clothe you and comfort you. He's just waiting for the opportunity to do it!</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...it may be that the Lord will work for us...' 1 Samuel 14:6 KJV<br /><br /><p>Jonathan, King Saul's son, was pursuing a Philistine garrison. No prophet had spoken. He had no word from the Lord to confirm that he was going to win the battle. He simply said to his armour bearer, 'Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it <i>may be</i> that the Lord will work for us.' Now, this doesn't give you licence to go off and do your own thing, then ask that God back you up. Clearly, Jonathan was fighting on the side of the Lord's people so he knew that God was with him. But without specific, detailed direction he stepped out on a 'maybe'. Did it work? Yes. When Jonathan and his armour bearer killed twenty of the Philistines, it threw the opposing force into such confusion that they started killing one another, and Israel came out on top. Solomon said, 'He who observes the wind will not sow, and he who regards the clouds will not reap.' (Ecclesiastes 11:4 NKJV) In other words, if you wait for perfect conditions you'll neither attempt nor accomplish anything. Yes, it would be wonderful if God always gave us specific directions. But often He leads by an <i>idea</i> or an <i>impression</i> that begins to grow inside you, and as it strengthens and persists you start to think, 'Maybe this is what God wants me to do.' We like the guaranteed outcome (and income). We're comfortable with the certain, absolute deal, with no risk of failure or loss. But you're going to face a 'maybe' more times than you will have guarantees. And it's those times of uncertainty that strengthen your faith, your resolve and your courage.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...it may be that the Lord will work for us...' 1 Samuel 14:6 KJV<br /><br /><p>God answered Jonathan's 'maybe' with a 'definitely'. That's because his cause was just, his faith was strong, he had a heart to do God's will, glorify His name and bless His people. To step out on a 'maybe' you must know that your motive is right, that you have prayed and searched the Scriptures and that you have been willing to listen to godly counsel. A 'maybe' doesn't give you the right to be presumptuous or ask God to rubber-stamp your personal agenda. Sometimes when we want something to happen, we presume God does too. Up until this point Israel went to war based on a plan, a prophecy or a well-thought-out strategy. But sometimes God-given opportunities come to you 'on the fly' and it takes faith and wisdom to know how to respond to them. In those 'maybe moments' you can't wait for guarantees or sit still and do nothing because your actions involve risk. You can't fear natural circumstances, obstacles or frightening situations. You must take the 'maybe' you've been given and do something with it, for that's when you begin to see God turn your 'maybe' into a miracle. Once you know that your heart is right before God you must be willing to face your fear and seize the moment. When you're in a moment that has the potential to alter your future, trust God, step out in faith and move forward. Don't let your dream die inside you because of the risk involved. With God, <i>risk</i> is the <i>bridge</i> that gets you to where He wants you to be.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let patience have its perfect work...' James 1:4 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Have you been asking God, 'Why do I have to wait so long?' If so, here are four important things you need to know: <i>(1) Waiting trains you.</i> Time spent waiting can be time spent learning. And if you're learning, you're not losing. God will train you for battle because He's a good general. 'Praise be to the Lord my Rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle.' (Psalm 144:1 NIV) <i>(2) Waiting corrects you.</i> The Psalmist wrote: 'Before I was afflicted I went astray, but now I keep Your Word.' (Psalm 119:67 NKJV) Pain can be profitable. Adversity can lead to spiritual advancement if you're willing to glean from it. Pain forces you to look to God for answers, to lean on Him instead of others, to learn where you went astray, to hunger for His presence and His healing touch, to listen for His instructions and be sensitive to the changes He wants to bring about in your life. Yes, you can turn your pain into progress. <i>(3) Waiting reveals those around you.</i> Motives are not easily discerned. Trust God but test people. That's Scriptural. '...the Lord your God led you...forty years, to humble you and to test you in order to know what was in your heart...' (Deuteronomy 8:2 NIV) People can keep their intentions and motives covered for a long time, but waiting generally forces the truth to the surface. <i>(4) Waiting gives God time to solve the problem.</i> He's a miracle-working God, so don't get ahead of Him and rob Him of the opportunity to demonstrate His power in your life.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Glancing this way and that and seeing no one...' Exodus 2:12 NIV<br /><br /><p>When Moses killed the Egyptian and hid the body in the sand, he looked around to make sure no one was watching. Ever done something wrong when nobody was watching? We all have! Mark Roberts says he counselled people whose business travel made them vulnerable. 'An executive found that...away from home, she was inappropriately flirtatious, even though she loved her husband and wanted to remain faithful to him. A high-powered professional struggled not to watch pornography in hotel rooms even though he was not tempted...at home. The internet sets innumerable ethical traps... By frequenting an online chat room, a wife became entangled in an emotional relationship with a man who was not her husband. In all of these cases, the sense that &quot;no one was watching&quot; allowed people to sin in ways they would never have done in ordinary, observed life.' Here's what you need to realise: <i>(1) God sees you when nobody else does.</i> When you couple that with a desire to please Him and not grieve Him, it makes a difference in how you act. <i>(2) </i><i>'</i><i>The godly offer good counsel...</i><i>'</i> (Psalm 37:30 NLT) If you know you're vulnerable in a certain area, share it with someone who will pray for you and hold you accountable. (Nowadays there are even computer programmes that will monitor your Internet activity and send a report to others). <i>(3) Avoid situations that afford you too much privacy.</i> One woman closed her personal bank account and opened a joint account with her husband because her spending was out of control. God created you to live in relationship with others, and the more open and honest you are, the less likely you'll be to stray.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Each family had just what it needed.' Exodus 16:18 NLT <br /><br /><p>In the wilderness God provided His people with manna so that they wouldn't go hungry. It appeared miraculously each morning: 'Everyone had just enough. Those who gathered a lot had nothing left over, and those who gathered...a little had enough. Each family had just what it needed.' Ever notice there are times in life when God's blessings seem to '...overtake you...'? (Deuteronomy 28:2 NAS) Your prayers are getting answered, the doctor's report is good, the bills are paid, your job is going great and your children are finally on the right track. When that happens, rejoice and thank God for His goodness. Then there are other times when He gives you 'just enough' light to take one more step. That's when He's teaching you to trust Him on a daily (or sometimes hourly) basis; to test His Word and see for yourself that '...His mercies...are new every morning...' (Lamentations 3:22-23 NCV) Bottom line: God never lets us gather tomorrow's manna today. The Bible says He will '...supply all your need according to His riches in glory.' (Philippians 4:19 KJV) He wants you to rely on the Giver and not the gift, to trust Him to meet all your needs, and to expect that He will bring good things out of bad situations. Instead of getting stressed out, He wants you to '...let [all] your requests be made known to God' (Philippians 4:6 NKJV), to stop fretting when you're alone because He will '...never leave you nor forsake you' (Deuteronomy 31:6 NIV); to realise that no matter what life throws at you, you never have to question His love because it's '...everlasting...' (Jeremiah 31:3 KJV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['And He...said, &quot;Behold, I make all things new...&quot;' Revelation 21:5 KJV<br /><br /><p>The Bible's story is one of change from Genesis, the book of 'beginnings', to Revelation, where God says: 'Behold, I make all things new.' Whatever your situation today, change is possible through Him. However often you've repented, confessed and tried changing, God can change what you can't-and make it last. But change requires understanding certain principles. Let's look at them: <i>(1) You don</i><i>'</i><i>t need to change others in order to change your life.</i> 'I'd be happier if he'd stop...' 'Things won't improve for me till she...' Such beliefs make you focus on the problem and not the solution, ignore realistic options and feed depression. 'Each person should judge his own actions and not compare himself with others.' (Galatians 6:4 NCV) Instead of trying to change others, which only produces resistance and resentment, let God show you what <i>you</i> need to do differently to improve your handling of the problem. When you stop doing what doesn't work and change your reactions to the problem, others often change spontaneously. <i>(2) True change be</i><i>gins by addressing your relationship with God.</i> Bitterness and frustration over problems just result in distancing from God, leaving you to handle the issue in your own strength. Surrendering to Him changes you fundamentally, challenging pride, envy, resentment, fear, dishonesty etc-characteristics of poor change management. 'Let us search out and examine our ways, and turn back to the Lord.' (Lamentations 3:40 NKJV) With 'our lives under God', we're more honest, self-aware, able to perceive realistically; we're respectful, and prepared to become God's change agents.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['And He...said, &quot;Behold, I make all things new...&quot;' Revelation 21:5 KJV<br /><br /><p>Here are two more life-changing principles: <i>(1) You must be willing to change unconditionally.</i> In the early stage of therapy counsellors bump into the 'change-if' syndrome. The client sees change as a strategy of give-to-get: 'I'll change if they are willing to do... If not, I won't.' With God, your reward for changing is intrinsic. You get the joy of His approval, plus all the benefits that follow from being a changed person. This includes God's gift of '...salve to put on your eyes, so you can see.' (Revelation 3:18 NIV) The ability to see things clearly will enable you to understand the problem and deal with it effectively, regardless of what someone else does or doesn't do. <i>(2) You must accept the truth that change means letting go of the past.</i> Whatever you cling to ultimately controls you. If the offence resulted from your actions, or the loss from your poor judgment, confess it to God, receive forgiveness and leave it at the cross. If it was the other person's fault but you've held onto it because you think you're the innocent party and 'deserve your pound of flesh', the freedom you forfeit and the options you miss are too high a price for the false comfort of being right. 'Forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you' (Ephesians 4:32 NIV) will release you from the chains of resentment, giving you back your future. If you're bound by chains of regret over 'coulda, woulda, shoulda' God stands ready to make your future better than your past could ever have been.(Joel 2:25)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['For the Lord gives wisdom...' Proverbs 2:6 NKJV<br /><br /><p>To succeed in life you must do these three things: <i>(1) Decide what</i><i>'</i><i>s important. </i>The story's told of a family who moved to the country to get away from the city. They decided to raise cattle so they bought a ranch. One day a friend visited them and asked what they'd named it. Dad said, 'I wanted to call it The Flying-W, but Mum wanted to call it The Suzy-Q. One of our sons liked The Bar-J, but our daughter preferred The Lazy-Y. So we compromised and called it The Flying-W, Suzy-Q, Bar-J, Lazy-Y Ranch.' The friend asked, 'How are your cattle doing?' Dad replied, 'We don't have any. They didn't survive the branding.' Come on, decide what's important to you! <i>(2) Prioritise your time.</i> Too many of us are like the store owner who got so busy trying to keep the place clean that he forgot to open the front door. The reason you're in business is to serve customers and make a profit, not get distracted by secondary things. Base your life's decisions on your priorities. And if you need help figuring out what they are, ask God: 'For the Lord gives wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding.' <i>(3) Learn to motivate yourself.</i> Most times, nobody else will. When tragedy struck his life, we read: 'David encouraged himself in the Lord...' (1 Samuel 30:6 KJV) You need to learn how to do that too. Jude writes: '...building up yourselves...praying in the Holy Ghost.' (Jude 1:20 KJV) To succeed in life you must learn to encourage yourself, pray and build yourself up.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['This job is too heavy...to handle all by yourself.' Exodus 18:18 NLT<br /><br /><p>President Reagan said, 'Surround yourself with the best people you can find, delegate authority, and don't interfere.' Yet in our eagerness to please God we take on responsibilities that are 'too heavy...to handle all by [ourselves].' Moses was spending every waking minute listening to complaints from long lines of people. Finally his father-in-law said, 'You're going to wear yourself out-and the people, too,' and advised him to appoint capable leaders to 'help...carry the load.' (Exodus 18:22 NLT) It was a win-win solution; the people got help faster, and Moses became a better leader. Henry and Richard Blackaby write: 'One of our greatest challenges...is determining what God <i>doesn</i><i>'</i><i>t</i> want us to do! We love God, we love His people, and we see many needs. But sometimes good intentions cause more harm than good...When you become aware of a need, don't automatically assume God wants you to meet it. The only reason to perform ministry is when God clearly tells you it's His will. If you're overwhelmed...you're probably doing more than God asked. Pray about the assignments you take on, so you don't rob yourself and others of God's best.' Jon Walker adds: 'Imagine if God created you to be the Michelangelo of this age but you stayed so busy doing all kinds of things-good things-that you never got around to painting and sculpting. You'd end up missing the best because you got distracted chasing the good. What a disappointment...for God...and all the people who would have been blessed if you'd stayed focused on your original purpose.' Learn to delegate. Release the burdens God never meant you to carry, and focus on what He called you to do.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon Him, the Spirit of wisdom...' Isaiah 11:2 NKJV<br /><br /><p>During His earthly ministry Jesus needed 'the Spirit of wisdom' when it came to making decisions and dealing with the enemy. As believers, that same Spirit lives in us. James 3:15 says ungodly wisdom has three aspects. It's: (1) <i>Earthly,</i> so it isn't always dependable because 'Sometimes what seems right is really a road to death.' (Proverbs 16:25 CEV) (2) <i>Sensual,</i> based on emotions that can lead to confusion, hurt, and jealousy. (3) <i>Demonic;</i> that is, selfish, lustful, and ungodly. <i>Godly wisdom</i>, however, '...[comes] from above is...pure, then peaceable, gentle, willing to yield, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and...hypocrisy.' (James 3:17 NKJV) The Bible says, '[When] you need wisdom, ask...God, and He will give it to you...' (James 1:5 NLT) And when you're praying, ask yourself these questions: (a) Are my motives pure or will I be ashamed of them later on? (b) Will my decision result in mercy and compassion or strife and stress? (c) Have I considered all the people who'll be affected by the outcome? (d) Am I willing to submit to what God wants or am I determined to plough on regardless? (e) Will the end result cause me to have a harsh attitude or will it produce an environment where love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control can grow? (Galatians 5:22-23) (f) Is it fair and impartial or does it favour a particular person or group? (g) Can I in good conscience pursue this particular course of action or does it involve some level of deceit and selfishness?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...meditate on it day and night...' Joshua 1:8 NIV<br /><br /><p>Pastor, are you an emaciated chef? Are you serving healthy meals to your congregation every Sunday, while you yourself are starving to death spiritually? Have you allowed the business side of the church to steal your prayer life and rob you of time spent in the Scriptures building yourself up? One of the great dangers of ministry is giving out but not taking in. Financially, when you give out more than you take in you end up bankrupt. And the same thing can happen to you spiritually. When Joshua replaced Moses as the leader of Israel, God said the same thing to him three times: 'Be strong and of good courage.' (Joshua 1: 6, 7, 9) Then He explained to Joshua where his strength and courage would come from: 'This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success.' (Joshua 1:8 NKJV) Note the words, 'you will make your way prosperous.' <i>You</i> have a role to play in both your strength and your success. What is it? To 'meditate on [God's Word] day and night.' To meditate is to ruminate. Cows are ruminants. They chew the cud, swallow it, bring it back up and chew it some more, and each time they do they get something more out of it. So chew on God's Word. Think about it. Process it. If you want to be spiritually healthy, meditate and ruminate on the Scriptures!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Love...endures through every circumstance.' 1 Corinthians 13:7 NLT<br /><br /><p>When Ed and Alice went for marriage counselling the therapist asked Alice, 'What first attracted you to Ed?' She replied, 'His strong, silent temperament.' The counsellor continued, 'So why do you want a divorce?' Alice answered, 'His strong, silent temperament!' Sometimes what drew us together ends up a major irritant. In every relationship there are times when it seems it would be easier to quit than to hang in. But short of physical and emotional abuse, there are advantages to working through your issues. For example, there are: <i>(1) Emotional benefits.</i> Contrary to what Hollywood's culture would have us believe, divorced people are more likely to feel depressed due to loneliness. In fact, many say although there were disagreements in the relationship, they miss having somebody to come home to. <i>(2) Health benefits.</i> Emotional stress leads to physical problems, and being in a relationship, especially a good marriage, can be beneficial for your health. It's like having your own nurse or therapist. <i>(3) Community benefits.</i> What your kids see influences their future choices. Staying in your marriage teaches them how to work through relationship challenges. Couples with strong marriages are helping to build a nation of loving, responsible parents who can guide their children onto the right track. 'Love...endures through every circumstance.' Author Christy Scannell says, 'When [my husband and I] got married, we agreed it was for life...Weeks before our wedding we made a pact to work out whatever problems came our way...Yes, we fight. We accuse. We toss barbs...but we won't be moving out or filing papers...whatever happens we're staying.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['It is good for a man to bear the yoke while he is young.' Lamentations 3:27 NIV<br /><br /><p>Thinking maturity and spiritual growth will suddenly 'happen' to your children is like expecting an acorn to suddenly become an oak tree. Time, development and nurture are required to produce an oak tree-the same goes for raising children. And the earlier you start the better your results will be. 'It is good for a man to bear the yoke while he is young.' Otherwise the passage of time will just produce unprepared children with habits and attitudes that are hard to shake later on when life requires them to take on responsibility. In the 'yoke' metaphor the untrained ox learns by being yoked to the well-trained one, sharing the workload and following its example. Parents tend to make two mistakes with their children. First, they over-function. They do everything for them, then blame the child for being lazy. Secondly, they under-function. They demand too much of the child, frustrating them and making them feel incompetent. The key to building character and confidence is not to do it <i>for</i> them but <i>with</i> them, teaching them responsibility. The yoke principle offers two great advantages: <i>(a) It provides the role</i><i>-</i><i>model advantage.</i> 'Apprentice' your children by patiently, lovingly using on-the-job training to demonstrate and impart skills and competence. They'll appreciate you when the tools you provide them lead to a lifetime of natural and spiritual success; <i>(b) It provides the relationship advantage.</i> Those training times and shared work leave space projects are great opportunities to develop and deepen an enduring and precious bond with your children.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...you are My followers if you love each other.' John 13:35 NCV<br /><br /><p>Before Andrew Jackson became president of the United States he was a general in the Tennessee Militia. During the War of 1812 his troops were fighting and bickering among themselves so he called them together and said, 'Gentlemen, let's remember the enemy is over <i>there!</i>' We'd all do well to remember that. It's easy to love God because of everything He's done for us; it's harder when it comes to loving those we have to live with. Charles Swindoll says: 'If there's anything that would keep me away from Christ...if I was lost...it would be the attitude of Christians towards one another...When I was a kid and an argument broke out...my dad used to say, &quot;We may have a few differences inside these walls but remember, we're family. If your brother or sister needs you...take care of 'em...love 'em...and pull for 'em.&quot;' Everything we need to know...can be found in these two verses, 'Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind let each of you regard one another as more important than himself...look out...for the interests of others.' (Philippians 2:3-4 NAS) In other words, think about the other person... Don't be selfish. Sounds like something a teacher might say to a roomful of nursery children...yet how many adult problems could be solved if that was the driving force in our relationships?...How many couples could reconcile their marital differences?' Jesus said, 'People will know...you are My followers if you love each other.' In the hours before He died He was still praying for us to '...have unity in the way that You, Father, are in Me and I am in You...' (John 17:21 GWT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Moses...became so tired...Aaron and Hur...stood on each side... holding up his hands...' Exodus 17:11-12 NLT<br /><br /><p>We like to think of ourselves as self-sufficient, but it's wise to know when you need help. When Israel was fighting the Amalekites, as long as Moses held up his staff the Israelites prevailed. But when he lowered it the enemy gained the advantage. Like the rest of us, Moses was human and his 'arms...became so tired he could no longer hold them up. So Aaron and Hur found a stone for him to sit on. Then they stood on each side...holding up his hands.' God not only gave Israel the victory that day, He showed Moses there are times when we all need help. Mark Roberts says: 'I remember a time I was deeply discouraged...I questioned whether I was the right person to pastor the church...A friend sensed my despair...took me out for coffee and listened to my concerns. He took time to [remind me] of all the ways God was using my leadership...He helped me gain the perspective I'd lost. By the end of our time together, I felt encouraged, ready to continue...I'll always be thankful for the way &quot;he held up my hands&quot;.' Most of us find it easier to <i>give</i> help than to <i>receive</i> it. Sometimes accepting help means giving up your role as the martyr or victim, tearing down walls of independence you've spent years building and letting other people be there for you. If that sounds like you, pray this prayer: 'Lord, You know I tend to rely on myself. Help me to accept the gift You've given me in the people who want to support and encourage me.'</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.' 2 Timothy 1:7 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Fear is something you will experience each time you try something new, like a new job or a new relationship or a new investment strategy. You will never succeed as long as you keep giving in to fear. The corporate world risks failure every time they launch another product. The fashion world risks failure with each new clothing line. Yet they're willing to take multimillion-dollar risks to improve their merchandise and boost their sales. Do they always win? No, but without taking a risk they've no chance of succeeding at all. A poet wrote: 'There was a very cautious man who never laughed or played; he never risked, he never tried, he never sang or prayed. And when one day he passed away, his insurance was denied; for since he never really lived, they claimed he never died!' The fact is, we all fail! The failure rate of the human race is one hundred percent, and everyone (you included) qualifies for membership in this club. But that doesn't mean you have to live in the fear of failure. Faith in God is what gives you the courage to confront your fears and live the life He meant you to live. If you don't, you'll suffer the regret of 'what could have been.' You'll never be perfect, so you'll never be perfectly successful. That doesn't mean you will not succeed in life but you must try. Fear is a 'spirit' and, if you let it, it will control you. God offers you three better options: 'Power...love...a sound mind.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.' 2 Timothy 1:7 NKJV<br /><br /><p>A tourist was driving through the countryside when he saw an old farmer sitting in a rocking chair on his porch. Behind his farmhouse was seventy-five hectares of land. The tourist asked, 'Is that your land?' 'Yep,' he replied. 'Well, what are you doing with it? Thinking of growing cotton?' the tourist asked. 'Nope, I'm afraid the boll weevils will get it,' said the farmer. 'What about corn?' the tourist asked. 'No, I'm afraid the locusts will eat it,' he replied. 'Well,' the tourist asked, 'What about raising cattle?' The farmer said, 'I'm afraid the price of beef might go down.' 'So, what are you going to do with all that prime farmland?' the tourist asked. 'Nothing. I'm just going to play it safe.'</p>
<p>Is that how <i>you</i> feel? When you choose to play it safe in life, your potential for success is like that barren wasteland. As long as fear rules your life you won't step out in faith and fulfil your destiny. The Bible says that without faith it is impossible to please God. (Hebrews 11:6) Isn't it better to risk failure and do what God wants, than risk displeasing Him? We've all experienced the fear that makes us want to pull back. Only those who overcome it go far in life. '...Let the Lord be magnified, Who has pleasure in the prosperity of His servant.' (Psalm 35:27 NKJV) Conquering the fear of failure begins with believing: 'God wants me to succeed.' Undergirded by that truth you cannot only defy your fears but defeat them.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit...' John 4:24 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Someone has said that we are not human beings trying to have a spiritual experience but spiritual beings trying to have a human experience. The life force within you came from God, Who is Spirit. So in the act of worship, it's like going back to your beginnings and reconnecting with Him. The story is told of a little boy sitting beside the crib of his newborn baby sister. He whispers to her, 'Tell me what God is like, for I have forgotten.' Jesus said, 'God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit' [out of the depths of your spirit]. When asked how he could score over eighty points for his team in a single game, basketball superstar Michael Jordan replied, 'Because I was in the zone.' In a sense, heartfelt worship takes you into the God-zone! David the Psalmist lived there. 'Seven times a day I praise You...' (Psalm 119:164 NKJV) 'From the rising of the sun to its going down the Lord's name is to be praised.' (Psalm 113:3 NKJV) 'As the deer pants for the water brooks, so pants my soul for You, O God.' (Psalm 42:1 NKJV) What a picture. In the stream of God's presence our deepest thirst is quenched, our wounds are healed, our strength is renewed, and we are placed beyond the reach of the enemy. Henry Blackaby says, 'You will never be satisfied just to know <i>about</i> God. Really knowing God comes only through experience as He reveals Himself to you.' And that is what happens when you spend time 'in the worship zone.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I must be about My Father's business...' Luke 2:49 NKJV<br /><br /><p>As a boy of twelve, Jesus said, 'I must be about My Father's business.' During His ministry He said, 'I must work the works of Him who sent Me...' (John 9:4 NKJV) Before He died He said, 'I have finished the work which You have given Me to do.' (John 17:4 NKJV) Jesus knew His purpose and priorities, and He lived by them. The question is, do you? You can't have it all. You must understand your God-given purpose and keep it in front of you continually. That way you will know what you must sacrifice, and what you must give yourself to. Only a clear picture of who you are and where you want to go can help you prioritise what you need to do. We all make choices. The question is: are you going to make choices that bring you closer to your goal or take you further away from it? If you don't understand your life's purpose you won't be capable of making the right choices. Clarity of vision creates clarity of priorities. Speaking to pastors, Vance Havner said: 'It is one of the ironies of the ministry that the very man who works in God's name is often hardest put to find time for God. The parents of Jesus lost Him in church, and they were not the last ones to lose Him there.' Ray Ortlund said: 'We must first be fully committed to Christ, then to one another in Christ, and finally to the work of Christ in the world.' The best way to keep your priorities in place is to make prayer and God's Word your top priority.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...They speak a vision of their own heart, not from the mouth of the Lord.' Jeremiah 23:16 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Many people have been sold a bill of goods when it comes to dreams. The saying, 'If you believe it, you can achieve it,' is simply not true. Just about every child dreams of being able to fly like a bird but it's not going to happen, no matter how much they imagine it. Ever watch <i>Australian Idol?</i> Some of the contestants are clueless when it comes to their ability. They sing off key, they screech, they bellow and they howl. And when they're told that they're not good enough by the judges, these wannabe stars throw tantrums and say, 'That's just <i>your</i> opinion. I'm great.' We all need a reality check. Faith is not fantasy. It's not mind over matter. It's not having a lottery mindset. People who think this way believe that if they somehow show up at the right place at the right time and make the right connections, then presto, their fantasy will come true! Wouldn't it be nice if it were that easy? But it isn't. Ralph Waldo Emerson observed: 'Shallow men believe in luck...strong men believe in cause and effect.' When God gives you a dream you need faith to bring it to pass. So the question you need to ask yourself is, 'Is my dream from <i>God?</i><i>'</i> When it is, you'll have the necessary gifts and talents to fulfil it. And what you lack, God will provide in additional relationships and resources. The trouble with chasing a fantasy is that while you're doing it you're not fulfilling the dream God has given you for your life.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...They speak a vision of their own heart, not from the mouth of the Lord.' Jeremiah 23:16 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Jesus said, 'Ask, and it will be given to you...' (Matthew 7:7 NKJV) But that promise is qualified by this condition: what you're asking for must be in harmony with God's will. (1 John 5:14) When you sign a legal contract you cannot afford to overlook the fine print. And as someone with a dream, you can't afford to overlook reality. If you do, reality will stop you cold in your tracks. When God gives you a dream, He gives you all that's needed to fulfil it. The more unrealistic your dream, the more you'll be tempted to depend upon things you cannot control (such as luck). You must balance the boldness of dreaming with the reality of your situation. Yes, you need to reach far beyond what you think you're capable of, but at the same time base what you do on your strengths and other factors within your control. The more concerned you become with things you <i>can</i><i>'</i><i>t</i> control, the less you will do to improve the things you <i>can</i> control. And when you do that, you start living in a fantasy world. When God gives you a dream it will play to your strengths. Catherine B. Ahles observed: 'We spend most of our twenties discovering all of the hundreds of things we can be. But as we mature into our thirties, we begin to discover all of the things we will never be. The challenge for us is to reach our forties and beyond and put it all together-to know our capabilities and recognise our limitations-and become the best we can be.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...My soul thirsts for You...in a...land where there is no water.' Psalm 63:1 NAS<br /><br /><p>Mark Roberts writes: 'On a hike...we spotted a peak that seemed to be just a couple of [kilometres] further, so we headed for it. By the time we conquered the peak we'd used up almost all of our water. Our return...was mercifully downhill, but there was not even a tiny spring to slake our nagging thirst...I spent three hours longing for water, thinking of nothing else besides how wonderful it would feel to finally get a drink.' When David wrote, 'My soul thirsts for You...in a dry and weary land where there is no water,' his enemies were pressing in on him and he wondered if God had forgotten him. Ever been there? Your pain is unbearable and God feels distant? Just as physical thirst is your body's way of telling you that you need water, inside you there's a spiritual thirst only God can quench. And He will: '...[When you] require Me [as a vital necessity]...[you will] find Me when you search...with all your heart.' (Jeremiah 29:13 AMP) Half-hearted efforts won't cut it! One Bible teacher says: 'The only way to know God is...first-hand. Those who are content to know Him through a second-hand relationship don't really know Him...They want others to pray for them rather than praying themselves...to provide the verse rather than reading it themselves. They're content with a TV church, or a sermon on the Internet...Every person needs to test God...to see if He is who He says...if His promises are true...if He'll answer your prayers...if He'll be there when you need Him...if He'll give you wisdom, strength, endurance and perseverance...<i>He is, they are, and He will</i><i>-</i><i>every time</i>.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...who always leads us in triumph in Christ...' 2 Corinthians 2:14 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Jesus said, '...Here on earth you will have many trials...' (John 16:33 NLT) Having problems doesn't mean you're a fake, a failure or the focus of God's displeasure. The storm tested both the believer's and the unbeliever's house. (Matthew 7:24-27) But the believer overcame it. So what's God's goal? To make you an overcomer, not an escape artist! 'Thanks be to God who always leads us in triumph in Christ.' Yes, God will deliver you but first He will develop you. There are problems you can't avoid and must deal with, such as: <i>Your physical heredity.</i> In a society obsessed with 'looks,' are you unhappy about yours? Feel too tall, too short, unattractive, not athletic; you're apple-shaped, pear-shaped, your nose is all wrong? Got freckles, double chin, protruding ears? Tried to darken it, lighten it, accentuate it, hide it, reduce it, enlarge it, but it never looks the way you wish? Beware of our culture's carnal norms. '...They measure themselves by one another and compare themselves with one another...without understanding.' (2 Corinthians 10:12 ESV) The Bible points out that 'sorrow awaits those who argue with their Creator...[who say], &quot;Stop, You're doing it wrong!&quot;' (Isaiah 45:9 NLT) Look your best, but accept what you can't change. God doesn't make mistakes. Don't be like those 'without understanding.' 'People judge by outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.' (1 Samuel 16:7 NLT) Adopt God's standard, not man's. Start appreciating yourself.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...who always leads us in triumph in Christ...' 2 Corinthians 2:14 NKJV<br /><br /><p>S<i>ometimes you have to overcome your family environment.</i> None of us come from an ideal family. Many will experience things like rejection; physical, emotional, verbal or sexual abuse; poverty; rage; drug addiction; alcoholism; divorce etc. Years later we still struggle with things like low self-worth, marital failure, loneliness, depression, addiction, anxiety, anger control and dysfunctional parenting. But having a bad start doesn't mean you can't have a great finish. Your life today is more than what happened yesterday; it's about what you <i>do</i> with what happened yesterday. Consider Jephthah's family background. He was born to a prostitute, kicked out of the house by his brothers, robbed of his rightful inheritance, disappointed in religious leaders, a refugee and rebel living in a cave (Judges 11). But unbowed, he defied defeat, trained a motley militia of rejects, delivered Israel from their enemies, and made it into faith's hall of fame with Abraham, Moses and David (Hebrews 11). How did he do it? He started where he <i>was,</i> he took what he <i>had,</i> and he did what he <i>could.</i> By faith he seized his God-given opportunity. You are more than the product of your environment. Whatever happened back then, you're now '...a new person. The old life is gone; a new life has begun!' (2 Corinthians 5:17 NLT) Live in the new and renounce the old! 'He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.' (1 John 4:4 NKJV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...who always leads us in triumph in Christ...' 2 Corinthians 2:14 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Few things can discourage you like children who don't follow in your path. As Christian parents we long to see our children serve God. If you've prayed, lived your faith before them as best you could and yet they choose another path, your heartache can be deep. But others have travelled the path before you. Isaac saw his son Jacob surrender to God, while his other son Esau rejected Him. Aaron, the high priest, had two sons who offered 'strange fire' on God's altar. Manoah lived through the suicide of his son, Samson. Even the sons of the prophet Samuel '...did not walk in his ways; they turned aside after dishonest gain, took bribes, and perverted justice.' (1 Samuel 8:2-3 NKJV) You're not alone in your concern for your children, and it's too early for guilt, or for giving up on them. Remember<i>first, God alone can save.</i> 'Salvation is of the Lord.' (Jonah 2:9 KJV) Don't try to take on God's responsibility or accept guilt that's not yours. Because He knows our hearts, God knows how and when to 'close the deal' with your child. So instead of worrying, keep lifting up their names before Him in prayer. <i>Secondly, let God shoulder the load.</i> Your part is to pray and believe God for them, then to get out from under the burden. He can carry it; you can't! (1 Peter 5:7) <i>Thirdly, if they</i><i>'</i><i>re alive,</i><i> there</i><i>'</i><i>s hope.</i> (Jeremiah 31:17) God can arrange circumstances and turn their stubborn hearts around, if you will only trust Him.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...well-nurtured plants...pillars...to adorn a palace.' Psalm 144:12 NIV<br /><br /><p>Character and maturity aren't qualities we normally expect to find in our children. We assume that these things come later-an assumption that hinders their growth potential. God's got higher expectations for your children! In His Word we read: (1) 'Our sons...will be like well-nurtured plants.' Not in their forties, fifties or sixties but 'grown up in their youth' (KJV). They needn't waste their youth; they can grow now. Why does God liken them to plants? Because they have spiritual roots capable of drawing in His nurture, ways and strength, and are born with the potential for success. '...I write to you, young men, because you are strong, and the Word of God lives in you, and you have overcome the evil one.' (1 John 2:14 NIV) Hello, that's <i>your</i> child He is talking about! (2) 'Our daughters will be like pillars carved to adorn a palace.' Why would God equate your daughters with pillars? First, because they're designed to be upright and support-giving; they're indispensable to the building's structural integrity. Secondly, because they 'adorn' the building, making it attractive, drawing attention to its grandeur and causing us to admire the architect and owner. Palace pillars glorify the King, making Him, and them, look good. Your children need you to believe in their God-given potential. Do you remember what Jesus said about our children? '...of such is the Kingdom of Heaven.' (Matthew 19:14 NKJV) His faith in their potential is great. Yours must be too.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'I have been crucified with Christ...' Galatians 2:20 NKJV</p>
<p>When we are under attack our survival instincts come out. We are fighters! But that creates a problem, for Paul says, 'I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.' If your number one goal is self-preservation, you are no longer free to make the right decisions. You'll keep doing things based on what feels good, and what's acceptable to others, rather than what God wants you to do. You'll talk a lot about being faithful, but very little about being fruitful. You can only bear fruit if you are willing to die to self: '...unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies [to self], it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.' (John 12:24 NAS) The 'survival seekers' in the Bible forfeited God's best by looking out for their own interests rather than God's. Without considering Abraham, Lot chose the well-watered plains of Jordan, and lost his family (Genesis 13:10-11). The rich young ruler could have been numbered among Christ's disciples, but he'd too much to lose (Mark 10:22). Often, the more we have, the tighter we hold on. Jesus said, 'Whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses [invests] his life for My sake...will save it.' (Luke 9:24 NAS) Paul wrote, 'I consider my life worth nothing to me, if only I may finish the race and complete the task the Lord Jesus has given me...' (Acts 20:24 NIV). The safest place to be-the only place to be-is in the will of God!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['He who finds a wife finds a good thing...' Proverbs 18:22 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Single people need three things. First, they need acceptance. 'He who finds a wife finds a good thing.' But what if you can't find 'a good thing'? By placing all our emphasis on marriage and family, the church can make single people feel like a spare part. 'God places the lonely in families...' (Psalm 68:6 NLT) So let's include them, motivate them and make them feel at home. Secondly, they need healing. People who have never been married or who've been through divorce don't need to be treated like second-class citizens. Regardless of who's 'guilty' or who's 'innocent' in a separation, hearts need to be mended and lives need to be reclaimed. We're in the 'oil and wine business'. The Good Samaritan poured oil, which speaks of spiritual empowerment, and wine, which speaks of joy, into the badly injured man's wounds. And Jesus said that we are to '...Go and do likewise.' (Luke 10:37 NIV) Thirdly, single people need hope<i>.</i> God brought Eve to Adam (Genesis 2:22-23). Let's encourage our single friends not to be driven by loneliness and unmet needs, but to be led by God. If you are single, here is a prayer: 'Lord, reassure me that I'm believing according to Your will. Teach me the difference between what I must pursue and what I must wait on You for. They say You are never late. In these days of waiting, keep me strong in faith. Don't let me stop short of my blessing. Remind me that I must not throw away my confidence for it will be richly rewarded. In Christ's name. Amen.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...To Philemon our beloved friend and fellow labourer.' Philemon 1:1 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Paul called Philemon 'our beloved friend and fellow labourer'. Obviously Paul had found the right person for the job. How do you do that?<i> </i>Perhaps by enjoying their uniqueness. Fred Smith says, 'One young woman worked for me matching colours of ink. She could get tears in her eyes over certain shades of blue. Isn't this a beautiful match? she'd ask. I could never figure out what went on in her head to make matching blue such a remarkable occurrence. But all I needed to do to keep her motivated was to share her excitement and appreciate her work.' We can find the right person by knowing their capabilities<i>.</i> If a musician has limited talent, it's a mistake and a disservice to talk to them about the joys of being a Mozart. In motivation, desire must be matched with ability. Then: by knowing how much responsibility they can handle. Some people can take on full-sized responsibility but not sole responsibility. Something in their psyche says, 'I don't want the whole load. I want somebody to lean on, to report to.' We can find the right person by giving them a reputation to uphold. One leader writes, 'One of my bosses had a way of saying nice things about his workers that got back to them...and we couldn't keep from trying to do more things he could tell. People will work hard to uphold a good reputation.' Finally, by knowing what they thirst for. People have different thirsts. One of the secrets of identifying a person's thirst is seeing what motivated them in the past. People rarely outlive their basic thirst. When we satisfy that, we motivate them.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['When he came to his senses...' Luke 15:17 NIV<br /><br /><p>Do you have a prodigal heart? The parable of the prodigal son teaches us that by listening to God we can avoid tragedy; that by living under His rule we're saved from our misguided tendencies. Jesus said, 'There was a man who had two sons. The younger one said...Father, give me my share... Not long after...[he]...set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth in wild living. After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine...and he began to be in need. So he went and hired himself out...to feed pigs. He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything.' (Luke 15:11-16 NIV) When God says no, heed Him. When He pulls back on the reins, thank Him. It's better to be alone and walk with God than be surrounded by those who'll hurt you. Prodigal, things won't improve until you start doing things God's way!<i> </i>Are you willing to repent and come back home? In three back-to-back parables, in Luke 15, Jesus pointed out that the shepherd went looking for his lost sheep, the woman went looking for her lost silver, but nobody went looking for the lost son. That's because he knew the way back. And it happened when 'he came to his senses'. The rebel who left home saying, 'Give me,' humbled himself and came back saying, 'Forgive me.' When he did, his father embraced him and said, 'This son of mine was...lost and is found...' (Luke 15:24 NIV) Today your Heavenly Father is waiting to welcome you home.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['These things happened...as...warnings for us...' 1 Corinthians 10:11 NIV<br /><br /><p>Scientists now say it was a series of slits, not a giant gash, that sank the <i>Titanic</i>, the opulent, 270m ocean liner that went down in 1912 on its first voyage from England to New York. Fifteen hundred people died that night in one of history's worst maritime disasters. The most widely held theory was that the ship hit an iceberg, which opened a huge gash in its side. But an international team of divers and scientists recently used sound waves to probe through the wreckage, which is buried in mud four kilometres deep. Here's what they discovered. The damage was surprisingly small. Instead of a huge gash, they found six relatively narrow slits across the six watertight holds. 'Everything that could go wrong, did,' said William Garzke Jr, a naval architect who helped the team with their analysis. So, what sank the <i>Titanic</i>? Four things-things that could sink you too! First, they thought they were immune, that it couldn't happen to them. Secondly, they were 'asleep at the wheel' and failed to heed five different warnings. Thirdly, it wasn't one big thing, but a series of small things that took them under. Finally, the problem that finally destroyed them was hidden beneath the waterline, out of sight. The Bible says, 'These things happened to them as examples and were written down as warnings for us... So, if you think you are standing firm, be careful that you don't fall!' (1 Corinthians 10:11-12 NIV) Not one of us, however strong, wise, successful or virtuous, is immune to failure. So stay close to God!</p>

<alias><![CDATA[life-stabilisers-2]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...like an ocean wave tossed around in a storm.' James 1:6 CEV<br /><br /><p>Here are two more life-stabilisers. First, submission. Our ego always wants to 'do it our way', for our purposes and our pleasure. The result is a hardening of the attitudes-a dangerous resistance to God. So His Word says, '...warn each other every day...that none ...will be deceived by sin and hardened against God.' (Hebrews 3:13 NLT) Like a pond gradually freezing in winter, our self-will slowly rigidifies, destroying our spiritual sensitivity. The Spirit's gentle influence no longer moves us; we're left feeling content and justified doing our own thing, to our own demise. It's not wrong to have our own will, and God won't 'cure' or 'deliver' us from it. But He intends us to line our will up with His. A good racehorse must have a will in order to win, but its will must be submitted to the rider's directions or winning will be impossible. 'The sacrifices of God are a broken [submitted] spirit [will]: a broken...heart...God...will not despise.' (Psalm 51:17 NKJV) Secondly, self-sacrifice. The world's philosophy is 'Get and keep all you can!' Few things sabotage our peace and stability like this philosophy. 'Take care of yourself' isn't a Kingdom principle. 'If you try to keep your life for yourself, you will lose it. But if you give up your life for Me, you will find true life.' (Matthew 16:25 NLT) Psychologists say that grasping, and holding on to things and people only makes us anxious, possessive, controlling and difficult to live with! That's why Jesus said, 'Whoever tries to keep his life will lose it, and whoever loses [invests] his life will preserve it.' (Luke 17:33 NIV) You've tried everything else-now try giving yourself fully to God!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...like an ocean wave tossed around in a storm.' James 1:6 CEV<br /><br /><p>Are you winning or losing most of your spiritual battles? Are you down more than up? Do you feel frustrated? Are you going in circles? Is your experience full of stops and starts, a constant guilt-failure cycle? That's not God's plan for you. You can live a stable, consistent life! But it will require life stabilisers such as<i> decisiveness.</i> Israel wanted to have it both ways: God's blessing, yet the right to disregard His Word; freedom to live like heathen nations, yet be His special people. But Joshua declared it unacceptable. '...choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve...' (Joshua 24:15 NIV) The church at Laodicea also wanted it both ways, but God pressed them: '...You are...neither cold nor hot...make up your minds...' (Revelation 3:16,19 CEV) God requires a direction chosen, a goal set, and a mind made up. Wavering classifies you as double-minded and Scripture says That person should not expect to receive anything from the Lord.' (James 1:7 NIV) To live a stable life, you need faith. You are called a 'believer' because faith must characterise not just some, but every area of your life. 'Without faith it is impossible...' (Impossible! Not unlikely, improbable or difficult) 'to please God...' (Hebrews 11:6 NIV) Faith is not what you study on Sunday morning, it's what you do 24/7! The Bible says, 'My righteous [ones] will live by faith.' (Hebrews 10:38 NIV) You say, 'Where do I get faith?' By meditating on, and living in God's Word (Romans 10:17). Who possesses faith? The spiritually exceptional? No, '...God has dealt to each one a measure of faith.' (Romans 12:3 NKJV) That includes <i>you</i>! Faith, not feelings or circumstances, is what makes your life stable!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...Who will go for us?' Isaiah 6:8 NIV<br /><br /><p>Understand two things. First, that borrowed beliefs have no power. You must have a personal encounter with God or your life will have no impact. After they'd been filled with the Holy Spirit, we read, 'The apostles testified powerfully...and God's great blessing was upon them all.' (Acts 4:33 NLT) Secondly, that unused power has no value<i>. </i>Isaiah writes, 'The posts of the door were shaken...and the house was filled with smoke.' (Isaiah 6:4 NKJV) What a mind-blowing experience to have in church! But Isaiah had to leave, go out and perform God's purposes. 'I heard the voice of the Lord saying: Whom shall I send?...Then I said, Here am I! Send me. And He said, Go, and tell this people.' (Isaiah 6:8-9 NKJV)<i> </i>You must spend time in God's presence building a relationship with Him, then carry His Word to those hurting around you. When Jesus took His disciples up the Mount of Transfiguration, Peter got so caught up in the experience that he wanted to stay there. '...Lord, it is good for us to be here...' (Matthew 17:4 NIV) But Christ explained that His power is not for storing, but sharing. Paul wrote, 'I will not...speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me...' (Romans 15:18 NIV) Paul didn't glory in what Christ had done <i>for</i> him, but <i>through</i> him. God has only one reason for filling you with His Spirit, and that's to pour you out in service to others. Jesus said, 'The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to preach...[and] heal the broken hearted...' (Luke 4:18 NKJV) You have been empowered for a purpose! </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I have faith in God that it will happen just as He told me.' Acts 27:25 NIV<br /><br /><p>On his way to Rome, Paul-and 275 others-were shipwrecked. We can learn three important lessons from their story. First, that we must listen to God. If we don't, we'll experience heartache and loss: '...Paul warned them, Men, I can see that our voyage is going to be disastrous and bring great loss... But the centurion, instead of listening to what Paul said, followed the advice of the pilot and...the majority decided that we should sail on...' (Acts 27:9-12 NIV) Notice, being in the majority doesn't make somebody right. Who are we listening to? Do they know God? Are they walking by faith or by human reasoning? Jesus said, '...he who receives whomever I send receives Me.' (John 13:20 NKJV) Secondly, the purposes of God will always overcome the plans of men and women. God can actually make mistakes work for our good. Through this shipwreck Paul landed on Malta and introduced the Gospel to its people. Instead of beating ourselves up over mistakes or arguing about who's right and who's wrong, try to see the hand of God in it. Finally, whatever we've lost, God can restore it. '[The people of Malta] honoured us in many ways and when we were ready to sail, they furnished us with the supplies we needed.' (Acts 28:10 NIV) Don't limit God. He will use people to bless us-people we haven't even met yet. Jesus said, 'Give, and it will be given to you. They will pour into your lap a good measure-pressed down, shaken together, and running over. For by your standard of measure it will be measured to you in return.' (Luke 6:38 NAS) Let's be encouraged; God will bring us through!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[ 'Many waters cannot quench love...' Song of Solomon 8:7 NKJV<br /><br /><p>We smile at the cartoon of a husband saying to his wife, 'There you go again, quoting our marriage vows out of context!' Walter Lippmann said, 'The concept of two people living together for twenty-five years or more without a serious dispute suggests a lack of spirit only to be admired in sheep.' Marriage is God's idea, and it's a good one. But if you're looking for someone who can be <i>everything</i>, you'll be disappointed! When you marry someone you take on their weaknesses as well as their strengths. It's a package deal. By expecting perfection, you're asking for more than either of you are capable of giving. However, when you get into trouble you can count on your partner. Marriage is having someone to curl up with when the world seems cold, who's as concerned as you are when the children are ill. It's having a hand that keeps checking your brow when you aren't well, and a shoulder to cry on when they lower a loved one into the ground. To the one you marry you're saying, 'When my time comes to leave this world, it's your face I want to kiss goodbye. It's your hand I want to hold as I slip into eternity. I want to look into your eyes and see that I mattered. Not what I looked like, or how much money I made, or even how talented I was. No, I want to look into the eyes of someone who loved me and see that I mattered!' If you've been too busy lately, or just forgetful, take a moment and let your spouse know how much you appreciate them.</p>

<alias><![CDATA[are-you-a-good-listener]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...take heed how you hear...' Luke 8:18 NKJV<br /><br /><p>To be a good listener, you must try to listen in an active manner. Pay attention. Nobody wants to talk to a wall, so paraphrase, clarify, and give feedback. Paraphrasing helps you understand correctly. Clarifying is asking questions until you fully understand what the other person means. Feedback is sharing your own thoughts and feelings in a non-judgmental way. Secondly, try to listen with empathy. You may not like what's being said but often as you listen you realise that, if you were in their shoes, you might feel that way too. 'Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep.' (Romans 12:15 NKJV) That's what empathy is all about. Then, try to listen with openness<i>.</i> Selective listening, defensive listening and filtered listening are not open listening. Listen as though you were an anthropologist and the person was from another planet; their customs, beliefs and way of thinking are different from yours, and you're trying to understand them. Finally, listen with awareness. Does what they are saying line up with the facts? Are they consistent? If you've listened actively, empathetically and openly, and still don't understand their point of view, you don't have to attack. Wait, and gather more information! Ask, 'Could you tell me a bit more?' or 'Could you give me a specific example?' Or you might say, 'Thank you for letting me know your perspective. I'll think about it.' Or, 'That's interesting, I hadn't considered it in that light.' Or, 'What you're saying may have some truth to it. Tell me more.' Jesus listened. And the art of listening is a Christ-like skill you must develop!</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...first sit down and estimate the cost...' Luke 14:28 NIV<br /><br /><p>Before God gives you more, He observes you with what you already have. Furthermore, when He speaks a word over your life it's like a seed; it needs time to take root and sprout. If God has planned it for you, don't be impatient; '...wait for it; because it will surely come...' (Habakkuk 2:3 KJV) Patience develops in us the ability to stand up to the pressures that accompany blessing. Look back; aren't some of the things you've been through the very things that have equipped you to handle what you have now? Had God given them to you sooner you couldn't have handled them, and He loves you too much to let that happen. Think: if you're having difficulty handling criticism from a few people, how would you cope if God made you pastor or company president? Are you ready to pay the price? And, more importantly, are you <i>able</i> to pay it? The more God gives you, the more He holds you responsible for. Jesus said, 'No man builds without counting the cost.' Sometimes we want things because others have them. You say you want a husband and children, for example-but are you ready to start living sacrificially? You say you need a wife, but are you ready to give yourself for her? (Ephesians 5:25) Whatever you're going through today, there's great peace in knowing that nothing the enemy does can pre-empt God's plan. So, 'Don't be impatient for the Lord to act! Keep travelling steadily along His pathway and in due season He will honour you with every blessing.' (Psalm 37:34 TLB) Rejoice; God is getting you ready.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Love is patient and kind...' 1 Corinthians 13:4 NLT <br /><br /><p>The space shuttle <i>Discovery</i> was once grounded-not by technical difficulties or lack of funding, but by woodpeckers! The birds found the insulating foam on the shuttle's external fuel tank irresistible. The foam is critical to the shuttle's performance. Without it, ice forms on the tank when it's filled with super-cold fuel; ice that can break free during lift-off and damage it. There's a lesson here. Often, our marriages are damaged not by big things such as infidelity, abuse or abandonment, but little things such as criticism, lack of respect, and taking each other for granted. Pecking away at your relationship keeps it from reaching the heights of happiness God has planned for you. Someone wisely observed, 'Before you criticise your spouse's taste, remember, they chose <i>you</i>.' You say, 'But I'm just stating the facts.' Oswald Chambers said, 'God never gives us discernment in order that we may criticise one another, but that we may intercede [pray] for one another.' Nagging doesn't work; it only tears down your spouse's self-worth and security. People change only when they feel validated and understood. The Bible says, 'Love is patient and kind.' Instead of 'pecking', recall the qualities that attracted you to your spouse, build on them, and bring out the best in them. If <i>you</i> don't, who will? Paul writes, '...Fix your thoughts on what is true, and honourable, and right, and pure, and lovely, and admirable. Think about things that are excellent and worthy of praise.' (Philippians 4:8 NLT) If you plan to stay married and be happy, these are time-tested principles. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Confess your faults one to another...' James 5:16 KJV</p>
<p>It feels good to live without shame. That doesn't mean you'll never stumble, it just means that by God's grace you'll get back up. Do you remember when you had to get a 'permission slip' to miss school? Some of us have given ourselves permission slips to be weak, because we've become weary in the fight. Yes, it's a long fight, but you can win if you want to! Here's one of the keys to victory: 'Confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed.' (James 5:16 NIV) If you are struggling to break a habit that's trying to break you, God never intended you to do it alone. Whatever your habit or struggle may be, the moment it comes-tell on it! When you do, it begins to lose its power. You say, 'Tell who?' Someone who's been through it, someone who's compassionate, someone who'll stand with you in prayer, someone who'll hold you accountable, someone who'll keep your confidence. The Bible says, '...pity the man who falls and has no one to help him up!...Though one may be overpowered, two can defend themselves...' (Ecclesiastes 4:10-12 NIV) Roman soldiers stood back to back, protecting each other when the attack was coming from different directions. So, who's got your back? But a word of caution: confess your faults, not someone else's! You can never be healed by confessing the faults of others. Confess your faults, and let God heal you. Today God wants to make you whole and set you free to enjoy His blessing. Will you let Him?</p>

<p>It feels good to live without shame. That doesn't mean you'll never   stumble, it just means that by God's grace you'll get back up. Do you   remember when you had to get a 'permission slip' to miss school? Some of us   have given ourselves permission slips to be weak, because we've become weary   in the fight. Yes, it's a long fight, but you can win if you want to! Here's   one of the keys to victory: 'Confess your sins to each other and pray for   each other so that you may be healed.' (James 5:16 NIV) If you are struggling   to break a habit that's trying to break you, God never intended you to do it   alone. Whatever your habit or struggle may be, the moment it comes-tell on   it! When you do, it begins to lose its power. You say, 'Tell who?' Someone   who's been through it, someone who's compassionate, someone who'll stand with   you in prayer, someone who'll hold you accountable, someone who'll keep your   confidence. The Bible says, '...pity the man who falls and has no one to help   him up!...Though one may be overpowered, two can defend themselves...'   (Ecclesiastes 4:10-12 NIV) Roman soldiers stood back to back, protecting each   other when the attack was coming from different directions. So, who's got your   back? But a word of caution: confess <em>your</em> faults, not someone else's!   You can never be healed by confessing the faults of others. Confess your   faults, and let God heal you. Today God wants to make you whole and set you   free to enjoy His blessing. Will you let Him?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['My help comes from the Lord...' Psalm 121:2 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Did you hear about the guy who prayed, 'Lord, so far today I've done all right. I haven't gossiped, lost my temper, been nasty, greedy or grumpy. But in a few minutes I'm gonna have to get out of bed, then I'm gonna need all the help I can get.' We smile, but the truth is, it's hard to acknowledge our need of help, especially in a world that prizes self-sufficiency. The most dangerous time in your life is when you think you don't need God! Complacency will set in. Smugness will grow. You'll say, 'I need you, Lord,' then act like it all depends on <i>you.</i> As a result your faith will be unused, and when you're not using your faith you can't please God (Hebrews 11:6). If your vision doesn't require God, it's not of God! When He gets involved in your vision, He becomes the only means of achieving it. Without His help, what can any of us say or do that truly makes a difference? We can't even <i>begin</i> to make progress until we humbly acknowledge that we are powerless over most things in life. We are, but God's not! Whatever you're facing today, read these words and rest in them: 'He will never let me stumble, slip or fall. For He is always watching, never sleeping. Jehovah Himself is caring for you! He is your defender. He protects you day and night. He keeps you from all evil, and preserves your life. He keeps His eye upon you as you come and go, and always guards you.' (Psalm 121:3-8 TLB)</p>

<alias><![CDATA[finishing-strong]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...I have finished my course...' 2 Timothy 4:7 KJV<br /><br /><p>To finish strong, you must understand three things. First, that people will leave you. It may be because you've outgrown them, or to fulfil their own vision, or because they don't want to go where God's taking you. People left Jesus: '...many of His disciples went back and walked with Him no more.' (John 6:66 NKJV) Secondly, that challenges will come. Everybody God uses moves from one challenge to the next. Paul writes, '...we try to show that we are true ministers of God. We patiently endure troubles and hardships... We have been beaten, been put in jail, faced angry mobs, worked to exhaustion, endured sleepless nights, and gone without food... God's power has been working in us... Our hearts ache, but we always have joy. We are poor, but we give spiritual riches to others. We own nothing, and yet we have everything.' (2 Corinthians 6:4-10 NLT) Finally, that Satan will attack you. When he does, remember, attack is a sign of respect. It lets you know you're valuable to God. It also indicates the level of blessing that awaits you beyond the attack. Satan will attack when God is about to bring something to birth in your life. It may be the birth of a relationship, a career, a ministry, or even a child God will use. Your 'difficult child' may be a child of destiny; that's why they encounter more difficulties than your other children. They have an assignment the enemy has discerned. When the attack comes, stand on God's Word and say, 'Thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.' (1 Corinthians 15:57 NKJV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['He guides the humble in what is right...' Psalm 25:9 NIV<br /><br /><p>Did you hear about the old lady who earned a living by peddling her wares? Each day when she came to a certain intersection she would toss a stick up into the air. Whichever way the stick pointed when it landed was the way she went. One day a man saw her tossing the stick into the air: once, twice, then three times. He asked, 'What are you doing?' She said, 'I'm letting God show me which way to go by using this stick.' Looking at her curiously, he said, 'But why did you throw it up three times?' She replied, 'Because the first two times He was pointing me in the wrong direction!' Hello! When you don't like the direction God gives you, do you pray, hoping He will change His mind and tell you what you want to hear? If so, you have never exchanged your will for His! Jesus said, 'I am the vine, you are the branches...' (John 15:5 NKJV) Only as you stay 'connected' to Christ will you bear fruit. Just as the life flows from the vine into the branches, so His power flows to you, then through you and begins to affect other areas of your life. The Psalmist said, 'He guides the humble in what is right and teaches them His way.' God will show you what is 'right' for you if you seek Him. Essentially, there are only two ways-His and yours! If you're tired of doing things your way, get down on your knees and ask Him to show you how to do them <i>His</i> way.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Love is not jealous, it does not brag, and it is not proud...' 1 Corinthians 13:4 NCV <br /><br /><p>Do you remember the elder brother in the parable of the prodigal son? He wanted the privileges of being a <i>son</i>, but not the obligations that came with being a <i>brother</i>. And because he couldn't celebrate his brother's return, it cost him his joy. Contrary to what you may have heard, speaking critical words doesn't make you feel better, it just makes you more miserable and keeps the issue alive. The Bible says, 'Pleasant words are...healing to the body.' (Proverbs 16:24 AMP) If you value your opinions more than your friends, you'll defend your opinions and destroy your friendships. When conflicts arise, step back and look at what's really important. Give others the benefit of the doubt. When working with yourself, use your head; when working with others, use your heart. Learn to be flexible. Thomas Jefferson said, 'In matters of principle stand like a rock; in matters of taste swim with the current.' Don't major in minors, and stop fighting over things that ultimately make no difference. Be gracious with others in the same way God is gracious with you. Mature love allows someone who has failed to ease out of the situation with their dignity intact. Once you've made your point, back off! In life, you're always going to have disagreements. They'll either give you ulcers or give you understanding-the choice is yours. Don't over-react. When conflict arises make it a time to learn, not lose. If you're serious about building good relationships, live by the words, 'Love your neighbour as you love yourself.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Acquaint yourself with Him, and be at peace...' Job 22:21 NKJV<br /><br /><p>A wealthy businessman was upset to find a fisherman sitting beside his boat. 'Why aren't you out fishing?' he asked. 'Because I've caught enough for today,' replied the fisherman. 'Why don't you catch more fish than you need?' the businessman asked. 'What would I do with them?' replied the fisherman. The businessman said, 'You could earn more money, buy a bigger boat, catch even bigger fish and make more money. Soon you'd have a whole fleet of boats and be rich like me.' The fisherman said, 'Then what would I do?' The businessman replied, 'You could sit down and enjoy life.' The fisherman said, 'What do you think I'm doing now?' Contentment comes from two things: great relationships and God-given purpose. The first great relationship you must have is with God. In the book of Job we read, 'Acquaint yourself with Him, and be at peace; thereby good will come to you.' The second relationship you must have and treasure is with your family. When you reach the end of your life that's the relationship that will matter most. When it comes to God-given purpose, you must identify your core strengths, know what God's called you to do, then go to work. Humourist Sam Levenson said, 'My folks are immigrants. They fell under the spell of the American legend that said the streets are paved with gold. But when Papa got here he found out three things: (1) The streets are not paved with gold. (2) Many streets are not paved at all. (3) He was supposed to do the paving.' What are <i>you</i> supposed to do? Do it, and you'll find contentment.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['He who guards his...tongue keeps himself from calamity.' Proverbs 21:23 NIV<br /><br /><p>If you don't want people to remember something, don't talk about it. If you don't want to hear about it later, don't sow the seeds of it into their minds. Arguments would cease and stress decrease if only we had the wisdom to know when to be quiet. In order to know <i>what</i> to say, <i>when</i> to say it, and <i>who</i>to say it to, try to be guided by these Scriptures: 'The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts' (Proverbs 18:8 KJV); 'A wholesome tongue is a tree of life...' (Proverbs 15:4 KJV); 'He who guards his mouth and his tongue keeps himself from calamity.' (Proverbs 21:23 NIV) Be careful about confessing your mistakes to others. You may be sincere, but when you're hurting, vulnerable and in need of support, you can raise issues that live longer than the explanations you give. You can't stop people from shooting at you, but you don't have to give them ammunition. Certainly there are times when public disclosure is right and wise. Jesus said when someone sins against you, you should do these three things. First, go to them privately. If that doesn't work, take two or three mature people with you. If that doesn't work, bring it to the church leadership (Matthew 18:15-17). If you have sinned, ask God to forgive you and He will. Then focus on the future and put everything else into God's hands. If He can deliver you, He can also defend you. If He doesn't choose to do either, He will use it to develop you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...grace in which we stand, and...tribulation [that] produces perseverance.' Romans 5:2-3 NKJV<br /><br /><p>There are two things you can count on as you walk with God: <i>tribulation</i> that works for you; and <i>grace</i> that enables you to stand while you're going through it. Have you been praying for patience? Get ready for tribulation; there's no other way to get it! Patience grows only in the soil of adversity. The truth is, some of the people you can't stand right now are the very ones who'll mature you spiritually and get you to your destiny. God said, 'Moab is my washbasin...' (Psalm 60:8 NIV) The Moabites were Israel's troublesome next-door neighbours who drove them crazy. But such people can also drive us closer to God! So, who's <i>your</i> washbasin? Who brings out the worst in you? Who drives you to your knees? Who stretches your faith? Who develops your character? The problem is, we pray for certain things but God has a process; only as we get to know Him better do we begin to recognise it. Here's how it works: you ask God for strength and He allows you to go through struggles that develop you. You ask Him for wisdom and you get to deal with messy situations that have no easy solutions. You ask Him for success and He gives you ability to work and wisdom to produce. You ask Him for favour and you get responsibility. (Then you want to run from it.) There's a work going on in you right now! You may not be fully aware of it, but without it you'll never be qualified to handle what God has in mind. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...They shall be fresh and flourishing.' Psalm 92:14 NKJV<br /><br /><p>There will soon be millions of people alive who have reached the age of 100, and you need to know how to relate to them. It's a mistake to look at retired people in the light of what they <i>have</i> been, rather than what they <i>can</i> be. Too often they feel shelved. David said, 'Do not cast me away when I am old; do not forsake me when my strength is gone.' (Psalm 71:9 NIV) It's crazy to think people can no longer learn; learning ability doesn't wear out. The rate of learning may decline, but the capacity remains constant. Let's encourage our golden oldies to exercise their minds, and to keep dreaming. Like an atrophied muscle, the ability to learn and grow tends to weaken only because it's not being used. Do you want to be 'filed away' when you're old? No? Well, neither do they. Instead, let's talk about coping with retirement; finding new ways to be useful; adjusting to a reduced income; learning to live alone; relating to grandchildren; understanding the aging process; maintaining high morale; keeping up personal appearance; and preparing for death. Rather than shunting off our wisest minds or belittling their contribution, we should help them to make demands on the church. In a very real sense, their opportunity to have a voice and a role in the church's ministry has been <i>earned.</i> Our culture shames itself by catering to teenagers who have less knowledge of what the church ought to be doing, while bypassing people in whom the Spirit of God has been working for 50 years or more.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart.' Romans 10:8 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Nothing pays greater spiritual dividends than memorising Scripture. Your prayer life will be strengthened. Your witnessing will be more effective. Your counselling will be in demand. Your outlook will change. Your mind will become more alert. Your confidence will be enhanced. Your faith will be solidified. Even if you've tried memorising Scripture and given up, try again using these seven simple steps. (1) Choose a time when your mind is free from outside distractions. (2) Learn the reference by repeating it every time you say the verse. Numbers are more difficult to remember than words. (3) Read each verse through several times-both in a whisper and aloud. Hearing yourself say the words helps cement them in your mind. (4) Break the passage into its natural phrases. Learn the reference, then the first phrase. Then repeat the reference and the first phrase as you go to the second phrase. Continue adding phrases one by one. (5) Learn a little bit perfectly, rather than a great deal poorly. Don't go on to the next verse until you can say the previous one perfectly. (6) Review the verse immediately. About 20 to 30 minutes later repeat what you've memorised. Before the day has ended, firmly fix the verse in your mind by going over it 15 to 20 times. (You can do this as you drive or do your job.) (7) Use the verse orally as soon as possible. The purpose of Scripture memorisation is a practical one, not academic. Use the verse in conversation, in correspondence, in everyday opportunities. Relate what you've learned to your daily situation. You'll be thrilled with the results!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...in all things at all times, having all that you need...' 2 Corinthians 9:8 NIV<br /><br /><p>If your desire is to promote God's Kingdom, He will teach you to profit (Isaiah 48:17 NKJV). Paul writes, 'Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously. Each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that in <i>all</i> things at <i>all</i> times, having <i>all</i>that you need, you will abound in every good work.' (2 Corinthians 9:6-8 NIV) Beware of those who manipulate your giving for their own end. But also beware of those who cripple your faith and leave you wondering if it's all right to give, expecting God's blessing. The Bible says, 'Honour the Lord with your wealth, with the first fruits of all your crops; then your barns will be filled to overflowing, and your vats will brim over with new wine.' (Proverbs 3:9-10 NIV) Just replace the words 'barns' and 'vats' with 'savings' and 'investments'. Here's the question: do you want to be a burden, or a burden-bearer? God wants you to have enough to fulfil His plan for your life, and enough left over to help others. Do you want just enough to take your family out to dinner, or enough to feed hungry children, print Bibles, and help your church fulfil its vision? Paul emphasises the purpose behind our increase: 'He has dispersed abroad [missions]; He has given to the poor [charity]...' (2 Corinthians 9:9 NKJV) Your prayer should be, 'Lord, bless me so that I can be a blessing in Your kingdom!'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...the Lord has blessed me for your sake.' Genesis 30:27 NKJV<br /><br />
<p>There is a principle in the Bible you need to learn if you are to enjoy God's best in your life: blessing comes by association! The Bible says, 'He who walks with wise men will be wise...' (Proverbs 13:20 NKJV) The story of Israel entering the Promised Land teaches us that we can keep company with people such as Joshua and Caleb and go in and possess it, or hang around with the other ten spies who believed it couldn't be done and die in the wilderness. When Joseph entered Potiphar's house, he brought great blessing with him. When he went to Pharaoh's palace, the entire nation prospered. When Jacob wanted to return home to his own family, Laban his father-in-law said, 'Please stay...for I have learned by experience that the Lord has blessed me for your sake.' The Philippian church had a long partnership with Paul in spreading the Gospel. They supported him financially and he ministered to them spiritually. He writes, 'I thank my God every time I remember you. In all my prayers for all of you, I always pray with joy because of your partnership in the Gospel from the first day until now.' (Philippians 1:3-5 NIV) And what was their reward? Paul says, '...all of you share in God's grace with me.' (Philippians 1:7 NIV) This word 'grace' simply means 'all of God you'll ever need, for every situation you'll ever face'. How wonderful! Paul got it from Jesus, and the Philippians got it from Paul. Learn to recognise those who walk in the blessing of God and get as close to them as you can. Blessing comes by association!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...teach them to your children...' Deuteronomy 4:9 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Being a parent is a privilege, so you must convince your children that they're more important to you than career success or acquiring material things. Never miss a chance to tell them you love them. Be there!<i> </i>Being a parent is a responsibility. God doesn't hold the government or the school system responsible for your children, He holds <i>you</i> responsible! 'Do not forget the things your eyes have seen...Teach them to your children and to their children after them.' Being a parent is a limited opportunity<i>.</i> If you neglect them long enough, your children will conclude they're not as important to you as the things you keep sacrificing them for. When that happens you've effectively lost them. Is that a price you're prepared to pay? If not, rearrange your priorities. In his book <i>Avoiding</i> <i>Stress Fractures</i>,<i> </i>Charles Swindoll writes, 'I vividly remember some time back being caught in the undertow of too many commitments and too few days. It wasn't long before I was snapping at my wife and our children, choking down my food at mealtimes, and feeling irritated at those unexpected interruptions through the day. Before long, things around our house started reflecting the pattern of my hurry-up style. It was becoming unbearable. I distinctly recall after supper one evening the words of our younger daughter, Colleen. She wanted to tell me about something important that had happened to her at school that day. She hurriedly began, Daddy-I-want-to-tell-you-something-and-I'll-tell-you-really-fast. Suddenly, realising her frustration, I answered, Honey, you can tell me...and you don't have to tell me really fast. Say it slowly. I'll never forget her answer: Then listen slowly.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I have given you authority...to overcome...the enemy...' Luke 10:19 NIV<br /><br /><p>Has Satan singled you out for attack? Are you wondering, 'Why would he even bother with someone like me?' The answer is-influence. Job's influence was a constant irritant to Satan. One day God said to Satan, 'Have you considered My servant Job, that there is none like him?' (Job 1:8 NKJV) Shortly after that conversation Satan attacked Job's health, his children, his marriage and his business. You can't get God's attention without getting Satan's too! Whatever glorifies God, enrages our enemy. But you have the power to overcome him. Jesus said, 'I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. I have given you authority...to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you.' (Luke 10:18-19 NIV) Notice, you haven't been called to <i>defeat</i> Satan; Jesus already did that 2000 years ago. You have been called to <i>enforce</i> His defeat each day. Jesus already disarmed and made a public spectacle of him at the cross (Colossians 2:15). When General MacArthur met the Supreme Commander of the Japanese forces at the end of World War II, he took the sword out of his hand, declared victory and enforced the terms of unconditional surrender. And that's what Jesus did for you at the cross. When He died and rose again He stripped the devil of his power and declared, 'All [power] in Heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go...' (Matthew 28:18-19 NIV) Go in His power. Go in His strength. Go in His name. He has given you authority over the enemy.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['He will sit as a refiner...of silver...' Malachi 3:3 NIV<br /><br /><p>It's hard watching someone you love going through the refiner's fire, but it's the only way to get pure silver. It's hard watching the refiner turn up the heat until all the scum on the bottom rises, every impurity is removed, and He finally sees His face reflected on the surface. But only then is the work complete. And that's God's goal for each of us. When we pray, 'Make me more like Jesus,' we're asking the Holy Spirit to do a work in us. Usually we don't change until the pain of staying the same becomes unbearable. For most of us, knowledge is not the bridge to growth-pain is. No matter how much you love someone, don't try to rescue them from God's dealings. The worst thing you could have done for the Prodigal Son was go down to the pigsty, clean it up and make it comfortable for him. That's called 'enabling'. Let the refiner do His work! For much of his life Jacob didn't think he needed God. He'd probably have told you, 'I'm doing just fine, thank you!' But the time came when he had to go home, stand before his father and face the wrath of his brother Esau whom he'd wronged. And that's when he became willing to wrestle with God and say, '...I will not let You go unless You bless me.' (Genesis 32:26 NIV) Change usually comes when it hurts so much that you <i>have</i> to change, when you learn so much that you <i>want</i> to change, and when you receive so much that you <i>welcome</i> change.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...God has made me laugh...' Genesis 21:6 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Sarah laughed twice. The first time it was in unbelief because God had promised her a child in her old age. The second time it was with joy because God had fulfilled His promise. But between these two events she went through the most wrenching experience of her life. Her husband, Abraham, betrayed her to save himself. A heathen king took her to his harem and would have violated her had God not intervened. Only a woman who truly loves her husband can understand what Sarah went through that night. There's a lesson here. Between praying for a miracle and getting one, you'll be tested, you'll grow, and you'll learn to trust God more than you ever thought possible. Plus, here's something else that's important to remember: when you share your experiences with others don't just tell how you started or where you are today; instead, tell them what God brought you through, for those are the very things they're struggling with too. Tell them how your faith was tried in the furnace of affliction before you came forth as gold. Don't leave them feeling frustrated because they claimed God's promise and haven't received it yet. King Abimelech's tent where Sarah spent that terrifying night was in a place called Gerar, which means 'the halting place'. Yes, there'll be times when you'll feel like your life has come to a screeching halt and you're getting nowhere. Maybe that's where you are today. If it is, please know this: God will be faithful to you. Not only will He bring you through, but like Sarah, your joy will return as you watch Him fulfil His promise to you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...as a father deals with his own children, encouraging, comforting and urging you to live lives worthy of God...' 1 Thessalonians 2:11-12 NIV<br /><br /><p>With his typical humour, American radio personality Paul Harvey once said: 'A father is a thing that is forced to endure childbirth without an anaesthetic...that growls when it feels good-and laughs very loud when it's scared half to death. A father never feels entirely worthy of the worship in a child's eyes. He's never quite the hero his daughter thinks, never quite the man his son believes him to be-and this worries him, sometimes. So he works too hard to try and smooth the rough places in the road for those of his own who will follow him. Fathers are what give daughters away to other men who aren't nearly good enough so they can have grandchildren who are smarter than anybody's. Fathers make bets with insurance companies about who'll live the longest. I don't know where fathers go when they die...wherever it is, he won't be happy unless there's work to do. He won't just sit on a cloud and wait for the girl he's loved and the children she bore. He'll be busy there, too, repairing the stairs, oiling the gates, improving the streets, smoothing the way.'</p>
<p>When Paul needed an example of a positive influence, he talked about 'a father...with his own children, encouraging, comforting and urging you to live lives worthy of God.' If your dad distinguished himself as a good role model, remember to thank him. If you weren't blessed with that kind of influence, or you grew up without a dad, let today be an occasion to honour the spiritual fathers who <i>did</i> nurture and inspire you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Christ has made us free...' Galatians 5:1 NKJV<br /><br /><p>History records dark chapters when godless tyrants ruled and religious dictators made it a crime to read the Bible or worship God according to the dictates of your conscience. In 1945, Martin Niemoeller said, 'When the Nazis came for the communists, I didn't speak up because I wasn't a communist. When they came for the Jews, I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Jew. When they came for the trade unionists, I didn't speak up because I wasn't a trade unionist. When they came for the Catholics, I didn't speak up because I was Protestant. Then they came for me, and by that time there was no one left to speak up for anybody.' On the top of the Capitol Dome in Washington DC is a 6 metre statue of <i>Lady</i> <i>Freedom</i>. Her face is framed in a crest of stars and she's holding a shield of stars and stripes in her hand. She was shipped from Rome, and during a fierce storm the captain ordered some cargo thrown overboard. The sailors wanted to ditch <i>Lady</i> <i>Freedom</i>, but the captain is said to have refused, shouting above the wind, 'Never! We'll founder before we throw freedom away!' Benjamin Franklin said that those who give up liberty for safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety! Speaking to the believers in Galatia, Paul addresses the legalists who wanted to force them to go back and live under the impossible standards of the old law. He writes, '...Christ made us free. So stand strong. Do not change and go back into the slavery of the law.' (Galatians 5:1 NCV) Today you need to stop, look up and say, 'Thank God for my freedom!'</p>

<alias><![CDATA[pray-for-our-leaders]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Pray for...all who have authority...' 1 Timothy 2:2 NCV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says, 'Righteousness exalts a nation...' (Proverbs 14:34 NAS) In the Old Testament, Abraham interceded with God on behalf of Sodom (Genesis18:20-33). Moses stood between God and Israel, and saved it from destruction (Exodus 32:11-14). When Achan sinned, Joshua pleaded the people's case before God (Joshua 7:6-9). We live in an era of dwindling regard for authority, and it's easy to add your voice to the chorus of naysayers. Even if you didn't vote for those who are in power, the Bible says, 'Pray for rulers and...<i>all</i> who have authority.' Why? Because it 'pleases God'; it's that simple! Ask Him to give our leaders three things. First, humility: '...humility comes before honour.' (Proverbs 15:33 NIV) Jesus, the greatest leader of all time, '...gave up His divine privileges [and]...took the humble position of a slave...' (Philippians 2:7 NLT) Servant-leadership is the epitome of strength; it means acknowledging our limitations and looking to God for insight and guidance. Secondly, wisdom.<i> </i>Solomon said, '...[The] fear of the Lord [precedes] Wisdom...' (Proverbs 15:33 AMP), and James adds, 'If you need wisdom, ask...God, and He will give it to you...' (James 1:5 NLT) Instead of praying only for the advancement of your own political agenda, ask God to give our leaders what they need to exercise sound judgment and make wise decisions. Thirdly, courage<i>.</i> David said, 'Wait on the Lord; be of good courage, and He shall strengthen your heart...' (Psalm 27:14 NKJV) In the face of global terrorism, war, financial upheaval and a climate of fear, pray that God will give our leaders the strength of character to do what's right, instead of what's popular.</p>

<title><![CDATA[Give Your Marriage a Tune-Up!]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[give-your-marriage-a-tune-up]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...be kind to one another, tender-hearted...' Ephesians 4:32 NKJV<br /> <br />The secret to closeness in marriage is not sparkling conversation or shared interests or incredible sex. As good as those are, the secret is practising plain, old-fashioned thoughtfulness and kindness. It's the stuff we learn when we're young and forget when we're too busy: things like respect, sensitivity, attentiveness and caring. If your marriage needs a tune-up, start doing these four things. First, practise 'hug therapy'. When you're at odds with each other, remember this: 'Hearts may agree though heads differ.' A hug works wonders. When we touch one another in caring ways our bodies actually produce chemicals that calm us emotionally and help us to bond physically. God designed us that way. Secondly, don't forget the small stuff. When you routinely build little kindnesses into your marriage they become a source of strength later; it's like money in the bank you can draw on. So think 'personal' and 'sweet', like helping to clean up after dinner, making the bed, walking the dog or putting out the bins. Thirdly, mind your manners. Just because you're married doesn't mean common courtesy should go by the wayside. The Bible says, 'Be kind to one another, tender hearted.' That means listening without interrupting, and practising the basics like saying, 'Please,' 'Thank you' and 'I'm sorry'. This stuff's not rocket science, but it works! Finally, compliment each other. Your marriage partner is not a mind reader. Whenever you think something nice about them, tell them! We live in a cold, competitive world; hearing that we're loved, smart, attractive and fun from someone whose opinion we really value means everything.</p>

Any time you learn from failure, you've taken a step towards success. You can't hit a home run unless you step up to the plate and face the pitcher. Baseball legend Babe Ruth hit a record 714 home runs, but he also struck out over 1300 times. During a low period, an interviewer asked him how he overcame discouragement. He replied, 'If I just keep swinging the bat, the law of averages says I'll catch up. In fact, when I'm in a slump, I feel sorry for the pitcher because I know that sooner or later he's going to pay for it.' When Benjamin Disraeli attempted to speak in Parliament for the first time they booed him into silence. But he said, 'Though I sit down now, the time will come when you will all hear me.' And they did! He became one of Britain's best orators and Prime Ministers. Today Disraeli's critics are forgotten, but his contribution to history lives on. You say, 'How can I recognise my destiny?' First, your destiny is a desire that won't let you go. Paul said, 'I am compelled to preach. Woe to me if I do not.' Secondly, your destiny will be more than a job, it will be joy.<i> </i>The Psalmist said, 'I delight to do Your will.' (Psalm 40:8 NKJV) Thirdly, your destiny will unlock your creativity. When God called Gideon a '...mighty man of valour' (Judges 6:12 NKJV), he was hiding in a winepress. But God wasn't addressing his present state, He was speaking to the potential within him. So, what are you called to do?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...let us lay aside every weight...' Hebrews 12:1 NKJV<br /><br /><p>In his book <i>Maverick</i>, Ricardo Semler writes, 'We were in yet another meeting...when we came to the purchase of fifty thousand dollars' worth of file cabinets. We didn't buy a single new file cabinet that day. Instead we decided to stop the company for half a day and hold the first biannual file inspection and clean-out... Our instructions were simple: we told everyone to look inside every file folder and purge every non-essential piece of paper... I was one of Semco's biggest file hogs, with four large cabinets and a request for two more. After our clean-up, I trimmed down to a single cabinet, and that was pretty much how it went throughout the company... The clean-up went so well that when everyone had finished, Semco auctioned off dozens of un-needed file cabinets.' The Bible says, 'Let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares us, and...run with endurance the race...set before us.' Now, we tend to focus on 'sins' and overlook 'weights', because sins are easy to identify and weights aren't. But often they're what keep us from running our best race. The problem with success is that it gives you options you didn't have before, like <i>owning</i> more stuff and having to <i>maintain</i> it. How can you know what's good for you and what's not? '...No good thing will He withhold from those who walk uprightly.' (Psalm 84:11 NKJV) If God withholds it, you don't need it! 'Delight yourself also in the Lord, and He shall give you the desires of your heart.' (Psalm 37:4 NKJV) When you make Jesus the Lord of your life, His desires become yours, and those are desires God will fulfil.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...this one thing I do...' Philippians 3:13 KJV<br /><br /><p>Ask yourself two questions. First, do I want God's best? It's not easy to rise up early while others sleep, and prepare for the challenge. Like Jesus in Gethsemane, you'll discover it's hard to find people who will stand with you while you're in preparation. But there can be no celebration without preparation. Not everybody can handle success. Some would rather have tranquillity; they don't like criticism and they can't take the pressure. But if you want God's best you can have it. If you've the passion, the price won't stop you! You'll be drawn and driven toward the goal. Secondly, ask yourself: how strong is my desire? If you don't have the passion for it, you'll never overcome the obstacles. Real power comes from desire kindled in the furnace of unfilled longing. Long-distance runners take steady strides and focus on endurance, not just speed. They run each lap, stretch to their limits and give themselves to one thing-winning. Perspiration pours out of them. The taste of exhaustion is in their mouths. As they near the finishing line a final burst of energy kicks in. It's the last lap. No excuses; it's now or never! At least one time before they lay you in your casket, you owe it to God and yourself to experience that last-lap feeling of giving it all you've got. Victory doesn't come cheap. Paul writes, '...resist the enemy... Stand your ground, putting on the sturdy belt of truth and the body armour of God's righteousness... be fully prepared... Pray at all times.' (Ephesians 6:13-18 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...his father called him Benjamin.' Genesis 35:18 KJV<br /><br /><p>When people label you, those labels can cause you to shrink instead of to stretch to your full potential. But the God who gave Jacob a new identity can give you one too. Are you struggling with the old names people called you and the old images you have of yourself? Nothing will change in your <i>life</i> until it first changes in your <i>mind</i>. Jacob's wife Rachel died in the desert in childbirth. Just before she died she named her son Ben-Oni, which means 'son of my sorrow'. When the midwife handed him to his father Jacob, he said that he should not be called Ben-Oni, the son of my sorrow, but Benjamin, the son of the right hand (that is, son of power). Guess which name prevailed? Benjamin! Hear this: you are who <i>God</i> says you are, not who <i>others</i> say you are! If God didn't give you the name, it's not yours. Only believe what God says about you. Nobody understood better than Jacob the power of a name change. It was in God's presence that Jacob the trickster was re-named Israel, '...a prince...with God...' (Genesis 32:28 KJV) Christ breaks the power of every negative thing that attaches itself to you. 'You're a saint, not a sinner; not a loser but a winner.' When people try to label you, tell them you don't answer to that name any more. Tell them the person they're talking about died, was buried, and rose brand new in Christ. God sees you as a new creation, so start thinking, talking and acting like one!</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['God has appointed...teachers...' 1 Corinthians 12:28 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Howard Hendricks points out that good teaching involves giving people <i>responsibility</i> with <i>accountability</i>: 'Our problem in the churches is that we don't do that. The United States government takes multi-million-dollar planes and puts them in the hands of kids nineteen years old; and when those same kids come to church we don't even let them take up the offering... Ever been in a courtroom where a will is being read? The reader is mumbling his way over the legal jargon, and everyone else in the room is half asleep-everyone, that is, except the person named in the will as the beneficiary... When your teaching has the learner's name written all over it-when he sees that, in effect, his name occurs throughout the book-it will make a big difference in his level of motivation... I am convinced that everyone-no exception-can be motivated to learn. But not at the same time, and by the same person, and not in the same way. The timing is crucial. Teaching is the assembling of a time bomb...marked for explosion at a later date and at a different location. That is why you need to walk by faith to be a good teacher, and you need a lot of patience. And you aren't God's answer to every individual. That is what the body of Christ is all about... I'm asked over and over again, How do I get a person motivated? I answer, When you sock someone with twenty thousand volts of electricity, they don't turn to you and ask, 'Did you say something?' No, they move!' The question is, 'Teacher, are <i>you</i> motivated?'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...how often shall...I forgive him...?' Matthew 18:21 NKJV<br /><br /><p>When people are upset they say and do the wrong things. At times such as these it's easy for you to become critical of them and arrive at the wrong conclusion. Instead, slow down; ask God for patience and understanding. Don't force others to live by their past while you expect yours to be forgotten. Whatever you sow in mercy you'll reap a hundred times over. Everybody makes mistakes, so give them a chance to come back into the relationship with dignity. How long has it taken <i>you</i> to correct the mistakes in your life? Aren't you still working on some of them? Aren't you glad people don't know the whole story of your struggles? So give people time; give them an opportunity to explain themselves. They may not even know the right words at first, so be willing to listen a little longer. Jesus put up with Peter's weaknesses because He knew what Peter would one day become. Interestingly, when someone upset Peter he came to Jesus and said, '...how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times? Jesus said to him...Seventy times seven.' (Matthew 18:21-22 NKJV) If they have a flicker of hope, fan that flame, don't extinguish it. They don't need a critic, they need a cheerleader. When Nathaniel Hawthorne was fired from his job he was devastated. But his wife said to him, 'Now you can start that book you've always wanted to write.' Out of that came <i>The Scarlet Letter.</i> James Whistler failed at West Point. He also failed in business. But a friend encouraged him to try painting. And the rest is history. So give them another chance.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Noah...warned by God...[saved] his household...' Hebrews 11:7 RSV<br /><br /><p>Are you close enough to God to hear His warnings when danger approaches? Noah was, and he saved his family. Are you close enough to your family for them to have confidence in what God has spoken to you? You can change the direction of your family without argument or discussion. How? Through prayer. Your loved ones need to be sheltered under the covering of your prayer life. If you don't have one, get down on your knees and say, '...Lord, teach me to pray...' (Luke 11:1) We are emotionally overwhelmed and spiritually depleted because we haven't learned the power of prayer. The lack of it has left us weak and anxious. We blindly make decisions for our businesses, our relationships and our ministries without taking time to talk it over with the Lord. The story of Noah teaches that you can't prepare for trouble without a warning from God. That means staying close to Him and hearing what He has to say. You can do great things <i>after</i> you've prayed, but you can do nothing of eternal value <i>until</i>you've prayed. 'If My people who are called by My name humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from Heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.' (2 Chronicles 7:14 RSV) God promises to intervene on behalf of the person who prays in His will. '...if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. And if we know that He hears us-whatever we ask-we know that we have what we asked of Him.' (1 John 5:14-15 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[‘...the pure in heart…shall see God.’ Matthew 5:8 ASV
<p>In the tabernacle there was a large washbasin called the laver (Exodus 30:18). Its bronze base acted like a mirror letting the priest see the dirt on his feet. Before he could approach God he had to stop and be cleansed, otherwise he would die. The Psalmist writes, ‘...Who may stand in [Your] holy place? He who has clean hands and a pure heart… He will receive blessing from the Lord...’ (Psalm 24:3-5 NIV) God’s blessings are contingent upon the condition of your heart. Does that mean you must be sinless? No, it means you must be <em>conscious</em> of your sin and <em>deal</em> with it right away. Why the big deal about purity? Because Jesus said, ‘Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.’ The problem is not God’s inability to be seen, but our inability to see Him. No wonder David prayed, ‘Create in me a pure heart...’ (Psalm 51:10 NIV) This word <em>pure</em> is from the Greek word <em>katharos</em>, which means ‘to clean out’. When you’ve heard too much and seen too much, you need a spiritual catharsis. Only a pure heart can understand God’s will and discern His ways. Unidentified, unconfessed, unforgiven sin will block your spiritual arteries. A heart that’s not pure will keep you seeking the wisdom of those around you rather than the ways of God. It will keep you needing prayer instead of offering prayer for others. Don’t carry around what God wants discarded. Get rid of ‘...every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares...’ (Hebrews 12:1 NKJV) What God wants to show you is worth cleaning up for.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I am still confident of this: I will see the goodness of the Lord...' Psalm 27:13 NIV<br /><br /><p>When a player begins to score, the opposing team assigns their best players to block him. So the attack you're experiencing right now could be an indication of your value to God. Paul wrote, 'I have...been in danger from rivers, thieves, my own people, the Jews, and those who are not Jews. I have been in danger in cities...and on the sea and...with false Christians. I have done hard and tiring work, and many times I did not sleep. I have been hungry and thirsty...cold and without clothes. Besides all this, there is on me every day the load of my concern for all the churches.' (2 Corinthians 11:26-28 NCV) How did Paul handle these experiences? By 'forgetting the past and looking forward to what lies ahead.' (Philippians 3:13 NLT) Now, Paul didn't forget any of it; he could remember names, places, faces, and even record it. But here's the difference: he refused to let what was done to him affect his outlook. That's the attitude <i>you</i> need! When your desire to go forward becomes greater than the memories of your past, you'll begin to live again. 'Where there is no vision, the people perish...' (Proverbs 29:18 KJV) Until you have a vision of tomorrow, you'll live in yesterday's struggles. The very fact that God is putting desire back into your spirit means that better days are coming! So rise up and say with the Psalmist, 'I am still confident of this: I will see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living.' </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...parts...that seem...least important are...most necessary.' 1 Corinthians 12:22 NLT<br /><br />
<p>In his book <em>Encourage Me</em>, Charles Swindoll asks the following questions: 'Who taught Martin Luther his theology and inspired his translation of the New Testament? Who visited Dwight L. Moody at a shoe store and spoke to him about Christ?... Who financed William Carey's ministry in India? Who refreshed the Apostle Paul in that Roman dungeon as he wrote his last letter to Timothy?... Who followed Hudson Taylor and gave the China Inland Mission its remarkable vision and direction?... What was it Jim Elliot, the martyred messenger of the Gospel to the Aucas in Ecuador, once called the missionaries? Something like a bunch of nobodies trying to exalt Somebody. But don't mistake anonymous for unnecessary. Otherwise, the whole body gets crippled...even paralysed...or, at best, terribly dizzy as the majority of the members...become diseased with self-pity and discouragement. Face it, friend, the head of the body calls the shots. It is His prerogative to publicise some and hide others. Don't ask me why He chooses whom He uses. If it's His desire to use you as a Melanchthon rather than a Luther...or a Kimball rather than a Moody...or an Onesiphorus rather than a Paul...or a Hoste rather than a Taylor, relax! Better than that, give God praise! You're among that elite group mentioned in 1 Corinthians 12: 24 TLB: 'God has put the body together in such a way that extra honour and care are given to those parts that might otherwise seem less important.' So be encouraged: you may be anonymous, but you're indispensable!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...you shall remember it as waters that pass away.' Job 11:16 AMP<br /><br /><p>Tamar experienced the terrible trauma of rejection. But her future was greater than her past: she gave birth to a child who became a progenitor of our Lord Jesus. What an honour! Wounded one, you <i>can</i> come through this painful experience and sing the song of the overcomer. By God's grace you can learn to live in the present and let go of the past. How? By spending time in God's presence and allowing His love to touch the hurting places within you. Give all your secrets to God-and leave them there. He can take the misery out of the memory like you take the poison out of an insect bite; then your healing will begin. Job, who lost his health, his wealth and his family, lived to see these words fulfilled: 'You shall forget your misery; you shall remember it as waters that pass away.' Go ahead, stand in the stream of God's grace and release it. Let it all go. It was night, but now it's day! Let God hold you safely in His arms. There, you can allow the past to fall from you like a garment. You may remember it, but you won't have to wear it any more: 'You shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid.' (Job 11:19 AMP) No more pacing the floor, no more bad dreams, no more fear of tomorrow. Shame has been removed and grace enthroned. Rise up in Christ's name and take authority over every memory that keeps you linked to the past. Allow God to heal your scars, break your chains and set you free.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['But Christ gave Himself...one sacrifice for all time.' Hebrews 10:12 TLB<br /><br /><p>Notice how God dealt with sin in the Old Testament. The priest took a lamb, shed its blood and offered it on the altar. As the sacrificial smoke went up, the priest would sprinkle the ashes on the ground, then stand on them. At that moment the person's sin was atoned for and their guilt removed. What a beautiful picture of your salvation! At Calvary, the fires of God's wrath were fully expended on Christ. In that moment, He was both your High Priest and your sacrificial lamb. When He cried, 'It is finished,' (John 19:30 NIV), your sins were paid for-from the cradle to the grave. And the minute you trust in Christ as your Saviour, your standing before God is altered; you are made righteous (2 Corinthians 5:21). In the early days of the American West one of the greatest fears the wagon train masters had was prairie fires. The hot sun could start them, and before you knew it you were engulfed in flames. But a wise wagon train master would immediately give the order to back up the horses and wagons on to the ground that had already been burned. Why? Because the fire could not come where the fire had already been!<i> </i>Augustus Toplady wrote, 'Payment God will not twice demand; first at my bleeding Surety's hand, and then again at mine.' Jesus 'took the heat' for every one of us. 'He...bore our sins in His body on the tree...' (1 Peter 2:24 NIV) So today, if the devil is beating you up because of your faults and failures, tell him: 'I may not be perfect, but I'm redeemed, loved and accepted by God!' </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['My God shall supply all your need...' Philippians 4:19 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Are you afraid you won't have enough to meet your needs? Let's read the story of the feeding of the 5000 and observe three things about the disciples. First, they tried to escape the problem. They told Jesus, 'Send them away, that they may go...and buy themselves bread.' (Mark 6:36 NKJV) But He said no. Jesus understood that you grow by dealing with problems, not avoiding them. Your faith increases only as you place a demand on it. Lazy, inactive faith will fail you in the hour of need, so you must feed on God's Word and exercise your faith regularly. Secondly, the disciples thought what they had wasn't enough: 'There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two small fish, but what are they among so many?' (John 6:9 NKJV) God will ask you to look at what you've got because even though it doesn't look like much, when you factor Him in, it'll be more than enough to meet the need. In the disciples' hands it was just lunch for one, but in Christ's hands it became dinner for 5000. So put what you have into God's hands and let Him work. Thirdly, only when the disciples obeyed His plan was their need met. When you ask God for a miracle He will often give you a plan with a set of instructions. At that point your obedience sets the timer, activates the plan and determines the results. With God, there's no lack and no limit. When it was over, '...they took up twelve baskets full of fragments and of the fish.' (Mark 6:43 NKJV) Don't worry, you will have enough!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['To the Lord I cry aloud, and He answers me...' Psalm 3:4 NIV<br /><br /><p>Regardless of when or why you stumbled, God wants to pick you up and put you back on your feet. People who have never experienced failure usually don't accomplish much. There's a certain security in playing it safe. Nothing's lost, but nothing's won. They never get out of the boat and walk on the water. Wouldn't it be better to almost drown and have to be saved, than never to experience God's power working through you? Adversity is like yeast; when the heat is turned up, it rises. And the hotter it gets, the more it rises. The truth is that every opportunity God gives you will come with obstacles, and you'll have to rise above them. Look at the children of Israel in Egypt: '...the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew...' (Exodus 1:12 NKJV) Often the bad times do more to strengthen your faith than the good ones. You say, 'But I blew it!' God says, 'My grace is sufficient for you: for My strength is made perfect in weakness...' (2 Corinthians 12:9 NKJV) You say, 'But the people I trusted let me down, and those I thought were for me were really against me.' The Psalmist said, 'Many are saying... God will not deliver him. But...to the Lord I cry aloud, and He answers me...' (Psalm 3:2-4 NIV) It's hard to accept that some people don't want you to succeed. But many people 'saying' it doesn't make it so! The most secure place in the world is in the will of God. If you align your plan with His purpose, ultimately you'll win, and there's nothing they can do to stop you!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Pour out your heart...for...your...children...' Lamentations 2:19 NKJV<br /><br /><p>When George McCluskey started a family, he decided to invest one hour every day in prayer because he wanted his children to follow Christ. Then he expanded his prayers to include his grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Every day between 11am and noon he prayed for the next three generations. As the years went by his two daughters committed their lives to Christ and married men who went into the ministry. These two couples produced four girls and one boy. Each of the girls married a minister and the boy became a pastor. The first two children born to this generation were both boys. After leaving secondary school, the two cousins chose the same college and became roommates. During their second year one boy decided to go into the ministry. The other didn't. He felt lots of pressure to continue the family legacy, but he chose instead to go his own way and pursue his interest in psychology. He earned his doctorate and eventually wrote books for parents that became bestsellers. Eventually he started a radio programme that was heard around the world each day. The man's name? James Dobson. So now you know the story of George McCluskey! He was just an ordinary man, but his prayers had an extraordinary effect on much of the world. If you are a parent or a grandparent, the Word for you today is, 'Arise, cry out in the night...pour out your heart like water before the face of the Lord. Lift your hands toward Him for the life of your...children.' </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...our light affliction...is working for us...' 2 Corinthians 4:17 NKJV<br /><br /><p>There are times in your life when everything you attempt to do will seem to go wrong. Your faith may be strong and your commitment deep, yet adversity will come knocking on your door. In such times, the power of prayer will strengthen and stabilise you. But you can't pray away life's seasons! God has a purpose for not allowing you to be fruitful all the time. Real growth requires seasons of struggle as well as seasons of success. Your seasons of struggle destroy pride in your own ability, increase your dependence on God, and cause you to say, like Paul did, 'Not that we are sufficient of ourselves...our sufficiency is from God.' (2 Corinthians 3:5 NKJV) These are humbling experiences, but you need them. Your life is like a tree: in winter it silently refurbishes its strength, preparing for the next season of fruitfulness. As you look back on your life's accomplishments you'll notice that they are seasonal. There are seasons of rain as well as sunshine, and each season serves an important purpose. That's why it's a mistake to make a permanent decision based on a temporary circumstance or changing emotion. '...the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.' (2 Corinthians 4:18 KJV) The word <i>temporal</i> means 'subject to change'. Hold steady, it's not always going to be this way! Sometimes the situation doesn't call for action, it calls for patience and trust in God. Paul writes, 'Our light affliction, which is but for a moment, is working for us.' In ways you cannot understand, God is making the circumstances you're in today work for your good. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Pharaoh's chariots and his army He has cast into the sea.' Exodus 15:4 NKJV<br /><br />
<p>For 400 years the Egyptians had enslaved the Israelites. Then just when they thought they'd escaped Pharaoh, he showed up at the Red Sea. And that's when God intervened, causing them to sing, 'Pharaoh's chariots and his army He has cast into the sea'. And God wants to do the same for <em>you.</em> Regardless of what has happened, He can bring you through it and give you a new song. Will it happen quickly or easily? No, we get through it in different ways and at different rates. How did the Israelites get through the Red Sea? One step at a time! But when they got to the other side that body of water became the dividing line between their past and their future. But to get beyond your past you must forgive, and keep on forgiving until the past loses its hold over you. You must rise up and declare by faith that the power those old issues had over you is broken. Jesus promised that when <em>His</em> word on the issue becomes <em>your</em> word on it, your circumstances will begin to change (Mark 11:23-26). So make God's Word the final word! But look out, old memories will try to negotiate another deal to see if you're serious about moving on. Paul writes, 'Reckon yourselves to be dead.' (Romans 6:11 NKJV) Now, death alone doesn't bring closure; you need burial. So establish a time, a place and an epitaph that reads, 'The past ends right here!' Tell Pharaoh, 'Your hosts and your ghosts can't hurt me any more', and move on!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ.' 1 Corinthians 11:1 NIV<br /><br /><p>Ralph Waldo Emerson usually greeted Henry David Thoreau by asking, 'What has become clearer since last we met?' The late Fred Smith liked to ask that question too. A lifelong friend of Billy Graham and Zig Ziglar, Smith mentored a generation of leaders. But, more importantly, he was the real deal at home. He believed the words: 'Tell your children and grandchildren...the incredible things I am doing.' (Exodus 10:2 TLB) Fred's daughter Brenda shares some Scriptures she learned from her dad. Let's look at them: 'Love never fails...' (1 Corinthians 13:8 NAS) When Fred's doctors said he was dying, Brenda said, 'No, I'll take him home and he'll live.' She did, and he did. Many older people who die of 'natural causes' actually die of loneliness. Love is still our healthiest environment; it's God's greatest gift to us, and ours to one another. '...tribulation produces perseverance.' (Romans 5:3 NKJV) Don't miss the good in the bad. Trials can be negative or positive, depending on how you use them. Type A people expect life to run on their schedule, but tribulation has its own agenda and pace, and patience is the only antidote. 'Don't be lazy in showing your devotion. Use your energy to serve the Lord.' (Romans 12:11 GWT) The director of a big company confirms that engineers who retire without a plan to stay busy often die within 16 months. By not staying involved in life you are subconsciously giving yourself permission to die. Fred Smith's philosophy was: <i>you can't let up, and keep up</i>. Paul said, 'If I continue to live...my work will produce more results.' (Philippians 1:22 GWT) And the same is true for you too.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['They will still bear fruit in old age...' Psalm 92:14 NIV<br /><br /><p>Have you noticed that no matter how old certain people get, they never lose their attractiveness? It just moves from their face to their heart. Today, you get the impression that a person's usefulness ends at 65 or 70. What nonsense! What a waste of potential! Picasso produced some of his greatest works at 90. Rubinstein gave one of his greatest recitals at 89. Marjorie Stoneham Douglas, who's credited with saving the Florida Everglades, was still fighting for the cause at 100. Read your Bible: 'Moses was 120 years old when he died; his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.' (Deuteronomy 34:7 KJV) '...the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning...' (Job 42:12 NKJV) Noah built the ark when he was 500, went into it for a while, then came out and started the world all over again. 'It ain't over till God says it's over', and if He 'ain't said so' live every moment He gives you to the fullest! 'The older the violin, the sweeter the tune', so pick up your bow and make some music. When someone told the 89-year-old poet Dorothy Duncan that she had lived a 'full life' she replied sharply, 'Don't past tense me!' If you're not too old to learn and you haven't outlived your enthusiasm, you can 'still bear fruit in old age'. It's up to you. If you can breathe, pray! If you can speak, encourage others! If you can recall, share your wisdom. Remember creation? It's wonderful what God can do in just one day. So give Him all the days you have left. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['[Your] steps...are ordered by the Lord...' Psalm 37:23 NKJV<br /><br /><p>What should you do when doors you thought God had opened suddenly slam shut? You're thinking, 'Lord, I did all the right things. Why is this happening?' Be at peace, God is <i>still</i> directing your steps. When your hopes seem crushed and your plans have altered, rely on His superior wisdom and unfailing love. God has already planned your life from beginning to end, so trust Him to work things out for your good (Isaiah 46:10-11). If you give it a little more time, your pain will turn to praise as you realise that He just closed a lesser door to open a greater one. Timing is so important! As you begin to understand God's timing you'll be better able to cooperate with Him. When you don't know, learn to wait with confidence on the One who does. The problem most of us have is that we attempt to take the lead role in our relationship with God and it doesn't work. God has that role, and He won't give it to us! He gives instructions and we're supposed to follow, even when we don't like or understand the way He takes us. 'Why does it take God so long to do things?' you ask. Because unanswered questions are there to develop trust. When you don't know, you have to trust the One who does, and that keeps you growing in faith. God has a definite plan and time, and while He's getting you ready He keeps you in His waiting room. If that's where you are today, remember, it's only as you reach new levels of maturity that God releases new levels of blessing into your life.</p>

<alias><![CDATA[for-things-to-go-well]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...that it might go well with [you]...' Deuteronomy 5:29 NIV<br /><br /><p>When God tells you to do something that seems difficult or unpleasant, He's not trying to make your life hard or put you in a straitjacket. Often He's just getting you to a place where He can bless you. 'Oh, that...[they]...would...fear me and keep all my commands always, so that it might go well with them.' Anything God asks you to do carries this thought with it: 'That it might go well with [you].' Hopefully, that will help you to start looking at things differently. Living in peace, instead of always going to pieces, is easier when you learn to respond to God <i>immediately.</i> Don't hesitate. Don't negotiate. Don't rationalise. And whatever you do, don't run. The only thing that's worse than running away from God is living with the painful aftermath. Your disobedience can take you all the way to the bottom. If you doubt that, stop and read the story of Jonah. The prophet Samuel said, 'To obey is better than sacrifice...' (1 Samuel 15:22 NIV) The truth is, sometimes you'll have to sacrifice certain things in order to obey God. But it's better to do that than to ignore His voice, live stressed out, forfeit His blessing, and end up getting nowhere. Sometimes God will require things of you that He doesn't seem to require of others, that He won't explain and you can't understand, and that when you've obeyed them, you won't immediately see the benefits. But if you're convinced that He loves you and has a plan for your life, you'll surrender to Him in trust, knowing that in the end it will 'go well with [you]'.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Abraham...was called God's friend.' James 2:23 NIV<br /><br /><p>After losing everything he held dear, Job looked back and longed for the days when God's friendship 'was felt in [his] home...[his] children were around...the days when [he was] honoured...' (Job 29:4-7 NLT) Maybe you can remember days like that in your own life. We've been conditioned to think of friendship in terms of the benefits it confers, but being God's friend comes at a price. As Rebecca Barlow Jordan points out, it 'costs...time, selflessness, thoughtfulness...absolute trust-and very often suffering. Those who are intimately close, feel the hurts and joys of the ones they love more than anyone else... True intimacy means a death to our own selfish desires.' Abraham was called God's friend, but the friendship came at a price. We read, '[Abraham] believed God' (Genesis 15:6 TLB) when He asked him to leave his home, set aside any preconceived notions of how his life would go and move to a strange land. Aged 99, '[Abraham] believed God' would still make good on His promise of a son and heir. Then Isaac was born and God upped the ante by asking his 'friend' to make the supreme sacrifice: to do something He demanded from nobody else in Scripture-except Himself. The Bible says, 'By faith Abraham...offered Isaac as a sacrifice...even though God had said...through Isaac...your offspring will be reckoned.' (Hebrews 11:17-18 NIV) Then just as Abraham was preparing to plunge the knife, in an act foreshadowing the death of His Son, God honoured Abraham's faith and provided a substitute. When you decide to walk with Jesus, the One Who calls us 'friends', the journey is rough at times, but His friendship will never fail you.</p>

<title><![CDATA[A seamless robe]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[a-seamless-robe]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['His robe...was seamless, woven in one piece from [the] top.' John 19:23 NLT<br /><br /><p>The Bible doesn't say much about what Jesus wore-with a notable exception. John tells us that at Calvary 'They...took His robe...it was seamless, woven in one piece from [the] top.' (John 19:23 NLT) It was traditional for Jewish mothers to make these garments as gifts for their sons who were leaving home. So while we don't know if Mary actually made Jesus' robe, it was likely a cherished possession. It's also significant because throughout the Bible clothes symbolise behaviour and character. Peter writes about being 'clothed with humility' (1 Peter 5:5 NKJV); Paul says, 'Put on [Christlikeness] like...new clothes' (Galatians 3:27 NLT); and David tells us that evil people are clothed 'with cursing'. (Psalm 109:18 NKJV) </p>
<p>Like His robe, Jesus' character was seamless, integrated and perfect. The words 'woven from [the] top down' indicate that He was always directed by the mind of God. In fact He said, 'The Son can do nothing...only what He sees the Father doing.' (John 5:19 NRS) But when Jesus was crucified He set aside His seamless robe, 'changed places with us' (Galatians 3:13 NCV), and put on robes of sin that had <i>our</i> names on them. He died like a common criminal for sins He didn't commit so that we could wear the garments of His righteousness. So that sinners like us, coming to the cross, could leave wearing the 'coat of His...love' (Isaiah 59:17 NCV), the belt of 'goodness and fairness' (Isaiah 11:5 NCV), and the 'garments of salvation'. (Isaiah 61:10 NIV) </p>
<p>Think: not only did Jesus prepare a place in Heaven for us, He made sure we'd be properly dressed for the occasion.</p>

<title><![CDATA[According to Fred Smith (2)]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[according-to-fred-smith-2]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ.' 1 Corinthians 11:1 NIV<br /><br /><p>Here are some more Scriptures Brenda Smith learned from her dad: '...a real friend will be more loyal than a brother...' (Proverbs 18:24 NCV) When Fred was initially hospitalised, a host of well-wishers came by to visit, but eventually dropped off when they didn't know what to say. It was friends who stood by them over the long haul who sustained them. 'The Lord sees the good people and listens to their prayers.' (Psalm 34:15 NCV) The Psalmist said, 'I waited patiently for the Lord; He turned to me and heard my cry...He set my feet on a rock and gave me a firm place to stand.' (Psalm 40:1-2 NIV) Fred Smith said, 'Many nights I lay awake unable to move or sleep, but...when I was tempted to lose hope, prayer renewed my strength.' A psychiatrist who interviewed aspiring astronauts reported that, faced with total isolation, many candidates became frustrated, whereas those who knew how to pray and sense God's presence had fewer problems. Prayer works when all else fails-but don't wait till things reach that stage. 'When you are old...I will take care of you...' (Isaiah 46:4 NCV) Someone said, 'Old age ain't for sissies.' While you are getting older physically, you don't have to get old in your outlook. We live in a 'disposable' culture that dismisses senior citizens as set in their ways and out of touch. Fred Smith proved otherwise. He demonstrated that while aging isn't convenient or comfortable, it can be productive. By focusing on the 'can do's' instead of the 'used to do's', you not only follow the example of Christ, you also create a blueprint for the next generation. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...they made Him a supper; Martha served...Lazarus...sat at the table with Him.' John 12:2 NKJV<br /><br /><p>After Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead, we read: 'a dinner was given in Jesus' honour.' (John 12:2 NIV) Martha served, Mary sat listening to what Jesus had to say, and Lazarus talked to the guests. So, there's room at God's table for all kinds of people. Let's take a closer look at Martha. Marthas are generally in the background with their sleeves rolled up, making sure everybody's fed and watered. They rarely seek the spotlight, and often we don't appreciate them until they're missing. The problem with Marthas is that they're inclined to make the mission more important than the Master. They need to remember that worship is also service. Marys tend to forget there are bills to be paid and meals to be cooked. Sometimes they act so heavenly-minded, they're no earthly use. They need to realise that service is worship too. But we need Marys; they bring passion to our worship, and you can always count on them to intercede with God on behalf of others. '...they flocked to see...the man Jesus had raised from the dead...because of him...many...believed in Jesus.' (John 12:9-11 NLT) Lazarus had a story so amazing that those who heard it became instant converts. He reminds us that we each have a story to share about God's grace and mercy. When was the last time you shared yours?So, if you're a Martha, God sees your labour of love. If you're a Mary, He delights in your worship. If you're a Lazarus, He promises to honour your testimony. There's a place at the table for all of us!</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['You, Lord, give perfect peace to those who keep their purpose firm...' Isaiah 26:3 GNT<br /><br /><p>Your life is like a camera; you've got to focus it correctly to get the right results. Having the right focus can bring four results. First, it simplifies things. When you're not clear as to your purpose, you try to do too much-and that causes stress, inner conflict and confusion. You have only enough time and energy to do God's will. Not getting everything done may be an indicator that you're doing far more than God ever intended. Focus leads to a simpler lifestyle and a saner schedule. Only when you keep your focus can you keep your peace: 'You, Lord, give perfect peace to those who keep their purpose firm.' Secondly, it gives you direction. If you want your life to have impact, consult God, and then do what He tells you. Don't confuse activity with productivity. Diffused light has limited impact, but when light's focused like a laser it can cut through steel. Thirdly, it energises you. It's meaningless work, more than overwork, that wears you down. George Bernard Shaw wrote, 'This is the true joy of life: being used up for a purpose recognised by yourself as a mighty one...being a force of nature instead of a selfish little clot of ailments and grievances, complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy.' Finally, it determines your legacy. When people recall your name, what will they associate with it? 'A good name is more desirable than great riches; to be esteemed is better than silver or gold.' (Proverbs 22:1 NIV) Ultimately, what matters isn't what others say about you, but what God says. So focus on the end game.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['He will...oppress the...people of the Most High...' Daniel 7:25 NLT<br /><br /><p>Satan uses two strategies. First, 'he will defy the Most High.' Satan will always attack God's plan, God's principles and God's people, so be on guard! Secondly, 'he will...oppress the...people of the Most High.' Weariness is a weapon Satan will use against you. When you're worn out, you're vulnerable. At that point temptation can lead to compromise, compromise to indulgence and indulgence to defeat. '...make no provision for the flesh.' (Romans 13:14 NKJV) Don't give Satan an inch or he will take a mile. Your mind is where the real attack takes place. The Bible warns you to be careful, lest you become 'wearied and faint in your minds.' (Hebrews 12:3 KJV) Satan will wear you down in order to wipe you out, so you must take time to replenish your strength in God's presence. It's easy to get caught up in the work of the Lord, and not spend time with the Lord of the work. Jesus said, 'Come to me, all...who are tired and have heavy loads, and I will give you rest. My teachings and learn from Me...I am gentle and humble in spirit, and you will find rest for your lives. The teaching...I ask you to accept is easy; the load I give you to carry is light.' (Matthew 11:28-30 NCV) When you commit yourself to doing God's will, God's way, in God's strength, you don't wear out. You're fulfilled, you stay in balance, and you overcome the stress and anxiety of this world. And that's how God wants you to live.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be strong and of good courage...' Deuteronomy 31:6 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Your words and attitudes have a powerful effect on other people. The woman caught in adultery is a case in point. Observe how the Pharisees handled her: 'In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women.' (John 8:5 NIV) How different Jesus' attitude was! Looking at her with compassion, He said, 'Neither do I condemn you... Go now and leave your life of sin.' (v11) Lifted, redeemed, empowered-you can't help but believe she spent the rest of her days trying to live up to Christ's view of her. The mandate to 'encourage one another' and 'build each other up' is woven throughout the New Testament. <i>All</i> of us need reassurance and appreciation. So why do we sometimes pocket the praise we should pass on to others, or sidestep the practical help we could offer to open the way for them to succeed? Sometimes it's simply because we're lazy or selfish or we fall into the habit of taking people for granted. Sometimes it's just easier to find fault. We underestimate the impact our words and attitudes can have on another person, or we assume our approval is obvious. Are we afraid our praise might be a stumbling block, causing pride in them? Jesus didn't fear that when He hailed Nathanael, 'Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is nothing false.' (John 1:47 NIV) What a compliment! The truth is, more people die of broken hearts than swelled heads. So ask God today for an opportunity to offer genuine praise to someone in your life. Ask Him to use you to come alongside them, and encourage them towards their goal. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...for this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world...' John 18:37 NIV<br /><br /><p>Jesus knew exactly why He lived: 'For this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth.' That's what He thought about, prayed about, planned for, worked towards, sacrificed for, died and rose again for, and finally accomplished. By fulfilling His destiny He changed the world for ever. So, do you know your destiny? What are you doing to achieve it? 'We are...created...to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.' (Ephesians 2:10 NIV) Does that sound like a life of aimless wandering with no known destination? The Bible says, 'A man's heart plans his way, but the Lord directs his steps.' (Proverbs 16:9 NKJV) Plan well, but always stay open to God's direction. '...All the days ordained for me were written in Your book before one of them came to be.' (Psalm 139:16 NIV) God's plan for your life was set before you were a twinkle in your parents' eyes! If you fail to follow His path you'll miss His best for your life. The Bible is full of examples of people who crashed and burned at some point. King Saul is a great example. Recalling it, David his successor prayed first, 'I desire to do Your will...' (Psalm 40:8 NIV) Your desires are the driving force in life, so make sure they're in harmony with God. Secondly he prayed, 'Teach me to do Your will...' (Psalm 143:10 NIV) When it comes to doing God's will, the Psalmist acknowledged he needed God's help. You do too. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...that I may finish my race with joy...' Acts 20:24 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Imagine your life is over and you're standing in front of a big DVD player. God inserts a disc with your name on it labelled: 'What might have been'. It details everything He wanted to accomplish through you: how He wanted to bless you financially, but you were afraid to sow into His Kingdom and be generous with others; how He wanted to use your gifts, but you lacked the discipline to develop them and the courage to use them; how He gave you great relationships, but you weren't truthful and loving enough to maintain them; how He longed to reproduce in you the character of Christ, but you refused to deal with your sin, resist temptation, and pursue spiritual growth. John Greenleaf Whittier said, 'Of all sad words of tongue or pen, the saddest are these-it might have been.' But there's a bright side. As long as you're still breathing, you can close the gap between what is and what can be. So stop and ask yourself, 'What can I do now to live without regrets later?' Here's what: start renewing your mind each day with God's Word instead of filling it with junk. Use your talents and your treasures to build His Kingdom instead of your own. If you do, you'll discover that God gives '...seed to the sower...' (2 Corinthians 9:10 NIV) The more seed you sow, the more seed God will give you. And how about making time to disciple somebody? That way your legacy will be greater than your lifespan. It's not too late to become the person you might have been-if you're willing to start today.</p>

<title><![CDATA[How to Avoid Burnout]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[how-to-avoid-burnout]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...the bush burned...yet was not consumed.' Exodus 3:2 AMP<br /><br /><p>Remember the story of the burning bush? It burned, but it didn't burn out. Some people who once burned for God have burned out. Loyal workers in the church for years, suddenly they vanish. Herbert J. Freudenberger, a psychologist, describes burnout as 'fatigue brought about by devotion to a cause that failed to produce the expected reward'. So how can you avoid burnout? First, seek God's input. 'If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault...' (James 1:5 NIV) God is an expert; consult Him. Secondly, realign your priorities. Too many irons in the fire mean none of them gets adequate attention. Learn to say no. Your family will appreciate it, even if others don't. Thirdly, practise the art of thanksgiving. Freudenberger says, 'Get into the habit of noticing-and nurturing-the unspectacular good things that happen to you.' Next, learn the art of physical relaxation. Take ten or twenty minutes at the end of the day to sit in a comfortable chair and enjoy a good stretch. Coax your body and mind to relax. Imagine yourself basking on a warm beach. How about exercising? It's one of the best antibiotics for burnout. But pick what works for you, not what stresses you. You could develop your own relief devices; take a walk; read a good book; try a little creative loafing. As James Thurber quipped, 'It's better to have loafed and lost, than never to have loafed at all.' Finally, find someone to share with. Shutting yourself off increases the problem rather than solving it. Find someone you trust to talk with.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be strong and of good courage...' Deuteronomy 31:6 NKJV<br /><br />
<p>Over and over in Scripture God says things like, 'Be strong and of good courage, do not...be afraid...for the Lord...goes with you.' (Deuteronomy 31:6 NKJV) Why? To bring out the best in us! The history books are full of stories of gifted people whose talents were overlooked until someone believed in them. Einstein was four years old before he could speak. Isaac Newton did poorly in primary school. A newspaper editor fired Walt Disney because he had 'no good ideas'. Tolstoy dropped out of university. There's a lesson here: people develop at different rates. To motivate them you must always be on the outlook for hidden capacities. Your <em>words</em> create an environment in which people not only discover their gifts, but also develop and excel in them. John Erskine, Professor of English at Colombia University, was an educator, concert pianist, author of 60 books, president of the Juilliard School of Music, and a popular and witty lecturer. Writing about that remarkable career, his wife Helen attributed it to his 'defiant optimism'. 'He was a good teacher,' she said, 'because of his own excitement for learning and his trust in the future.' He would say to her, 'Let's tell our young people that the best books are yet to be written; the best paintings have not yet been painted; the best governments are yet to be formed; the best is yet to be done by them.' Within every human being there is a God-given drive to achieve something. If you tap into that drive and demonstrate that you believe in their future, they'll do almost anything to live up to your expectations.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be strong and of good courage...' Deuteronomy 31:6 NKJV<br /><br /><p>In the musical <i>My Fair Lady</i>, Eliza Doolittle, a common flower girl, becomes an elegant lady who mixes with England's high society. How did it happen? Because Henry Higgins, the eminent linguistics professor, taught her to act like a lady-and she began living up to his expectations. Alan Loy McGinnis writes, 'I was once waiting to speak at a sales conference where the year's awards were being given. One woman, who'd performed spectacularly and made an extraordinary amount of money, gave all the credit to her sales manager. As she stood before a crowd of 3000 people, clutching the award for best producer of the year, she recalled the slump she'd been in for two years previously. The future looked so bleak that she was ready to resign, and had even called her supervisor several times to quit. But the manager kept persuading her that she hadn't tried long enough, that she would not have been hired if there had not been unusual potential in her. Her voice cracked as she related the story. Then she made this insightful remark: For all those months when I wanted to quit and didn't think I had any future, Joan believed in me more than I believed in myself. She wanted me to succeed even more than I did.' One of the attributes of true Christian character is a willingness to encourage and lift people: 'I am the Lord, your God, who takes hold of your right hand and says to you, Do not fear; I will help you.' (Isaiah 41:13 NIV) So, in your dealings with others, are you problem-focused or possibility-focused?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be strong and of good courage...' Deuteronomy 31:6 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Anne Sullivan, teacher of Helen Keller, tried again and again to teach her the concept of words. The gifted tutor worked tirelessly to draw out of Helen the treasures buried deep inside her. She literally 'willed' Helen to succeed. Watching this relationship in the powerful play <i>The Miracle Worker</i>, you see Helen begin to blossom and develop gifts that would inspire the world for generations to come. Understand this: God uses the encouraging words, actions and attitudes we direct at each other to strengthen our inner resolve to succeed. But to be effective, your praise should be <i>immediate</i>,<i> specific and genuine.</i> Dr William Mayo, co-founder of the famous Mayo Clinic, used praise to encourage young doctors. One of them said, 'You'd read a paper at a staff meeting and afterwards he'd see you in the lift or the hall, and would shake your hand and put his hand on your shoulder with a quiet Good work, and a straight, warm look that made you think he meant it. Or perhaps a day or two later you'd get a note from him, just a short one, saying something like, Dear ________, I learned more about _________ from that paper of yours the other night than I ever knew before. It was a good job. Believe me, a fellow prized those notes.' Praise, practical help, encouragement-all of these flow out of us naturally and genuinely when we begin to see, as Anne Sullivan saw, the untapped potential buried inside each individual. That's why the Bible says, 'Let everything you say be...helpful, so that your words will be an encouragement to those who hear them.' (Ephesians 4:29 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Do not call me Naomi; call me Mara...' Ruth 1:20 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Learn to build your life around your <i>person</i>, not your <i>role</i>, otherwise when your role changes you'll lose your sense of worth. Being a good mother is a noble calling. It's also a self-sacrificing job. But when your children leave home and those demands are over, it's easy to feel like Naomi did. Her name meant <i>Pleasant</i>. But after her two sons died she asked to be called Mara, which means <i>bitterness</i>. Don't allow changing times to change who you are, or to make you stop dreaming and give up hope. God still had a lot for Naomi to do. In the future she would mentor Ruth, who would give birth to a son who was destined to grow up and become part of the lineage of King David and our blessed Lord. What an honour! When your role changes, remember that your life's not over. See your own worth as a person, discover your next assignment, gather up your assets and keep on living and giving. Don't develop a 'Mara mentality'. She allowed herself to become cynical when her circumstances changed; don't let that happen to you! Discouragement often comes when we feel like we've seen it all, heard it all, done it all, and most of it was bad. No matter how old you are, you can never say you've seen it all. God can do 'exceeding abundantly above all that [you] ask or think...' (Ephesians 3:20) You don't know what God will do with your life before it's over. He has a way of saving the best for last.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint...' Genesis 32:25 KJV<br /><br /><p>God uses people such as Jacob who, spiritually speaking, walk with a limp. After years of wrestling with stubborn issues, they've been radically changed by God's power; now they're able to minister to those they couldn't have reached before. God also uses people such as Paul, who said, '...there was given me a thorn in my flesh...to torment me.' (2 Corinthians 12:7 NIV) When Paul asked God to remove this thorn, God said, '...[No,] My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness...' (2 Corinthians 12:9 NKJV) No doubt, that's the last thing Paul wanted to hear. Understand this: God loves to use people who walk with a limp, or who are locked into thorny situations they can't escape. Why? Because when they're blessed they don't become arrogant like some who think they deserve it. They're a little warmer, and a little more willing to reach out and embrace others. Today God is looking for people with enough compassion to ask, 'How are you?' then stop long enough to listen to the answer! When people have been hurt they need extra love and attention. They need to be held a little closer and prayed over a little longer. After all, that's what God did for <i>you</i>; now it's your turn to do it for somebody else. And yes, you'll have to be patient and overcome their reluctance to trust you. Because they feel betrayed and 'used' they struggle with doubts and resentments. But don't give up on them: 'Love never fails...' (1 Corinthians 13:8 NKJV) If you keep loving them, God will use you to bring them healing and hope</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I have commanded a widow...to provide for you.' 1 Kings 17:9 NKJV<br /><br /><p>When famine hit Israel, God said to the prophet Elijah, 'Go to Zarephath...I have commanded a widow there to provide for you.' Observe three things in this story. First, when the need arises, your provision will be in place. That's how God works, so ask Him to tell you where to go and what to do. And when He does, get moving! Secondly, the people God uses will surprise you. Sometimes they're people you would tend to overlook. This penniless widow had 'only a handful of flour...and a little oil...' (1 Kings 17:12 NKJV) That's no problem to God. He doesn't need much to start with in order to do something great, just a willing heart. Why didn't God send Elijah to a wealthy family? Because they didn't need a miracle-she did. When God's work has a need He looks for someone with a seed, stretches their faith, and both the giver and God's work are blessed. Finally, your 'bad time' is often God's opportune moment. This miracle took place in the middle of an economic depression. What seems like the worst possible time for you is when God loves to move. This woman was only one meal away from death; it doesn't get much worse. 'So, she went away and did according to the word of Elijah... she and...her household ate for many days. The bin of flour was not used up, nor did the jar of oil run dry...' (1 Kings 17:15-16 NKJV) The key to her miracle is found in Elijah's words: 'Do not fear...but make me a small cake from it first...' (1 Kings 17:13 NKJV) The Word for you today is this: don't be afraid; put God first and He will meet your need. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...though a righteous man falls seven times, he rises again...' Proverbs 24:16 NIV<br /><br /><p>Why is it that failure destroys some people, yet makes others stronger? The secret perhaps is that they allow failure to become their teacher, and turn their defeats into learning experiences. Wilma Rudolph was the twentieth of 22 children born into an impoverished black family in Tennessee. As a child, she had polio and was forced to wear leg braces until she was nine. At twelve, she tried out for her school's basketball team and failed. For the next year she practised every day until she finally made the team. A college athletics coach spotted her one day and talked her into letting him train her to be a sprinter. Her persistence earned her a scholarship to Tennessee State University where she became a track star. In 1960, she made the US Olympic team. In the 100-metre sprint she had to face Jutta Heine of Germany, the world record holder. But Wilma won-and she did it again in the 200-metre event! Wilma's third race was the 100-metre relay, where she again faced Jutta. Just as the baton was handed to Wilma she dropped it, giving Jutta the lead. But her never-give-up spirit made her pick up the baton and take off in desperate pursuit. She caught the German runner in the last few strides and won the third gold medal-more than any other woman had won at that time. Wilma became a grandmother and travelled the world for children's causes, motivating them with her story. 'I let them know,' she said, 'that they can achieve it, as long as they're willing to work for it.'</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['But even now I know that God will give you whatever you ask..' John 11:22 NLT<br /><br /><p>When their brother Lazarus died, Mary and Martha sent for Jesus. Notice the three tenses of faith at work in this story. First, the past tense. Heartbroken, Martha said to Jesus, '...If You had been here, my brother would not have died.' (John 11:21 NKJV) That's called 'if only' faith. We say things like: 'If only I'd lived in the days of Jesus,' or 'If only I could be prayed for by a certain person.' 'If only' faith plans for a funeral, not a resurrection. Secondly, the future tense<i>.</i> When Jesus told Martha that Lazarus would live again, she replied, '...I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.' (John 11:24 NKJV) This is called 'some day' faith. People who have it tend to sing, 'In the sweet by and by.' With them, everything belongs to the future. But you need to know your rights, your privileges and your authority as a believer in Christ-right now. When you do, your outlook will begin to change. Finally, the present tense. Martha said, 'But even now I know that God will give you whatever you ask...' (John 11:22 NLT) This is 'even now' faith. In spite of all you've been through, God has the power to raise you up again. You may have been divorced; you may have lost your job or your home; you may be struggling with stubborn habits; you may be living with a sense of failure. It doesn't matter. 'Even now', by God's grace and power, you can come out of this experience and live again. You can fulfil your hopes and dreams. All you have to do is pray and invite Jesus into your situation.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...she poured it on Jesus' feet...' John 12:3 NIV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says, 'Mary took...expensive perfume; she poured it on Jesus' feet and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. But one of his disciples...objected, Why wasn't this perfume sold and the money given to the poor?...' (John 12:3-5 NIV) When it came to worship, Mary ignored any feelings of self consciousness and filled the house with the fragrance of her praise. And Jesus accepted it! There's a lesson here. Put aside your preconceived notions, your self-consciousness and concern over what others think, and pour out your heart in worship. Join the Psalmist: '...my lips will glorify You. I will praise You as long as I live, and in Your name I will lift up my hands.' (Psalm 63:3-4 NIV) When people try to intimidate and silence you, don't let them. When they tried it with Jesus, He rebuked them and said, '...if they keep quiet, the stones will cry out.' (Luke 19:40 NIV) You can never worship God too exuberantly, for God knows-even if your critics don't-that the rocks will cry out. Nothing builds intimacy like words of love and appreciation. There will always be a Judas around who'll say, 'What a waste!' When you take time to stand and bathe your soul in the presence of God, they will say, 'What a waste of time; what a waste of effort.' That's because they don't understand two things: what God saved and delivered you from; and that worship is how you enter, how you enjoy, and how you thrive in the presence of God.</p>

<alias><![CDATA[knowing-your-spiritual-gifts]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['All these are the work of...the same Spirit...' 1 Corinthians 12:11 NIV<br /><br /><p>After listing various spiritual gifts, Paul writes, 'All these are the work of...the same Spirit, and He gives them to each one, just as He determines.' You say, 'How do I know what my spiritual gift is?' John MacArthur answers, 'If I walk, live, and am filled with the Spirit, it is not too important for me to understand the definition of my gift. It isn't an academic issue; it's a matter of getting down on your knees and asking the Spirit of God to dominate and control your life. As you yield to Him, the Spirit of God operates through you, and that will be your area of ministry. So the best way to know your gifted area is not to figure it out and then do it, but to walk in the Spirit and then look back and say, So <i>that's</i> what I do. When I was in high school a lady wanted to paint my portrait. I remember that she had a palette in her hand. On the palette she had some primary colours which she squirted out of some tubes. Then she began to mix all those colours together. It was amazing to see the various combinations that came out of those primary colours. Finally she began to paint them on the canvas. This is exactly how spiritual gifts function. The Holy Spirit has a palette. On it are some primary gifts. They are the gifts listed in Scripture. But by the time they are squeezed around there is a mixture. Each one becomes a very unique portrait.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'Let my prayer be...as incense...' Psalm 141:2 NKJV</p>
<p>Noah's ark is a picture of your church. It wasn't a luxury liner; can you imagine spending a year in that ark with all those animals, and just one window? But Noah had only two options-the stink or the storm. So what's the relevance here? That there are no perfect churches! Furthermore, if you found one and joined it, you'd ruin it! We all love to talk about the power of the New Testament church, but what about its problems? They had hypocrites. Remember Ananias and Sapphira? They had financial scandals (Acts 5). They had doctrinal differences that almost split the church down the middle (Acts 15). And they had moral problems. They actually had a man belonging to the Corinthian church who was sleeping with his stepmother (1 Corinthians 5). So what should you do when there's a big stink in your church? First, don't spread it. 'And above all things have fervent love for one another, for love will cover a multitude of sins.' (1 Peter 4:8 NKJV) Secondly, work for reconciliation. '...if someone is caught in a sin, you who are spiritual should restore him gently...' (Galatians 6:1 NIV) Thirdly, pray. Don't be discouraged when 'flesh acts like flesh'. And don't be part of the problem by being immature; instead, be part of the solution. The Psalmist said, 'Let my prayer be set before You as incense.' When problems arise in your church, you should pray, walk according to God's Word, and believe Him to bring good out of the situation.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['As soon as they began singing...' 2 Chronicles 20:22 CEV<br /><br />
<p>Here's a simple but effective formula for handling a spiritual slump. Praise your way out! David starts Psalm 22 by asking, 'God, why have You forsaken me?' and goes on, '...You...dwell...[where]...praises...[are offered].' (Psalm 22:3 AMP) You won't always feel like praising God-that's why it's called '...the sacrifice of praise...' (Hebrews 13:15 NKJV) But when you're in a slump you need the discipline of praise more than ever. It brings a sense of God's power and presence like nothing else does. That's why the Psalmist wrote, 'I will bless the Lord at all times: His praise shall continually be in my mouth.' (Psalm 34:1 NKJV) By praising God in advance for the victory, you open a channel for Him to intervene in your circumstances, hope rises in your soul, and it's impossible to stay down and defeated. And praise fits every personality, so you've no excuse! You can clap and shout (Psalm 47:1), use music and dance (Psalm 150:4), sing psalms, hymns and spiritual songs (Ephesians 5:19), make a joyful noise (Psalm 98:4), lift your hands (Psalm 134:2), be still and silent before God (Psalm 4:4), you can kneel (Psalm 95:6) and you can even be loud! (Psalm 33:3) Your praises thwart the enemy's best-laid plan! When the Israelites were outnumbered, they prayed and God told them the battle was His and that He would do the fighting. Judah (which means 'praise') went out ahead of the army, and 'As soon as they began singing, the Lord confused the enemy...and...they turned against each other'. The minute you start praising God He releases His power to start working on your behalf.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Jacob set up a pillar in the place where He talked with [God]...' Genesis 35:14 NKJV<br /><br />
<p>When you recall God's faithfulness to you it causes hope to rise in your soul. It enables you to face the future with confidence and say, '...He is the faithful God, keeping His covenant of love to a thousand generations of those who...keep His commands.' (Deuteronomy 7:9 NIV) Looking back and remembering is a Scriptural principle that works. 'Jacob set up a pillar in the place where He talked with [God]'; 'Joshua set up twelve stones that had been in the middle of the Jordan...' (Joshua 4:9 NIV); 'Samuel took a stone...set it up...and called [it]...Ebenezer, saying, '...&quot;Thus far the Lord has helped us.&quot;' (1 Samuel 7:12 NKJV) The Bible says, 'No testing has overtaken you that is not common to everyone. God...will not let you be tested beyond your strength, but...will also provide the way out...' (1 Corinthians 10:13 NRS) Going back through Scripture and remembering the ups and downs of God's people and how He consistently came through for them, lends fresh perspective to your own situation and enables you to see a bigger picture. In Psalm 22:2 NCV David starts out saying, 'God...I call to you...but you do not answer.' But as soon as he starts remembering God's faithfulness he does a 180-degree turn around and says, 'Our ancestors trusted you...and you saved them. They called to you for help and...were not disappointed.' (Psalm 22:4-5 NCV) When you're in a spiritual free fall, stop dwelling on yourself and your disappointment and begin to focus on God. '...Not one word has failed of all the good promises He gave...' (1 Kings 8:56 NIV) He's still the same; He hasn't changed.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness...' Galatians 6:1 NAS</p>
<p>Why is restoration necessary? To preserve their life. '...Whoever turns a sinner from the error of his way will save him from death...' (James 5:20 NIV) When someone you love is sinning, they're literally killing themselves. If you care, you won't be able to stand by and watch. Restoration is necessary to preserve the church. Paul writes, '...admonish the unruly...' (1 Thessalonians 5:14 NAS) When sin is tolerated and rationalised, members become angry and leave, and others are wounded. A church's reputation and climate are hurt by those who sin and don't make amends. It's vital to preserve God's reputation. When Nathan spoke to David about his sin with Bathsheba, he said, '...you have made the enemies of the Lord show utter contempt...' (2 Samuel 12:14 NIV) When we condemn in the world what we condone in ourselves, our message falls on deaf ears. So Paul writes, 'If anyone is caught in any trespass, you who are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness.' We are to approach them the right way! We must not confront someone about sin when we have the same problem ourselves. We must approach them with the purpose and expectation of restoring. This isn't a witch hunt, it's a lamb search. It's to bring them back into fellowship, and we must get rid of our 'holier than thou' attitude. Be honest; it's only by God's grace that you're not caught in the same trespass, right? Tell the one you're dealing with that you recognise this. Assure them that whatever the sin, it's not unforgivable. There's a way back to spiritual health.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...we will hold to the truth in love...' Ephesians 4:15 NLT</p>
<p>A teenager who'd just obtained his driver's licence told his parents he was meeting his friends at a restaurant. But this particular restaurant had several locations and his friends were at one 100 km away. They say, 'What you don't expose, will expose you.' Unfortunately, his parents went shopping in that area the same evening. Imagine his thoughts when he stopped at an intersection, looked over, and saw his mum giving him that 'look' parents reserve for the worst offences! We need to set '...forth the truth plainly [so] we commend ourselves to every...conscience in the sight of God.' (2 Corinthians 4:2 NIV); speak the plain, unembellished truth, so people know '...there is nothing written between the lines...' (2 Corinthians 1:13 NLT) There are statements we instinctively disbelieve, like: 'The cheque is in the post... the puppy won't be any trouble... I won't tell anybody.' Then there are '...lies so clever they sound like the truth.' (Ephesians 4:14 NLT) For example, we want to be the good guy, so we leave out information that might put us in a bad light. Or to avoid upsetting somebody we stretch the truth. One Bible teacher writes, 'Solving problems in a relationship is one of the most important skills you'll ever learn. It makes for a successful family life, career, education, and social life. Unless we have these skills we'll never be truly happy. When you have a problem with someone, state it in a gentle, positive way. If you don't start right you'll have little hope of ending right.' So, '...hold to the truth in love'.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'My help comes from the Lord...' Psalm 121:2 NIV</p>
<p>If you desire to do God's will but don't draw on His power, you'll fail in spite of your skill, your connections and your resources. You must develop an increasing sense of dependence on God. Now you can't just sit on the sidelines expecting Him to do everything for you. You've been called to step out in faith, obey His instructions-then trust Him for the right results. God-sufficiency should become your goal, not self-sufficiency! This calls for praying, 'Lord, I'm tempted to do things in my own strength, but I don't like the results. Teach me to strive for excellence, not omnipotence; to maximise my talents and minimise my ego. Remind me that You will never give me an assignment that doesn't require obedience, commitment, and Your enabling grace.' The Psalmist cried, 'My help comes from the Lord.' Think: if He's Lord of every situation and He's promised to help you, then your victory is assured. It's when you think you can do it without Him, or with limited input from Him, that you get into trouble. Jesus said, '...The Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He sees the Father do...' (John 5:19 NKJV) Jesus knew He couldn't do anything apart from the Father, so He never bothered to try. We, on the other hand, quote the verse, '...without Me you can do nothing' (John 15:5 NKJV), then go out and act like it all depends on us. And what happens? We fall flat on our faces. So learn to stop regularly and ask yourself, 'Who am I depending on?' Then answer, 'You, Lord!'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...led by the Spirit of God...' Romans 8:14 NKJV<br /><br /><p>God will help you to be all you can be, but He will never help you to be somebody else. When you try to be somebody else, you lose yourself in the process. God wants us to fit into His plan, not yield to pressure and try to fit into someone else's. It's all right to be different; different is ok! Find out what you're good at, throw yourself into it wholeheartedly and you'll start to experience true joy. Besides, when you try to do what somebody else is good at, you generally fail, right? That's because God hasn't assigned you to do what they are doing, or at least not in the way they're doing it. But that doesn't mean you're not good at anything. Here's an important key: focus on your potential, not your limitations. We all have limitations and we must accept them. That's not a bad thing, it's just a fact of life. Actually, it's wonderful to be different without feeling like there's something wrong with you. Spiritually mature people know that God loves them as they are and has a purpose for their life, so they're not threatened by the abilities and accomplishments of others. They enjoy what other people do, because they enjoy what they themselves do. Paul writes, 'Let us not become...competitive...envying and...jealous of one another.' (Galatians 5:26 AMP) In the end, what matters most is being able to say as Jesus said, 'I have brought You glory on earth by completing the work You gave Me to do.' (John 17:4 NIV) Any time you can say that, you did it right!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['But He knows the way that I take...' Job 23:10 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Are you in a situation you don't know how to handle? Are people giving you conflicting opinions and advice? Are you afraid you'll make the wrong decision? If so, you're in the place where God can speak to you. Here's a prayer for you today: 'Lord, Your Word says that You are &quot;the only wise God&quot; and I am desperately in need of You at this time. I'm in a situation human wisdom can't explain and human ability can't fix. There's only one way out-that's through You! Send the spirit of wisdom and show me which way to go. Send the spirit of revelation to help me understand what I can't figure out, for nobody but You can get me through this. Help me to faithfully obey all You show me to do, and to remember that sometimes the wisdom of this world is foolishness to You. Help me to know the difference between human advice and godly advice, and to choose Your way. I submit this situation to You and commit myself to following You, knowing You've promised to direct my steps. Help me to walk this road with confidence in You; with the courage that comes from knowing I am Yours. Help me to cling to my convictions, yet still love those who misunderstand me. Keep me far from anger and close to Your heart. And though it's an uphill climb, take my hand, light my way and help me to walk on, for in the end I know that all things will work together for my good and Your glory: in Christ's name, Amen.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Elijah was afraid and fled for his life...' 1 Kings 19:3 NLT<br /><br /><p>The Bible says, 'Jezebel...sent this message to Elijah: &quot;You killed my prophets, and now...I am going to kill you&quot;...So Elijah fled for his life.' (1 Kings 19:1-3 TLB) Often the voice of fear comes after you've had a mountain-top experience. Elijah had just called down fire from Heaven on Mount Carmel. Then Jezebel spoke. She didn't use chariots and soldiers; she didn't need to. Her words intimidated him, depressed him and drove him into hiding. Look out! If you listen to the voice of fear you'll be afraid of the next telephone call, the next medical prognosis or the next stock market report. Who are you listening to? Who are you going to believe, God or men? Neither the wind nor the fire nor the earthquake could bring Elijah out of his cave, only the still, small voice of God could (1 Kings 19:11-13). Our fears are often the result of two things: imagination and misunderstanding. Fear causes us to think the worst instead of believing God for the best (2 Corinthians 10:5). '...fear brings with it the thought of punishment...' (1 John 4:18 AMP) When something goes wrong we wonder, 'Is God punishing me for something I've done?' No, fear and faith are present with us every day; the one you choose will rule your life. So when you come up against a fear-producing situation, do these three things: pray for God's wisdom and protection; He promises both; admit your inner struggle-you're not unique, we all battle fear; stand on His Word, for He says, '...I will never leave you nor forsake you.' (Hebrews 13:5 NKJV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Jesus said...&quot;Pick up your mat and walk.&quot;' John 5:8 NIV<br /><br /><p>Jon Walker writes, 'Long ago...I was diagnosed with clinical depression and began the hard work of deep, lasting, in-Jesus recovery. One day Jesus asked me, &quot;Do you want to be healed?&quot; ...It seemed like such a ridiculous question...but I knew what He meant. Was I willing to do the hard work of facing painful situations, uncovering bitterness, and admitting to deep, resentful anger; was I willing to give up stubborn excuses that allowed me to stay the same...seeing my sickness as more secure than my health? Was I willing to...let God be God, and admit that I can't, but He can; or would I insist on...holding myself in a cycle of helplessness and hopelessness? When Jesus asked an invalid of 38 years, &quot;Do you want to be healed?&quot; the question swept...through 2000 years, and into the shadows of my soul... the Great Healer holding out help, acutely aware that we can't, but God can, knowing this to be true because He was walking towards the only way to re-create us whole and healthy...the road to Calvary. Like our own steps of faith, the first step was surely the hardest... this invalid had 38 years of experience telling him his legs wouldn't support him...and no experience trusting Jesus. It took courage, energy and pain to take the first step. Jesus didn't enslave the man; He liberated him, empowering him with choice, and independence from his fears. Paralysed in confusion and fear, the question remains: Do you want to be healed? Will you do what God says? Will you pick up your mat and make godly choices? Will you step into faith and away from fear?' </p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Revive us, and we will call upon Your name.' Psalm 80:18 NKJV<br /><br /><p>AW Tozer gives us four more steps to personal revival that we must take: '(1) Bring your life into accord with such Scriptures as are designed to instruct us in the way of righteousness. An honest man with an open Bible, a pad and a pencil, is sure to find out what is wrong with him very quickly. I recommend that self-examination be made on your knees, rising to obey God's commandments as they are revealed to us. (2) Be serious-minded. You can well afford to see fewer shows on TV. Unless you can break away... every spiritual impression will continue to be lost to your heart. The...world used to go to the movies to escape serious thinking about God. You would not join them there, but you now enjoy spiritual communion with them in your own home. The devil's ideals, moral standards and mental attitudes are being accepted by you without your knowledge. (3) Deliberately narrow your interests. Too many projects use up time and energy without bringing us nearer to God. (4) Have faith in God. Begin to expect. Look up toward the throne where your Advocate sits at the right hand of God. All of Heaven is on your side. God will not disappoint you.' The Psalmist writes, 'Restore us...and we shall be saved!' (Psalm 80:19 NKJV) You say, 'Saved from what?' From ourselves! Saved from the influences that pull us away from God and towards this world. Saved to fulfil the purposes for which we have been redeemed and called into His Kingdom. If you desire it, you can have a personal revival. </p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Revive us, and we will call upon Your name.' Psalm 80:18 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The Psalmist prayed, 'Revive us, and we will call upon Your name.' Almost a century ago, AW Tozer laid out the steps that lead to personal revival. Some of the language may be outdated, but the principles still work today. First, get thoroughly dissatisfied with yourself. Complacency is the enemy of spiritual progress. A complacent soul is a stagnant soul. Secondly, set your face like a flint towards a sweeping transformation of your life. Timid experimenters are tagged for failure before they start. We must throw our whole soul into our desire for God. Thirdly, put yourself in the way of blessing. It's a mistake to expect God's help to come as a windfall apart from conditions known and met. There are plainly marked paths which lead straight to the green pastures; let us walk in them. To desire revival, for instance, and at the same time neglect prayer and devotions, is to wish one way and walk another. Fourthly, do a thorough job of repenting. Do not hurry to get it over with. Hasty repentance means shallow spiritual experience and lack of certainty in the whole life. Let godly sorrow do its healing work. Until we allow the consciousness of sin to wound us, we will never develop a fear of evil. Finally, make restitution wherever possible. If you owe a debt, pay it, or at least have a frank understanding with your creditor about your intention to pay, so your honesty will be above question. If you have quarrelled with anyone, go as far as you can in an effort to achieve reconciliation. </p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['See, I am doing a new thing...' Isaiah 43:19 NIV<br /><br /><p>Can you imagine Moses' surprise when God talks to him from a burning bush? As doors shut without explanation, Paul is surprised by a man from Macedonia calling to him in a vision: '...come over here and help us.' (Acts 16:9 TLB) Well, He's still the God of surprises who says, 'See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it?' Ah, there's the challenge-our perception. We fail to recognise God at work! Maybe you're saying, 'I've prayed, claimed God's promises, done all I know to do, yet nothing seems to be working for me.' Then try this promise: 'Therefore the Lord will wait, that He may be gracious to you...' (Isaiah 30:18 NKJV) Notice the word 'wait'. God has a plan and a timetable. 'Many are the plans in a man's heart, but it is the Lord's purpose that prevails.' (Proverbs 19:21 NIV) Even when your plans flounder, if your heart's right God will still make things turn out for your good and His glory. When it comes to God's guidance, here are some things you need to know. First, ideas go away, but His direction stays. There's persistence in His leading; that's why time is on your side. Secondly, His direction is impossible to follow without His help. He plans it that way. '...without Me you can do nothing.' (John 15:5 NKJV) Thirdly, His direction usually begins with discomfort. Like 'an eagle that stirs up its nest... The Lord...led him...' (Deuteronomy 32:11-12 NIV) A baby eagle is shocked when its mother forces it out of the nest. But that's when it 'finds its wings'. Think about it! </p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Samson went down...' Judges 14:1 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Samson lost everything for several reasons. First, wrong relationships. When God says 'no' to a relationship He's not being punitive, He's being protective. 'But I feel so good when I'm with them,' you say. God sees where the road leads, you don't! It's better to want what you don't have, than end up with what you can't handle. Secondly, wilful disobedience. Three times we read, 'Samson went down.' And each time he got more entangled with Delilah! So, is this relationship taking you up or down? The poet wrote, 'My old companions fare you well; I will not go with you to hell.' The Bible says that 'Samson went down' to Timnath and married a Philistine girl, breaking God's law. And even though she betrayed him '...the Spirit of the Lord came upon him mightily, and he went down to Ashkelon and killed thirty of their men...' (Judges 14:19 NKJV) Perhaps Samson thought God would excuse him because he was 'special'. No, 'He who is often rebuked, and hardens his neck, will suddenly be destroyed...' (Proverbs 29:1 NKJV) Repent, before you run out of time! Thirdly, misplaced confidence. '[Delilah] said, &quot;The Philistines are upon you, Samson!&quot; So he awoke...and said, &quot;I will go out as before, at other times, and shake myself free!&quot; But he did not know that the Lord had departed from him. Then the Philistines took him and put out his eyes, and brought him down...' (Judges 16:20-21 NKJV) When God's blessing is no longer upon what you're doing, it's time to realise that there could be sin in your life that you must deal with, and that the secret of your strength is in God, not you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I press toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.' Philippians 3:14 NKJV <br /><br /><p>We must never stop asking, 'Is there a better way?' You can't pray for progress and fight change. In 1829, Martin Van Buren, Governor of New York, wrote to President Andrew Jackson cautioning him about the future: 'President Jackson, the canal system of this country is being threatened by the spread of railroads. We must preserve the canals for the following reasons: (1) If canal boats are supplanted by railroads, serious unemployment will result. Captains, cooks, repairmen and lock tenders will be left without jobs, not to mention farmers now employed in growing hay for horses (2) Boat builders would suffer, whip and harness makers would be left destitute (3) Canal boats are absolutely essential to the defence of the United States. In the event of the expected trouble with England, the Erie Canal would be the only means by which we could ever move the supplies so vital to waging modern war. As you may well know, Mr. President, railroad carriages are pulled at the enormous speed of 15 mph (24 km/hr) by engines, which, in addition to endangering life and limb, snort their way through the countryside belching out smoke, setting fire to crops, scaring the livestock and frightening women and children. Surely the Almighty never intended people should travel at such breakneck speed.' Poor Martin-what would he think if he knew we were flying 10000 metres up in the air at 800 km/hr sipping coffee and typing on a laptop? God is the author of all true progress, so we must never stop asking, 'Is there a better way?'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Be quick to listen, slow to speak...' James 1:19 NLT<br /><br /><p>Want to become a good leader? Become a good listener! Here are two stories of what happens when we don't take time to listen. The first is from a young woman hurt by a manager who constantly cut her off: 'We expected he would wait and give us answers to serious questions about our work. Many times he walked off when we were in mid-sentence, having heard nothing.' The next is from a church youth director who was fired: 'After serving the Lord there for two years, I was called into an elders' meeting. They took out a list of all the things I'd done wrong in the past two years. Most of what they said was true, for I was brand new in this work. Then they called for my resignation. What did I learn? (a) not once did anyone care enough to coach or shepherd me (b) I'd no idea or warning that I was doing anything wrong (c) the church leaders never built a relationship with their staff.' Why is it so hard for some leaders to listen? Because leaders love to talk, and as they gain more authority there is the danger to think they have less reason to listen. Leaders by their very nature tend to be removed from the frontlines of battle. To win, they must constantly listen to those who are in the trenches and rely on that information to make wise decisions. Before Ezekiel was qualified to prophesy or lead God's people, he wrote: '...I sat among them for seven days-overwhelmed. At the end of seven days the Word of the Lord came to me.' (Ezekiel 3:15-16 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Seek the Kingdom of God above all else...' Matthew 6:33 NLT<br /><br /><p>As you read the following nine qualities, ask yourself, 'Are these things evident in my life today? Am I developing these fruits so that I may be entrusted with greater responsibility for the advancement of God's Kingdom?' (1) <i>merciful and grace-giving</i>. 'God blesses those who are merciful...' 'Stop judging others, and you will not be judged.' (Matthew 5:7; 7:1 NLT) (2) <i>reconciliatory</i>. 'If...a friend has something against you...go and apologise and be reconciled to him...' (Matthew 5:23-24 TLB) (3) <i>teachable</i>. 'Anyone who listens to My teaching and obeys Me is wise...' (Matthew 7:24 NLT) (4) <i>courageous</i>. 'Look, I am sending you out as sheep among wolves...don't be afraid...' (Matthew 10:16;26 NLT) (5) <i>submitted</i>. 'Anyone who does the will of My Father in Heaven is My brother and sister and mother!' (Matthew 12:50 NLT) (6) <i>surrendered</i>. 'If any of you wants to be My follower, you must put aside your selfish ambition, shoulder your cross, and follow Me.' (Matthew 16:24 NLT) (7) <i>repentant</i>. '...unless you turn from your sins and become as little children, you will never get into the Kingdom of Heaven.' (Matthew 18:3 NLT) (8) <i>humble</i>. 'But those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.' (Matthew 23:12 NLT) (9) <i>servant-minded</i>. 'But among you it should be quite different. Whoever wants to be a leader among you must be your servant.' (Matthew 20:26 NLT) If you're willing to make Jesus Lord of your life, make His Word the last word on all issues, and seek the fullness of His Spirit-you can live this lifestyle too!</p>
