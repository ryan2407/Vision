‘He got into one of the boats…belonging to Simon…’ Luke 5:3 NIV
When Jesus Comes on Board
One day Jesus ‘…saw at the water’s edge two boats, left there by the fishermen, who were 
washing their nets. He got into one of the boats…belonging to Simon, and asked him to put out a 
little from shore. Then He sat down and taught the people from the boat. When He had finished 
speaking, He said to Simon, “Put out into deep water, and let down the nets for a catch.” Simon 
answered, “Master, we’ve worked hard all night and haven’t caught anything. But because You 
say so, I will let down the nets.” When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish 
that their nets began to break.’ (Luke 5:2–6 NIV) Are you sitting today where Peter sat? Your 
outlook is bleak, your nets are empty, you’ve tried everything you know and you’re ready to give 
up? It happens; you get to the place where you simply stop expecting anything good. You’ve 
experienced too many disappointments and you’re afraid to dream, reach, stretch or broaden 
your horizons. Jesus knows how hard you’ve tried and today He’s inviting you to try again—this 
time with Him. Even though you’re wrestling with depression and tormenting memories, 
unemployment, addiction, financial failure or sickness, the Lord of new beginnings wants to come 
on board. If you listen to Him, He will show you what to do. Now, what He says may not initially 
make sense to you. But if you’re willing to respond like Peter—‘Because You say so, I will’—you’re 
on the threshold of a miracle. Today, listen and obey the words of Jesus and watch how your 
situation changes.

SUNDAY AUGUST 2
‘…you will be able to discern what is best…’ Philippians 1:10 NIV
Don’t Go by Your Feelings
God gave you feelings, and you should never be ashamed of them. They can alert you to danger 
and give you insight into various situations. God actually uses our feelings to draw us closer to Him 
and highlight areas in our lives that need to be submitted to His Holy Spirit. But feelings are 
subjective; you can’t always trust them. Jon Walker says: ‘When old feelings creep back in we feel 
fearful, ashamed, hopeless, not good enough, unlovable, victimised, helpless and resentful… An 
event can trigger these reactions…ending a relationship, stress, problems at work and at home, 
times of change or illness…and sometimes these feelings return for no reason.’ So you must test 
your feelings, otherwise you’ll end up allowing ‘…your feelings [to] get out of control.’ (Colossians 
3:5 NIV) It can be disastrous to act on what you see, hear and feel. Instead of reacting to feelings, 
you must learn to act on what God’s Word says. That’s the gold standard, and it never changes! For 
instance, even if you feel like you can walk on water, you can only do it if God has called you to 
step out of the boat. Paul says, ‘…my prayer [is] that [you]…abound…in knowledge 
and…insight…that you may be able to discern what is best…’ (Philippians 1:9–10 NIV) Bottom line: 
don’t rely on your feelings, rely on the knowledge and truth of God’s Word. You may feel 
worthless, but God says, ‘…You are precious to Me …I love you.’ (Isaiah 43:4 NLT) You may feel like 
a failure, but God says, ‘There is…no condemnation for those…in Christ.’ (Romans 8:1 NIV)

MONDAY AUGUST 3
‘These all wait for You, that You may give them their food in due season.’ Psalm 104:27 NKJV
It All Belongs to God (1)
We fear losing our job, our health insurance and our retirement benefits, so we amass 
possessions, thinking the more we have, the safer we are. 
Jesus told a parable of one such person: ‘...“The land of a rich man produced plentifully, and he 
thought to himself, ‘What shall I do, for I have nowhere to store my crops?’ And he said, ‘I will do 
this: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my 
goods. (Luke 12:16-18 ESV) Can’t you hear the presumption in those words? Just like us stockpiling 
pensions, possessions and property, he accumulated and stacked until his barns of belongings 
were overflowing. Then he said, “...Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years; relax, eat, 
drink, be merry.” (Luke 12:19 ESV) The Bible says, ‘Command those who are rich…not to…trust in 
uncertain riches but in the living God…’ (1 Timothy 6:17 NKJV) Riches don’t bring security. The more 
you have, the more you have to lose! It’s ironic; the more you accumulate the more protective you 
become, and the greater your concern that it could all be swept away by events you can’t control. 
That’s not how God intended you to live. He wants you to save and He wants you to sow. And 
when you’ve done all that wisdom demands, to trust in nothing but Him. The Psalmist said, 
‘…Living things…small and great…all wait for You, that You may give them their food in due 
season.’ (Psalm 104:25–27 NKJV) And He does. God’s the great giver, absolutely generous and 
utterly dependable. The resounding message of Scripture is clear: God owns it all. God shares it all. 
So place your trust in Him—not in belongings.

TUESDAY AUGUST 4
‘When I fed them, they were satisfied; when they were satisfied, they became proud; then they 
forgot Me.’ Hosea 13:6 NIV
It All Belongs to God (2)
Paul writes: ‘Command those who are rich in this present age not to be haughty, nor to trust in 
uncertain riches but in the living God, Who gives us richly all things to enjoy. Let them do good, that 
they be rich in good works, ready to give, willing to share.’ (1 Timothy 6:17–18 NKJV) Are you ‘rich 
in this present age’? Almost half the world—more than three billion people—lives on less than $4 a 
day. So if your income is more than that, you’re rich by comparison. But prosperity comes with a 
warning: don’t be arrogant. ‘Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall.’ (Proverbs 
16:18 NIV) The Scottish historian Thomas Carlyle wrote, ‘Adversity is sometimes hard upon a man. 
But for one man who can stand prosperity, there are a hundred that will stand adversity.’ God 
wants you to enjoy things without becoming obsessed with them. Accumulating possessions has a 
way of eclipsing God, no matter how meagre they may be. There’s a predictable progression from 
poverty to pride. The poor man prays and works; God hears and blesses. The humble man 
becomes rich and forgets God. The faithful poor man becomes the proud rich man. As God said 
through Hosea, ‘When I fed them, they were satisfied; when they were satisfied, they became 
proud; then they forgot Me.’ How can you avoid this trap? Remember that everything you own 
comes from God, and He’s the source of everything you’ll need in the future. So live with a 
grateful heart, and in total dependence on Him.

WEDNESDAY AUGUST 5
‘“The silver is Mine and the gold”…declares the Lord…’ Haggai 2:8 NIV 
It All Belongs to God (3)
How would you describe someone who built a house without giving any forethought to the 
foundation? Foolish! Likewise, God says, don’t put your trust in ‘uncertain riches’ (1 Timothy 6:17 
NKJV). Between 1948 and 2001 the U.S. economy endured ten recessions, each averaging one 
year, and resulting in the loss of billions of dollars. That means every five years or so, the economy 
dumps its suitors and starts all over again. What word would you use to describe a husband who 
philandered his way through nine different wives over fifty years? Fickle? And how would you 
describe wife number ten? Foolish? Abraham was one of the richest men of his generation, and so 
was Job. The New Testament church had some rich people in it. The Bible says, ‘…all who were 
possessors of lands or houses sold them …brought the proceeds…and laid them at the apostles’ 
feet…’ (Acts 4:34–35 NKJV) God wants you to be blessed financially so you can bless His work. But 
the reason He doesn’t give some of us more money is because He knows we don’t have the 
maturity to handle it. It would be our undoing. And to those He does entrust with money, He says, 
‘Let them do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to give, willing to share.’ (1 Timothy 6:18 
NKJV) You don’t really own anything; you’re just a steward. ‘“The silver is Mine and the gold is 
Mine,” declares the Lord.’ The truth is, you’ll never be financially secure until you’re willing to say, 
‘Yes!’ to God in whatever He asks you to do, knowing that He will always take care of you. Always!

THURSDAY AUGUST 6
‘To the Lord your God belong the heavens…the earth and everything in it.’ Deuteronomy 10:14 NIV 
It All Belongs to God (4)
When it comes to our money, we like to think, ‘I earned it, so it’s mine.’ But that’s where you’re 
dead wrong! The Bible says: ‘To the Lord your God belong the heavens…the earth and everything in 
it.’ (Deuteronomy 10:14 NIV) ‘Yours, O Lord, is the greatness…the power… the glory…the majesty 
and the splendour, for everything in Heaven and earth is Yours.’ (1 Chronicles 29:11 NIV) ‘“The 
silver…and the gold is Mine,” declares the Lord Almighty.’ (Haggai 2:8 NIV) Riches are like Monopoly 
money; if you’re better than your competition, you end up with the deeds to the most expensive 
properties. But guess what? At the end of the day when the game is over, the participants leave 
the table and all the stuff goes back in the box. And if you were overly aggressive, the other 
players may end up not liking you. Here’s a humbling Scripture: ‘Do not be overawed when others 
grow rich... for they will take nothing with them when they die... Though while they live they count 
themselves blessed— they will join those... who will never again see the light of life. People who 
have wealth but lack understanding are like the beasts that perish.’ (Psalm 49:16–20 NIV) The God 
who owns it all gives it to us for two reasons: (1) To enjoy. (2) To invest into fulfilling His purposes 
on earth. When we live with that attitude, we replace fear with faith in God.

FRIDAY AUGUST 7
‘…in Him we live, and move, and have our being.’ Acts 17:28 NKJV
Ask God
George Washington Carver, an agricultural chemist who discovered three hundred uses for 
peanuts, shared these observations about God: ‘As a very small boy exploring the almost virgin 
woods of the old Carver place, I had the impression someone had just been there ahead of me. 
Things were so orderly, so clean, so harmoniously beautiful. A few years later in these same 
woods…I was practically overwhelmed with the sense of some great presence. Not only had 
someone been there, someone was there…Years later when I read in the Scriptures, “…in Him we 
live, and move, and have our being,” I knew what the writer meant. Never since have I been 
without this consciousness of the Creator speaking to me… the out–doors has been to me more 
and more a great cathedral in which God could be continuously spoken to and heard from… Man, 
who needed a purpose, a mission to keep him alive, had one. He could be…God’s co–worker… My 
purpose alone must be God’s purpose—to increase the welfare and happiness of His people… 
Why, then, should we, who believe in Christ, be so surprised at what God can do with a willing man 
in a laboratory?’ In 1921 Carver spoke before the United States House of Representatives. The 
chairman asked, ‘Dr. Carver, how did you learn all these things?’ He answered, ‘From an old book.’ 
The chairman asked, ‘What book?’ Carver replied, ‘The Bible.’ The chairman enquired, ‘Does the 
Bible talk about peanuts?’ Carver replied, ‘No sir, but it tells about the God who made the peanut. I 
asked Him to show me what to do with the peanut, and He did.’ Do you need a creative idea or 
solution today? Ask God!

SATURDAY AUGUST 8
‘…think about the things that are good…’ Philippians 4:8 NCV
How to Overcome Perfectionism
Be honest: Have you ever met a perfectionist who was truly happy? No, because when things 
must always ‘be a certain way’, life becomes miserable because it’s constantly changing. As soon as 
you solve one problem, another comes along. Instead of dwelling on their blessings and being 
grateful, perfectionists focus on what’s wrong and why they need to fix it. It may be a job they did 
that was less than perfect, a few kilos they need to lose, or even a disorganised wardrobe. Or it 
could be someone else’s imperfections: the way they live their life, how they behave, or the way 
they look. Constantly dwelling on flaws—your own or someone else’s—makes it impossible to be 
grateful. And gratitude is at the core of happiness. Now, let’s be clear; we’re not talking about 
striving to do better. That’s a good thing. We’re talking about obsessing over what’s wrong. 
There’ll always be a better way to do something, but that doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy life the 
way it is right now. So what’s the cure? Catch yourself before you fall into the trap of insisting that 
things should be different from how they are. Stop and remind yourself that, in the absence of 
your judgment, everything will work out just fine. Paul says, ‘…in all things God works for the good 
of those who love Him…’ (Romans 8:28 NIV) Are you getting it? God’s in control; it’s ok for you to 
let go. Instead of focusing on the negative, ‘think about the things that are good and worthy of 
praise.’ (Philippians 4:8 NCV) When you do, you’ll begin to discover how wonderful life is.

SUNDAY AUGUST 9
‘…men shall dream dreams [and]…see visions.’ Joel 2:28 NKJV
The Power of Vision (1)
A boy supposedly once asked Michelangelo why he was working so hard chipping away on the 
block of marble that would become his greatest masterpiece: David. The artist replied, ‘There’s an 
angel inside this rock and I’m setting him free.’ The power of vision enables you to see a potential 
masterpiece in what others overlook or consider worthless. It also helps you discover things within 
yourself you never knew were there. It brings out the best in you. Many of the people God used in 
Scripture looked like losers before they looked like winners. After the disciples fished all night and 
caught nothing, Jesus told them, ‘…Do not be afraid. From now on you will catch men.’ (Luke 5:10 
NKJV) They did, and they ended up: (1) building a church that’s still thriving two thousand years 
later; (2) writing history’s greatest books; (3) having our sons named after them. 
Does that mean you can just dream a dream and God will fulfil it? No. Paul says, ‘…You are not your 
own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honour God…’ (1 Corinthians 6:19–20 NIV) Belonging to 
Christ means you lost the right to take your talents, opportunities and experiences and run off in 
any direction you please. But why would you even want to? What could possibly be more fulfilling 
than God’s purpose for your life? And what could be more tragic than missing it? You can’t wring 
enough meaning out of secular accomplishments to satisfy your soul. The hole you’re trying to fill 
has an eternal dimension only Christ can fill. That’s why you must pray, ‘Lord, show me Your vision 
for my life.’

MONDAY AUGUST 10
‘…acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths.’ Proverbs 3:6 NKJV 
The Power of Vision (2)
Having God’s vision for your life gives you four things: (1) Passion. It makes you wake up in the 
morning and bound out of bed because there’s something out there you love to do; something 
you believe in and are good at; something bigger than you; something you can hardly wait to get 
at. (2) Motivation. Author Richard B. Edler said: ‘Safe living generally makes for regrets later on. We 
are all given talents and dreams. Sometimes the two don’t match. But more often than not we 
compromise both before ever finding out. Later on, we find ourselves looking back longingly to 
that time when we should’ve chased our true dreams and talents for all they’re worth. Don’t be 
pressured into thinking your dreams or talents aren’t prudent. They were never meant to be… 
They were meant to bring joy and fulfilment to your life.’ (3) Direction. Vision simplifies decision–
making. Anything that moves you closer to your vision gets a green light; everything else should be 
approached with caution. Vision brings what’s important to the surface, and weeds out anything 
that stands in your way. Without vision, good things will keep you from achieving great things. 
People without a clear vision are easily distracted. They’ve a tendency to drift aimlessly from one 
thing to another. They’ve no spiritual, relational, financial or moral compass. Consequently, they 
make decisions that rob them of their dreams. (4) Purpose. Having vision is like getting a sneak 
preview of things to come. It says, ‘If you don’t show up, something important won’t happen. Your 
life matters. Without you, what could be—won’t be.’

‘I will instruct you…in the way you should go.’ Psalm 32:8 NKJV 
The Power of Vision (3)
Mother Teresa didn’t set out searching for fame; it found her. She simply went to India, found a 
need no one else was meeting, heard the call of God, allowed her heart to be consumed by it, and 
ministered to multitudes of the world’s most neglected and forgotten people in the slums of 
Calcutta. One of her most famous slogans was, ‘A life not lived for others is not a life at all.’ Let’s 
face it; much of what we do each day doesn’t seem to matter until it’s evaluated as part of a larger 
picture. When you take the minutiae of any given day, drop it into the cauldron of a God–ordained 
vision and stir it around, suddenly there’s purpose, worth, adrenaline and the joy that comes from 
knowing you’re fulfilling your destiny. It’s like the difference between filling bags with dirt and 
building a levee to save a town. There’s nothing glamorous about filling sandbags, but saving a 
town from the ravages of a flood is another matter entirely. Building a levee gives meaning to the 
drudgery of shovelling dirt into sandbags. And it’s like that with your vision. Many times the 
everyday routine of life can feel like shovelling dirt. But take those same routines and view them 
through the lens of a God–given purpose, and suddenly everything looks very different. Vision 
brings your world into focus. It brings order and purpose out of chaos. It enables you to see 
everything in a fresh light. And the good news is that God is the giver of visions—so ask Him for 
one!

‘…so the power of God could be seen in him.’ John 9:3 NLT
Take It to the Lord
When Jesus encountered a blind man, His disciples immediately began to discuss the man’s 
condition. They asked, ‘Was this man’s blindness the result of his own sins, or the sins of his 
parents?’ Jesus answered, ‘This happened so the power of God could be seen in him.’ Notice four 
things: (1) The disciples were eager to attribute the man’s problem to sin. Satan will try to convince 
you that, because of your sin, you’re disqualified from God’s grace. You’re not! ‘For He says to 
Moses: “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have 
compassion.”’ (Romans 9:15 ESV) (2) When Jesus healed him, the neighbours wanted to debate, 
not celebrate. They started asking, ‘“…Isn’t this the man who used to sit and beg?” Some said he 
was… others said, “No…”’ (John 9:8–9 NLT) (3) His healing failed the ‘religiosity test’ because the 
Pharisees said, “…This man Jesus is not from God for He is working on the Sabbath…”’ (John 9:16 
NLT) (4) Even the man’s parents weren’t free to praise God, because ‘…anyone saying Jesus was 
the Messiah would be expelled from the synagogue.’ (John 9:22 NLT) To the neighbours he was a 
misfit, to church leaders a topic of debate, to his parents a social stigma, so they ‘…threw him out.’ 
(John 9:34 NIV) End of story? Thank God—no! ‘ Jesus...found him... and said, “...I have come into 
this world, so that the blind will see...”’ ( John 9:35, 39 NIV) So instead of rehashing your problem 
and listening to other people’s opinions, take it to the Lord in prayer. When you share it with 
others, the best you’ll get is sympathy, but when you share it with Jesus you’ll get a solution.

‘…do not complain…’ James 5:9 NCV
Go on a Complaining Fast
Whatever you keep doing becomes a habit. That’s why James says, ‘…do not complain…’ Author 
Jon Gordon says, ‘A complaining fast won’t just make everyone around you happier…you’ll 
experience more joy, peace, success and positive relationships.’ So instead of complaining when 
things go wrong: (1) Practise gratitude. Giving thanks for three blessings every day energises you 
and makes you feel happier. It’s impossible to be grateful and negative at the same time. (2) 
Encourage others. Instead of complaining about what people do wrong, focus on what they’re 
doing right. ‘…encourage…people who are afraid. Help those who are weak. Be patient with 
everyone.’ (1 Thessalonians 5:14 NCV) It’s ok to criticise people’s weaknesses as long as you 
balance it with three times more praise. (3) Focus on your success. Start a success journal. Every 
night before you go to bed, write down something great about your day. It could be an uplifting 
conversation…or an accomplishment you’re proud of. There’s truth to the old saying, ‘Nothing 
succeeds like success.’ When you focus on success you set the stage for more to follow. (4) Learn 
to let go. Instead of obsessing about what you can’t change, focus on what you can influence. 
When you stop trying to control everything and place your life in God’s hands, things have a way of 
working out. (5) Use the power of prayer. Paul says, ‘…pray…on all occasions with all kinds of 
prayers and requests…’ (Ephesians 6:18 NIV) Prayer reduces stress, boosts positive energy and 
promotes health. When you’re under pressure, instead of complaining, plug in to God’s power and 
recharge your batteries.

‘Wait patiently for the Lord. Be brave and courageous…’ Psalm 27:14 NLT
Wait (1)
It’s in looking back that we realise: (1) God had something better in mind for us. (2) We weren’t 
mature enough at that point to handle what we were asking Him for. We think we’re ready, but 
God knows when we are. Scripture often commands us to ‘wait on the Lord’. Learning to wait is a 
test of maturity. John MacArthur writes: ‘People find it difficult with life if they can’t instantly 
gratify every desire. They want to eliminate every discomfort, difficulty, injustice or deprivation 
instantly. Scripture responds with two revolutionary concepts: heavenly mindedness and delayed 
gratification.’ Waiting forces us to accept that we’re not in control. It humbles us in ways we need 
to be humbled. Consider the trapeze artist: for a split second, which must feel like an eternity, he 
or she is suspended in nothingness. They can’t go back, and it’s too soon to feel the grasp of the 
one who’ll catch them. They must wait in absolute trust. You may be at that same point in your life 
right now. You’ve let go of what God called you to let go of, but you can’t feel His hand catching 
you yet. Moses waited eighty years for a ministry that lasted forty years: two–thirds of his life was 
spent getting ready! Jesus spent thirty years preparing for a ministry that would last three–and–a–
half years. From God’s perspective, your life isn’t measured by its length, but by its effectiveness 
and its impact for His Kingdom. So wait, and keep a good attitude while you’re doing it. God won’t 
disappoint you.

‘I waited patiently for the Lord to help me…’ Psalm 40:1 NLT
Wait (2)
The Psalmist said: ‘I waited patiently for the Lord to help me, and He turned to me and heard my 
cry. He lifted me out of the pit of despair…He set my feet on solid ground and steadied me as I 
walked along. He has given me a new song to sing, a hymn of praise to our God. Many will see 
what He has done and be amazed.’ (Psalm 40: NLT) Waiting means trusting that God knows what 
He’s doing, even when He doesn’t give you all the details. Perhaps you’re single and looking for 
someone to share your life with. Maybe there’s a relationship at your fingertips, but you know it 
wouldn’t be pleasing to God. It isn’t the right person, because he or she doesn’t share your values, 
goals, or commitment to Christ. Maybe they’re putting pressure on you to get involved sexually 
even though you’re not married. Sampling the product before you buy may be the world’s way, 
but you know it’s not God’s way. Still you’re tempted to think, ‘I’m tired of waiting. I’m going to 
reach for whatever satisfaction I can get and worry about the consequences later.’ Samson did that 
and ended up losing his sight, his strength, his reputation, his freedom and his life. Hold out for 
God’s best! Pray: ‘Lord, I don’t want to get involved in any relationship that I know would 
dishonour You, hurt me, and bring pain to the lives of others. You said the plans You have for me 
are good. So even though I sometimes feel no one understands how hard it is, I’ll trust in You and 
wait patiently.’

Esther, a Jewish girl married to a pagan king, risked death to break with long–standing tradition, 
marched into her husband’s throne room, spoke her mind, and rescued her people from 
annihilation. One girl saved a nation because she was willing to put everything on the line. Are you

can’t do everything; but still I can do something: and because I can’t do everything, I will not refuse 
to do the something I can do.’ How many people did it take to rescue the dying man on the Jericho 
road? One Good Samaritan. How many people did it take to save the whole known world from the 
consequences of a seven–year famine? One man, Joseph. John Maxwell writes: ‘God has put a 
dream inside you. It’s yours and no one else’s. It declares your uniqueness. It holds your potential. 
Only you can give birth to it. Only you can live it. Not to discover it, take responsibility for it and act 
upon it is to negatively affect yourself as well as all those who would benefit from your dream.’ 
Poet John Greenleaf Whittier wrote, ‘For all sad words of tongue and pen; the saddest are these, 
“It might have been.”’ In your twilight years, will you look back and feel you’ve spent your life 
struggling to fulfil other people’s expectations? Or know that you lived to the fullest by striving to 
fulfil your God–given dream? Think about it now, while there’s still time to change direction.

resurrection…’ (John 11:24 NCV), that was future–tense faith. And when she said, ‘…Even now God 
will give You anything You ask’ (John 11:22 NCV), she was demonstrating ‘now’ faith, which is 
present–tense. As believers, the Bible tells us not to ‘…look at the things which are seen, but at the 
things which are not seen…’ (2 Corinthians 4:18 NKJV) ‘Now’ faith stakes its claim on 
‘something…even if we do not see it.’ (Hebrews 11:1 NCV) Paul says, ‘…we walk by faith, not by 
sight.’ (2 Corinthians 5:7 NKJV) Too often we base our feelings on what we see, instead of what 
God says in His Word. But as Jon Walker writes: ‘When we believe that reality is confined to what 
we see, we become trapped into thinking the only truth is what we see. We become prisoners of 
our own perceptions; we cease walking in faith… For those who walk by faith, appearances are 
never the ultimate reality… Reality extends beyond what you can see… the things we do not see 
are eternal [time and circumstance do not diminish or alter them] (2 Corinthians 4:18 NIV). Even 
though things may appear bad, God is working things out for our good (Romans 8:28). He knows 
how the story ends, so fix your eyes on the unseen and not on what you see.’

‘…God so loved the world…’ John 3:16 NKJV
Jesus Loves You Unconditionally
David said, ‘Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.’ (Psalm 32:1 NKJV) 
No matter how hard we worked, we could never pay off our sin debt. And thank God we don’t 
have to, because ‘God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever 
believes in Him should not perish, but has everlasting life.’ Years ago a congregation decided to 
honour one of its retired pastors. He was ninety–two, and some people wondered why the church 
even asked the elderly man to speak. After a warm welcome and introduction, he rose from his 
chair and walked with great dignity and effort to the pulpit. Leaning on the podium to steady 
himself, without notes of any kind, he began to speak: ‘When your pastor invited me here, he 
asked me to talk about the greatest lesson I’ve learned in fifty–plus years of preaching. I’ve 
thought about it for a few days, and boiled it down to the one thing that has made the most 
difference in my life and sustained me through all my trials. The one thing I can rely on when tears, 
heartbreak, pain, fear and sorrow paralyse me… the one thing that always comforts me: Jesus 
loves me! This I know, for the Bible tells me so. Little ones to Him belong. They are weak but He is 
strong. Yes, Jesus loves me. Yes, Jesus loves me. Yes, Jesus loves me. The Bible tells me so.’ You 
could hear a pin drop as the old man shuffled back to his seat. It’s something the congregation 
never forgot. And it’s something you should never forget either—Jesus loves you unconditionally. 
That’s so today, tomorrow, and forever!

‘…God will generously provide all you need…’ 2 Corinthians 9:8 NLT
Get Rid of Your Scarcity Mentality
‘…God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory.’ (Philippians 4:19 NKJV) Whose 
riches? God’s! And His ability to bless you is not limited by the job market, the stock market or the 
housing market. For forty years He fed His people in the wilderness with manna from Heaven. He 
sent ravens to deliver meat to Elijah during a famine. He fed over five thousand people with a 
boy’s lunch. Paul writes, ‘God will generously provide all you need. Then you will always have 
everything you need and plenty left over to share with others…Yes, you will be enriched in every 
way…’ (2 Corinthians 9:8, 11 NLT) The scarcity attitude is rooted in fear and shows distrust of the 
awesome power of God to supply all our needs according to His unlimited resources. It’s based 
upon the faulty assumption that if someone else has something, you can’t have it because there’s 
only one pie, and every slice that someone else gets means less is available for you. It makes you 
believe that the blessings of others come at your expense. It says, ‘You win, I lose.’ That’s no way 
to live the abundant life! Start today to reprogramme your thinking. Remind yourself that you’re 
not in competition with anybody, for anything, in any area of your life. Cling to the words of Jesus: 
‘…I have come that [you] may have life, and that [you] may have it more abundantly.’ (John 10:10 
NKJV) Pray: ‘Father, help me to reject all thoughts of scarcity. Show me how to help others achieve 
their goals by sharing my time, talents, treasure. In Jesus’ name, I pray. Amen.’

‘A prudent person foresees danger and takes precautions…’ Proverbs 27:12 NLT
Install Your ‘Cables’ Now
Half Dome is a granite peak that towers above the valley floor in Yosemite National Park. Your final 
climb is between steel cables bolted to the rock; they were designed as handholds to safeguard 
and help you reach the top. Columnist Mary Hunt writes: ‘The final ascent up the sheer granite 
surface…is by far the most challenging. Once you see the cables you experience terror like you’ve 
never known… and you’ve no choice but to finish the trip. At that moment you’re thankful for 
cables that become the guardrails you need to pull yourself to the top. The secret to [continuing] 
when you feel like quitting is to erect ‘cables’ in your life before you need them so that when you 
face difficult situations, the help you need to make it will be there to protect you from your own 
fears and self–defeating attitudes.’ Solomon says, ‘A prudent person foresees danger and takes 
precautions. The simpleton goes blindly on and suffers the consequences.’ Sooner or later you’ll 
face a mountain you can’t conquer alone. And if the ‘cables’ you need are in place, you’ll conquer 
it. What are they? (1) God’s Word. Jeremiah said, ‘Your words…sustain me…’ (Jeremiah 15:16 TLB) 
Get into God’s Word, and get God’s Word into you. That way, when trouble comes you’ll be able 
to handle it. It’ll ‘...guide you when you walk…guard you when you sleep…speak to you when you 
are awake.’ (Proverbs 6:22 NCV) (2) A strong prayer life. ‘…The earnest (heartfelt, continued) 
prayer of a righteous man makes tremendous power available [dynamic in its working]…’ (James 
5:16 AMP) Time spent with God changes you; it makes you more like Jesus and strengthens you for 
what lies ahead.

‘...if...you lack wisdom, you should pray to God, who will give it to you; because God gives 
generously and graciously to all.’ (James 1:5 GNT) 
Are You Trying To Make An Important Decision?
If you are, here are some suggestions to help you. (1) Don’t ask God to bless YOUR plans, instead 
ask for HIS wisdom and direction! And remember, God will never tell you to do anything that 
doesn’t line up with what He’s already told you in His Word (Isaiah 8:20). (2) Make sure your goal is 
to glorify God. Sometimes that’s hard to know, for the worst pride often masquerades behind 
feigned humility. The human body is amazing—just pat a man on the back and so often his head 
begins to swell. But God opposes pride. (James 4:6) (3) Use your brain. God’s guidance transcends 
human reasoning, but it doesn’t exclude it. When God saves you, He doesn’t remove your mind, 
He renews it. (Romans 12:2) So pray, then put it to work. (4) Seasons aren’t meant to be ignored. If 
it isn’t God’s timing, wait! In the right season, the plan will be clear, the people you need will show 
up and the funds will be provided (Ecclesiastes 3:1). God has promised it, so trust Him! (5) Seek 
trustworthy counsel. Beware of those who patronise you for selfish reasons. Listen to those who 
value what you value and have been where you want to go (Proverbs 27:17). (6) Never act without 
the facts, but never limit God to them. When knowledge won’t take you another step, faith will 
carry you through, for that’s what connects you to the power of God. Now listen again ‘...if...you 
lack wisdom, you should pray to God, who will give it to you; because God gives generously and 
graciously to all.’ (James 1:5 GNT)

‘…To turn the hearts of the fathers back to the children…’ Luke 1:17 NAS
Dad, Equip Your Kids for the Real World! (1)
Research shows the results of the ‘dad deficit’. Too many children today are growing up without a 
father’s input. And as a result they end up making poor life, relationship and marriage choices. So 
how does a dad equip his kids for life in the real world?
(1) Know what they’re up to. Get to know what makes them tick. Ask what subjects they enjoy in 
school, and which ones they’re struggling with. Learn who their friends are; who they spend time 
with at break and after school. Try to listen and learn. Take them out occasionally for breakfast or a 
hamburger; they’ll feel like royalty spending one–to–one time with Dad! (2) Teach them to stand 
tall. A tragedy of their young world is the increasing suicide rate because of playground bullying. 
Teach your children to stand up for themselves. Teach them respect, and how to protect 
themselves by speaking up appropriately in class when they’re unclear about the lesson, or to 
courageously say what they believe. Teach them assertiveness in confronting unfair treatment. 
Kids who become ‘punch bags’ are set up to be victimised! (3) Give them an example. However 
accomplished your ‘preaching’ skills may be, you need to be ‘walking the walk’ in front of your 
children. You can tell them it’s important to be healthy and active, but if you’re a couch potato 
inhaling bags of chips and watching endless footy matches, they’re not convinced. Set an example 
by getting fit, pursuing a healthy lifestyle, activities and interests, and watch them think how ‘cool’ 
it is to be like Dad!

‘…I am your spiritual father through the Gospel; that is why I implore you to follow [my] footsteps.’ 
1 Corinthians 4:15 PHPS
Dad, Equip Your Kids for the Real World! (2)
Dad, do these three things for your kids: (1) Alert them to the dangers of having a sense of 
entitlement. Yes, they need parents who express unconditional love for them. But some of us 
think our kids can do no wrong—even when they do! Consequently they grow up having 
unrealistic expectations and a distorted view of how life works. Everybody gets a scorecard in life, 
and it records both our wins and our losses. Let your kids know that we all make mistakes. Failing to 
recognise that just makes them self–deceived and sets them up for heartache. Children learn from 
failure how to deal with disappointment; it prepares them for later life when things don’t go their 
way. (2) Teach them the truth about death—yours and theirs. The Bible says, ‘…it is appointed unto 
men once to die…’ (Hebrews 9:27 KJV) Let them know that death is universally ordained because of 
the sin of humanity. Tell them that life, however long, is a gift to be maximised, and Heaven is a 
family reunion not to be missed. The death of a friend or loved one can be an opportunity to 
diminish their fears and equip them to handle loss, grief and recovery. (3) Show them why you 
married their mother. It’s the most formative relationship in their early lives; one that will influence 
who they ultimately become, their choice of a partner, and their future happiness. When they see 
you loving their mother, treating her like a queen, and giving her consideration and honour, they’ll 
admire, appreciate, and emulate their awesome dad!

‘…We ought to obey God rather than men.’ Acts 5:29 KJV
Set Yourself Free from People Pleasing
Too often our actions are dictated by a misguided need to please others. We care so much about 
what they think that with every step we take we look over our shoulder to see whether they’re 
smiling or frowning. Understand this: if you’re always looking for people’s approval, you’re not 
looking where you’re going and eventually you’ll hit a wall or trip over your own two feet. The Bible 
says, ‘…We ought to obey God rather than men.’ What do you think will happen if you open your 
mouth and stand up for yourself? The truth is that people who don’t respect your rights and 
honour your wishes are not worth your time or effort. Nor are they worthy of a long drawn–out 
discussion; just say goodbye! (We’re not talking about your marriage or children.) When the land 
became too small for the flocks of Abraham and Lot to graze together, strife broke out. Abraham 
loved his nephew Lot, but he realised he could no longer live in this situation. So he said, ‘…Please 
separate from me. If you take the left, then I will go to the right; or, if you go to the right, then I will 
go to the left.’ (Genesis 13:9 NKJV) How does their story end? Lot chose the best grazing land close 
to Sodom, and, as a result, everything he worked for went up in smoke. But Abraham, who always 
sought to please God, ended up not only being blessed himself, but being a blessing to the nations 
of the world. So the word for you today is—God wants to set you free from people pleasing.

After many years of marriage, John decided to divorce his wife. The reasons he gave his counsellor 
were: ‘She’s not attractive, she’s not interesting, she’s overweight, and she’s a poor 
housekeeper.’ So the counsellor gave him this suggestion: ‘Starting today, I want you to go home 
and treat your wife like a goddess. Start doing everything in your power to please her. Listen 
intently when she talks about her problems. Help around the house, and take her out to dinner at 
the weekend. I want you to literally pretend that she’s a goddess. Then after two months of this 
wonderful new behaviour, pack your bags and leave. That should get her attention!’ John agreed it 
was a great idea, and decided to implement it. He took his wife away on romantic weekends and 
read poetry to her every night. After two months the counsellor called and asked, ‘John, did you 
file for divorce? Are you looking forward to being a bachelor again?’ John replied, ‘Are you kidding? 
I’m married to a goddess. I’ve never been happier in my life. I’d never leave my wife in a million 
years. In fact, I’m discovering new, wonderful things about her every single day. Divorce? Not on 
your life!’ The Bible says, ‘…A man reaps what he sows.’ (Galatians 6:7 NIV) And when John 
changed his strategy and started sowing seeds of love, he reaped a marriage he never dreamed 
possible. Do you think this same strategy might possibly work for you? What’ve you got to lose? 
Give it a try and see what happens. Chances are you and your spouse will love the results.

‘…I am…wonderfully made…’ Psalm 139:14 NIV
Your Eyes: A Divine Masterpiece
Evolution says that, where there’s a want, nature will provide what’s needed. Really? In Natural 
Theology, Dr. William Paley writes: ‘To keep the eye moist and clean—which qualities are 
necessary to its brightness and its use—a wash is constantly supplied by a secretion for the 
purpose; and the superfluous brine is conveyed to the nose through a perforation in the bone as 
large as a goose quill. When the fluid has entered the nose, it spreads itself upon the inside of the 
nostril and is evaporated by the current of warm air which in the course of respiration is continually 
passing over it… It’s easily perceived that the eye must want moisture; but could the “want” of the 
eye generate the gland which produces the tear, or bore the hole by which it’s discharged—a hole 
through bone? Let the evolutionist tell us who bored the hole… and laid a water pipe through it for 
the dispersion of tears.’ When it encounters darkness, your eye’s ability to see increases one 
hundred thousand times. The finest camera ever made doesn’t even come close! And what’s 
more, your eye will find the object it wants to see, and focus on it automatically by elongating or 
compressing itself. Both eyes moving in tandem must adopt different angles in order to fix 
themselves on what’s to be seen. Evolution tells us when the eye got ready to create itself, it had 
forethought for its own protection and built a bony ridge of the brow, which provided a nose on 
which to position the glasses many of us need. Then it provided a shutter to protect itself from 
foreign objects. Perhaps it takes more faith to believe in evolution than creation! What do you 
think?

‘…Pour out your heart before Him…’ Psalm 62:8 NAS
Pray, and Keep Praying!
More than anything else in life, Hannah wanted a son. And as the years passed she wrestled with 
disappointment and despair. ‘…and [Hannah] was in distress of soul, praying to the Lord.’ (1 
Samuel 1:10 AMP) However, she did two things that worked—and they’ll work for you, too! (1) 
Instead of turning away from God, she turned to Him. Instead of praying less, she prayed more. 
She knew that while her husband couldn’t give her a child, God could. She may not have been 
happy with God’s timing, but she never doubted His goodness. Unfortunately, one of the things 
we’re tempted to do when things fall apart is to avoid God’s presence. That’s a mistake, because 
He’s the one you need most! Yes, it’s hard to pray when your heart is breaking. But unless you’ve 
prayed with a broken heart and a deep sense of your need, you’ve never really poured out your 
heart before God, or learned what the Bible truly means by prayer. (2) She didn’t just think about 
what she wanted, she also thought about what God wanted. ‘…she made a vow, saying, “Lord 
Almighty, if You will…not forget Your servant but give her a son, then I will give him to the Lord for 
all the days of his life…”’ (1 Samuel 1:11 NIV) And shortly after that Samuel was conceived. When 
you’re willing to make a promise to God that He can hold you to (which is what a vow is), you’re 
getting serious about prayer. And that’s when God will get serious about your prayer as well! So, 
‘pour out your heart before Him.’

‘…He…guided them in the wilderness like a flock.’ Psalm 78:52 NKJV
What You Need in the Wilderness (1)
Charles E. Fuller, one of the first radio Bible teachers, started his daily broadcast with the song, ‘My 
Lord knows the way through the wilderness; all I have to do is follow.’ To get them from Egypt to 
Canaan, God took His people through the wilderness—and, spiritually speaking, you’ll have to go 
through it, too! You can have a wilderness experience anywhere. At a graveside, in a cancer ward, 
in a divorce court, in an unemployment queue, or when you lose your house. But the wilderness 
can also be a place of miracles. So for the next few days, let’s look at some things you need to 
survive in the wilderness. Direction! Without it you end up going round in circles. Notice how God 
led Israel. He ‘went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud…and by night in a pillar of fire, to give 
them light…He took not away the pillar of the cloud…nor the pillar of fire…from before the people.’ 
(Exodus 13:21–22 NKJV) God basically told Moses: ‘Whenever the pillar moves, you move. And 
when the pillar stops, you stop.’ But what do you do at night when it’s pitch black? There are no 
candles or oil lamps, and you risk sharing your bed with a scorpion or stepping on a snake on your 
way to the bathroom. Don’t worry; God’s got you covered! The wilderness isn’t alien territory to 
Him. The Psalmist said, ‘Your Word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.’ (Psalm 119:105 
NKJV) For every contingency, condition and circumstance you face, your Bible will guide you, 
protect you, and keep you safe. So stop worrying and start reading it every day.

‘…He led them on safely, so that they did not fear…’ Psalm 78:53 NKJV
What You Need in the Wilderness (2)
You can be in the wilderness and still be in the centre of God’s will. ‘…He made His own people go 
forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock… He led them on safely, so…they did 
not fear…’ (Psalm 78:52–53 NKJV) In the wilderness you get to know God in a way you never knew 
Him before. So, what else did Israel need to survive in the wilderness? Food! Someone calculated 
it would have taken about twenty–six wagonloads of food to feed that many Israelites every day. 
The problem is there were no trains and no tracks! But they had something much better—God! 
For forty years He delivered manna, ‘the perfect food’, to the doors of their tents. The supply was 
according to each family’s individual need—and God never missed a day. So if the economy has 
you feeling anxious and wondering whether or not God can take care of you—this is the word for 
you today! God may not give you everything you want, but He will give you everything you need. 
The God we serve doesn’t suffer from lack or limitation! The Psalmist said, ‘I have been young, and 
now am old; yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his descendants begging for bread.’ 
(Psalm 37:25 NKJV) The old country preacher got it right when he said, ‘Where He leads me I will 
follow; what He feeds me I will swallow.’ Think of it: for forty years Israel never missed a meal or 
went without. And their God is your God, so put your trust in Him today and stop worrying!

‘…He brought you water out of hard rock.’ Deuteronomy 8:15 NIV
What You Need in the Wilderness (3) 
What else do you need in the wilderness? Water! You can live without food for about forty days, 
but without water you’ll die much faster. It’s the same in the spiritual realm; you can get by in life 
without a lot of things, but you won’t make it without God. In the wilderness God was teaching His 
people a lesson He wanted them to remember when they arrived in the Promised Land: 
‘Otherwise, when you eat and are satisfied, when you build fine houses and settle down, and when 
your herds and flocks grow large and your silver and gold increase and all you have is multiplied, 
then your heart will become proud and you will forget the Lord…Who brought you out of…slavery. 
He led you through the vast and dreadful wilderness, that thirsty and waterless land, with its 
venomous snakes and scorpions. He brought you water out of hard rock. He gave you manna to 
eat in the wilderness, something your ancestors had never known, to humble and to test you so 
that in the end it might go well with you.’ (Deuteronomy 8:12–16 NIV) Note the words ‘that it 
might go well with you’. In spite of what you’re going through today, God has great blessings in 
store for you. But in order to handle them properly you must learn humility, develop a heart of 
gratitude, and never forget that He alone is the source of every good thing you’ll ever have. Then 
God added this P.S.: ‘If you ever forget…you will surely be destroyed.’ (Deuteronomy 8:19 NIV) 
That’s how serious He is about making sure you depend on Him each day.

‘…And there was none feeble among His tribes.’ Psalm 105:37 NKJV
What You Need in the Wilderness (4) 
Notice something else Israel enjoyed in the wilderness: divine health. Think of the health issues 
you’d expect among two million people walking through endless desert with no doctor or hospital 
in sight. Yet from the youngest to the oldest, ‘He…brought them out…and there was none feeble 
among His tribes.’ That’s because they lived on a diet provided by God Himself. Their troubles 
began when they complained and wanted to go back to the food they ate as slaves in Egypt. Hello! 
There’s an important lesson here for those who live on fast foods that promote ailments like heart 
disease, cancer and diabetes. Imagine pouring five pounds of sugar into the fuel tank of your car 
and complaining that it won’t run properly. Now, when health problems run in your family, or 
economic circumstances force you to eat less than ideal food, God understands and you can go to 
Him with confidence, believing, ‘…the prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise him 
up…’ (James 5:15 NKJV) But when the choice is between exercising wisdom in order to have good 
health or exercising faith in order to be healed, your choice is clear. When Israel entered the 
Promised Land, God told them, ‘…serve the Lord…and He will bless your bread and your 
water…take sickness away from the midst of you…[and] fulfil the number of your days.’ (Exodus 
23:25–26 NKJV) But don’t forget, He also gave them dietary laws to live by that set them apart from 
the surrounding nations. Question: How many of us fail to ‘fulfil the number of [our] days’ and the 
assignment God gives us, because we refuse to exercise wisdom and discipline when it comes to 
our diet? Think about it!

‘Acquaint now yourself with Him, and be at peace…’ Job 22:21 NKJV
What You Need in the Wilderness (5)
When you find yourself in the wilderness, what’s the one thing you need more than anything else? 
God! That’s why the Lord told Moses to build the tabernacle and He used it as a teaching tool to 
show His people that: (1) He wants to meet with us regularly. The word ‘tabernacle’ means ‘tent of 
meeting’. God wants you to spend time with Him. He wants you to get to know Him. Because 
when you do, you’ll worry less and trust Him more. The Bible says, ‘Acquaint now yourself with 
Him, and be at peace…’ It’s important to listen to God’s Word being taught, to meet with other 
believers, and be encouraged by their testimonies. But at some point you’ve got to stop trading in 
second–hand information and get ‘up close and personal’ with God. James writes, ‘Draw near to 
God and He will draw near to you…’ (James 4:8 NKJV) (2) God wants to be at the centre of our lives. 
When Israel set up camp each night, the twelve tribes pitched their tents in formation surrounding 
the tabernacle, where God’s presence dwelt. Every man, woman, boy and girl could stand in the 
door of their tent and see God in their midst. Could the message be clearer? When your deepest 
affections and greatest ambitions are centred around Christ, your life will take an upward swing. 
‘…delight yourself in the Lord and He will give you the desires of your heart.’ (Psalm 37:4 NIV) The 
formula for thriving in the wilderness is: centre your life on Christ and soak yourself in His Word!

‘…You are to receive the offering for Me from everyone whose heart prompts them to give.’ 
Exodus 25:2 NIV 
What You Need in the Wilderness (6)
God’s people already possessed everything necessary to build the tabernacle. So Moses went to 
God for the plan, and to the people for the resources. And that’s still how it works! Pastor, don’t 
come up with a plan of your own, or one you got from somebody else, and then ask God to 
underwrite it. Ask God for His plan, because that’s the only one He will bless. And don’t feel 
intimidated about going to the people and asking them to give. Perhaps you’re reluctant to talk 
about finances because some people in church complain and say, ‘All the pastor ever talks about is 
money.’ Of course, if they’re right, you need to get back into balance. But generally speaking, 
people need clear biblical teaching on giving; to see it as a privilege and an opportunity to go into 
partnership with God. Over and over the Bible refers to giving as ‘sowing’. And when you sow, you 
should expect to reap. The law of giving is like the law of gravity; it never fails. God said, ‘As long as 
the earth endures, seedtime and harvest…will never cease.’ (Genesis 8:22 NIV) Observe how it 
works: first you sow your seed, then there’s a time of waiting, and finally you get to reap. Money 
can be a touchy subject; it can stir up resistance and resentment. But God promised that when you 
sow generously, you will reap generously: ‘...whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and 
whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully... for God loves a cheerful giver.’ (2 Corinthians 
9:6–7 ESV) Now, either God told the truth or He didn’t. And you need to find out whether or not 
it’s true. The only way to do that is to try it and see for yourself.

‘…Remember the Lord your God…’ Deuteronomy 8:18 NIV
Today, Let’s Remember That!
On March 3, 1863, anguished by the ravages of civil war, Abraham Lincoln declared a Proclamation 
Appointing a National Fast Day: ‘Whereas it is the duty of nations as well as of men to own their 
dependence upon the overruling power of God, to confess their sins and transgressions, in 
humble sorrow, yet with assured hope that genuine repentance will lead to mercy and pardon; 
and to recognise the sublime truth announced in the Holy Scriptures and proven by all history, that 
those nations only are blessed whose God is the Lord… We have been the recipients of the 
choicest bounties of Heaven. We have been preserved these many years in peace and prosperity; 
we have grown in numbers, wealth and power as no other nation has ever grown. But we have 
forgotten God. We have forgotten the gracious hand which preserved us in peace, and multiplied 
and enriched and strengthened us; and we have vainly imagined, in the deceitfulness of our 
hearts, that all these blessings were produced by some superior wisdom and virtue of our own. 
Intoxicated with unbroken success, we have become too self–sufficient to feel the necessity of 
redeeming and preserving grace, too proud to pray to the God that made us! It behooves us then 
to humble ourselves before the offended Power, to confess our national sins, and to pray for 
clemency and forgiveness.’ God warned Israel: ‘When…your silver and your gold are multiplied, 
and all that you have is multiplied… you shall remember the Lord your God, for it is He who gives 
you power to get wealth, that He may establish His covenant…’ (Deuteronomy 8:13, 18 NKJV)

‘He restores my soul…’ Psalm 23:3 NKJV
Practise Soul Care
David said, ‘The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He makes me to lie down in green pastures; 
He leads me beside the still waters. He restores my soul…’ (Psalm 23:1–3 NKJV) Today car engines 
are computerised. A light on your dashboard will let you know something’s wrong and that it’s time 
for a checkup. Your soul will do that too. But you’ve got to pay attention to the signals! Don’t wait 
until you have a spiritual, moral, emotional or relational breakdown before you stop and pay 
attention. When your soul’s thirst is not quenched and its needs are not met, it will seek relief 
some other way, often a way that will hurt you. You must know when to say ‘when’. Most of us 
don’t take breaks that enable us to ‘restore our souls’. We’re ensnared by guilt, as if stopping 
would somehow be irresponsible. Or we fear losing ground because we took a minute for 
ourselves. One of the hardest things in life to achieve is not success, but a sense of balance. So in 
all your goal–setting and ‘go–getting’, don’t forget your soul. Even God rested (Genesis 2:2). And if 
He did, then you need to also. The power of rest is that it allows you to enjoy the journey of life 
and not just the destination. Indeed, if you don’t learn to walk in the park by choice, you may end 
up in the hospital by necessity. When God ‘makes you lie down in green pastures’, enjoy them. 
When He ‘leads you beside the still waters’, it’s to refresh and restore you. So practise soul care!

‘…If someone slaps you on the right cheek, offer the other cheek also.’ Matthew 5:39 NLT
Turn the Other Cheek
There are two ways you can respond to negative criticism. If there’s truth in it, humbly accept it 
and grow through it. If not, practise what Jesus taught: ‘You have heard the law that says the 
punishment must match the injury: “An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.” But I say…If 
someone slaps you on the right cheek, offer the other cheek also.’ (Matthew 5:38–39 NLT) 
Sometimes a person’s criticism may actually have nothing to do with you at all; they simply feel 
cheated by life. And rather than take control of their heart’s dreams, they go around trying to 
squelch other people’s dreams in an attempt to drag them down to their own level of despair. And 
while it’s tempting to want to retaliate and point out their weaknesses and failures, that’s not the 
example Jesus set for you. Nor is it the high road you are called to take. ‘Never pay back evil with 
more evil. Do things in such a way that everyone can see you are honourable. Do all that you can to 
live in peace with everyone.’ (Romans 12:17–18 NLT) What does it mean to turn the other cheek? It 
means don’t let your critics get under your skin. Simply listen to them, thank them, and take their 
criticism with a grain of salt. Save your time and energies for those you trust, those who love you 
enough to tell you the truth even when it hurts. Someone has said, ‘You owe nothing to a critic!’ 
Actually, you do. Jesus said, ‘…Pray for those who persecute you!’ (Matthew 5:44 NLT)

‘…the Spirit pleads for us…in harmony with God’s own will.’ Romans 8:27 NLT
Different Ways to Pray (1)
Someone who’s better at prayer than you are is already at work on your behalf. ‘...the Holy Spirit 
helps us in our weakness. For example, we don’t know what God wants us to pray for. But the Holy 
Spirit prays for us... [and] pleads for us believers in harmony with God’s own will.’ (Romans 8:26–27 
NLT) Notice, the Holy Spirit ‘prays for us’. Sometimes we’ve a hard time being ‘fully present’ in 
prayer. We all know what it’s like to be with another person when their mind is a million miles 
away. What’s the answer? Try jotting down what goes on while you’re praying. The two most 
common hindrances to praying successfully are: (a) your mind gets easily distracted by other 
thoughts; (b) you get tired. When author John Ortberg shared these two frustrations with a friend, 
he suggested that John go outside alone and simply invite Jesus to come along with him. Ortberg 
writes: ‘The next day I went to the ocean, took off my shoes, started to run and invited Jesus to 
come along. I found the strangest thing. When I thought I was supposed to be talking to Him, I 
found it effortful and difficult. Now that all I had to do was invite Him, I couldn’t stop thinking about 
Him. My mind kept reflecting on His being with me. I found myself wanting to point out the 
pelicans and the waves to Him. People and concerns would pop into my mind, and I would find 
myself telling Jesus about them. Everything changed.’ So, invite Jesus to come along with you 
today and share each thing you do with Him.

‘Hezekiah received the letter…and spread it out before the Lord.’ Isaiah 37:14 NIV
Different Ways to Pray (2)
Hezekiah, King of Israel, received a threatening letter from a much more powerful king—the King 
of Assyria. The Assyrian potentate demanded unconditional surrender, and told Hezekiah not to 
trust in God. The letter was graphic, warning that resistance meant the Israelites would have to 
‘eat their own excrement and drink their own urine’ before they died (2 Kings 18:27 NIV). So 
Hezekiah went to the temple ‘and spread it out before the Lord.’ Then he prayed: ‘…God of Israel, 
enthroned between the cherubim, You alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth. You have 
made Heaven and earth. Give ear, O Lord, and hear; open Your eyes, O Lord, and see…’ (Isaiah 
37:16–17 NIV) Hezekiah basically said, ‘Lord, would you read this, then do something about it!’ And 
God did. Indeed, what He did was spectacular. ‘Then the angel of the Lord went out and put to 
death a hundred and eighty–five thousand in the Assyrian camp. When the people got up the next 
morning—there were all the dead bodies!’ (Isaiah 37:36 NIV) So, what piece of paper would you 
like to spread out before the Lord? A financial statement that’s overwhelming? A divorce decree? 
A medical diagnosis? An angry email? Any piece of paper that causes you stress can be an invitation 
to prayer, and a candidate to be spread out before the Lord. If it’s important to you, it’s important 
to Him. You say, ‘I’ve never done anything like that before.’ Try it. Give it to God, trust Him, and 
watch how He works things out for you.

‘I lay prostrate before the Lord…’ Deuteronomy 9:25 NIV
Different Ways to Pray (3)
Find a prayer style that works for you. In Scripture people pray as they stand, kneel, lie on the 
ground, sit, stretch out their hands, lift their faces toward the sky, or bow them toward the earth. 
Just find the method that works best for you, and use it. Some people pray better when they are 
moving. If you’re one of them, take a walk, go for a drive, or run. You are free to use your body 
and posture to help you turn your mind and heart towards God. When you’re acknowledging your 
sins, you may find it helpful to have your head bowed and to kneel; it’ll help you to remember and 
experience the humility of the moment. In worship, you may want to turn your face towards the 
sky. In asking for guidance, you may find it helpful to turn your palms upwards as a way of 
expressing with your body: ‘Lord, whatever You want.’ When praying for someone, say at a 
restaurant, you may want to look that person right in the eye while talking to God and say, ‘Father, 
I’m so grateful for this person. You know what they need. Give them what is required by their 
heart.’ When you’re praising God, put on a worship CD and sing along. The point is you should 
approach God with the joy, excitement and simplicity with which a child runs into the arms of a 
loving parent. Just as you don’t have anyone else’s fingerprints, you don’t have anyone else’s 
temperament. So just approach God in a way that’s natural, spontaneous and comfortable for you.

‘He will call upon Me, and I will answer him…’ Psalm 91:15 NIV
Different Ways to Pray (4)
When we try to spend an extended period of time in prayer, our minds tend to wander. When that 
happens, is God upset with us? No, when your mind wanders—God’s Spirit is still with you. 
Sometimes your wandering thoughts can actually guide you into prayer. Jon Ortberg writes: ‘I 
begin praying, and then I imagine myself being wildly successful at something. Or I replay a 
conversation with a person I’m upset with. Or I try to figure out how to solve a problem I’m 
worried about. I used to think of those kinds of thoughts as obstacles to prayer, but I’ve come to 
think of them as prayers waiting to be offered. Maybe the reason they pop into my mind isn’t 
simply my short attention span, but rather what my mind is really concerned about. So instead of 
trying to suppress these thoughts, it’s better to begin to talk to God about them. And just like that, 
I’m back in the flow of prayer. Indeed, we are free to pray in ways that will best help us live in the 
joyful awareness of God’s presence.’ Obviously, things like getting your hair done or your car fixed 
are distractions. When these arise, just write them down and say, ‘I’ll get to that later,’ then get 
back to prayer. Developing a rich and rewarding prayer life isn’t something you accomplish 
overnight; you have to work at it. But the rewards are more than worth the effort. You’re not 
unique; everybody battles distractions in prayer. Those who succeed are those who learn to deal 
with the distractions.

‘…I was afraid and went out and hid your talent in the ground…’ Matthew 25:25 NIV
Are You Burying Your Talent?
One of the most familiar parables Jesus told illustrates how things work in God’s Kingdom: ‘Then he 
who had received one talent came. “Master,” he said, “…I was afraid and went out and hid your 
talent in the ground.”…His master replied, “You wicked, lazy servant!… You should have put my 
money on deposit with the bankers, so that when I returned I would have received it back with 
interest. Take the talent from him and give it to the one who has the ten talents. For everyone who 
has will be given more, and he will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what he has 
will be taken from him …throw that worthless servant outside.”’ (Matthew 25:24–29 NIV) Can you 
imagine going to work next Friday and watching your boss hand your pay packet to someone else, 
while you stand there? That’s exactly what’s going on in this story. It’s a picture of what will 
happen at the judgment seat of Christ—and you’ll be there to see it. Why did the Lord come down 
so hard on this guy? Because he buried his talent. And why did he bury it? Because he ‘was afraid’. 
Afraid of what? (a) Afraid the talent God had given him wasn’t equal to the task. (b) Afraid to take 
a risk in case he failed. (c) Afraid he didn’t have the talents others had, therefore his didn’t count. 
Just like there are degrees of punishment at the Last Judgment (Matthew 11:21–24; James 3:1; 
Matthew 18:6), there will be degrees of reward in Heaven. And how you steward your talent now 
determines what your reward will be then.

‘…God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in them.’ 1 John 4:16 NIV
The Power of Love
When Dr E Stanley Jones preached a sermon on love in India, a church leader told him how a 
layman, whom he loved and had helped, was making trouble and threatening to split the church. 
The frustrated clergyman asked Dr Jones what to do because, in this case, love didn’t seem to be 
working. ‘Increase the dosage!’ retorted Jones. Our self–centred nature would have us believe 
that happiness comes when we get what we want and all of our needs are met. Yet, when we do 
get a better job, or a bigger house, or a bit of fame, we find ourselves empty because these things 
don’t bring us lasting joy and fulfilment. They actually whet our appetite for more—and around 
and around it goes. Peter Gillquist said, ‘Every time we have a chance in any way to flesh out the 
love of God to others, our joy cycle gets fulfilled all over again.’ Francis of Assisi may have 
expressed it best in his famous prayer: ‘Lord, make me an instrument of Your peace. Where there 
is hatred let me sow love; where there is injury, pardon; where there is doubt, faith; where there 
is despair, hope; where there is darkness, light; and where there is sadness, joy. Oh Divine Master, 
grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console; to be understood as to 
understand; to be loved as to love. For it is in giving that we receive; it is in pardoning that we are 
pardoned; and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.’

‘Where there is no counsel, the people fall…’ Proverbs 11:14 NKJV
Can You Take Advice?
The only thing that’s worse than making a mistake is concealing it and allowing pride to lock us in to 
it. Why do we do that? Insecurity! Low self–esteem! We’re all prone to being defensive from time 
to time. But if you find that this has become a pattern in your life, you must do something about it. 
So: (1) Try to listen to yourself as you speak; become aware of your tendency to defend and justify 
your actions. (2) Guard against defensive body language. For example, crossing your arms when 
someone is offering their opinion could be your subconscious way of saying, ‘I’m closed to what 
you’re saying.’ (3) Counter the anxiety that comes with feeling attacked, by breathing deeply and 
silently praying, ‘Lord, I receive Your strength now.’ Combining this physical and spiritual act will 
help to minimise your emotional response. (4) If there is a genuine and credible justification for 
your action, state it in a calm, unemotional manner. And if you are really brave, ask a trusted friend 
or co–worker if you are being defensive. Then refuse to become defensive if the response is, 
‘Yes!’ (5) Don’t attack your attacker. Simply ask them what they would have done in the situation 
under discussion. Then thank them for sharing their insights. (6) If you are guilty of a bad decision 
or wrong behaviour, try admitting it before it comes to light. A simple ‘I made a mistake’ will give 
you credibility, preserve your integrity, and not allow your mistake to redefine who you are in the 
eyes of others. It may even increase their level of trust in you.

‘…He will see the blood…and…not permit the destroyer to enter your houses…’ Exodus 12:23 NIV 
Divine Protection
When the angel of death visited Egypt, only those whose doorposts were painted with lamb’s 
blood were protected from ‘the destroyer’. And the blood of Jesus [the Lamb of God] is still your 
best protection from the enemy who ‘…prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to 
devour.’ (1 Peter 5:8 NLT) His atoning death on the cross to secure forgiveness of our sins. 
(Ephesians 2:12–16) Christians have also been sealed with the Spirit of God (Ephesians 1:13), and 
our salvation is assured by the Lord (Romans 8:38–39). So when Satan confronts us he knows he 
cannot ultimately succeed... but he still wants to try and make us stumble. Generally speaking, he’s 
looking for an ‘easy mark’. Just like a thief who cases your house for a hole in your security, he’ll be 
on the lookout for a weakness in your life. But if you ‘put on the whole armour of God, [you’ll] ...be 
able to stand against the schemes of the devil’ (Ephesians 6:11 ESV), and he’ll have to move on. 
God put a hedge around Gomer, the prophet Hosea’s wife, a promise that He would always draw 
her back to her husband. He said, ‘…I will fence her in with thornbushes. I will block her path with a 
wall to make her lose her way.’ (Hosea 2:6 NLT) Before your family leaves home in the morning, 
remind them of Christ’s ultimate ‘hedge of protection’—His victory at the cross. Remind them to 
stand firm in the finished work of Jesus, wearing the whole armour of God (Ephesians 6:10–18). In 
prayer speak out His promises (Psalm 118:6, Psalm 27:1, James 4:7) and ask Him to safeguard you 
and your family throughout the day, directing all your paths away from wrong influences.

‘Those who look to Him are radiant…’ Psalm 34:5 NIV
Beauty Is an Inside Job
It’s said, ‘Beauty is in the eye of the beholder’, but you can waste your life trying to please the

from childhood… I’ve fretfully hung clothes of every size in my wardrobe… messed with make–up 
when I should have slapped on sunscreen and gone outside to play. I’ve eaten close to nothing in 
an effort to stay small… wasted time worrying I wasn’t pretty enough when I should have been 
enjoying the things that made me interesting. Throughout history the definition of beauty has 
shifted to reflect society. Sometimes we should be curvy, other times thin as a lathe; sometimes 
tanned, sometimes pale; sometimes with long hair, sometimes with short… We devote our 
energies to meeting the latest standards and… guess what? There’s always another mandate… We 
must seriously consider whose heart we’re trying to capture… God’s is the only one worth 
pursuing.’ Paul says, ‘…Don’t let the world around you squeeze you into its own mould, but let God 
re–mould your minds from within…’ (Romans 12:1–2 PHPS); ‘If anyone belongs to Christ…The old 
things have gone; everything is made new!’ (2 Corinthians 5:17 NCV) You won’t find the secret to 
inner beauty and peace by comparing yourself with the photoshopped models on magazine 
covers. That kind of image is unsustainable. You’ll find peace by asking God to remove the scales 
from your eyes and show you what you look like in His eyes. ‘Those who look to Him are radiant.’ 
The only healthy and lasting definition of beauty comes from God because He judges people by 
‘...what is in their hearts.’ (1 Samuel 16:7 CEV)

When You Don’t Understand
When you don’t understand what’s happening in your life, start with what you know for sure; 
namely, that God is good all the time, and His ‘…love for those who respect Him continues forever…’ 
(Psalm 103:17 NCV) He’s not fickle. He doesn’t bless you one day and curse you the next: His 
‘mercies…are new every morning.’ (Lamentations 3:22–23 KJV) But there are things God chooses to 
reveal to us, and ‘secret things’ He doesn’t—for our own good. Writer Beth Jones says: ‘If God 
keeps a secret from us, it’s for our benefit and the benefit of others… For example, He doesn’t go 
around blaming, tattling or disclosing our sins, weaknesses, unbelief, carnality, selfishness or pride 
to others. When things happen, God knows why… Secret things belong to the Lord. And when He 
reveals something to us, it’s because He wants us to walk in that truth by faith. For example, He 
reveals His character and His will in His Word… so we can live by faith knowing that He’s good, fair, 
kind, generous, merciful, faithful, gracious, patient, and He’s in the saving, healing, redeeming, 
restoring, sanctifying, and blessing business. Things revealed belong to us. When we don’t know 
why… here’s what we know for sure. God’s Word is truer than our circumstances or experiences… 
and just because He knows everything about us doesn’t mean He tells us about everything. We 
also know that when things look bad, God is still good.’ ‘The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken 
away; blessed be the name of the Lord.’ (Job 1:21 ESV) No matter what happens or doesn’t 
happen, at the end of the day—God is still in control and worthy of our praise!

Are You Struggling Financially? (1)
Donna Savage writes: ‘In my husband’s first years as a pastor our mortgage payment gobbled up 
half his income… I learned to replace panic with peace by praying for: Clarity. Money is linked to 
our self–esteem. It can trigger feelings of shame, fear, pride, and anger. But “understanding 
[God’s] Word brings light to the minds of ordinary people.” (Psalms 119:130 CEV) Creativity. If you 
want more money, you must earn more or spend less. We serve a creative God, and He rewards 
those who “…diligently seek Him.” (Hebrews 11:6 NKJV) Ask Him to show you how to increase your 
income. Connections. Kids are familiar with connect–the–dot puzzles, where you join a random 
collection of dots to produce an image you’d otherwise miss. It’s all about the right connections, 
and God can send the right people into your life with answers to your money problems. 
Contentment. Just like earthquakes expose structural weaknesses in buildings, financial pressure 
exposes our spiritual weakness. Paul said, “I have learned the secret of being content.” (Philippians 
4:12 NIV) Key phrase: I have learned. Hardship enrols us all in a basic contentment course, but we 
don’t all get the same homework. Some of us learn through financial hardship and proving God’s 
faithfulness for ourselves.’ Savage continues: ‘I’ve given God an “I can’t do this” ultimatum more 
than once… I’ve also celebrated the adventure of moment–by–moment dependence on His 
resources. I’ve proved God’s faithfulness in my prayers and in my pantry, and it’s never limited by

Get Over It!
Countless friendships are destroyed because one person gets offended by something the other 
one said or did. A mark of spiritual growth is how quickly you get over slights and insults; the more 
mature you are, the less time it takes to ‘forgive an offence’ and move on. One Christian writer 
says: ‘Okay, your friend ditches you and your feelings are hurt… or she’s too busy to return your 
phone call or email… or you’re out to dinner with another couple and the other man insults your 
husband in an attempt to be funny …Offences come…Jesus said they would (John 16:33). People 
are people. If you’ve been offended by a friend, or felt slighted, get over it! Hit the 
Control>Alt>Delete buttons. Don’t let bitterness even think about putting down roots… “Love…is 
not irritable…it keeps no record of being wronged…never gives up…and endures through every 
circumstance” (1 Corinthians 13:4–7 NLT) …It seems impossible…and without God’s love it is. So 
yield to His love, overlook offences and walk in love, because next week you’ll be the one needing 
unconditional love. When it comes to being perfect, we’ve all failed. If you want your friends to 
overlook your offences, be quick to overlook theirs.’ Make this your prayer today: ‘Father, thank 
You for the relationships You’ve blessed me with. I make a decision today to release anyone who 
has ever offended me in the slightest… to overlook it… forget about it, and move on. I will not keep

something about it. The procedure was delicate, requiring the surgeon to cut at just the right 
point… He was confident he could do it …but I was nervous… He did an excellent job and the only 
reminder I have is a slight scar …The Word of God is as delicate and precise as a surgeon skilfully 
removing a cyst from cartilage…He operates with perfection… slices away bad attitudes, thoughts, 
motives, and actions... When God speaks to you it’s for a purpose—to bring your life into 
conformity to Christ. And your response should always be, ‘Search me, O God, and know my 
heart…’ (Psalm 139:23 NIV) Let the Word of God highlight the areas in your life that need work. 
Don’t run from the process.’ Remember ‘…do not despise the discipline of the Almighty... He 
wounds, but He also binds up; He injures, but His hands also heal.…’ (Job 5:17–18 NIV)

‘This I recall to my mind, therefore I have hope.’ Lamentations 3:21 NAS
The Importance of God’s Sovereignty 
Lamentations chapter three describes Jeremiah’s despair, and how he conquered it. He opens 
with: ‘I am the man who has seen affliction…’ (Lamentations 3:1 NAS), and it intensifies as he lists 
all his troubles. The fact is, when our circumstances deteriorate, we can sound a lot like Jeremiah. 
At first he sounds like he’s blaming God for his afflictions. In prayer he recites his troubles and fears 
of being singled out as an object of public ridicule. No wonder he felt powerless and hopeless! 
(Lamentations 3:18) That kind of situation, handled badly, can initiate and intensify despair, 
depression and feed a negative outlook on life. But here’s the lesson to be learned: ‘This I recall to 
my mind, therefore I have hope.’ Jeremiah acknowledged God’s goodness and mercy: ‘Because of 
the Lord’s great love we are not consumed… His compassions never fail. They are new every 
morning; great is Your faithfulness.’ (Lamentations 3:22–23 NIV) He also acknowledged the Lord’s 
sovereignty in his trouble: ‘For the Lord... though He causes grief, yet He will show compassion 
according to the multitude of His mercies... Is it not from the mouth of the Most High that woe and 
well–being proceed?’ (Lamentations 3:31–38 NKJV) When you acknowledge the sovereignty of 
God in all things it gives your faith in Him a boost, no matter what! It doesn’t happen automatically; 
you have to deliberately refocus your thinking at the very time when you feel least like doing it. 
Notice: Jeremiah’s circumstances didn’t improve—his outlook did. He was reminded of the 
sovereign goodness and faithfulness of God—and his depression lifted: ‘“The Lord is my portion,” 
says my soul, “therefore I have hope in Him.”’ (Lamentations 3:24 NAS)

‘Love…keeps no record of being wronged...’ 1 Corinthians 13:4–5 NLT 
Dump Your Grudges!
Holding a grudge is costly, and you and the people in your life end up footing the bill! In all 
probability the offender has moved on, forgotten the offence and left you holding the bag. But in 
reality, blame, not the offender, is the crux of the problem. And until you understand and accept 
that, you will continue to be upset. Don’t let your grudges fester and turn into: (1) Self–
victimisation. Negative energy expended on others just drains your resources and robs you of the 
chance to fulfil your God–given potential. Stop cheating yourself. Don’t surrender your power to 
your grudges! (2) Bitterness. It’s like a deadly poison; a little of it can contaminate your entire 
system. The hurt you harbour pollutes the stream of your daily experience, including your 
experience with God! (3) Isolation. There’s no joy in being around someone who constantly 
indulges in blame, defensiveness and anger. Others pick up the vibes and feel at risk, so they keep 
a safe distance in case they become a target in the event that they displease you. It’s a formula for 
isolation and self–induced loneliness. (4) Negative role–modelling. Maybe you think, ‘My feelings 
are nobody’s business!’ Maybe—if you live on a desert island. Grudges are highly communicable. 
‘…Watch out that no poisonous root of bitterness grows up…corrupting many.’ (Hebrews 12:15 
NLT) (5) Sabotaged repentance. Genuine repentance and forgiveness aren’t possible until you’re 
willing to face up to your grudges. If you’re still blaming others, you’re avoiding responsibility. A 
bad attitude is like a flat tyre—until you change it, you’re not going to get anywhere.

‘…God created mankind in His own image…’ Genesis 1:27 NIV
Start Thinking Creatively (1)
The Bible calls you a ‘child of God’. Stop and consider what that means. God’s creativity is already 
built into your DNA; your job is to identify it, release it and put it to work. Writers and even ad–
men have recognised the great power of creativity is in its defeat of habit by originality. But for 
your creativity to be released, you must first identify the barriers and start taking them down. 
Here’s a common one: ‘We’ve always done it this way.’ People who say that have stopped thinking 
for themselves. They’re just putting in their time, waiting for a pay packet and going home at the 
end of the day without thinking, reflecting or even considering the possibilities of change. If you’re 
one of these people, it’s time to wake up and start looking around you. Mind–deadening routine is 
the cancer of creativity. If you mindlessly go about your business the same way every day, your 
routine is opening you up to mistakes. Why? Because, the chances are, your habits have caused 
you to lose the ability to think critically and question your methods. Start questioning policies, 
techniques, forms, rules, paperwork—anything that’s become routine. Ask, ‘Why do we do that? 
Is it even necessary? Can we do it better?’ On the farm of success there are no sacred cows. If you 
insist on doing things the way they’ve always been done, you’ll end up being out–thought, out–
sold, out–produced and finally out of business. So start thinking creatively.

‘Do you see a man skilful in his work? He will stand before kings; he will not stand before obscure 
men.’ Proverbs 22:29 ESV
Start Thinking Creatively (2)
God has given you the skills and creativity you need to succeed, but you need to steward them and 
continue stretching your capacity. In other words, thinking creatively. Film director Frank Capra 
said, ‘A hunch is creativity trying to tell you something.’ So if you’re part of a church or a business 
that continually throws up obstacles to productivity, forms barriers to originality and puts the 
brakes on momentum, it’s time to speak up. And if nobody will listen, it’s time to pray and ask God 
if you’re in the right place. An environment doesn’t just ‘happen’, it’s created by the people who 
live and work in it. People, systems and policies either stoke the fire of creativity or put it out. 
Alexander the Great once visited the famed teacher Diogenes and asked whether he could do 
anything for him. Diogenes replied, ‘Only stand out of my light.’ One of the best things you can do 
for a creative person is not to get in their way! Michelangelo, Rembrandt and Leonardo da Vinci all 
used the best equipment and went to extraordinary lengths to find the finest materials for their 
paints, brushes and canvas. And they’d be no different today. But don’t expect change to come 
easily. Insecure leaders tend to penalise honesty and feel threatened by creativity, especially 
when it suggests there’s a better way of doing things. But you owe it to God, to yourself and the 
people you work with to give it your best shot.

‘Diotrephes…does not acknowledge our authority…’ 3 John 1:9 ESV
Start Thinking Creatively (3)
Not everybody is willing to think creatively, and where it becomes problematic is when people 
disregard the authority of those who have been put in charge. The apostle John said: ‘I have 
written briefly to the church; but Diotrephes, who likes to take the lead among them and put 
himself first, does not acknowledge my authority and refuses to accept my suggestions or listen to 
me.’ Every organisation has at least one of these people; just make sure it’s not you. Author Phil 
Cooke says: ‘One of the most damaging sacred cows in organisations is basing employee status on 
seniority rather than talent. Yes, loyalty is important, but some of the most loyal employees I’ve 
ever met are loyal because of selfishness. They project loyalty to keep their jobs, retain their 
benefits, or hold on to their authority. Real loyalty is about innovation, original thinking and helping 
the company get to the next level… Every person has worth and is important. But a great leader 
always knows the people who bring the most value to the organisation. Those are the people to be 
developed, trained and cultivated. When you create an atmosphere of original thinking, you’ll have 
more loyalty than you’ll know what to do with. Most companies are so ignorant of how to develop 
an environment of innovation that if you’ll do it, you will have people coming from every direction 
to work with you.’ The apostle Paul practised and taught this principle: ‘We urge you… to recognise 
those who labour among you… and to esteem them very highly in love for their work’s sake…’ (1 
Thessalonians 5:12–13 NKJV) To become a creative thinker, you must value creative thinking.

‘...Having believed, you were marked…with a seal...’ Ephesians 1:13 NIV

If you are having doubts about your salvation, understand this clearly: the moment you trusted in 
Christ as your Saviour, His blood cleansed you from all sin. At that point ‘you were marked…with a 
seal, the promised Holy Spirit…guaranteeing [your]…redemption.’ (Ephesians 1:13–14 NIV) The 
Bible says, ‘You should not be like cowering fearful slaves. You should behave instead like God’s 
very own children, adopted into His family—calling Him, “Father, dear Father!” For the Holy Spirit 
speaks to us deep in our hearts and tells us we are God’s children. And since we are His children, we 
will share His treasures—for everything God gives to His Son, Christ, is ours too.’ (Romans 8:15–16 
NLT)
In the book of Ruth we read that ‘the custom…in Israel concerning redeeming…[was] one man took 
off his sandal…gave it to the other, and this was a confirmation...’ (Ruth 4:7 NKJV) Notice, the 
‘redeemer’ put on another man’s sandal, signifying his willingness to stand in his place. That’s what 
Jesus did for us at the cross. He stood in our shoes so we could stand before God in His—
redeemed and righteous! Don’t let doubt steal your joy. Refuse to go by your feelings. Make up 
your mind to believe what God says, for until you do you’ll be plagued by uncertainty. Study God’s 
Word until you can say with assurance, ‘...I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that He 
is able to keep what I have committed to Him until that Day.’ (2 Timothy 1:12 NKJV) Are you 
trusting in Christ as your Saviour? Then your salvation is not in doubt. The deal is sealed!

‘…If God has given you leadership ability, take the responsibility seriously…’ Romans 12:8 NLT
Characteristics of Godly Leadership
Leadership in business, politics and public service doesn’t automatically qualify you for leadership 
in church. J Oswald Sanders says, ‘The overriding need of the church... is for a leadership that’s 
authoritative, spiritual and sacrificial.’ Let’s look at each of those qualities: (1) Authoritative 
leadership. People respect leaders who are certain about where they’re going, and inspire 
confidence in those who choose to follow them. Tentative leaders don’t motivate others to get on 
board and stay on board. Uncertainty confuses and disheartens followers. People follow, almost 
without question, someone who’s wise, strong and faithful to what he or she believes. (2) Spiritual 
leadership. We’re attracted to leaders who are gifted and charismatic. But these natural 
characteristics alone aren’t enough. Followers can be captivated by human traits—often to their 
own cost. Don’t settle for being a popular ‘Pied Piper’. Godly leaders are committed to connecting 
their followers with Jesus, not with themselves! Do your people know, love and serve God more 
because of your leadership? If so, you’re a godly leader. (3) Sacrificial leadership. Would you still 
lead if, like Paul, you were betrayed, falsely accused, beaten, half–drowned, starved, stoned and 
left for dead? Godly leaders lead when it’s uncomfortable, inconvenient, unrewarding and costly. 
They’re dedicated to the sheep they’re responsible for, and the ‘Chief Shepherd’ they’re 
responsible to! They recognise that Jesus drafted and modelled the prototype of godly leadership 
at the cost of His own life: ‘To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an 
example, that you should follow in His steps.’ (1 Peter 2:21 NIV)

‘…Jesus…went around doing good…’ Acts 10:38 NIV
What Are You Called to Do?
Your value in God’s eyes was established at the Cross. The Bible says, ‘He who did not spare His 
own Son, but gave Him up for us all—how will He not also, along with Him, graciously give us all 
things?’ (Romans 8:32 NIV) Notice the words ‘all things’. We are all equal in Christ. But when it 
comes to your career, your value is determined by the problem you solve. That’s why we pay a 
cardiologist more money than a chef in a fast–food restaurant. Jesus was a problem solver. People 
were spiritually hungry so He said, ‘…I am the bread of life…’ (John 6:35 NIV) They were sick so He 
‘went about doing good…healing all.’ He discerned what He had, that others needed, and 
provided it for them. What do you have to offer? What would you attempt to do if you knew it was 
impossible to fail? You are not here by accident. God told Jeremiah, ‘Before I formed you in the 
womb I knew you; before you were born I sanctified you; I ordained you a prophet to the nations.’ 
(Jeremiah 1:5 NKJV) Everything God makes is to meet a need and solve a problem. So what are you 
called and gifted to do? That’s where you’ll find your highest level of joy! Think of your 
contribution to others as an assignment from God. Paul made tents to support his ministry. So your 
ministry may be supported by your job. But whether you are in a full–time ministry or a part–time 
ministry, don’t leave this earth until you have found and fulfilled what God called you to do.

‘…through love serve one another.’ Galatians 5:13 NKJV
Get Rid of Your Entitlement Attitude
The Bible says, ‘…through love serve one another.’ In other words, ‘Get rid of the you–owe–me 
attitude and develop an IOU mindset.’ Some of us think: (1) A lifetime job with good pay and a 
guaranteed retirement plan at sixty–five come with just being born. (2) Promotion is just a matter 
of time. (3) Forty hours a week is the maximum endurance for any worker. (4) The last hour of 
each day is there to make the transition to home easier. (5) A ten–minute coffee break should 
take at least half–an–hour. (6) A half–hour lunch break should take at least an hour–and–a–half. 
(7) An equal share of company profits belongs to all workers regardless of their contribution. What 
gives us our source of entitlement anyway? Part of it is found in the middle of the word 
entitlement itself: ‘title’. We think people ‘owe us’ because of the title we hold in their lives: 
mother, daughter, brother, wife, husband, friend, donor, pastor, employee, boss, etc. We treat 
our title as if it were a title deed that gives us the right to whatever benefit we expect. But life 
doesn’t work that way! When the Prodigal Son left home and landed in a pig sty, the Bible says, 
‘…no one gave him anything.’ (Luke 15:16 NKJV) Humbled and slapped with reality, he became 
willing to work in the servants’ quarters of his father’s house. Fortunately, his father loved him and 
restored him. But the point is, life ‘owes you’ nothing. God ‘owes you’ nothing. Anything we 
receive from Him is an act of His grace and benevolence. He has given us opportunities to study, 
work hard, grow, and sacrifice to get to where we want to be but ultimately we must remember 
that ‘Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights...’

‘…lay your hand upon your mouth.’ Proverbs 30:32 AMP
Making Yourself Look Good (1)
Your tongue is just centimetres from your brain, but the way some of us rattle on, you’d think our 
mouths and minds were kilometres apart! James says, ‘…The tongue…corrupts the whole body…’ 
(James 3:5–6 NIV) Ramona Cramer Tucker writes: ‘I admit I’m a talker …I don’t set out to break a 
confidence, but somehow my mouth kicks into gear before my brain… But God takes a clear stand 
on gossip. He knows loose lips can ruin another person’s reputation, introduce mistrust into a 
relationship, encourage the gossiper to embellish their tale, and cause them to sin by being 
tempted to lie when confronted… I love to share news, to be “in the know”, and because I’m 
wired this way it’s easy for me to spread gossip under the guise of being well–meaning, even 
prefacing my news with “I wish you’d pray for”… But just because my sharing is well–meant 
doesn’t mean it’s appropriate.’ The most common reason for making someone else look bad—is to 
make ourselves look good! We are like the proud Pharisee in the temple who stood alone and 
prayed, ‘…God, I thank you that I am not like other people…’ (Luke 18:11 NCV) The writer of 
Proverbs says, ‘If you have done foolishly in exalting yourself, or…thought evil, lay your hand upon 
your mouth.’ (Proverbs 30:32 AMP) It’s one thing to think bad thoughts—it’s another to voice 
them. The saying goes: ‘You can’t stop the birds from flying over your head, but you can stop them 
from building a nest in your hair!’ So do yourself and everybody around you a favour—practise 
putting your brain in gear before engaging your mouth.

When you’re upset, it’s tempting to ‘hand out other people’s dirty laundry’. But making yourself

righteous feeling turns to shame faster than you can walk away, hang up the phone, or hit 
“send”…I can’t emphasise enough how crucial it is to get control over your tongue. I wish someone 
had warned me to stop talking and start praying.’ A lady named Michelle learned her lesson the 
hard way. She was having lunch with a co–worker at a restaurant and they visited the ladies’ toilet. 
While they were fixing their hair they started to talk about people at work who drove them crazy. 
Immediately Michelle launched into a diatribe about Beth, a co–worker who had no idea how 
much trouble she created for the rest of the team. As Michelle prepared to launch into more 
specifics, a cubicle door opened and out walked Beth, flushed and upset. In a split second what felt 
like a pressure–relief session turned into an embarrassing mess… Beth ran out in tears, and 
Michelle couldn’t take back the words she’d said. Beth never returned to work, and the next day 
she resigned. While her co–workers openly cheered what they considered to be good news, 
Michelle was miserable… She tried to call Beth, and even wrote a letter of apology, but there was 
no response. And what’s worse, Michelle is a Christian and Beth made no such profession. Treat 
others the way you’d like to be treated (Matthew 7:12). What goes around comes around, and idle

‘…overwhelming victory is ours through Christ, who loved us.’ Romans 8:37 NLT
The Power to Solve the Problem
Everyone has problems. The only people who don’t—are in cemeteries. The real problem is—how 
we handle our problems. Often we try to solve them with our own power. How can you tell when 
you’re doing that? Because you’re tired all the time! You’re like the guy who said, ‘I’m sick and 
tired of being sick and tired.’ Or we’re like the lady who said, ‘Just about the time I manage to 
make ends meet, somebody moves the ends.’ We say things like, ‘I’m doing ok under the 
circumstances.’ Well, what are you doing under them? Someone has said that circumstances are 
like a mattress; if you’re on top you rest easy, but if you’re underneath you suffocate! What’s the 
answer? Take your focus off your problems and put it on God’s promises. Here’s one of them: 
‘Can anything ever separate us from Christ’s love? Does it mean He no longer loves us if we have 
trouble?...’ (Romans 8:35 NLT) Paul answers, ‘No, despite all these things, overwhelming victory is 
ours through Christ, who loved us.’ (Romans 8:37 NLT) The word ‘conqueror’ means ‘one who 
overcomes by gaining control’. And Paul says that we are ‘more than conquerors.’ (Romans 8:37 
NKJV) To be a conqueror means to fight a battle and win. To be more than a conqueror means to 
win a battle without having to fight. Jesus fights on your behalf; He does it in you, and through you, 
and that makes you ‘more than’ a conqueror.

‘…I will strengthen you and help you…’ Isaiah 41:10 NIV
The Power to Change
We go to seminars and conferences looking for a painless cure by which our lives can be zapped

weeks. Then we fall back into the same old rut. We don’t change. We read self–help books, but 
the problem with self–help books is that they tell us what to do but can’t give us the power to do 
it. We are told things like: ‘Get rid of all your bad habits. Be positive; don’t be negative.’ But how? 
Where do we get the power to change? The Greek word for ‘power’, dunamis, is used in the New 
Testament to describe the most powerful event that ever happened—the resurrection of Jesus 
Christ from the dead. And that resurrection power is available to change your life today. The most 
important thing in life is knowing Christ and experiencing the power of His resurrection. Paul 
writes, ‘I want to know Christ… to know the power of His resurrection…’ (Philippians 3:10 NIV) 
Again he writes, ‘I pray that you will begin to understand how incredibly great His power is to help 
those who believe in Him. It is that same mighty power that raised Christ from the dead…’ 
(Ephesians 1:19–20 TLB). This Greek word for ‘power’, dunamis, can be understood in two ways: 
(1) ‘dynamite’, which is an explosive force, or (2) ‘dynamo’, which is a constant flow of power. And 
in Christ, you have both. Through Him you can break the chains that bind you and the limits that 
constrain you, and walk victoriously in His power today.

Rules for Serving
When it comes to serving others, try to live by these three rules: (1) Serve sincerely. ‘Don’t just 
pretend to love others. Really love them…’ God knows your heart, so be honest with yourself about 
your true motives in serving and sacrificing for others. If you need help in this area, turn to the 
Scriptures: ‘For the Word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two–edged 
sword…and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.’ (Hebrews 4:12 NKJV) (2) Serve 
silently. ‘…when you do a charitable deed, do not sound a trumpet…that [you] may have glory 
from men…’ (Matthew 6:2 NKJV) Note the words, ‘do not sound a trumpet’. When people take 
your kindness for granted or fail to appreciate the things you do for them, don’t toot your own 
horn. Look to God for your reward, not people; otherwise you’ll be disappointed. ‘…as the eyes of 
servants look to the hand of their masters… so our eyes look to the Lord our God…’ (Psalm 123:2 
NKJV) (3) Serve selectively. You’re not called to go to every place, meet every need, and help every 
person. On two different occasions God stopped Paul from going into Asia to preach the Gospel. 
But look what happened next: ‘And a vision appeared to Paul in the night. A man of Macedonia 
stood and pleaded with him, saying, “Come over to Macedonia and help us.”…immediately we 
sought to go to Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to preach the Gospel to them.’ 
(Acts 16:9–10 NKJV) Why is this important to know? Because when God guides you, He provides 
for you!

Shake It Off
Here’s some good advice Jesus gave His disciples. When someone rejects you or won’t listen to 
you, ‘…shake the dust off your feet when you leave, as a testimony against them.’ When you 
experience rejection, you have two choices: allow it to affect your confidence and self–worth, or 
‘shake it off’ and move on. Now, Jesus was not talking about sincere minds that don’t understand, 
but proud minds that reject the truth. He was saying, ‘Don’t let it break your stride and keep you 
from accomplishing what needs to be done.’ When Paul was shipwrecked on the island of Malta, 
he was bitten by a snake while gathering firewood. Immediately the islanders said to one another, 
‘…this man is a murderer, whom, though he has escaped the sea, yet justice does not allow to live.’ 
(Acts 28:4 NKJV) How did Paul respond? ‘…he shook off the creature into the fire and suffered no 
harm.’ (Acts 28:5 NKJV) What did the islanders say about him then? ‘…they changed their minds 
and said that he was a god.’ (Acts 28:6 NKJV) Wow! People’s minds change like the wind! So don’t 
let their compliments puff you up, or their criticisms tear you down. God’s will is for you to help 
others. If they accept your help, give it. If not, go where you will be accepted and appreciated. 
Jesus said, ‘…I say to you, he who receives whomever I send, receives Me…’ (John 13:20 NKJV) In 
the final analysis it’s not you they are rejecting, but the One who sent you. Knowing that, gives you 
confidence and peace of mind.

‘You will keep in perfect peace all who trust in You…’ Isaiah 26:3 NLT
Are You Afraid? Trust God!
Fear is a normal part of living. And the most successful and confident people you know experience 
it. The difference is they refuse to be ruled by fear because they know that, when it gets out of 
control, it can paralyse you. The Bible says, ‘…fear involves torment…’ (1 John 4:18 NKJV) 
Neuroscientists at Yale University discovered that patients who expected to experience an electric 
shock had anxiety levels similar to those who responded to the real thing. Researcher Elizabeth 
Phelps writes, ‘A lot of our fears and anxieties are learned through communication. If someone 
tells you to be afraid of a dog, then the brain responds as if you actually were.’ In other words, our 
brains don’t know the difference between real and imagined threats. This goes a long way toward 
explaining why the National Institute of Mental Health reported that almost twenty million 
Americans suffer from anxiety disorders. Someone who’s perfectly safe, but has a fear of being 
robbed, suffers just as much as someone living in a situation with a high risk of robbery, or 
someone actually in the act of being robbed. Because our brains don’t discriminate between 
emotions that are real or imagined, fear can dominate our lives, and it’s just as devastating as 
physical injury. Psychologist Marilyn Barrick said, ‘For the most part, fear is nothing but an illusion. 
When you share it with someone, it tends to disappear.’ So share your fears with God and watch 
them begin to disappear. The Bible says, ‘You will keep in perfect peace all who trust in You, all 
whose thoughts are fixed on You!’

about soldiers who were captured, tortured and starved by the Japanese in the Malay Peninsula in 
World War II. As a result they started acting like animals, clawing, fighting and stealing food. In an 
effort to turn things around, the group decided to start reading the New Testament. And as 
Gordon read it to them they were converted to Christ, and this community of animals was 
transformed into a community of love. That’s because Jesus is God and is willing to live in the 
hearts of those who trust Him. He offers joy, peace, a transformed life and assurance of eternal 
life to all those who place their trust in His atoning death. So what are you using to try to fill the 
void in your life? Material possessions? Mood–altering substances? Sex? Career success? The 
pursuit of intellectual growth? Excitement? You may as well give it up now—it won’t work! Paul 
explained it like this to the philosophers in Athens: ‘…God…made the world and everything in it… 
He…gives life…to everything… He satisfies every need… His purpose was [that we should] seek after 
God…feel [our] way towards Him and find Him—though He is not far from…us. For in Him we live 
and move and exist…’ (Acts 17:24–28 NLT) In the words of the time–honoured hymn: ‘Now none 
but Christ can satisfy; none other name for me. There’s love, and life, and lasting joy, Lord Jesus, 
found in Thee.’

‘…what will be the sign of Your coming?...’ Matthew 24:3 NKJV
Signs of the Times (1) 
When the disciples came to Jesus and asked Him, ‘…what will be the sign of Your coming, and of 
the end of the age?’, He told them things were going to get worse before they got better. Then He 
added these words: ‘…see to it that you are not alarmed…’ (Matthew 24:6 NIV) The word ‘alarmed’ 
is one Jesus used only on this occasion; it means ‘to wail, to cry aloud’. In essence, what He was 
saying is this: ‘Don’t fall apart when bad things happen.’ For the next few days let’s look at some of 
the signs Jesus said would herald His return. Spiritual deception. ‘…Watch out that no one deceives 
you. For many will come in My name, claiming, “I am the Messiah,” and will deceive many.’ 
(Matthew 24:4–5 NIV) Notice, there’ll be many deceived, as well as many deceivers. Jesus also said 
they’ll come ‘in My name’, masquerading as ministers of God and claiming special status and 
superior spirituality. They’ll boast of insider information and adorn their teachings with phrases like 
‘God told me,’ implying they have access to information the common people like you don’t have. 
Don’t be misled. Jesus also warned, ‘…false Messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform 
great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect.’ (Matthew 24:24 NIV) Multitudes 
and miracles—when you see them, be careful. Satan can counterfeit both. Be doctrinally diligent. 
Focus on one question: ‘Is this person pointing listeners to the real, Biblical Jesus?’ There is only 
room for one name on the marquee—and that’s His!

‘…wars and rumours of wars…’ Matthew 24:6 NIV 
Signs of the Times (2)
Jesus said: ‘You…hear of wars and rumours of wars… see to it that you are not alarmed. Such 
things must happen, but the end is still to come. Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom 
against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. All these are the 
beginning of birth pains.’ Those who suffered through two world wars have no difficulty 
comprehending the word ‘wars’. But for the next six decades or so, their children and 
grandchildren had a more limited concept of what war meant. To them, wars were mostly regional 
and overseas but not on the homeland. Then came 9/11, and Americans began to understand the 
words, ‘Men’s hearts failing them for fear…’ (Luke 21:26 NKJV) Some dates will forever stand out in 
our memory. Like the day President Kennedy was assassinated, and the day three thousand 
people perished in the World Trade Centre. Today the political rationale is if we fight terrorism 
‘over there’, we won’t have to fight it here at home. But don’t be deceived. Borders will always 
need checkpoints. War correspondents will always have jobs. The world will never see lasting 
peace this side of Heaven. Jesus said, ‘…All these are the beginning of birth pains.’ Rejoice! God is 
still on the throne. His plan is still being worked out. The death throes of the old order we live in are 
the ‘birth pains’ of a new and glorious order, when Christ will return to set up His Kingdom. An old 
Prudential Insurance Company slogan says, ‘Get a piece of the rock.’ But when you’re trusting in

‘…you will be…put to death…because of Me.’ Matthew 24:9 NIV 
Signs of the Times (3)
Jesus said to His disciples: ‘...you will be handed over to be persecuted…put to death, and…hated 
by all nations because of Me. At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and 
hate each other, and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people. Because of the 
increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold.’ (Matthew 24:9–12 NIV) Notice the words 
‘put to death’. Heaven is filled with those who have already fulfilled this prophecy—and hatred of 
Christians still abounds. Voice of the Martyrs, a Christian agency that defends religious liberties, 
contends that more of Christ’s followers have been killed for their faith in the last century than in 
most of the previous centuries combined. The global evangelism movement reports an average of 
165,000 martyrs a year, more than four times the number in the past century. Today countries that 
facilitate religious freedom are experiencing increasing hostility toward Christians. Professors 
publicly mock Bible–believing students. TV talk show hosts denigrate people of faith. We can 
expect the persecution to increase, and when it does, fragile convictions will collapse and ‘…the 
love of many will grow cold.’ (Matthew 24:12 NLT) The half–hearted will become the cold–hearted. 
Spiritual stowaways will jump ship. Many church attendees will be exposed as faith pretenders. 
They’ll not only leave the faith, they’ll make the lives of the faithful miserable. When these things 
begin to happen, Jesus counselled, ‘…See to it that you are not alarmed…’ (Matthew 24:6 NIV) 
When the outlook is bleak, the ‘…blessed hope…’ (Titus 2:13 AMP) of Christ’s return calms our 
fears.

‘…this Gospel…will be preached in all the world…’ Matthew 24:14 NKJV
Signs of the Times (4)
Jesus said when we see calamity and apostasy, don’t give in to fear because they’re signs of His 
imminent return. ‘But he who endures to the end shall be saved. And this Gospel of the Kingdom 
will be preached in all the world as a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come.’ 
(Matthew 24:13–14 NKJV) Every prophecy concerning Christ’s first coming was fulfilled in detail, 
and so will every prophecy concerning His second coming. Our mandate is to work, pray, give, and 
take the Gospel to the whole world—then Christ will return. Though the church is winnowed down 
like Gideon’s army, and the world is in a state of upheaval, don’t overreact. ‘Be still in the presence 
of the Lord, and wait patiently for Him to act. Don’t worry about evil people who prosper or fret 
about their wicked schemes.’ (Psalm 37:7 NLT) God’s hand is still on the wheel. ‘…the Most High 
rules in the kingdom of men…’ (Daniel 4:17 NKJV) Avoid Pollyanna optimism. Though you may be 
personally blessed, the world order as you know it will continue to disintegrate. But that doesn’t 
mean you should join the ‘Chicken Licken chorus’ and declare, ‘The sky’s falling down!’ Don’t give 
in to the extremes of blind denial or blatant panic. When the bombs of World War II levelled 
Warsaw, only one skeletal structure remained standing on the city’s main street. It was the British 
and Foreign Bible Society, and on its walls was clearly written: ‘Heaven and earth shall pass away,

‘You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good…’ Genesis 50:20 NIV
Are You Selling Your Dream?
In the movie Up in the Air, actor George Clooney is hired by a major corporation to handle big lay–
offs. His job is to fire people. In one scene when he’s about to fire an ageing middle manager, he 
notices on the man’s CV that he’d been trained as a French chef. As the man expresses despair 
over losing his job, Clooney reminds him of his original dream and asks him this soul–searching 
question: ‘Back when you started, how much did it take to buy you away from your dream?’ At 
that pivotal moment the middle manager thought back to the time he decided to settle for a 
steady pay packet in exchange for what he really wanted to do with his life. Are you doing that? 
Understand this: the day you were born God had a track for you to run on and an assignment for 
you to fulfil. So the question you must ask yourself is this: ‘Is the difficult situation I’m in right now 
a God–given opportunity for me to go back and fulfil the dream God gave me in the first place?’ 
Looking back on the most painful chapter in his life, when he was betrayed by his family, Joseph 
said, ‘You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good.’ His greatest loss led Joseph to the 
fulfilment of the dream God gave him in the beginning. Is that your story too? Are you realising 
that you’ve settled for second best, and now God’s giving you a second chance; a chance to do the 
thing He put you in the world to do?

‘…go and tell him his fault between you and him alone…’ Matthew 18:15 NKJV
Sometimes You Must Confront
Jesus said, ‘…if your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone. 
If he hears you, you have gained your brother.’ Confronting someone requires these three things: 
character, courage and caution. Let’s look at each: (1) Character. Since Jesus was secure in His 
identity and character as God’s Son, He was able to let go of the need to please and be accepted 
by those around Him. Being grounded in who you are in Christ and in what your heavenly Father 
created you to be, allows you the freedom to confront people when necessary without worrying 
about the fall–out or the negative consequences. (2) Courage. The Pharisees had the power to 
undermine Christ’s reputation, which eventually led to His death on the cross. But He told them 
the truth nonetheless. And you must do the same. You must be willing to take up your cross and 
follow Him, even when it means risking an argument and handling hurt feelings. To ‘confront’ 
means to get in ‘front’ of someone, look into their face, and deal with the issue honestly and 
lovingly because you value the relationship. (3) Caution. Make sure you’re following God’s timing 
and not your own. It’s easy to use false courage or bravado to challenge others in order to get your 
own way. It’s easy to claim a confrontation is necessary, when what you actually want is control. 
No, you must ask God to show you when, how and where to confront others. Your goal should 
always be to reconcile and restore the relationship. So ‘go and tell him [or her]’.

‘Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.’ Proverbs 27:6 NKJV
Can You Give and Receive Correction?
The word ‘correction’ is not one we are always comfortable with. It sometimes recalls memories of 
frowning parents and painful consequences. Or we think of the risk of destroying a relationship 
rather than the possibilities of strengthening and enriching it. ‘Faithful are the wounds of a friend, 
but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.’ We all need someone to tell us the truth because others 
have 20/20 vision where we have blind spots. Yes, someone may react defensively, but they may 
also be thrilled to realise you care more about their ultimate well–being than their immediate 
response to you. Corrections made from a loving spirit, not a self–righteous, ‘I–know–what’s–
best’ attitude are usually well received. If others sense you are genuinely concerned for them and 
long for a better relationship, they are likely to consider what you have to say and be open to 
making changes. Think of the courage Nathan the prophet showed in confronting David over his sin 
with Bathsheba. As king, David held the power of life and death over him. But Nathan loved David 
too much to allow sin to rob him of his destiny. God often uses us in each other’s lives to restore us 
to the narrow yet rich paths of destiny that He has preordained. Looking back, David could say, 
‘Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now I keep Your Word.’ (Psalm 119:67 NKJV) There are 
times when wisdom says, ‘Mind your own business and stay out of it.’ And there are other times 
when wisdom says, ‘Because you love them, get involved.’

‘Many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall increase.’ Daniel 12:4 NKJV
Information Overload! (1)
Technology lets us do things we’ve never been able to do, but it can be addictive. You can become 
tied to it in ways that are exhausting. One expert notes: ‘There’s a strong tendency for humans to 
do everything they’re able to. Combine that with constant connectivity, and the workday need 
never end. It’s easy to contact anyone anytime, and with information always available on line you 
can keep clicking forever.’ Paul writes about ‘making the most of your time.’ (Ephesians 5:16 NAS) 
We say, ‘Time is money,’ but in actuality time is much more valuable, because it’s a non–
renewable resource. Once spent, it’s gone forever. Managing information overload means re–
establishing boundaries that technology has demolished. So:
Recognise the signs: if you communicate with people all day yet you’re still lonely, chances are, 
technology is dominating your life. Take baby steps: make yourself unavailable for short periods 
and see what happens. The wheels of industry won’t grind to a halt! Remember you have a choice: 
people who think they should be available 24/7 exaggerate their own importance or the control 
others have over them. Establish boundaries: rein in the emails, instant messages and on–line 
feeds. Do you really need all those ‘FYI’s’ about the same thing? Give clear instructions: tell people 
you answer emails at designated times throughout the day, and let them know who to contact for 
an immediate response. Make a task list: that way if you’re interrupted you’ll get back on track 
faster. Stick to a schedule: constantly dipping in and out on the computer is classic self–
interruption. Do a reality check: after a few minutes of surfing the web ask yourself, ‘Should I be 
doing this now?’

Information Overload! (2)
When you’re constantly multi–tasking, important things can fall between the cracks. A lawyer who 
negotiated an unbelievable deal in favour of his client was asked how he did it. He replied, ‘I was 
the only person at the meeting that day who didn’t spend the whole time text messaging!’ A 
respected researcher says we’ve trained our brains ‘to constantly flit around the universe of 
messages and information, seeking brief hits of excitement. Grazing ceaselessly, we never dig too 
deeply before moving on to the next distraction…and it ratchets up our stress levels in ways we’re 
only starting to understand.’ Another expert says: ‘We get more information in 72 hours than our 
parents received in a month, and most people don’t have the skills to deal with it. They let new 
things in, but don’t get rid of old information they wanted to act on.’ 
When was the last time you enjoyed some relaxed, uninterrupted down time? Can you even 
remember? We’re so results–oriented that unless we’re doing something that can be quantified, 
we think it’s a waste of time. The fact is you need time away from the unrelenting onslaught of 
information to regroup, reflect and recharge. Jesus had a schedule to keep, people to minister to, 
disciples depending on Him, and a short time to do it all. Nevertheless, ‘He withdrew…into the 
wilderness, and prayed.’ (Luke 5:16 KJV) Now, since ‘the servant is not greater than his lord,’ do 
you think you’re above all that? Are you wiser than He? Or more spiritual? Jesus said, ‘Come… 
apart…and rest a while’ (Mark 6:31 KJV), because when you don’t come apart, you fall apart!

How’s Your Self–Talk These Days?
When John Roebling devised a plan to build a bridge between Manhattan and Brooklyn, experts 
thought it was impossible. They said a bridge spanning that distance couldn’t withstand the winds 
and tides. But Roebling refused to concede defeat; instead, he and his son, Washington, worked to 
solve the problems. Then just as construction was about to start, Roebling was killed in an 
underwater accident that left his son brain–damaged and unable to walk or talk. The prevailing 
wisdom was to abandon the project, but Washington Roebling was determined to fulfil his father’s 
dream. He developed a system of communication by touching a finger to his wife’s arm, and she in 
turn conveyed his ideas to the project engineers. For thirteen years that’s how he supervised 
construction—and in 1883 the first car drove across the Brooklyn Bridge. The ‘impossible’ had 
become reality! Are you facing a seemingly impossible situation at home, on the job, with your 
finances, or in a relationship? If so, what you tell yourself about it is important. Your self–talk sets 
you up for joy or misery. You can tell where your faith is by what comes out of your mouth: ‘Good 
people bring good things out of the good they stored in their hearts…’ (Luke 6:45 NCV) One pastor 
says: ‘When the pressure’s on, what comes out of your mouth lets you know if you need to make 
some adjustments… When you want something to show up in your outward man, deposit God’s 
Word in the inward man. Feed on it continually… once you believe it, you’ll find yourself saying it,

Going Out on a Limb
Risk. Some people are naturally cautious and some revel in risk. Jon Walker says: ‘If God tells you to 
take a step of faith but you hesitate to take it until he shows you what the second step will be, 
you’re not waiting on God. He’s waiting on you.’ Patience is no excuse for hesitation. ‘God uses 
risks, large and small, to push us into a deeper faith. And so he wants us to step forward in faith, 
even if we don’t know where the second step will take us. The not knowing is what requires faith, 
and the not knowing compels us to rely on God to guide us forward.’
The Bible says, ‘If you wait for perfect conditions, you’ll never get anything done.’ (Ecclesiastes 11:4 
TLB) Helen Keller said, ‘Security is mostly a superstition. It doesn’t exist in nature nor do the 
children of men as a whole experience it… Life is either a daring adventure, or nothing.’ If you want 
‘more than you ever dreamed’, you’ve got to go out on a limb. That’s where the best fruit is. 
Acting in faith with no ‘earthly’ guarantee what’s on the other side means attempting something 
you couldn’t possibly do unless God gave you the ability. Jon Walker goes on: ‘Faith grows when 
we take risks—not just any kind of risks, but ones specifically directed by God. These God–nudges 
push us beyond the borders of our “independent states” into “the promised land” of life by faith.’

‘Do all things without complaining…’ Philippians 2:14 NKJV
Stop Complaining (1)
A lady who worked at the post office was approached by a customer who said, ‘I can’t write. 
Would you mind addressing this postcard for me?’ After addressing it for him and writing a short 
message, the postal clerk asked, ‘Is there anything else I can do for you, sir?’ The man thought for 
a moment and said, ‘Yes, could you add a P.S. at the end saying, “Please excuse the sloppy 
handwriting.”’ Now, there’s gratitude for you! The Bible says, ‘Do all things without complaining’ 
because when you don’t, you end up hurting: (1) Yourself. Complaining leads to anger and 
depression. God loves you and He doesn’t want you hurting yourself. (2) God. Complaining calls 
into question God’s care, His character and His competence. In reality, what you’re saying is, ‘Lord, 
You blew it! You had a chance to fulfil my demands and You chose not to.’ (3) Others. Your words 
affect the people around you and nobody enjoys spending time with a member of ‘the cold–water 
bucket brigade’. Complaining temporarily satisfies our selfish nature, but it changes nothing. When 
you complain, you explain your pain for no gain. But here’s the good news: The Bible says, ‘…the 
people became like those who complain of adversity…’ (Numbers 11:1 NAS) You didn’t start out as 
a complainer; you ‘became’ that way, and by God’s grace you can become a thanks–giver! Once 
you acknowledge your habit of moaning and fault–finding, it becomes possible to choose a better 
one. A bad habit is like a nice soft bed; it’s easy to get into and hard to get out of. So if you’ve fallen

If you think complaining is no big deal, read this: ‘…when the people complained…the Lord

some in the outskirts of the camp.’ A wise man once said, ‘I complained that I had no shoes, until I 
met a man who had no feet.’ God has blessed you in 101 different ways, and He doesn’t want to 
hear you whining. What were the Israelites grumbling about anyway? ‘Adversity’. For some of us 
adversity comes through illness. For others it’s a faltering career, not enough money to pay the 
bills, or a family situation that happened years ago and now you’re left shouldering the 
responsibility. Some of us made poor decisions earlier in life, and as a result our plans fell apart. 
Now we’re struggling with marital problems, blended families, and the consequences of our 
choices. We all have to deal with some level of adversity. We each have something in our life that 
God doesn’t want to hear us griping about! Understand this: it’s hard to live with adversity but, 
when you complain, you forego the grace that’ll get you through it. By choosing to complain and 
cling to the image of a perfect life, you forfeit the grace that’s available to you and will bring you 
victory. So change your way of thinking. Get down on your knees and pray: ‘Lord, I want the 
landscape of my life to be different; to experience the joy You give to those who leave the 
wilderness of ingratitude and move into the Promised Land of thanksgiving.’ That’s a prayer that

‘…Naaman…went away in a rage.’ 2 Kings 5:12 NLT
Don’t Be Inflexible
As a general in the Syrian army, Naaman was accustomed to having things his own way. So when 
Elisha told him to dip seven times in the muddy Jordan River to be healed of leprosy, he ‘went 
away in a rage’. He said, ‘I expected him to wave his hand over the leprosy and call on the name of 
the Lord his God and heal me!’ (2 Kings 5:11 NLT) Fortunately, he listened to his servants, 
swallowed his pride and received a miracle. There are important lessons here. Since all progress 
calls for adapting to change and overcoming obstacles, ask yourself: (1) What’s at the core of my 
fear and anger over this situation? Am I afraid of the unknown and the changes it may bring? (2) 
Am I being inflexible and trying to impose my will in this situation? Am I willing to forfeit God’s 
perfect will by resisting a change He’s orchestrating? Many of us miss God’s best. Why? Like 
Naaman, we are accustomed to being waited on and having our ego stroked. E.G.O. means Edging 
God Out! Are you doing that? (3) Am I being lazy or incompetent, not wanting to invest the 
necessary time and effort into the change? Unless you’re willing to change, you won’t grow. And if 
you don’t grow, you won’t position yourself to receive the blessing God has in mind for you. 
Charles Franklin Kettering said, ‘The world hates change, yet it is the only thing that has brought 
progress.’ Today ask God for the emotional and spiritual strength to embrace the changes He’s 
bringing into your life, and to help you to see them as being for your good (Romans 8:28).

You Need Friends Who Encourage You
If you’re wise, you’ll surround yourself with people who support you emotionally and spiritually, 
and you can share your dreams and ideas with them. CS Lewis and JRR Tolkien were members of 
The Inklings, an informal literary discussion group associated with Oxford University. It was 
comprised of teachers, writers and friends who met regularly at a well–known Oxford pub to 
discuss passages from their favourite books as well as their own writings. In 1936, they decided the 
world needed more novels that had faith and morality as their central theme. Lewis and Tolkien 
decided to write science fiction after realising the inferior quality of similar stories being published 
at the time. They literally tossed a coin to decide who would write a book on space travel versus 
time travel. Tolkien got the time travel nod, but his early efforts with such a story never really 
worked out. Later, however, he achieved great success with The Lord of The Rings. Lewis wrote his 
famous series of novels called The Space Trilogy, and from that momentum he eventually penned 
The Chronicles of Narnia. Now, you may not reach that level of success, but you’ll go further with 
the encouragement of true friends than you will without it. So ask yourself what’s involved in 
cultivating the kinds of friendships that’ll help you fulfil your God–given potential. It may mean 
coming out of your shell and reaching out to others. Could you encounter hurt and rejection? Sure! 
But you’ll succeed only if you’re willing to take that chance.

‘A tithe of everything…belongs to the Lord…’ Leviticus 27:30 NIV
Give God His Tithe (1)
If you put your mortgage before your gifts to God, you show more gratitude to your bank than you 
do to the One who made you. You say, ‘I earned it, so I own it.’ No. The Bible says, ‘The earth is the 
Lord’s, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it.’ (Psalm 24:1 NIV) God owns every 
square metre of land on earth and every person who walks on it—including you. You’re not an 
owner, you’re a steward! And while a good steward deserves to be well rewarded by his master, 
his first priority is to please him and carry out his will. The Bible says, ‘A tithe of everything… belongs 
to the Lord…’ Get your thinking straight on this issue! In God’s eyes 10 per cent of your income is 
‘dedicated funds’ to be used for one thing only—His purposes on the earth. Tithing isn’t how the 
church raises its budget; it’s how God raises His children. We distort God’s Word when we teach 
tithing as a means of getting money to pay off church debt, or as a substitute for other worn–out 
methods of fundraising, or as a cure–all for the church’s financial shortfalls. The Bible says, ‘…son 
(daughter)… give Me your heart…’ (Proverbs 23:26 NIV) When God has your heart’s deepest 
affection you’ll give gladly, not grudgingly. The first man in Scripture to tithe was Abraham. Why did 
he do it? Gratitude, because God had delivered him from the hand of an enemy who was out to 
destroy him. Has God delivered you? Has He blessed you? Then show your gratitude by giving Him 
His portion!

changing dream, and when he woke the next morning he told God, ‘…of all that You give me, I will 
give You a tenth.’ Note, this was hundreds of years before the Law of Moses was instituted, which 
said, ‘A tithe of everything…belongs to the Lord…’ (Leviticus 27:30 NIV) Jacob wasn’t motivated by 
law, he was motivated by love for God. You can give without loving; some folks give under 
pressure, or to impress others or to get an income tax deduction. But you can’t love without giving! 
The Bible says, ‘For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son…’ (John 3:16 KJV) 
You’re never more like God than when you’re in the act of giving. Jesus said, ‘…seek first the 
Kingdom of God, and His righteousness; and all these things shall be added to you.’ (Matthew 6:33 
NKJV) Tithing is about putting God and His Kingdom first. When self, home, business and pleasure 
come first in your life, your priorities are out of whack. Tithing reverses that order and puts God 
where He rightfully belongs—in first place. When God instructs you to tithe, He’s telling you to 
establish the habit of putting Him in the number one slot as a life principle. When you do, Jesus 
said ‘all these things’ you’re so concerned about will be ‘added to you’.

‘Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse…’ Malachi 3:10 NIV 
Give God His Tithe (3)
When you honour the Lord in your business, He will bless your business. Imagine the advantage 
you’d have in the marketplace with God as your partner! Many famous Christian business people 
throughout history were faithful tithers, including Henry John Heinz of Heinz 57 Varieties, and 
William Colgate, the toothpaste magnate. Some of these people were so blessed that, before their 
lives were over, they gave God 90 per cent of their income and lived on the other 10 per cent. God 
says: ‘Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in My house. Test Me in 
this…and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of Heaven and pour out so much blessing that 
you will not have room enough to store it…all the nations will call you blessed…’ (Malachi 3:10–12 
NIV) When you demonstrate that God’s business means more to you than your own, He will 
prosper you. And He invites you to ‘test’ Him in this. How long have you known that you should 
tithe, wanted to tithe, said you were going to, and yet you’ve never got round to it? Start now—
and start with what you have! What you can do now is the only influence you have over your 
future. John D Rockefeller is reputed to have made the following statement concerning the habit 
of tithing: ‘I never would’ve been able to tithe the first million dollars I made if I hadn’t tithed my 
first salary, which was a dollar fifty per week.’ Tithing demonstrates that you’ve conquered self–
interest and the fear of lack. It’s a demonstration of faith—and God always rewards faith!

‘…those who fear Him lack nothing.’ Psalm 34:9 NIV 
Give God His Tithe (4)
There are three kinds of givers: the flint, the sponge and the honeycomb. To get even a spark from 
a flint you have to hammer it. To get anything out of a sponge you have to squeeze it. But a 
honeycomb just overflows with sweetness. Which kind of giver would you like to be? The Psalmist 
writes, ‘Taste and see that the Lord is good; blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him…for those 
who fear Him lack nothing.’ (Psalm 34:8–9 NIV) Tithing is an act of worship. Of the 100 to 110 hours 
you’re awake each week, one–third to one–half generally involve earning money. So when you 
give God your money, you’re giving Him your brain, your brawn and yourself. When you go to the 
Lord’s house on the Lord’s Day, partake of the Lord’s Supper and put the Lord’s tithe into the 
Lord’s treasury, it’s an act of profound worship. Now, let’s be clear: a God who paves Heaven’s 
streets with gold isn’t going to go broke because you don’t give Him a tithe of your income. The act 
of tithing isn’t about the tithe; it’s about the attitude of the tither to the Creator. It’s not about the 
gift; it’s about the attitude of the giver to the Giver. It’s not about the money; it’s about the 
attitude of the man or woman to the Maker. It’s not about possessions; it’s about the attitude of 
the loved ones to the Lover. As the songwriter Isaac Watts said, ‘Were the whole realm of nature 
mine; that were an offering far too small. Love so amazing, so divine, demands my soul, my life, my 
all.’

‘Carry each other’s burdens…’ Galatians 6:2 NIV
Find People Who Believe in You
Mark Twain said, ‘Keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions. Small people always 
do that, but the really great make you feel that you, too, can become great.’ Why does the Bible 
say, ‘Carry each other’s burdens’? Because one person can only carry a burden so far on their own. 
American novelist John Kennedy Toole quickly discovered that. As a young writer he worked alone 
writing a novel in New Orleans. When it was finished he sent it to publisher after publisher, but 
they all turned him down. Overcome by rejection, he took his own life. Some time after the 
funeral, his mother found a coffee–stained manuscript in the attic and took it to a professor at 
Louisiana State University who agreed to read it. Immediately he recognised its genius and 
recommended it to a major publisher. After its release, John Kennedy Toole’s novel, A 
Confederacy of Dunces, won a Pulitzer Prize and was heralded as one of the major novels of the 
twentieth century. If only he’d surrounded himself with friends who knew how to share his 
burden, encourage him when he faced rejection and motivate him to keep going, his life would 
have turned out very differently. So the word for you today is—‘Find people who believe in you.’ 
Encourage and support them, and welcome their support in return. Spend more time with those 
who sharpen you and make you better, and less time with those who drain your energy, time and 
talent. The truth is, friends who speak encouragement into your life are priceless. Their words are 
‘Like apples of gold in settings of silver…’ (Proverbs 25:11 NIV)

‘…meditate on these things…and the God of peace will be with you.’ Philippians 4:8–9 NKJV
Always Keep a Good Attitude 
When you’re going through bad times, your goal should be to keep a good attitude. And with 
God’s help you can. Dr Viktor Frankl, a Nazi Holocaust camp survivor, said: ‘If a prisoner felt that he 
could no longer endure the realities of camp life, he found a way out in his mental life—an 
invaluable opportunity to dwell in the spiritual domain, the one that the SS was unable to destroy. 
Spiritual life strengthened the prisoner, helped him to adapt, and thereby improved his chances of 
survival.’ Here is some practical advice on keeping a good attitude in bad times: (1) Always believe 
the best about others, but don’t get bent out of shape when they disappoint you. Nobody is 
perfect, including you. Just be grateful for the people that bring joy and endeavour to be counted 
among them. (2) When you are tempted to retaliate, judge or become impatient, say to yourself, 
‘This is an opportunity for me to model a great attitude for the glory of God.’ You say, ‘But this 
person is driving me crazy.’ Then refuse to be a ‘passenger’ and go along with them. Take back the 
wheel, get into the driver’s seat of your life, and determine which direction you’ll go and what 
attitude you’ll have. The Bible says: ‘…whatever things are true, whatever things are noble, 
whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things 
are of good report, if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy—meditate on these 
things…and the God of peace will be with you.’

‘…perfect love expels all fear…’ 1 John 4:18 NLT
God’s Forgiveness, Mercy, and Grace (1)
God cares about you too much to leave you in any doubt about His love. The Bible says His ‘perfect 
love expels all fear.’ If God loved us with an imperfect love, we’d have cause to worry. Human love 
is flawed; it keeps a checklist of our sins and shortcomings—and consults it often. God keeps no 
such list. His love casts out our fear because it casts out our guilt. John writes, ‘…if our heart 
condemns us, God is greater than our heart…’ (1 John 3:20 NKJV) When you feel unforgiven, 
question your feelings but don’t question God. Go back to His Word; it outranks self–criticism and 
self–doubt. Nothing fosters confidence like a clear grasp of God’s grace, and nothing fosters fear 
like ignorance of it. The fact is if you haven’t accepted God’s grace, you’re doomed to live in fear. 
No pill, pep talk, psychiatrist or earthly possession can put your mind at ease. Those things may 
help numb your fear, but they can’t eradicate it. Only God’s grace can do that. Have you accepted 
Christ’s forgiveness? If not, get down on your knees and do it now. The Bible says, ‘If we confess 
our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us…and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.’ (1 John 
1:9 NKJV) The place of confession is also the place of cleansing and restored confidence towards 
God. Your prayer can be as simple as this: ‘Lord, I admit I’ve turned away from You. Please forgive 
me. I place my soul in Your hands and my trust in Your grace. In Jesus’ name I pray. Amen.’ Now, 
having received God’s forgiveness, mercy and grace—live like it!

‘Many are saying of me, “God will not deliver him.”’ Psalm 3:2 NIV 
God’s Forgiveness, Mercy and Grace (2)
Regardless of how badly you have failed or how often you have failed—God won’t give up on you. 
So don’t give up on yourself! Nothing you’ve done is beyond the scope of His grace. Others may 
give up on you, but not God. King David fell as low as a person can get. He was guilty of adultery, 
deception and murder—all major offences. But God forgave and restored him. He writes about it 
in two psalms. In the first psalm he writes: ‘Many are saying of me, God will not deliver him. But 
You, Lord, are a shield around me, O Lord; You bestow glory on me and lift up my head. To the Lord 
I cry aloud, and He answers me from His holy hill. I lie down and sleep; I wake again, because the 
Lord sustains me. I will not fear the tens of thousands drawn up against me on every side… From 
the Lord comes deliverance.’ (Psalm 3:2–7 NIV) Later on in the psalms he writes: ‘…He turned to me 
and heard my cry. He lifted me out of the slimy pit, out of the mud and mire; He set my feet on a 
rock and gave me a firm place to stand. He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our 
God. Many will see and fear the Lord and put their trust in Him.’ (Psalm 40:1–3 NIV) And the God 
who turned David’s greatest mess into a message, and his greatest test into a testimony, will do 
the same for you when you turn to Him and receive His forgiveness, mercy and grace.

FRIDAY OCTOBER 30
‘…he who heeds rebuke gets understanding.’ Proverbs 15:32 NKJV
Acknowledge Your Mistakes
In spite of his faults, flaws and failures, God called David ‘…a man after My own heart…’ (Acts 13:22 
NKJV) And one of the qualities that made David great was his willingness to acknowledge his 
mistakes. Here were two instances of it: (1) When fleeing the wrath of King Saul, he sought the 
help of a certain priest—a decision that caused Saul to order the death of eighty–five priests and 
their families. Devastated but not defensive, David told the surviving son of the slain priest who 
had assisted him, ‘…I have caused the death of all your father’s family.’ (1 Samuel 22:22 NLT) Can 
you imagine taking responsibility for such a tragic consequence? (2) When the prophet Nathan 
confronted him about his affair with Bathsheba and his attempt to cover up her resulting 
pregnancy by having her husband killed, David acknowledged, ‘…I have sinned against the Lord…’ 
(2 Samuel 12:13 NLT) Would you have the emotional and spiritual maturity to make such an 
admission? Or do you have a tendency to defend your actions for fear of being judged, criticised or 
rejected? Do you sometimes feel attacked when someone offers feedback, whether it is positive 
or negative? Do you retreat in silence? Do you counter–accuse or blame your attacker? Do you 
make hostile comments? Do you become sarcastic? Making mistakes doesn’t make you a lesser 
person, but defending them does. Don’t let pride rob you of the wisdom that comes from 
acknowledging your mistakes and ultimately growing through them. ‘He who disdains instruction 
despises his own soul, but he who heeds rebuke gets understanding.’

SATURDAY OCTOBER 31
‘…as the clay is in the potter’s hand, so are you in My hand…’ Jeremiah 18:6 NKJV
Be Willing to Let God Mould You
Henry Poppen, one of China’s first missionaries, spent forty years telling its people about the love 
of Jesus and how He died to take away their sin. One day, after he had finished speaking, a man 
approached him and said, ‘We know this Jesus! He’s been here.’ Dr Poppen explained how that 
wasn’t possible because Jesus had lived and died long ago in a country far from China. ‘Oh no,’ the 
man insisted, ‘He died here. I can even show you his grave.’ He led Dr. Poppen outside the city to a 
cemetery where an American was buried. There, inscribed on a crumbling gravestone was the 
name of a medical doctor who felt called by God to live and die among the people of this remote 
Chinese village. And when its people heard Dr Poppen describe the attributes of Jesus—His mercy, 
His love, His kindness, His willingness to forgive—they remembered the missionary doctor. God 
will use you when you’re willing to become ‘clay in the potter’s hand’. Clay has no aspirations; it’s 
mouldable, pliable and completely subject to the potter’s will. Henry Blackaby says: ‘When God’s 
assignment demands humility, He finds a servant willing to be humbled. When it requires zeal, He 
looks for someone He can fill with His Spirit. God uses holy vessels, so He finds those who’ll allow 
Him to remove their impurities. It’s not a noble task being clay. There’s no glamour to it, nothing 
boast–worthy, except it’s exactly what God’s looking for.’
