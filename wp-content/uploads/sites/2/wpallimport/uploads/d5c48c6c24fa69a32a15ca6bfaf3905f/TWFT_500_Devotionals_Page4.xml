<introtext><![CDATA['Seek the Kingdom of God above all else...' Matthew 6:33 NLT<br /><br /><p>What does it mean to put God's Kingdom first in your life? It means 12 things. Read them carefully then ask, 'How do I measure up?' (1) <i>obedience to God</i>. '...anyone who obeys God's laws and teaches them will be great in the Kingdom of Heaven.' (Matthew 5:19 NLT) (2) <i>love</i>. '...love your enemies!...If you love only those who love you, what good is that?' (Matthew 5:44,46 NLT) (3) <i>justice</i>. 'God blesses those who are hungry and thirsty for justice...' (Matthew 5:6 NLT) (4) <i>peace</i>. 'God blesses those who work for peace...' (Matthew 5:9 NLT) (5) <i>holy living</i>. '...let your good deeds shine out for all to see, so that everyone will praise your heavenly Father.' (Matthew 5:16 NLT) (6) <i>integrity</i>. 'Just say a simple, &quot;Yes, I will&quot; or &quot;No, I won't&quot;...' (Matthew 5:37 NLT) (7) <i>generosity</i>. When you give a gift to someone in need, 'Give...in secret, and your Father, who knows all secrets, will reward you.' (Matthew 6:2,4 NLT) (8) <i>spiritual</i> <i>wholeness</i>. '...Is anything worth more than your soul?' (Matthew 16:26 NLT) (9) <i>Biblical knowledge</i>. 'Your problem is that you don't know the Scriptures...' (Matthew 22:29 NLT) (10) <i>Faith in God</i>. '...if you had faith as small as a mustard seed...Nothing would be impossible.' '...But with God everything is possible.' (Matthew 17:20; 19:26 NLT) (11) <i>blessing</i> <i>people</i>. Jesus not only taught this, but His constant healing of, training, and serving others demonstrated how to do it (12) <i>disciple-making</i>. 'Therefore, go and make disciples of all the nations...' (Matthew 28:19 NLT) According to Jesus that's the only agenda worth living for-and if necessary, dying for!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...led by the Spirit of God...' Romans 8:14 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Life is like a maze; it's easy to get lost. Pressure comes at us from every direction to keep others happy. We study the important people in our lives, trying to decide what they want from us and how to give it to them, and in the process we lose ourselves. You need to stop and ask, 'Who am I living for? Why am I doing the things I do?' Paul writes, 'Having gifts...that differ...let us use them.' (Romans 12:6 AMP) What has God called and equipped you to do? Those who succeed at being themselves don't allow others to control them because they're led by God. 'As many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.' Don't be upset because people place demands on you. It's your life, take charge of it! The pressures you feel right now may not be coming from others at all; they may be coming from your own people-pleasing instincts! Yes, there are times when we all do things we'd rather not do. We do them because we love others, and in so doing we show '...the fruit of the Spirit...' (Galatians 5:22) But that's different from being controlled by your own insecurities or the endless demands of others. When you try to become everything to everybody, you get lost in the process. Plus, when you live for people's approval, you risk forfeiting God's. It's time you started praying, '...Lord, what do You want me to do?...' (Acts 9:6 NKJV) Once He reveals it to you, commit yourself to it fully, regardless of who does or doesn't agree. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...we loved you so much...' 1 Thessalonians 2:8 NIV<br /><br /><p><i>The example of a godly lifestyle.</i> 'You are witnesses, and so is God, of how...we were among you...' (1 Thessalonians 2:10 NIV) Paul's audience could judge his claims because they witnessed his lifestyle. Dad, it's pointless to 'talk the talk' if there's no audience, and you can only 'talk what you walk' if there is. And at home, there is always an audience. If you're not consistent there, they won't buy it. Demonstrating a godly lifestyle requires two qualities: ()<i> Honesty.</i> Your kids don't need perfect parents, they need honest ones. If you're wrong, admit it. Many kids never hear a parent say, 'I'm sorry, I was wrong.' So they either perceive honesty and humility as weakness, or their parents as inconsistent. Either sets them up for a life of arrogance and trouble. ()<i> Being positive.</i> Surveys show that most parents' feedback to their kids is ten-to-one negative. 'You'll never amount to...Why do you always?...You never use your head.' Statistically, fathers are more apt to make such statements. Dad, shift the balance to the positive! How did Paul do it? 'We dealt with each of you as a father deals...encouraging, comforting and urging you.' (vv11-12) It takes encouragement: inspiring, strengthening and stretching them to realise their potential. It takes comfort: life's tough; boost their spirit, don't break it. It takes urging: developing their perseverance by saying, 'Don't quit, you can do it!' Did it work for Paul? Yes! 'You received the Word of God...from us...which is at work in you.' (v13) Will it work for you and your kids? Yes! </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...we loved you so much...' 1 Thessalonians 2:8 NIV<br /><br /><p>S<i>piritual leadership</i>. 'Surely you remember...we preached the Gospel...to you.' (v9) A recent survey of Christian families shows that one in ten fathers pray with their children, and one in 25 fathers read the Bible to them. Many of us remember being raised by godly mothers (thank God for them!) while our fathers were either marginally involved, or totally uninvolved with the family's spiritual life. Though Mum is leading the spiritual charge, God still holds Dad accountable to do it (see Ephesians 6:4). Mum may take the kids to church, pray with them and teach them Biblical principles, but kids have a core need only a father can meet. So model for them the life-shaping, loving character of their heavenly Father. Adults reared without the influence of a godly father frequently report something missing in themselves, preventing their feeling comfortable and intimate with their heavenly Father. He seems inaccessible, unaffectionate, judgmental, conditionally accepting, grudgingly forgiving, and predominantly punitive. They pray infrequently because prayer feels awkward, like 'bothering God' who's 'way too busy to listen to my needs'. Feeling this, many kids reject God altogether. On the other hand, adults whose dads were involved in leading the family spiritually seem relatively free from these problems. Dad, God has appointed you His representative in your kids' lives, and there's no substitute for you. It's time to take the wheel, whatever age your kids are, so that you, like Paul, can say, 'Surely you remember...while [I] preached the Gospel...to you!'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...we loved you so much...' 1 Thessalonians 2:8 NIV<br /><br /><p><i>Hard work.</i> 'Surely you remember...we worked night and day in order not to be a burden to anyone.' (v9) If the church had been an army, Paul would have been a commanding general. He could easily have given orders to be provided for to whatever extent he chose, and been obeyed. But he didn't do that. What he did was work hard, beyond the requirements of his ministry, to alleviate the financial burden others would have had on his behalf. Dad, your kids need to see you do the same, because: (1) By seeing you work hard it elevates the importance of work and helps them discover dignity in it. 'Lazy hands make a man poor, but diligent hands bring wealth.' (Proverbs 10:4 NIV) (2) By allowing them to share work with you around the home, you prepare them for success on the job by imparting to them much-needed work principles and skills. 'Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will serve before kings; he will not serve before obscure men.' (Proverbs 22:29 NIV) You'll be preparing them to be recognised for excellence and promoted because of their outstanding work ethic and skills. In a time of economic trouble when only the strong survive the competition, prepare your children to be the best they can be. The attitudes and abilities you nurture in them will benefit them all their lives. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Making the most of your time...' Ephesians 5:16 NAS<br /><br />
<p>If you're wise you'll stop frequently and think about how you're spending your time. Charles Swindoll writes, 'In a book I read, <em>The Time Trap</em>, I came upon a list of the most popular time wasters. It helped to pinpoint some specific areas of inefficiency I must watch. Who hasn't heard the true story of Charles M. Schwab and Ivy Lee? Schwab was president of Bethlehem Steel. Lee, a consultant, was given the unusual challenge, &quot;Show me a way to get more things done with my time.&quot; Schwab agreed to pay him &quot;anything within reason&quot; if Lee's suggestions worked. Lee later handed the executive a sheet of paper with the plan: &quot;Write down the most important tasks you have to do tomorrow. Number them in order of importance. When you arrive in the morning, begin at once on number one and stay on it until it is completed. Recheck your priorities, then begin with number two, then number three. Make this a habit every working day. Pass it on to those under you. Try it as long as you like, then send me your cheque for what you think it's worth.&quot;' That one idea turned Bethlehem Steel Corporation into the biggest independent steel producer in the world within five years. How much did Schwab pay his consultant? Several weeks after he received the note, he sent Lee a cheque for $25000, admitting it was the most profitable lesson he had ever learned. Try it for yourself. If it works, great. But don't send me any money for the idea. I'd just blow it on another time-management book...which I don't have time to read.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...if you are displeased, I will go back.' Numbers 22:34 NIV<br /><br /><p>A lace-maker was working on a very intricate design when she noticed a mistake at the beginning of her work. To the untrained eye it was inconspicuous and she could easily have camouflaged it, but moments like that separate the professional from the 'dabbler'. She worked all night, painstakingly unravelled her work till she reached the flaw, fixed it and started over again. When the angel blocked Balaam on the road, Balaam said, 'I have sinned. I did not realise you were standing in the road to oppose me...if you are displeased, I will go back.' There are times when you need to go back and make things right. Now, God doesn't usually send angels to tell us we're off-course; He speaks through His Word, through a trusted friend, or through our conscience. Joni Eareckson Tada says, 'If the Holy Spirit reveals we've made an error, it's pointless to go on unless we go back... Sometimes you get so far in life and realise...the threads just aren't coming together; you've made a mistake somewhere along the line. Your sins have come home to roost. We do ourselves a disservice when we merely make a quick mid-course correction. If you want the ends to come together, then ask the Holy Spirit to show you where you &quot;dropped the stitch&quot;.' 'We have left undone those things which we ought to have done; and we have done those things which we ought not to have done.' If the Holy Spirit is dealing with you right now about some unfinished business in your life, stop, go back and make it right. It's not easy, but God will honour your humility and obedience.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I will give [you] favour...' Exodus 3:21 NKJV<br /><br /><p>God told Israel, 'I will give [you] favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and...when you go, you shall not go empty-handed.' God promised His people two things before they left Egypt: favour with their enemies, and great provision. And when He brought them out, they had both. There's a lesson here. Your trouble is only a classroom-a controlled environment for God to work on your behalf. Look what He used to free His people from slavery and turn their situation around-flies, hailstones and frogs. The things that destroyed their enemies were the very things God used to deliver them. There's nothing God can't do. He can be your doctor, your counsellor, your stockbroker, your lawyer, and anything else you need Him to be. Notice, the frogs that invaded the homes of the Egyptians couldn't cross the property line of God's people. That's because the favour of God will protect you! Think of the things that have come right up to you, but didn't touch you. Ezra said, '...The hand of our God was on us, and He protected us from enemies...' (Ezra 8:31 NIV) Why did the same Pharaoh who repeatedly said 'no' to Moses suddenly say 'yes'? Timing! When the time is right God will move on your behalf. So start praying for favour: favour in unexpected places, favour that moves mountains, favour that opens doors, favour that gives you access to things you otherwise wouldn't have. If you can't cope with the future, check with the past. 'Surely [<i>not</i> <i>maybe</i>!] goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life...' (Psalm 23:6 NKJV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...A man must be content to receive the gift...given him from Heaven...' John 3:27 AMP<br /><br /><p>We love to quote the promise, 'I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.' (Philippians 4:13 NKJV) But that promise doesn't mean you can do whatever you want, or what somebody else does. No, Paul is saying you can do anything God calls you to do, for with each of His assignments comes His assistance. This verse actually teaches you to stay within the boundaries of what God's called you to do, and not try to undertake things that are not part of His will for you. That's not negativism, it's wisdom. God wants you looking to Him for your answers, not others. That doesn't mean you can't learn from others, it just means the plan that will lead you to success must come from God. What is God's will for your life? Find it, do it, otherwise you'll live in frustration, competing and comparing yourself with others. John the Baptist said, 'A man must be content to receive the gift which is given him from Heaven.' Read the previous verses and you'll discover that some of John's disciples were getting upset because Jesus was baptising too, and the crowds were leaving John and flocking to Him. If John hadn't been secure in his God-given identity and calling, he might have become fearful and jealous. But he displayed a different attitude-one you need to take to heart. He said about himself, 'A man can receive nothing [he can claim nothing, he can take unto himself nothing] except as it has been granted to him from Heaven. [A man must be content to receive the gift which is given him from Heaven...]' (John 3:27-29 AMP) And the same goes for you!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...to will and to act according to His good purpose.' Philippians 2:13 NIV<br /><br /><p>God is committed to His plan for your life, not yours! You can't say, 'Lord, here's my plan; bless it.' He may, but He may not. '...He...created us...so we can do the good things He planned for us...' (Ephesians 2:10 NLT) You can't say, 'In this category I'm doing things my way, but in that category I'm being led by God.' No, every step you take must be synchronised by the beat of the Holy Spirit. Nothing should be more important to you than keeping pace with Him. Paul writes, 'For it is God who works in you to will and to act according to His...purpose.' (Philippians 2:13 NIV) God works through you as you open your spirit, engage your mind, and use your talents to do what He's already put into your heart. The moment you say yes, He gives you the power to perform His will. Notice, He doesn't reveal His will, then call you. No, He calls you, and as you step out and obey Him He reveals His will to you step by step. Each day God is moulding you into a greater likeness of His Son. That's His objective. You're not out for a stroll, you're going somewhere! Over and over again you'll be put into situations that mature you to the point where you have the same attitude, the same perspective, the same responses, and the same discernment as Jesus. Once you understand that, walking with God will take on a whole new meaning. You'll realise that His custom plan for your life is the only plan that will ever satisfy you. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['He performs what is appointed for me...' Job 23:14 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Sometimes God permits things, other times He actually plans them. Either way, He's got a definite plan in mind. In the midst of unspeakable heartache, Job said, 'He performs what is appointed for me.' When you realise that God has 'appointed' something for you, it changes how you see it. It's like flying. On the ground your view is limited, but 3000 metres up everything looks different. Now you're seeing what God sees: 'the big picture'! The Bible says that after Job came through his trials he was blessed with twice as much as he had before (Job 42:10). Does that mean if you lose a $50 000-a-year job you'll get back a $100 000-a-year one? Or that your chequebook will always balance, or your car never break down, or your health never fail? No, sometimes God rewards our faith with things we can't measure in monetary value-such as relationships, joy, character, peace you didn't have before, a fresh sense of purpose, protection from danger, favour with others, a clearer understanding, more compassion, and intimacy with Him. What value would you place on those? Here are three things you need to keep in mind at all times. First, God wants you to trust Him in whatever you're going through (Psalm 138:8). Secondly, when it's your responsibility, God expects you to fulfil it (Ecclesiastes 9:10). Thirdly, in order to bless you, He will sometimes move in ways that are hard to understand or explain (Ecclesiastes 11:5). Why? So that when the answer comes there'll be no doubt about Who should get the credit.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...the mother of Jesus said...&quot;They have no wine.&quot;' John 2:3 NKJV<br /><br /><p>In Biblical times offering wine to your guests at a wedding was an expected courtesy. It was also a sign of respect, so running out of it would have been considered a social disaster. But observe how Mary handled it. Instead of looking for someone to blame, or making excuses, she took her problem to Jesus. That's always your best move. 'O what peace we often forfeit, O what needless pain we bear. All because we do not carry, everything to God in prayer.' Jesus told the servants to fill the jars with water and give some to the headwaiter. When he tasted it, the Bible says, '...the water had become wine...' (John 2:9 NCV) But notice, it happened after they had obeyed Jesus, not before. At a particularly contentious church board meeting when one member suggested they pray about the problem, another responded, 'Has it come to that?' There are basically two reasons we make prayer our last resort instead of our first: we like to think we're able to solve our own problems or we feel insignificant and think, 'It's okay for Mary to ask Jesus; she's His mother, but He's got bigger problems to solve than mine.' No, your problems are important to God-all of them! He delights in you (Psalm 18:19). He rejoices over you as a bridegroom rejoices over his bride (Isaiah 62:5). You're never too big or too small to ask your heavenly Father for help. Just take your cue from Mary: identify the problem, bring it to Jesus, do what He tells you, and watch Him work it out. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...if anyone is caught in any trespass...' Galatians 6:1 NAS<br /><br /><p>Paul writes, 'If anyone is caught in any trespass, you who are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness.' Note the word 'caught'. Most of us who stumble thought at one time, 'That will never happen to me.' But it did. In a moment of weakness we yielded to evil. When this happens to someone in God's family we have a responsibility to restore them, regardless of the nature of the sin. In this Scripture this word 'restore' has medical overtones. It pictures a doctor resetting a broken limb. To restore someone scripturally, we must help them in several ways. First, we must help them to acknowledge their failure. After his affair with Bathsheba, David prayed, '...[I have] sinned and done what is evil in Your sight...' (Psalm 51:4 NIV) Secondly, we should help them to accept responsibility for their sin. Even though someone else may have been a contributing factor, we are still accountable to God. Thirdly, we must help them to repent. Repentance involves deep remorse, turning away from our sin, and moving in a new direction. Then, we must help them to make restitution. For example, someone who has done wrong needs to make amends when possible. We can help them to grow stronger through it. Through failure, God teaches us lessons that keep us from wandering into similar situations in the future. We can help them to respond to God's correction with gratitude. Granted, this is not easy, but when a person comprehends God's purpose in such discipline-that we might '...share in His holiness' (Hebrews 12:10 NIV)-they begin to thank their heavenly Father for His loving correction. Indeed, it protects them from any root of bitterness springing up in the aftermath of sin.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness...' Galatians 6:1 NAS<br /><br /><p>What is the 'spirit' in which we are to restore someone? The spirit of gentleness. 'If anyone is caught in any trespass, you who are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness.' More than likely, the person is already hurting and as fragile as glass; condemnation will only worsen their plight. Understanding and acceptance-not agreement-are what's needed here. The spirit of humility. 'Each one looking to yourself, so that you too will not be tempted.' We're all cut from the same bolt of cloth; we're all capable of blowing it. Remember, Peter said to the Lord that others may deny Him but he never would. (Matthew 26:33) And he meant it; he didn't believe it could happen to him! We must be careful about our own lives, examining ourselves, knowing that we too are vulnerable to all types of temptation and sin. Finally, the spirit of love and empathy. Paul writes, 'Bear one another's burdens, and thereby fulfil the law of Christ.' (Galatians 6:2 NAS) In this passage the word 'burden' means 'a heavy load'. It means being willing to walk with them, weep with them and work with them until they've been restored. If the hurting cannot find grace, love and healing in the family of God, where can they go to find it? Dr Charles Stanley writes, 'It should be clear from the Scriptures that we have a responsibility to restore a fallen brother or sister. It should also be clear that this sensitive, delicate issue must be handled with great care, lest we greatly damage our witness to an unbelieving world.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Lord watches over the path of the godly...' Psalm 1:6 NLT<br /><br /><p>God will speak to you through relationships. Sometimes He will give you direct revelation, but often He will speak to you through relationships. His Word says, 'Remember your leaders, who spoke the word of God to you...' (Hebrews 13:7 NIV) Who speaks into your life? To whom are you submitted? Without good input you will live unprotected and undirected. God will speak to you through your gifts. 'A man's gift makes room for him...' (Proverbs 18:16 NAS) When God is directing your steps you won't need to kick the door open or force your way in. Your gift will bring a solution and meet a need; therefore, you'll be welcomed, valued and rewarded. He'll speak to you through your thoughts. '...we have the mind of Christ.' (1 Corinthians 2:16 NIV) When our minds are renewed by His Word and lined up with His will, God actually thinks through us. Consider what an advantage that is! God will speak through open doors. Paul wrote, 'For a great and effective door is opened to me, and there are many adversaries.' (1 Corinthians 16:9 NKJV) God will open doors for you, but you must remember that with every opportunity He gives, challenges come too. That's what builds your faith and strengthens you for the future. He will speak through 'a word' of confirmation. 'Your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, &quot;This is the way, walk in it.&quot;' (Isaiah 30:21 NKJV) Note the word 'behind'. This word comes after you obey God, letting you know you've made a good decision and that you're on the right track. Yes, you can be led by God. His Word says, 'The Lord watches over the path of the godly.' </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...think of what you were when you were called...' 1 Corinthians 1:26 NIV<br /><br />
<p>Jesus didn't see people as losers, but as potential winners who'd lost their way. He '...was moved with compassion for them...' (Mark 6:34 NKJV) He saw them through God's eyes: not weeds, but potential roses. And His perspective, which is often different from ours, brought out the best in them. Where others saw a woman with five failed marriages, He saw a restored sinner who could reach others in Samaria. They saw a blind man; He envisioned someone who could see. They saw a cripple; He pictured a man picking up his mat and walking away. They saw Matthew as a reviled tax collector; He saw a future disciple. They dismissed Zacchaeus as a crook; Jesus recognised a searching heart. When His disciples saw costly perfume and unnecessary expense, Jesus recognised the sacrifice of a grateful heart. Others saw an impulsive fisherman; Jesus saw a leader who could build His church. Onlookers watched Roman soldiers mocking as they pounded nails into human flesh; Jesus saw blind men who didn't know what they were doing. 'Lord, help us to see!' Paul says, '...think of what you were when you were called. Not many...were wise by human standards; not many were influential...[or] of noble birth.' (1 Corinthians 1:26 NIV) Face it, you weren't so wonderful before God turned you around, so stop judging others from your limited perspective and try to see them as God saw you. Work to bring out the best in them. Introduce them to the One who came to bring '...great joy to all the people' (Luke 2:10 NCV)-no exceptions!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He will work for you today...' Exodus 14:13 AMP<br /><br /><p>If you're battling fear today, listen to these words from the God who loves you, protects you and promises to be with you. When there seems to be no way out, He says, 'Fear not; stand still (firm, confident, undismayed) and see the [deliverance] of the Lord which He will work for you today.' Notice the words, 'He will work for you today'. Start looking for evidence of His hand at work in your situation; that's how your faith grows. When the problem looks too big, He says, 'Be strong, courageous, and firm; fear not nor be in terror before them, for it is the Lord your God Who goes with you; He will not fail you or forsake you.' (Deuteronomy 31:6 AMP) Stop and remind yourself whose company you're in. The One 'Who goes with you' has never lost a battle, and He will win this one. When you feel like you can't cope any more, He says, '...do not look around you...and be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen and harden you to difficulties...' (Isaiah 41:10 AMP) Notice the words 'harden you to difficulties'. God usually doesn't lift us out of the problem, He takes us through it and toughens us up. When you lose your peace of mind, He says, 'Do not fret or have any anxiety about anything, but in every circumstance...continue to make your wants known to God. And God's peace...which transcends all understanding shall garrison and mount guard over your hearts and minds...' (Philippians 4:6-7 AMP) Don't listen to the voice of fear. God is with you today!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Hallowed be Thy name.' Matthew 6:9 KJV <br /><br /><p>At the dedication service for their baby boy a young wife told the pastor, 'My husband wants to name him after his dad, but I want to name him after mine.' The pastor said, 'What's your dad's name?' 'Joseph,' she replied. 'What's your husband's father's name?' he asked. 'Joseph,' she replied again. 'Then what's the problem?' The husband replied, 'Well, her dad's a criminal and mine's a Christian. How will people know which one he's named after?' The pastor said, 'That's easy. Call him Joseph and see which one he turns out to be like. That way everybody will know whose name he carries.' Jesus taught us to pray, 'Hallowed be Thy name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in Heaven.' (vv9-10) How do we honour God's name? By doing His will on earth. Francis of Assisi once took a young companion with him to preach in town. But when they arrived they just chatted with vendors and talked to people on the street. Returning home, he was asked why they hadn't preached. He replied, 'People listened; they observed our attitude and behaviour. That was our message.' Paul writes, '...Take care of...business...do your...work...then people who are not believers will respect you...' (1 Thessalonians 4:11-12 NCV) That means ensuring that your walk matches your talk, that you truly care about others, that you're not cheating on your spouse or your income taxes, that you're paying your bills on time, that you're not short-changing your employer. Peter writes, '...serve one another...' (1 Peter 5:5 GNT) It's one thing to call yourself a Christian, it's entirely another when those who know you best, agree!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...let us strip off every weight that...trips us up...' Hebrews 12:1 NLT<br /><br /><p>The Psalmist said, 'You don't let me sleep. I'm too distressed even to pray!' (Psalm 77:4 NLT) Is that the way it is in your life right now? If so, let go of what no longer works. There are trade-offs. For everything you gain, you usually have to give something up. The trouble is, we hate giving up what we do well. So we focus on 'doing things right' rather than doing the right things, and wonder why we don't succeed. When your season changes, be open to a new strategy. Letting go of what doesn't work anymore frees you up to focus on what does. And more importantly, to focus on what God wants you to do! Secondly, don't let change paralyse you. In new situations our first inclination is to slow down, play it safe and buy ourselves time. But often we just fall further behind. Being overly cautious makes you freeze like a deer caught in the headlights. The Bible says that God '...gives power to the faint, and strengthens the powerless.' (Isaiah 40:29 NRS) So trust Him and move forward, instead of giving in to the impulse to just do nothing. Then, approach the future with confidence. Recent events have us all on edge, but as a child of God you can say, 'I can lie down and sleep soundly because You, Lord, will keep me safe.' (Psalm 4:8 CEV) The truth is, you can't build a decent argument for living in fear; so trust God, adjust to reality, and live each day to the fullest!</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Like the blind we grope...feeling our way like men without eyes...' Isaiah 59:10 NIV<br /><br /><p>The Pilgrims landed on the shores of America full of vision. The first year they established a town. The next year they elected a council. In their third year the town council proposed building a road eight kilometres out into the wilderness for westward expansion. But the people criticised it as a waste of public funds. Amazing! Once they had been able to see across oceans to new worlds, now they could not see eight kilometres down the road. What happened? They lost their vision! How can you keep that from happening to you?First, refuse to become self-centred! God wants you to enjoy success, but anytime the profit margin becomes more important than the service principle, you will forfeit God's blessing. Secondly, do not get lost in the mundane! One successful leader writes, 'In preparation for the day, I focus on the main event and ask, &quot;In order to make the main event a good event, what must I know? Do? Eliminate?&quot; Some things will be fun, some will not, but with preparation the most important things will get done well.'</p>
<p>Thirdly, refuse to go with the flow! Most of us are married to the status quo. We want what is, not what can be. We seek safety and simple answers. To keep your vision alive you must give yourself permission to go a different way; to break new ground. The moment your eyes open each morning remind yourself, 'There is more out there than what I've experienced', then commit your day to God and get moving!'Like the blind we grope...feeling our way like men without eyes...' Isaiah 59:10 NIV</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Joseph...saw that they were sad.' Genesis 40:6 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Sometimes you can tell by the look on someone's face what they are going through. 'Joseph...looked at them, and saw that they were sad.' Even though he himself was unjustly imprisoned, he found fulfilment in helping two other prisoners. Would it have been easier just to focus on his own problems? Yes, but it's self-defeating. Henry Drummond wrote, 'As you look back on your life, the moments that stand out are always the ones when you did things for others.' Joseph realised he wasn't the only one hurting, so he did what Jesus always did-treated those around him with compassion. How about you? Do you take time to try to understand what people are going through? Are you self-absorbed, or concerned about others who are hurting, especially when you've nothing to gain by it? Encouragement is like a shot of adrenaline: it can lift a person and put them back on their feet again. Writer Ren Bazin says, 'A remedy for the evils of our time...is the gift of yourself to those who've fallen so low that even hope fails them.' Will those you give to, always give back? No, but God will. When the royal butler was released from prison he forgot the promise he made to speak to Pharaoh on Joseph's behalf. But God didn't forget! Joseph's best days were ahead. Think of his rise in Egypt, his service to a nation, his impact as a leader, and the joy of reconciling with his family. He underlines it: '...God turned into good what [others] meant for evil...' (Genesis 50:20 TLB) So, start 'seeing' the needs of those around you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...the testing of your faith produces patience...' James 1:3 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The one thing we can count on in life is change. We try to resist it but it says, 'Ready or not, here I come.' In order to grow stronger through change we must give up, wise up and toughen up. First, don't be an escape artist, trying to avoid the stress that accompanies change. There is no escape; change is inevitable. Stop regarding it as an enemy and make it your friend. Only when you decide to ride the horse in the direction it's going, will you get to where you need to be. Secondly, when we're hit with sudden change, our 'fight or flight' instincts aren't very good at handling it. But there's a solution. By entrusting our lives fully into God's care and asking for His wisdom, '...God's kindness...is trying to lead...to Him and change...' (Romans 2:4 GWT) God loves us the way we are, but He loves us too much to leave us that way. Finally, someone quipped, 'If it wasn't for stress, I'd have no energy at all.' Stop and take inventory. Are you making it harder on yourself than it needs to be? Are you speaking faith or fear? Are you convincing yourself you can't handle the changes? Are you ready to give up without even trying, or trusting God? If you're struggling to make sense of the situation you're in, read these words: '...when your faith is tested, your endurance has a chance to grow. So let it...for when your endurance is fully developed, you will be strong in character and ready for anything...' (James 1:3-4 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['We get up again and keep going.' 2 Corinthians 4:9 TLB<br /><br /><p>Max Gunther quipped, 'When you're [in] a tug-of-war with a tiger, give him the rope before he gets to your arm. You can always buy a new rope!' Resistance to change just creates ulcers, sleeplessness and stress. So here are some attitudes you may need to adjust. Stop thinking like a victim, stop expecting others to rescue you, stop feeling sorry for yourself and reduce your stress levels. Get behind the wheel of your own life! You're not helpless, and the situation is not hopeless. God's Word promises you 'can do everything...with the help of Christ.' (Philippians 4:13 TLB) Then, stop deciding not to change. Instead of banging your head against the wall of reality, invest your efforts into changing what you can-such as your attitude and your approach! It takes more energy to hang on to old habits and beliefs than to embrace new ones. Stop playing the new game by the old rules. When a car that's stuck in second gear keeps trying to do 100 km/hr, guess what happens? Meltdown! If you don't want to burn out, learn to change gears. When your life's seasons, assignments or relationships change, begin to adjust. Learn to play by the new rules, otherwise you'll keep losing. Stop trying to control the uncontrollable. When the music changes, it's time to learn some new dance steps, otherwise you'll finish up sitting on the sidelines. You may not like the changes, but you can learn to flow with them. 'We are perplexed...but we don't give up and quit... We get knocked down, but we get up again and keep going.' (2 Corinthians 4:8-9 TLB)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I have learned to be content...' Philippians 4:11 NIV<br /><br /><p>Since you can't escape change or the stress that goes with it, here are some steps you can take to help you handle it. First, choose your battles wisely. Answer these questions: do you instinctively give in to fear and oppose change, even when it might benefit you? Do you keep throwing yourself across the tracks, hoping to stop the freight train of reality? Do you think that no issue is too small to be ignored? Waging war on too many fronts always results in fatigue and defeat, so choose battles big enough to matter. Secondly, try to become more adaptable. What's your most common response to change? Dragging your feet? Assuming a 'have to' attitude? Doing only what's necessary? Once you stop caring, life loses its sparkle and ironically you become even more stressed. So learn to become resilient. Paul said, 'I have learned (<i>it's a process that takes time</i>!) in whatever state I am, to be content.' Thirdly, welcome new experiences. If you're moving forward in life your surroundings will be constantly changing. If they're not, you're going in circles. Clinging to the familiar just buys you comfort today at tomorrow's expense. Draw on God's grace, plunge in and seize the day! Fourthly, learn to live with uncertainty. Always struggling to 'stabilise' in a constantly changing world is like trying to push water uphill-you soon get tired and stop and it runs back down over you. Learn to live with loose ends; 'wing it' a little more, instead of struggling to make sure that life always happens on your terms.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I will be glad and rejoice in your unfailing love...' Psalm 31:7 NLT<br /><br /><p>There's an old Chinese proverb that says, 'A diamond cannot be polished without friction, and a person can't be perfected without trials'. We all want to live stress free without having to work at it, but it can't be done. So, look at these 15 suggestions.</p>
<p>(1) Take time each day to pray and read God's Word; it'll transform your outlook. (2) If in real life you look like your passport photo, take a holiday; you need one! (3) What goes up must come down, so cut back on caffeine and sugar! (4) Eat right-a balanced diet isn't having a cookie in each hand! (5) Exercise three to five times a week for 30 minutes; it's nature's remedy for stress. (6) Develop better time management habits: 'use it or lose it'. (7) Make room in your life for fun and relaxation. (8) Get eight hours of sleep when possible. (9) Maintain your sense of humour: 'A cheerful heart is good medicine, but a broken spirit saps a person's strength.' (Proverbs 17:22 NLT) (10) Start counting your blessings. The Psalmist said, 'Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all His benefits.' (Psalm 103:2 NKJV) (11) When you talk to yourself, say the right things. Your words affect you more than others. (12) Simplify your life by eliminating clutter. If you haven't used it for two years, you probably don't need it. (13) Develop a sense of purpose by seeking God and setting personal goals. (14) Forgive; grudges are too heavy to carry: 'If you refuse to forgive others, your Father will not forgive [you].' (Matthew 6:15 NLT) (15) Read the last chapter of the Bible-we win!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...forgiveness...in accordance with the riches of God's grace...' Ephesians 1:7 NIV<br /><br /><p>Have you ever noticed how quickly we judge somebody else's shortcomings while making all kinds of allowance for our own? Paul talks about 'the riches of...grace' that God lavished on us. But we strain that grace when we refuse to extend it to others. Jesus said, '...when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive him, so...your Father...may forgive you...' (Mark 11:25 NIV) You don't get to decide which offences you'll forgive and which ones you'll keep holding over somebody's head. We are commanded to '...love mercy...' (Micah 6:8 NIV) That means we must pursue it and make it our goal. Don't say, 'I'll forgive him when he proves he deserves it.' Biblical forgiveness isn't conditional, can't be earned, isn't deserved, and you can't bargain for it. Jesus said, '...Give as freely as you...received!' (Matthew 10:8 NLT) 'If I forgive her she'll have got away with it.' You're not letting anybody get away with anything, because even when you've forgiven the offender there's still a penalty to be paid. It's just not your job to enforce it. 'If I forgive him he'll keep hurting me.' Forgiveness doesn't mean the relationship always stays the same. It takes time to rebuild trust and make sure repentance is genuine. In fact, if the offence is abusive or puts you in danger-forgive, but maintain a safe distance. 'If I forgive her she's free to hurt me again.' The truth is, she's free to do it again anyway, just like you're free to show grace even when the offender doesn't ask or show any sign of repentance.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...we loved you so much...' 1 Thessalonians 2:8 NIV<br /><br />
<p><em>Sharing your life with them.</em> 'We were delighted to share with you...our lives.' How can your daughter learn healthy relations with men, or your son develop a healthy male identity, unless you share your life with them? Today's mother-led family is largely the creation of the absentee father. Dad, you share your life with your kids by: (1) Sharing your values. They need to know what's important to you and where your priorities lie, what you stand for and truly believe. (2) Sharing how they can live by Biblical principles. Life will throw obstacles in their pathway, confusing them. They need to know God's ways and God's Word when making tough, crucial decisions. (3) Sharing moments of laughter and fun. When you come home do your kids scatter or gather around you? Are you fun to be with? Teach them that Christianity is something to be enjoyed, not endured. They say: 'The family that prays together stays together.' So does the family that plays together! (4) Sharing with them the finer interests of life. Criticising their interests only strengthens their commitment to them. Instead of condemning their music, dress, TV shows and internet use, introduce them to better alternatives. (5) Telling them how valuable they are to you. Don't assume they know. Researchers say that most kids, particularly boys, feel like nuisances to their dads. 'We loved you so much that we were delighted to share with you...our lives...you had become so dear to us.' Tell them again and again!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...we loved you so much...' 1 Thessalonians 2:8 NIV<br /><br />
<p>Becoming a <em>great</em> dad calls for a man having a close relationship with his heavenly Father. Applying the principles Paul used when fathering his spiritual children can equip you to become a great dad. Speaking to his 'children', Paul demonstrates the warmth of a mother and the muscle of a father (see 1 Thessalonians 2:7-11). For the next few days, let's observe some of Paul's fathering principles: <em>Making them feel loved.</em> 'We loved you so much.' Paul chose a seldom-used Greek word for love, not the usual word for unconditional love or brotherly affection. The word he used meant a strong, warm, spontaneous magnetism-an endearing term used normally with a very young child. Why would Paul speak this way to adults? Because the need to be loved is one we never outgrow! He wanted them to <em>feel</em> loved. The Bible says: '...the greatest of these is love.' (1 Corinthians 13:13 NKJV) Dad, more than anything else, that is what your children need from you and it doesn't have a thing to do with their age; they need it as much in adulthood as they did in childhood. Your adolescent will probably cringe if you're affectionate with them around their peers, but deep inside they'll appreciate it. And it has nothing to do with their gender. Both sexes need to feel loved. Your teenage daughter is likely to return your hugs and words, while your teenage son will probably roll his eyes and grunt inarticulately. Love them anyhow, until they're old enough to tell you how good it felt!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...My conduct will be faultless...in my house...' Psalm 101:2 GNT<br /><br />
<p>Almost half of all two-parent households today are blended families. If you're living in one, here are some things you need to consider. First, every child is unique. Small children accept step-parents more easily than teenagers. Your authority won't carry the same weight with older children. You need to approach them with wisdom and grace, while toddlers need nurture and security. Secondly, create new family systems. Each family has its own system: 'The way we do things in our house is...' It's what makes family members feel part of an intimate group. Things like attending church together, sharing mealtimes, playing games or just enjoying a good laugh, help to establish that important sense of bonding and belonging. Thirdly, unless there's danger, don't deny children access to their biological parent. The Bible says, 'God blesses those...who make peace...' (Matthew 5:9 CEV) So don't demean your ex before your kids, and don't use them as messengers. Research confirms that children who spend time with both parents adjust better. It also decreases the possibility of their getting caught in the crossfire and wounded. Finally, always work in the children's best interests. There will be holidays and events where you'll have to interact with your ex, so get used to it-for your children's sake. They need your love and understanding, especially when emotions run high and everybody is adjusting. Respect what's gone before. Don't try to force your idealised interpretation of what a family should be. Whether you come by it biologically or through marriage, parenting requires maturity-lots of it. PS If you haven't been praying, now would be a good time to start!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...My conduct will be faultless...in my house...' Psalm 101:2 GNT<br /><br />
<p>If you're trying to blend 'his' and 'her' children into one big, happy family, a marriage counsellor offers some helpful insights you'd do well to adopt. What we call romantic bliss, our children often see as domestic upheaval. So realise it takes work to resolve your problems and build intimacy. Keep reading 1 Corinthians 13: the key to a strong family is 'love'. You must practise it every day. Your kids take their cue from you, so in times of stress maintain a loving attitude. Remember that you had a choice, your children didn't. They didn't ask to be put in this situation, so be understanding and work to strengthen their sense of security during this difficult time of transition. Don't expect instant bliss. Be realistic about the challenges involved in blending two families. There's no such thing as instant intimacy or total compatibility. It takes time to develop strong bonds and stabilise a family, so 'easy does it'. Allow time to grieve past losses. Jesus said, '...those...who grieve...will find comfort!' (Matthew 5:4 CEV) At the time of their parents' second marriage many children have already lived in three different family units: their biological family, their single parent family, and now their new blended family. Plus, if your own biological children aren't living with you, you may experience a personal sense of loss. Failure to acknowledge this will result in anger and alienation, so deal with the past before taking on the future.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...be transformed by the renewing of your mind...' Romans 12:2 NKJV<br /><br />
<p>Are you wrestling with a personal problem, thinking, 'If I can just overcome this I'll be all right?' Well, there's good news and bad news. The good news is that by God's grace you can overcome it. The bad news is that when you've overcome this particular problem, another one is waiting to take its place. You're always going to be working on something. Spiritual growth is a work-in-progress. And it doesn't come through human effort, self-condemnation or the white-knuckling works of the flesh. It comes as a result of spending time in prayer and having your mind renewed daily by His Word. As you agree with God, believing what He says is true, change automatically happens. You start to think differently, talk differently, and act differently. Be patient with yourself; it's a process that develops in stages. Would you think there was something wrong with your child because they couldn't walk perfectly on the first few tries? No, you're delighted each time they take a step. When they fall, you pick them up. When they mess up, you clean them up and encourage them to try again. You never stop working with them! And God does the same with us. He's not angry because you haven't 'arrived', He's pleased that you're pressing on, endeavouring to stay on the path. It's God's job to '...cause [you to] be...governed by the Holy Spirit...' (2 Corinthians 3:8 AMP) If you could do it by yourself you wouldn't need Him. So instead of driving yourself harder and harder, start leaning on God more and more and you'll '...go from strength to strength...' (Psalm 84:7 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Isaac...loved Esau, but Rebekah loved Jacob.' Genesis 25:28 NIV<br /><br />
<p>The prophet wrote, 'Our fathers sinned and are no more, and we bear their punishment.' (Lamentations 5:7 NIV) Parents, no responsibility is greater than yours! Flawed and limited though you are, God has put awesome power into your hands-the power to shape the next generation. Succeeding or failing in business means nothing compared to succeeding or failing as a parent. When you fail, your children often pay for the wrongs you did. Many of us have gazed adoringly into the cot of our innocent child and prayed, 'O God, wherever else I may fail, don't let it be here!' Answering that prayer is going to take three commitments from you. First, total investment in them. It will involve being at their football match, play or social event when you're exhausted, and participating in their spiritual, emotional and educational challenges. Secondly, loving them unconditionally. That means even when they don't want to become what you hoped for, you support them wholeheartedly for being what God designed them to be instead! Thirdly, unfailing encouragement. Whether they win or lose, are right or wrong, make you look good or embarrass you, you understand, console and encourage them to believe in their God-given potential by letting them know, 'I'll never reject you, no matter what happens.' What if it's late in the game, they've gone off track and you know you've blown it? Admit it to God-and them. They know you failed and they're generous forgivers! Ask (and believe) God to change you and them. God has promised to '...restore to you the years...' (Joel 2:25 NKJV) that failure and neglect have stolen.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Isaac...loved Esau, but Rebekah loved Jacob.' Genesis 25:28 NIV<br /><br />
<p>Parental rejection drives children to two extremes: namely, rebellion and compliance. Children rebel out of their need for acceptance. Esau understood the principle of parentally-approved marriage. But he expressed his resentment against a scheming mother who failed to love him and helped cheat him out of his inheritance, and against an unloving father, by rebelling against the laws of God and family, and marrying unapproved women (Genesis 26:34). Perhaps Esau felt some perverse satisfaction when his mother was '...disgusted with living because of [Esau's] Hittite women...' (Genesis 27:46 NIV) When our kids drop out of school, run away, get pregnant, abandon church, take drugs, consume alcohol, engage in illicit sex and marry disastrously, in many cases it's saying, 'I'll show you!' Turning to compliance, Esau's rebellion didn't win Mum's love, so he tried the opposite technique with Dad, hoping that doing it Dad's way might make him loved. Recognising Dad's approval of Jacob's marital choice, 'Esau...realised how displeasing the Canaanite women were to his father Isaac...and married Mahalath', Abraham's granddaughter, but, alas, also Ishmael's daughter. (Genesis 28:8-9 NIV) A child at any age will do anything, however irrational or self-destructive, to earn and keep the love of parents! Did it work? No! Nothing he did could make his dad love him. The real problem was a self-centred parent who loved when it benefitted him! Certainly, Jacob and Esau were adults, responsible for their own choices. But parents are like potters, with the power to mould their child's character, conduct, convictions and course of life. Parents, nothing matters more to your children in life than your unconditional love for them!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Isaac...loved Esau, but Rebekah loved Jacob.' Genesis 25:28 NIV<br /><br />
<p>Isaac's favouritism triggered rivalry between his two sons. Now some rivalry is normal and healthy and is usually outgrown, but not in Esau's and Jacob's case. Time only turned their rivalry into hatred. It's tempting to blame Esau's explosive anger, but his brother Jacob was no innocent victim. Catching Esau at a moment of extreme hunger, Jacob tricked him into trading his inheritance for a bowl of stew. Later, pretending to be his brother, Jacob stole Esau's prophetic blessing from under their ageing father's nose. Where does this kind of toxic rivalry originate? Is it about good kids versus bad kids? Not likely! 'Isaac loved Esau.' Esau got his father's love, leaving Jacob resentful over getting what he, Jacob, wanted but was denied. Jacob couldn't get the love he craved from his father so he grabbed what he could: the birthright and the blessing. When children are denied our love they become self-destructive, pursuing whatever love-substitutes they can get from us or other sources. Jacob wasn't born a 'bad boy'. The failure of Isaac's love and his favouritism towards Esau left Jacob feeling rejected, hating the brother he perceived to be his problem. And Esau didn't start out a 'bad boy' either. His mother Rebekah favoured Jacob and helped concoct his 'stolen blessing scam'. Jacob wasn't loved by his father; Esau wasn't loved by his mother. Their parents weren't on the same page. Their favouritism led to one son becoming a fugitive and another programmed for a life of failure. Parents, consider carefully your power to shape your child's life!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...Let the little children come to Me...' Mark 10:14 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Mark records, 'They brought little children to Him, that He might touch them; but the disciples rebuked those who brought them. But when Jesus saw it, He was greatly displeased and said to them, &quot;Let the little children come to Me.&quot;...And He took them up in His arms, laid His hands on them, and blessed them.' (vv 13-16 NKJV) Notice three things. First, Jesus was never too busy for a child. By the time a child is five they've learned 75 per cent of everything they'll know in life. And by the time they're 18 their mind is set like a mould. Even if you don't have any children of your own, endeavour to be a role model to every child who crosses your path. Lift them. Jesus did! Secondly, Jesus admired children for their capacity to trust. We adults know so much, but believe so little. We complicate faith. We filter it through our intellect or our life's experiences. We rationalise our faith away by saying things like, 'Yes, I know God promised that, but...' Jesus said, 'Whoever does not receive the Kingdom of God as a little child will by no means enter it.' (Mark 10:15 NKJV) Finally, Jesus loved and encouraged children. 'He took them up in His arms, laid His hands on them, and blessed them.' Wow! Those children would never forget that experience. Imagine looking back to a moment in your life when the Lord picked you up, held you in His arms, laid His hands on you and blessed you. What a legacy! In this busy world, if you're serious about becoming more like Jesus you must learn to love children. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Blessed is the man...whose confidence is in [God].' Jeremiah 17:7 NIV<br /><br /><p>It takes courage to be led by God. It's not easy to 'break the mould' and rise above the limits others place on you. When you do, you'll face disapproval. Jesus did. When the folks He grew up around said, 'Isn't this the carpenter's son?...' (Matthew 13:55 NIV), they were really saying, 'He should stay in His place!' When they tell you that, don't listen. '...each of us will give an account of himself to God.' (Romans 14:12 NIV) In the final audit you'll discover that not only is it wrong to be judgmental of others, it's also wrong to permit their opinions to control you. 'Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord, whose confidence is in Him.' To follow God's leading you must have confidence that He loves you in spite of your shortcomings; He has a definite plan for your life; you are capable of hearing from Him for yourself; and whatever He asks of you, He will enable you to do. Once you've heard from God, be resolute! Things worth having never come easy. If you find yourself weakening, ask God for determination and He will impart it to you through His Spirit. If you find yourself being in two minds, go back and ask yourself what God told you in the beginning-then stick with it. Don't go in a different direction because of worry, discouragement or the sentiments of others. Remind yourself that you have what it takes to succeed in whatever God has called you to do. If you've made Jesus Lord of your life, His determination lives in you-because He lives in you. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...the deeds of a man's hands will return to him.' Proverbs 12:14 NAS<br /><br /><p>A lady was driving along a back road in stifling hot weather when she passed an elderly man attempting to fix a flat tyre. A woman alone can't be too careful; nevertheless, she hoped somebody would stop. When nobody did, she went back and found the old man weak and perspiring. 'Thanks,' he gasped. 'I prayed somebody would stop.' Using her mobile phone to call for help, the woman waited with him. He introduced himself as Bill Krumweide, talked about his family and his hobby of collecting antique farm equipment. He offered to pay her but the Good Samaritan said, 'Just knowing I was an answer to prayer is enough.' Ten years later the same lady was worried about her aging father, who could no longer take care of the family farm. When she called a volunteer organisation for help, four men arrived with heavy equipment and spent three days planting the crops. One of the men looked familiar, and when he introduced himself she realised why. It turned out he was the elderly man's son, Bill Krumweide, Jr. 'Thank you for helping my dad all those years ago,' he said. 'I'm the one who owes you,' the woman replied. 'It's amazing how one kindness followed another and connected our families in a bond of gratitude. And it started...with an old man's prayer.' What goes around comes around: 'The deeds of a man's hands will return to him.' God rewards us '...according to [our] work.' (Proverbs 24:12 NAS) You don't live in a vacuum. The Bible says, 'knowing that whatever good anyone does, he will receive the same from the Lord...' (Ephesians 6:8 NKJV) </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...be of one mind, united in thought and purpose...' 1 Corinthians 1:10 NLT<br /><br /><p>If you keep bailing out of relationships every time they hit troubled waters, get used to your own company-it's the only company you'll have! The best relationship you can hope for is an imperfect one you keep working on every day. Relationships can't be based on seeing eye-to-eye on all points, but on a commitment to love each other and a willingness to work for peace. Jesus said, 'God blesses those who work for peace...' (Matthew 5:9 NLT) Notice, peacemaking is 'work', but the rewards are worth it. Relationships are always worth restoring. God wants us to value our relationships instead of discarding them every time there's a problem. Paul wrote, 'Is there any encouragement from belonging to Christ?...Any fellowship together in the Spirit?...Then [agree] wholeheartedly with each other, loving one another, and working together with one heart and purpose...' (Philippians 2:1-2 NLT) Our ability to get along with each other is a mark of spiritual maturity. God wants His family to be known for their love. Strife and bickering send the wrong message to a watching world. Paul was embarrassed when the church in Corinth started splitting into warring factions and taking each other to court. 'Shame on you!' he wrote. 'Surely there is at least one wise person...who can settle a dispute between fellow Christians.' (1 Corinthians 6:5 GNT) He was shocked and disappointed that nobody was mature enough to resolve the conflict peacefully. So he wrote, '...be of one mind, united in thought and purpose...'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...be of one mind, united in thought and purpose...' 1 Corinthians 1:10 NLT<br /><br /><p>If you're serious about restoring a broken relationship, before you talk to the other person, talk to God. He can change their heart, your heart, or both hearts. It's amazing how different you feel when you've prayed. Often the conflict is rooted in unmet needs. Any time you expect human beings to meet needs only God can meet, you're in trouble. 'What causes...quarrels among you?... You want something but don't get it... You do not have, because you do not ask God.' (James 4:1-2 NIV) Instead of looking to God, you look to people, then you get angry when they fail you. God says, 'Why don't you come to me first?' Make sure you arrange to talk to them one-on-one. Even though you've been offended, God expects you to make the first move: '...go and be reconciled to that person...' (Matthew 5:24 NLT) We say, 'Time heals.' Not necessarily; sometimes it just causes wounds to fester. Taking control of the situation reduces the damage. Plus, bitterness only hurts your fellowship with God and keeps your prayers from being answered (1 Peter 3:7). Job's friends reminded him, 'You are only hurting yourself with your anger...' (Job 18:4 GNT) Don't forget that timing is all-important. Don't try to mend a relationship when you're tired, rushed or will be interrupted. And don't do it 'on the hoof'. The time and effort you're willing to put into restoring it indicates the value you place on the relationship. So do it when you're both at your best. You say, 'I'm not sure I can do it.' Yes, you can; God '...has given us this ministry of restoring relationships.' (2 Corinthians 5:18 GWT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...be of one mind, united in thought and purpose...' 1 Corinthians 1:10 NLT<br /><br /><p>Getting along with each other requires more than compliance, it calls for cooperation. So make sure you validate the other person's feelings! Never try to talk someone out of how they 'feel'. Listen without being defensive, and nod that you understand-even when you don't agree. Feelings aren't always true or logical, but until they're validated you won't get anywhere. David said, 'When my...feelings were hurt, I was...stupid.' (Psalm 73:21-22 GNT) We all act badly when we're hurt. But Solomon says, 'A man's wisdom gives him patience; it is to his glory to overlook an offence.' (Proverbs 19:11 NIV) When you are willing to empathise with someone's feelings it says, 'I care about our relationship more than our differences; you matter to me.' Yes, it's a sacrifice to patiently absorb somebody's anger, especially when it's unfounded. But remember, that's what Jesus does for you! Getting along with each other means that you must confess your part. Jesus said, '...First get rid of the log in your own eye; then you will see well enough to deal with the speck in your friend's eye.' (Matthew 7:5 NLT) Since we all have blind spots, get a friend to help you evaluate your attitudes and actions before meeting with the other person. Ask God, 'Am I part of the problem? Am I unrealistic, insensitive or too sensitive?' Confession is a powerful tool! When you can admit your own flaws, it defuses the other person's anger because they're expecting you to be defensive. Don't make excuses or shift blame, just acknowledge your part. You say, 'That's hard to do.' Yes, but God '...has given us this ministry of restoring relationships.' (2 Corinthians 5:18 GWT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...be of one mind, united in thought and purpose...' 1 Corinthians 1:10 NLT<br /><br /><p>Here are two things you must do in order to mend a broken relationship. First, attack the problem, not the person. You can't fix the problem if you're obsessed with fixing the blame. The Bible says, 'A gentle answer quiets anger, but a harsh one stirs it up.' (Proverbs 15:1 GNT) In resolving any conflict, how you say it is as important as what you say. If you say it offensively, you'll be received defensively. 'A wise, mature person is known for his understanding. The more pleasant his words, the more persuasive he is.' (Proverbs 16:21 GNT) Nagging doesn't work. You're never persuasive when you're abrasive! Don't use words that are condemning, belittling, comparing, labelling, insulting, condescending or sarcastic; rather, 'Use...only helpful words...so that what you say will do good to those who hear you.' (Ephesians 4:29 GNT) Secondly, focus on your relationship, not your differences. It's unrealistic to expect everybody to agree about everything. But when we focus on the relationship, the problem often loses its significance, diminishes or becomes irrelevant. Often we can re-establish the relationship even though we're unable to resolve our differences. We'll always have honest disagreements, but surely, by God's grace, we can disagree without being disagreeable. We can walk arm-in-arm without seeing eye-to-eye. This doesn't mean giving up on finding a solution. You may need to continue discussing it-but now you agree to do it in the spirit of love. Reconciliation means burying the hatchet, not necessarily the issue. So who do you need to contact? With whom do you need to restore fellowship? Pick up the phone and begin the process.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Isaac...loved Esau, but Rebekah loved Jacob.' Genesis 25:28 NIV<br /><br />
<p>The verdict is in: How your children turn out says more about your parenting skills than about their genes! The story of Esau and Jacob is a case study in favouritism, sibling rivalry, conditional acceptance and parental failure (Genesis 25-27). The twin boys are as different as chalk and cheese. Esau is the nature-loving sportsman type. Jacob is the quiet, home-loving, sensitive type. Personalities so diverse challenge our parenting skills. But the crucial difference wasn't between these two boys, it was between the parents, and between the parents and the boys. Isaac and Rebekah, as parents, were not united; they did not love unconditionally! 'Isaac, who had a taste for wild game, loved Esau.' There's the crux of their family dysfunction! Dad 'loved' based on his conditions. If Esau brought home the venison, he was loved. There are basically three kinds of love: love if you meet my need; love because you have met my need and love in spite of, requiring nothing from you-God's kind of love, the love children need from parents. Selfish parenting requires children to constantly prove they're worthy of our love. Isaac's was love if-and because-Esau met his needs. But conditional love is like probation. Its temporary approval and earned favouritism leave our children feeling, 'If I don't do and be what you want, you'll reject me.' It breeds insecurity, inadequacy, anxiety, deceit, depression and self-destructive ideas in children. Grades, looks, gifts and abilities have nothing to do with love. Ironically though, your child's performance and attitude are likely to improve significantly from knowing they're loved unconditionally.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...we were bold in our God...' 1 Thessalonians 2:2 NKJV <br /><br />
<p>If you want to be led by God you must learn to be bold; not rude or insensitive, but bold, because God will sometimes direct you to do things others don't understand or agree with. Any time you step outside the boundaries of what others think is acceptable, you risk rejection. So be it! You can't allow that to keep you from doing what you know God wants you to do. Confronting criticism becomes a little easier when you remember that, ultimately, '...each of us shall give account of himself to God.' (Romans 14:12 NKJV) It hurts to be criticised. But if you're to succeed in life, you must have the attitude Paul had. Ben Campbell Johnson paraphrases Paul's words in 1 Corinthians 4:3-4: 'I am not the least concerned with the fact that you are deciding what is right and what is wrong with me... Neither you nor anyone else can put me down unless I first put myself down (and I'm not doing that)... Though I don't know of anything against me, my ignorance doesn't mean that I am correct in my appraisal, because the final evaluation is in God's hands.' Secure people can handle being the only ones doing something. They can also allow others the same choice because they know we have been called to love one another, not analyse and categorise one another! To avoid growing old and feeling like somewhere along the way you got lost and never succeeded at being what God called you to be, you must be bold.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['The Lord...knows how weak we are...' Psalm 103:13-14 NLT<br /><br /><p>Since we now live longer, many of us are caring for sick and aging family members. But who's caring for the caregivers? Who's meeting their needs? If you are a caregiver, here are a few things you must learn to do for yourself. First, ask for help. John Donne wrote, 'No man is an island.' Reaching for help may feel awkward at first, but keep doing it and you'll develop a comfort level. Start by listing all the areas in which your loved one needs help. Be specific: household chores, transportation, personal finances, bathing, dressing, etc. When you get a 'no' don't take it personally, just look elsewhere. There are people all around you who are just waiting to be asked, people who find joy and fulfilment in serving. Secondly, get connected. Don't try to reinvent the wheel. Take advantage of the resources in your church, community programmes, support groups, senior citizen centres and the internet. Involve your family, as well as your friends and neighbours. The Bible says, 'A person standing alone can be...defeated, but two can stand back-to-back and conquer. Three are even better...' (Ecclesiastes 4:12 NLT) Thirdly, remember that you're human; God does! Don't feel bad about feeling bad. God is 'tender and compassionate... For He knows how weak we are.' (Psalm 103:13-14 NLT) Focusing on someone else's needs to the exclusion of your own seems noble, but it also sets you up for guilt, anger, depression and burnout. Your emotions influence your physical health, so giving yourself permission to 'feel your feelings' not only enables you to stay healthy, but also ensures you'll stay around to be a compassionate and able caregiver.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['That all of them may be one...' John 17:21 NIV<br /><br /><p>This may come as a shock, but the Book of Life doesn't record your denomination next to your name. In Heaven there are no religious labels. If someone has the right to call Jesus 'Lord', you must treat them as your brother and sister regardless of which church they attend. We're all related by blood-the blood of Jesus! As believers the Bible tells us to 'preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.' (Ephesians 4:3 NAS) Notice, God doesn't tell us to create unity, He tells us to preserve it. Comedian Elmo Phillips used to tell this story: 'In a conversation with a person I had recently met, I asked, &quot;Are you a Protestant or a Catholic?&quot; My new acquaintance replied, &quot;Protestant.&quot; I said, &quot;Me too!&quot; I asked, &quot;What franchise?&quot; He answered, &quot;Baptist.&quot; &quot;Me too!&quot; I said. &quot;Northern Baptist or Southern Baptist?&quot; &quot;Northern Baptist,&quot; he replied. &quot;Me too!&quot; I shouted. We continued to go back and forth. Finally I asked, &quot;Northern Conservative Fundamentalist Baptist, Great Lakes Region, Council of 1879, or Northern Conservative Fundamentalist Baptist, Great Lakes Region, Council of 1912?&quot; He replied, &quot;'Northern Conservative Fundamentalist Baptist, Great Lakes Region, Council of 1912.&quot; I said, &quot;Die, heretic!&quot;' Seriously, do you know what Jesus prayed for? 'That all of them may be one...so that the world may believe.' A divided church is a wounded and weak church. Have you ever considered what would happen if we downplayed our labels and put our contents on display? Maybe we wouldn't need signs outside our door to attract people, because they'd be drawn by the love of those inside. It's worth thinking about, isn't it?</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...do not think it strange...' 1 Peter 4:12 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Faith in God doesn't exempt you from life's trials; it sustains you in them and you grow stronger as a result of them. Trials come in different areas such as sickness, unemployment, relational conflict, and personal challenges. And trials have different time lines; some last a short season, others a lifetime. And trials, like storms, have different intensity levels. But most trials have one thing in common: they make you say, 'If only I could understand why this has happened.' The Bible answers this question in two Scriptures: 'Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivers him out of them all' (Psalm 34:19 NKJV); and '...for a little while...you have been grieved by various trials, that the genuineness of your faith, being much more precious than gold that perishes, though it is tested by fire, may be found to praise, honour, and glory...' (1 Peter 1:6-7 NKJV) God is not Santa Claus or your butler. It's not His job to give you everything you want, exactly when you want it. Yes, God has promised to bless us, but when you focus on 'getting', by implication you question the faith of those who may not have as much as you. That's a mistake. Claiming God's promises doesn't mean you will escape adversity. Who told you that anyway? Not God! His Word says, 'Do not think it strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you.' Real maturity often takes place in the crucible of pain. The truth is, you'll never know how strong your faith is until you've been there. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I have set the Lord always before me...' Psalm 16:8 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Frank Laubach's life began to fall apart when his plans for the Maranao people of the Philippines were rejected. Then, after losing three children to malaria, his wife and remaining child moved away. In despair, Laubach climbed a mountain to seek God. He writes, 'My lips began to move and it seemed God was speaking: &quot;You failed because you don't really love these people. You feel superior...because you're white. Forget your skin-tone; think only about how much I love them and they'll respond.&quot; I answered, &quot;God, I don't know whether You spoke through my lips, but I know it was the truth. My plans have all gone to pieces. Drive me out of myself, take possession, think Your thoughts through my mind.&quot;' That day Laubach decided to live-focused on God's presence! He writes about two things: double vision-seeing others not as they are, but as God sees them; and problem solving-including God so you'll always think more clearly. At mealtime an extra chair at the table can remind you He's always present. Set a Scripture where you'll see it as you're falling asleep and waking up. Count on it-this will set the tone for your day. The New Living Bible paraphrases the Psalmist's words, 'I know the Lord is always with me. I will not be shaken, for He is right beside me.' (Psalm 16:8 NLT) What you focus on becomes the dominant influence in your life. Frank Laubach went on to write books, lead world literacy crusades and become an adviser to kings and presidents. But his biggest accomplishment was learning to focus on Jesus. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Barnabas...encouraged them all...' Acts 11:22-23 NIV<br /><br /><p>Ronald Reagan earned the nickname 'The Great Communicator' because he was a gifted speaker. Earvin Johnson earned the nickname 'Magic' because of what he could do with a basketball. And Joseph of Cyprus earned the nickname 'Barnabas' because wherever he went he 'encouraged them all'. What a testimony! The Scripture says, 'Joseph, a Levite from Cyprus, whom the apostles called Barnabas (which means Son of Encouragement), sold a field...brought the money and put it at the apostles' feet.' (Acts 4:36-37 NIV) Then, 'When [Barnabas] arrived...he...encouraged them all to remain true... He was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith...' (Acts 11:23-24 NIV) Barnabas accompanied Paul on missionary trips and wherever he went his spirit of encouragement shone through: '...they returned to Lystra, Iconium and Antioch, strengthening the disciples...' (Acts 14:21-22 NIV) 'When [Paul] came to Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he really was a disciple. But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles...' (Acts 9:26-27 NIV) It was Barnabas who encouraged them to accept Paul and work with him as a brother in Christ. When Paul didn't want to take John Mark with them because of a perceived failure, Barnabas gave him a second chance. Later Paul acknowledged what a great asset John Mark was. Indeed, it seems he ended up writing the Gospel of Mark, but without encouragement from Barnabas it might not have happened.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I will heal your wounds...' Jeremiah 30:17 AMP<br /><br /><p>Have you built a wall around yourself, saying, 'No one can hurt me if I don't let anyone get close to me'? It won't work. The wall you've built to keep others out has you locked in. The Lord wants to be your protector, but He can't if you are busy trying to protect yourself. God didn't promise that you would never get hurt, but He promised to heal you if you come to Him rather than trying to take care of everything yourself. If you've built walls around yourself out of fear, then you must tear them down through faith. Go to Jesus with each old wound and receive His healing. When someone hurts you, don't let it fester; rather, take it to the Lord in prayer and be willing to handle it His way instead of your own. Read what God told His people, and receive it as a promise to you: 'For I will restore health to you, and I will heal your wounds, says the Lord, because they have called you an outcast, saying, This is [fill in your name], whom no one seeks after and for whom no one cares.' You won't merely survive this hurt, you'll grow stronger through it and be able to minister to others. 'Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort those who are in any trouble, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.' (2 Corinthians 1:3-4 NKJV) So, tear down those walls!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...There is a cloud, as small as a man's hand, rising...' 1 Kings 18:44 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Every success story begins with somebody taking a small step or sowing a small seed, which usually represents all they have at that moment. Simply stated: everything big starts with something small. If you're not willing to start small, you can't start at all! The servant who kept telling Elijah nothing was happening, finally saw something. It was just a tiny cloud, but it had great potential. God loves to use things we think are insignificant. He used a boy's lunch to feed a multitude, a slingshot to bring down a giant, and a handful of clay to restore a blind man's eyesight. He can use a little job, a little money, or a little idea to bless you. Little clouds are indicators of what's coming; they're conduits God has chosen to use. When God promises you something, He doesn't need anything big to make it happen. Often the change that impacts many starts with one individual. Whether it's an Esther or a Paul or a Mother Teresa or a Billy Graham, God only needs one person who believes Him and dares to step out on His Word. When God pours out His blessing upon you, you'll begin to see three things. First, that your problems are just an opportunity for Him to '...show Himself strong on [your] behalf...' (2 Chronicles 16:9 NKJV) Secondly, that His '...strength is made perfect in [your] weakness...' (2 Corinthians 12:9 NKJV) Thirdly, that you can reach a place where you actually begin to thank God for your enemies, because God 'prepares a table' and vindicates you right there in front of them (Psalm 23:5 NKJV).</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Barnabas...encouraged them all...' Acts 11:22-23 NIV<br /><br /><p>Our talents should be used '...for the edification of the church...' (1 Corinthians 14:12 NKJV) The word 'edify' comes from an architectural term which means 'to fortify, construct, and build up'. Your gifts were designed by God to build others up. Only when you use them for that purpose will you find fulfilment. If you're not familiar with the name 'Joseph of Cyprus', that's all right. Most of us know him by his nickname, '...Barnabas (which means Son of Encouragement).' (Acts 4:36 NIV) When New Testament Christians were discouraged and needed to be cheered on, the church at Jerusalem sent Barnabas, who 'encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord...and a great number of people were brought to the Lord'. Then as the work grew and flourished, Barnabas asked Paul to join them, and he took on a supporting role (Acts 11:25-26). Rebecca Barlow Jordan says, 'The encourager may begin in the front row, but eventually he retreats to his rightful place in the background... After Paul and Barnabas had travelled together, Paul emerged as the leader and Barnabas faded into the background as many encouragers do. There are always orphans to adopt and...hungry hearts that need spiritual encouragement. Encouragers don't look for honours, but the results of their work, like the works of Barnabas, are unmistakable.' What oxygen does for the body, encouragement does for the soul. It inspires us to persevere when it would be easier to just quit. The truth is that you'll never look into the eyes of a single person who's not important to God! So help them by making '...every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification...' (Romans 14:19 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...there is the sound...of rain.' 1 Kings 18:41 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Are you going through a spiritual dry spell? Are you busy encouraging others while your own life seems to be falling apart? You're not unique. It happened to Elijah, a prophet who'd just called down fire from Heaven on Mount Carmel and defeated 850 false prophets in a spectacular victory. Suddenly he found himself in a full-blown famine with every human resource dried up and his back to the wall. So what did he do? '...he bowed down on the ground, and put his face between his knees.' (1 Kings 18:42 NKJV) Good move! Elijah decided to shut out his surroundings, reach for God's help, and keep praying until he had an answer. When the answer came, it came as 'a sound of abundance of rain'. Notice, what Elijah heard in his spirit was completely at odds with what he could see or hear around him. His spirit sensed rain before a drop fell. There's an important lesson here. When God speaks to you He will speak to your spirit, not your flesh. What He says there will be more real than anything that's happening in your circumstances. But be warned, what you hear in your spirit may go against what you hear in your intellect, or what you have in the bank, or what's happening at work, or what's taking place at home, or what's happening in your body. Elijah had to discount all the 'no rain' reports he kept getting. So will you. When you know God has promised you a certain thing you must tune out the negativity around you, stand on His Word and keep believing!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Go up now, look toward the sea.' 1 Kings 18:43 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Elijah 'said to his servant, &quot;Go up now, look toward the sea.&quot; So he went up and looked, and said, &quot;There is nothing.&quot; And seven times [Elijah] said, &quot;Go again&quot;... the seventh time...[the servant] said, &quot;There is a cloud, as small as a man's hand, rising out of the sea!&quot; So [Elijah] said, &quot;Go up, say to Ahab, 'Prepare your chariot, and go down before the rain stops you.&quot;' (1 Kings 18:43-44 NKJV) Notice four things in this story. First, you must look to God for your answer, not people. 'Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord...He will be like a tree planted by the water that sends out its roots by the stream...It has no worries in a year of drought and never fails to bear fruit.' (Jeremiah 17:7-8 NIV) Secondly, you must keep believing what God says. Elijah kept getting the same negative report, 'There is nothing.' But he kept believing God until finally, the seventh time, his servant said, 'There is a cloud, as small as a man's hand, rising out of the sea.' God had promised it was coming, so he stood on God's Word. Thirdly, you must not be influenced by those who don't share your vision. Elijah's servant kept saying, 'Nothing is happening.' But Elijah knew better. You can't be led by those who aren't in sync with you spiritually. Finally, you must position yourself to receive. '...He... put his face between his knees.' (1 Kings 18:42 NKJV) That's a submission and a birthing position! Today what you sense within you is real, but if you don't get into position and push it won't happen. If you do, God will bless you with 'abundance'. (1 Kings 18:41 NKJV)</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['If you are untrustworthy about worldly wealth...' Luke 16:11 NLT<br /><br /><p>We never really own anything; it's just a loan. It was God's property before we arrived, and He'll lend it to somebody else after we're gone. Our selfish culture says, 'If I don't own it, why should I take care of it?' Those who understand God's will live by a higher standard. They say, 'Because God owns it, I'll take even better care of it!' In God's Kingdom, '...those who are trusted with something valuable must show they are worthy of that trust.' (1 Corinthians 4:2 NCV) To illustrate this, Jesus told the story of a businessman who entrusted his wealth to his servants while he was away. When he returned he evaluated and rewarded them accordingly: 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!' (Matthew 25:21 NIV) When you make the most of what God has given to you He promises three rewards. First, you'll be given commendation: 'Well done, good and faithful servant!' Next, you'll receive promotion: 'I will put you in charge of many things.' Finally, you'll be honoured with a celebration: 'Come and share your master's happiness.' For many of us, money is the greatest test of all. Jesus addresses this: 'If you are untrustworthy about worldly wealth, who will trust you with the true riches of Heaven?' (Luke 16:11 NLT) There's a direct correlation between how you use your money, and the quality of your life. So the question is: could the way you're handling your money be preventing God from blessing you with more?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...the Father seeks...worshippers.' John 4:23 NAS<br /><br /><p>When we fail to worship God we always find a substitute, even if it ends up being ourselves. Worship is a universal urge, hard-wired by God into every fibre of our being. It's as natural as breathing. Jesus said we were made this way because 'the Father seeks...worshippers'. Depending on your religious background you may need to expand your understanding of worship. For example: worship is more than just music. We say, 'At our church we have the worship first, then the teaching.' No, it's <i>all</i> done for God's glory! If worship is just music, then what about all those people who can't carry a tune at all? Also remember, worship is not a style. The music style you prefer says more about you than about God. One person's music preference often sounds like noise to another. But not to God-He loves 'joyful noise' and all the varieties it comes in. (Psalm 100:1) Also, worship is not just for your benefit, but for God's. When you say, 'I didn't get anything out of the service today,' you worshipped for the wrong reason! Yes, there are personal benefits, but we don't worship to please ourselves. Our highest motive should be to exalt God in whatever we do. Finally, worship should not be confined to church; as Martin Luther said, 'A dairymaid can milk cows to the glory of God.' The secret of worship is in doing everything 'as unto the Lord'. The Bible says, '...because of God's great mercy to us I appeal to you: Offer yourselves as...dedicated to His service and pleasing to Him...' (Romans 12:1 GNT) That's what it means to worship!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I will walk at liberty and at ease...' Psalm 119:45 AMP<br /><br /><p>In life, 'it's always something'. When you solve one problem, another is waiting to take its place. Jesus said, 'These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.' (John 16:33 NKJV) Observe two things Jesus said. First, 'In Me you may have peace'; secondly, 'In the world you will have [trouble].' God's peace becomes a certainty only when you listen to, and obey 'these things I have spoken to you'. The Psalmist wrote, 'I will keep Your law continually...[hearing, receiving, loving, and obeying it]. And I will walk at liberty and at ease, for I have sought and inquired for [and desperately required] Your precepts.' (Psalm 119:44-45 AMP) Two words in this Scripture are worthy of note. The first is 'inquired' which implies seeking to find the truth. The second is 'required' which implies walking according to its principles every day. Only as you do these two things will you be able to 'walk at liberty and at ease'. Your life will not be frustrating, you'll have joy in spite of the circumstances, and consulting God will be the first thing you do, not the last. So if you've lost your peace of mind today, ask yourself, 'Am I walking according to God's Word?' Obedience brings rest: 'For we who have believed (adhered to and trusted in and relied on God) do enter that rest...' (Hebrews 4:3 AMP) As soon as you start obeying God's Word you will be 'at ease'. And that is how God wants you to live today. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['We are not wrestling with flesh and blood...' Ephesians 6:12 AMP<br /><br /><p>Satan uses people and circumstances, but they are not our real enemy-he is. He works through people and circumstances, then delights in watching us react without ever realising that he is the source. When Satan used Peter to try to prevent Jesus from going to the cross to complete the task God had sent Him to do, 'Jesus turned away from Peter and said to him, &quot;Get behind Me, Satan! You are in My way [an offence and a hindrance and a snare to Me]...&quot;' (Matthew 16:23 AMP) Satan used Peter, but Jesus knew that Peter was not His problem. So He 'turned away' from Peter and addressed the source of the problem-Satan. So, first, identify the source of your problem. At the cross Jesus prayed, 'Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do.' (Luke 23:34 NKJV) When you understand that Satan's strategy is to use other people to tear you down, it's easier to forgive them. You don't have to carry the weight of resentment, or lash out, or even change them; you can leave them in God's hands. You won't be exempt from the devil's attack, but you'll be shielded from it and you won't be discouraged or defeated by it. You see, if the devil can't defeat you outright, he'll settle for keeping you pinned down. That way you'll never move forward in victory. Secondly, use the authority God has given you. Jesus said, 'I saw Satan fall like lightning from Heaven. Behold, I give you the authority...over all the power of the enemy...' (Luke 10:18-19 NKJV) So identify the source, and use your God-given authority. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I will remember My covenant...' Genesis 9:15 NIV<br /><br />
<p>The rain Noah experienced was a symbol of judgment. But after the flood God said, '...Never again...' (Genesis 9:15 NKJV) He told Noah, '...the rainbow shall be seen in the cloud; and I will remember My covenant which is between Me and you... the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy...' (Genesis 9:14-15 NKJV) From that point on in Scripture, rain became a symbol of blessing. '...I will...open for you the windows of Heaven and pour out for you such blessing that there will not be room enough to receive it.' (Malachi 3:10 NKJV) Are you afraid that the heartache of your past is going to return? Don't be. Just keep walking with the God Who promised, 'Never again!' When God uses the thing that should have destroyed you to develop you, you'll look back and say, 'It is good for me that I have been afflicted, that I may learn Your statutes.' (Psalm 119:71 NKJV) Without hard times you wouldn't have discovered certain things; for example, that stress can create in you a passion to seek God more and other things less; the power of your own prayers; what God can accomplish in spite of adversity; that when He heard you crying, your tears were so precious that He collected them in His bottle (Psalm 56:8); that the angel of the Lord protected you when the enemy wanted to take you out (Psalm 34:7); that God didn't need your friends to support you in order to bless you and that He brought you through, because He saw the rainbow and remembered His promise.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I require your...firstfruits...' Ezekiel 20:40 AMP<br /><br /><p>God wants to be number one in your life! When He's not, things won't work out right for you. Instead of asking God to bless your agenda, ask Him to give you an agenda He can bless. Jesus was able to say <i>yes</i> to one thing and <i>no</i> to another because He understood God's agenda for the day. Can you point to a single stressed-out or confused moment in Christ's life? No, when conflict arose He said, '...I always do what pleases Him.' (John 8:29 NIV) That's because He took time to consult His Father. How long are you going to allow yourself to be pulled in 101 different directions? Nothing will change until you decide to give God what He requires-your 'firstfruits'. Don't give Him the part of your day when you're worn out, can't think straight and can hardly keep your eyes open; give Him the best part of your day. That's where your true priorities will be discovered. From getting dressed to setting your schedule, ask Him to help you make choices that glorify Him. As you become more and more aware of His presence, it'll be impossible to 'compartmentalise' Him. Ordinary events will become sacred events because He's involved in them. Ask Him to direct you in the choices you make and to empower you for the jobs you need to get done. Keep Him first in everything you set out to do, and He will show you the path that leads to peace. Following the moment-by-moment leadership of the Holy Spirit will cause you to enjoy every day of your life. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['You are the salt of the earth...' Matthew 5:13 AMP<br /><br /><p>We keep trying to find happiness the wrong way. We attempt to find it by getting instead of giving. Love must give; it's the nature of love to do so: 'live a life of love, just as Christ loved us and gave Himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.' (Ephesians 5:2 NIV) Note the words 'gave Himself' and 'sacrifice'. Love is all about giving of yourself and sacrificing to meet the needs of others-practical needs as well as spiritual needs. Some of us are so religious that we see no value in meeting people's everyday needs. Love for God is the root; love for others is the fruit, expressed through encouragement, patience, kindness, courtesy, humility, unselfishness, good temper, gentleness and sincerity (Galatians 5:22). We must actively seek ways to show love, especially in little things. Jesus said, 'You are the salt of the earth, but if salt has lost its taste (its strength, its quality)...it is not good for anything any longer but to be thrown out.' Salt is like love; it can heal, purify, preserve and enrich, but it's useless if it's kept in a shaker and not sprinkled around. The truth is that all of life is tasteless without love. Even acts of generosity done out of obligation, but devoid of love, leave us empty. Love is the energy of life; it should be the reason we get up every morning. Each day can be exciting and meaningful if we see ourselves as God's agents, waiting in the shadows to sprinkle some salt on all the tasteless lives we encounter. So, get your shaker ready! </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The fear of the Lord adds length to life...' Proverbs 10:27 NIV<br /><br /><p>Don't let fear dominate your later years. Don't let life's 'unknowables', such as finances, health, loneliness, loss of friends and family members, get you down. The Bible says, '...You do not know the path of the wind...how bones are formed in the womb...you do not know the activity of God...' (Ecclesiastes 11:5 NAS) There's much in life you'll never know, yet God has brought you this far! So, 'Trust in the Lord with all your heart... Don't be impressed with your own wisdom. Instead, fear the Lord...Then you will gain renewed health and vitality.' (Proverbs 3:5-8 NLT) It's who, not what, you know that will prosper and protect you all of your days. Put the unknown into God's hand and trust Him with your worries. 'Sow your seed in the morning [your youthful years] and do not be idle in the evening [your older years]' because you do not know whether your evening and your morning sowing 'will succeed...or...both of them...' (Ecclesiastes 11:6 NAS) Activate, don't vegetate! And decide to rejoice every day. General MacArthur said, 'Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up interest wrinkles the soul... When the wires are down and your heart is covered with the snows of pessimism and the ice of cynicism, then and only then, have you grown old.' Determine to add joy to the gift of long life. 'Indeed, if a man should live many years, let him rejoice in them all...' (Ecclesiastes 11:8 NAS) </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The fear of the Lord adds length to life...' Proverbs 10:27 NIV<br /><br /><p>Ageing well requires that you stay flexible. The Bible says, '...Clouds always bring rain; trees always stay wherever they fall. If you worry about the weather and don't plant seeds, you won't harvest a crop.' (Ecclesiastes 11:3-4 CEV) Certain things are inevitable in life. Clouds bring the rain. Trees fall in a storm. Like the weather, circumstances arise that you can't control. Hazard-free living is a myth; every undertaking entails risk. 'If you dig a pit, you might fall in; if you break down a wall, a snake might bite you. You could even get hurt by...chopping a log.' (Ecclesiastes 10:8-9 CEV) You say, 'At my age, I play it safe and take no chances.' Avoiding risk guarantees missing what God has for you just ahead.</p>
<p>So how can you enjoy the final years of your life? Don't avoid; rather adjust, adapt and advance. But be practical; pace yourself! What if things take longer to do than when you were younger? Yes, your energy level may require more frequent breaks, but your advanced years allow you more time and less hurry than your frantic past. Slow down; embrace this opportunity to accomplish things you've never attempted. In his eighties, Rubinstein amazed audiences with his piano-playing skills. Gladstone became Britain's Prime Minister for the fourth time in his eighties. John Wesley preached every day aged 88. Moses led Israel at 120. Caleb led his troops against an army of giants at 80, and won. Two-thirds of the world's greatest works of art were accomplished by people over 65. Don't let a little rain, a falling tree or a possible risk stop you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The fear of the Lord adds length to life...' Proverbs 10:27 NIV<br /><br /><p>The secret of ageing well is staying young at heart, staying close to God, and staying fully engaged with life. The mirror isn't your problem; how you see yourself is. Have you noticed how 'young' some older people are, and how 'old' their peers seem? Seeking the elusive fountain of youth isn't the answer, nor is surrendering to time and fate. Rather, do these two things. First, be realistic! Nothing is sillier than a woman made up to re-create what she hasn't been for decades-except an older man in an unbuttoned shirt flashing jewellery intended to recreate the macho image of a lost youth. When you are comfortable with your age and stage of life, others will be too. Solomon points out that age decreases vigour, dims vision, slackens muscles, stiffens joints, whitens hair, and so on (Ecclesiastes 12:1-5). Vitamins, exercise and a good attitude help, but you must be realistic in order to handle ageing with dignity. Secondly, keep giving. 'Give generously, for your gifts will return to you later. Divide your gifts among many, for you do not know what risks lie ahead.' (Ecclesiastes 11:1-2 NLT) Don't stop investing your energy and resources into God's Kingdom because you think it's time for the young folk to take over. If you do that loneliness and depression will set in, and illness and death often soon follow. When you shut the door, draw the curtains and isolate yourself, you're old at any age. But when you stay in the mainstream, give yourself to God and others, you'll stay young all your life! </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The fear of the Lord adds length to life...' Proverbs 10:27 NIV<br /><br /><p>When asked about the benefits of living to be 100 years old, one centenarian smiled and said, 'There's very little peer pressure.' Thanks to medical science we're living to our eighties, nineties and beyond. But living longer means dealing with the realities of ageing. Our youth-orientated culture often gives old age a bad image, but clearly God doesn't agree. To Him, old age is the reward for a life well-lived, a privilege earned, an accomplishment worth celebrating, and wisdom shared to benefit succeeding generations. For the next few days let's observe some things about ageing.</p>
<p>Note how God sees ageing. He views long life as evidence of His favour. He says, '...Through Me your days will be many, and years will be added to your life.' (Proverbs 9:11 NIV) Longevity, with all its aches and pains, is a blessing. 'The fear of the Lord adds length to life, but the years of the wicked are cut short.' You say, 'But who will take care of me when I get old?' Don't worry, God will be there for you: '...I have cared for you since you were born... I will be your God throughout your lifetime-until your hair is white with age...I will care for you...' (Isaiah 46:3-4 NLT) What an insurance policy! Is there proof that He does? Yes, ask the Psalmist. 'Once I was young, and now I am old. Yet I have never seen the godly abandoned or their children begging for bread.' (Psalm 37:25 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...but if it dies...' John 12:24 NKJV<br /><br /><p>One day a depressed woman jumped off a bridge into a river. Without thinking, a man standing nearby jumped in to save her. But 'our hero' suddenly remembered that he couldn't swim, so he started thrashing around and screaming for help! Hearing his cries, the depressed woman swam to his rescue, hauled him out, administered mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and saved his life. What happened? She found a need greater than her own, and in so doing she found a reason to live. Jesus said, '...unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies [to self-interest], it produces much grain.' (John 12:24 NKJV) Christ also said, '...Do not worry about your life, what you will eat; nor about the body, what you will put on. Life is more than food, and the body is more than clothing.' (Luke 12:22-23 NKJV) Career success and material things cannot be your reason for living! You need a larger purpose, and God will give you one if you ask Him. Some of us are born knowing what God has called us to do in life; others discover it along the way. Some of us actually find it in our closing years. Indeed, some of us are awakened to it by tragedy and loss. What matters is that we find God's purpose and pour ourselves into it. Helen Keller wrote, 'When one door of happiness closes, another opens; but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one which God has opened for us.' So, have you found your reason for living?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The fear of the Lord adds length to life...' Proverbs 10:27 NIV<br /><br /><p>Our culture venerates rock stars and sports figures, yet often marginalises its most knowledgeable and seasoned people. How foolish! As God's family we should treat one another according to His values. Consider how He wants us to regard our aged. First, we must honour them: '...Show respect for the elderly and revere your God...' (Leviticus 19:32 NIV) Notice, it's a commandment, not an option. Failing to respect the elderly is failing to respect God; it bears the divine, not the cultural, signature! So remember it and teach it to your children. 'A grey head is a crown of glory; it is found in the way of righteousness.' (Proverbs 16:31 NAS) Secondly, we must encourage them. Encouraging them doesn't mean patronising, babying and doing everything for them. These behaviours destroy their dignity and disempower them. Encouraging them means believing in their God-given abilities and emphasising their positive, productive qualities. It means motivating them to stay involved in significant service, not just busying them with meaningless and humiliating mundane tasks. They feel like they're making a difference when their skills and wisdom are recognised. Thirdly, we must support them. This includes financial and material assistance offered according to practical, Biblical guidelines (1 Timothy 5:1-16). Failing here means we've '...denied the faith and [are] worse than an unbeliever' (v. 8 NKJV). Support means including them as a vital part of our family and church activities. Supporting them also requires that we regularly talk to God about them and their needs.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He who comes to God must believe that...He is a rewarder...' Hebrews 11:6 NAS<br /><br /><p>Christopher Pylant's parents refused to believe there was no hope for their son who'd been diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour. After studying the x-rays, neurosurgeon Ben Carson told them, 'There's no way I can encourage you.' 'The experts told us that in Georgia,' the mother replied, 'but God led us to Baltimore and said there's a doctor here who can help him. We believe you're that doctor.' Carson replied, 'I'll do my best,' praying for a miracle. When he operated, Christopher's brain stem looked like it had been consumed by cancer, and without that there's no real life. In the waiting room he told the Pylants, 'I'm sorry I couldn't help your son. We've all prayed but sometimes God works in ways we don't understand.' They never wavered, saying, 'God's going to heal our son. We're standing on His promise.' Carson admired their faith, but the evidence was irrefutable. For three days little Christopher was comatose, but his eyes were focusing and his physical movements improved. Following another scan Carson re-operated, and after removing the cancerous mass in layers and cleaning out the crevices, there it was-a healthy brain stem, distorted, but intact! Taking their son home a month later, his parents and the doctor thanked God together for a miracle. '...He who comes to God must believe that...He is a rewarder of those who seek Him.' The neurosurgeon said, 'As they walked out of the hospital that day...glory shone on their faces, and I heard my mother telling me again, If you ask God for something believing He'll do it...He'll do it.'</p>

<alias><![CDATA[praise-in-the-early-stages]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...They praised [God]...because the foundation...was laid.' Ezra 3:11 NKJV<br /><br /><p>We read, 'When the builders completed the foundation of the Lord's Temple... all the people gave a great shout, praising the Lord...' (Ezra 3:10-11 NLT) Why praise God in the early stages of something? First, because praise is an act of faith. It says, 'Lord, what You start, You finish. Thank You for giving me Your plan because Your plan always prevails. Some folk think I won't succeed, but with You on my side I'll succeed anyway. I'm not doing this for myself; I'm doing it for You and with You.' Secondly, because praise strengthens you. Nehemiah told his workers, '...The joy of the Lord is your strength!' (Nehemiah 8:10 NLT) If you lose your joy you lose your strength. If you lose your strength you lose your power to overcome the enemy. If you lose your power to overcome the enemy, you're defeated. But if you praise God even when all you have in front of you is a small beginning, His joy will energise you and you'll find it easier to complete the task. If you only praise God when things are easy or going right, you won't praise much, you won't have joy and you won't have strength. Thirdly, because praise changes your environment. Imagine wheelbarrows, cement mixers, a partially built wall, and in the midst of it people shouting the praises of God. That's what happens when you put on a praise CD or tune into a Christian radio station; your problems don't necessarily change, but your outlook does. Simply stated, when you praise God in the early stages, you work better and the job gets done!</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Be kind and compassionate...forgiving each other...' Ephesians 4:32 NIV<br /><br /><p>A counsellor writes, 'We have all been wounded. Who wounds us? Those we love and those who love us. When we feel rejected, abandoned, abused, manipulated or violated it's usually by people close to us: our parents, our friends, our marriage partners, our children, our teachers, our pastors. This is what makes forgiveness so difficult. It's our hearts that are wounded! We cry out, You, who I expected to be there for me, have failed me. How can I ever forgive you for that? Though forgiveness may seem impossible, the God who lives within us will give us the grace to go beyond our wounded selves and say, In the name of Christ, I forgive you. But remember, there are two sides to forgiveness: giving and receiving. Although at first sight, giving seems harder, often we are not able to offer forgiveness because we haven't fully received it ourselves. Only as people who have tasted the joy of forgiveness can we find the inner motivation to give it. Why is receiving forgiveness so difficult? Because it's hard to acknowledge that without your forgiveness I'm still affected by what happened between us. I need you to help set me free and make me whole again. That requires not only a confession that we've been hurt, but also the humility to admit our dependence on the very one who hurt us. Yet, only when we're able to receive forgiveness, can we truly extend it to others.' That's why the Bible says, 'Get rid of all bitterness... Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Good people live right...' Proverbs 20:7 CEV<br /><br /><p>Eventually your life will be summarised in a single sentence. What will your 'life sentence' be? If you live intentionally, people at your funeral won't be left to wonder. Will you get it all exactly right? No. But, 'Good people live right, and God blesses the children who follow their example.' Your life is your greatest legacy, and you've only got one, so make it count. Leave a legacy of excellence. In his book <i>Leadership Gold</i>, John Maxwell has a chapter entitled, 'Don't Send Your Ducks To Eagle School'. In it he writes, 'Ducks are not supposed to be eagles-nor do they want to be... Who they are is who they should be. Ducks have their own strengths...' That's where they excel. Leave a legacy of encouragement. It's said, 'Some cause happiness wherever they go; others cause happiness whenever they leave.' Are you the kind of person someone will call 10 or 20 years from now and say, 'Thanks, I couldn't have made it without you'? Leave a legacy of purpose. We're most energised when we're investing our strengths and talents into a God-given purpose. So make your life about something bigger than yourself. You won't live forever, but you can live on through the impact you make now. Leave a legacy of love. Jon Gordon says, 'My mum...passed away a few years ago... I don't recall her faults and mistakes or the disagreements we had. After all, who's perfect? What I remember...was her love. She gave me a legacy of love that'll embrace generations to come.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Thus shall the man be blessed...' Psalm 128:4 NKJV<br /><br /><p>If you're nice to outsiders but not to your own family, you have a problem that needs addressing. So read this: 'The children were loud, cranky, impossible. I was tired and fed up... I decided...to run away from it all and have a day just for me...a day in which I did what I wanted... I was going to live it up and be as greedy as I pleased. I wasn't going to tend to anybody but myself. I zoomed out of the house with $50. There, I did it! I said to myself as I drove to the highway... Well, I drove to a mall and had a wild time in a bookstore and bought the collected poems of Walt Whitman. After that I drove...to McDonald's and ordered two hamburgers, my own large fries and my own large soda. I ate everything without being interrupted, giving my pickle to anyone, or wiping anyone's mouth, nose, lap. Then I bought the <i>biggest</i> chocolate ice cream I could find. I was free! ...So I drove to a movie theatre and watched a movie without buying popcorn, without someone sitting on my lap, without escorting someone to the bathroom. I was a free man. I was living it up-and I was miserable. By the time I returned home everyone was asleep. As I slipped into bed my wife whispered, We missed you.' I answered, Me too. I never ran away from home again!' The Psalmist wrote, 'Your wife shall be...in the very heart of your house, your children...all around your table. Behold, thus shall the man be blessed...' (Psalm 128:3-4 NKJV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Let God transform...the way you think...' Romans 12:2 NLT<br /><br />
<p>Behind everything you do, there's a thought! So if you're serious about changing your life, you must change how you think. That's not easy, and it doesn't happen instantly. Picture yourself in a boat with the automatic pilot set to go in a certain direction, then you suddenly decide to go somewhere else. First option: willpower. Grab the wheel and force it to go where you want; by sheer willpower, overcome the autopilot. But you'll feel constant resistance. Your arms will get tired, and when you let go of the wheel, guess what? The boat will go the way it's programmed to go. Get the idea? That's what happens when you try to change your life through willpower alone: 'I'll force myself to quit drinking, cheating, or overeating', and so on. Your willpower can only produce short-term change, but it creates constant stress because you haven't dealt with the root cause and reprogrammed your mind. The change doesn't feel natural so eventually you give up, revert to your old patterns and say, 'I guess this is just the way I am. I'll never change.' Second option: God's power. There is a better way! The Bible says, '...Let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think.' Change always begins in your mind! The way you think determines the way you feel, and the way you feel determines the way you act. You say, 'How can I change the way I think?' By programming your mind each day with God's Word. 'How can a...man cleanse his way? By taking heed according to Your word.' (Psalm 119:9 NKJV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...lend, hoping for nothing in return...' Luke 6:35 NKJV<br /><br /><p>If you're serious about becoming like Jesus, pay careful attention to His words: '...just as you want men to do to you, you also do to them likewise... love your enemies, do good, and lend, hoping for nothing in return; and your reward will be great...' (Luke 6:31-35 NKJV) Love, expecting nothing in return. Give, though they'll never say thanks. Forgive, even though they won't forgive you. Come early, stay late, invest everything you've got even though nobody notices. Paul calls this '...the high calling...' (Philippians 3:14 KJV) And there's a reason: none of us would set such a standard for ourselves! If you think some people are just naturally more loving than others, think again. Love is a choice: one that costs! You can't love others while you're staring into a mirror or give to others while you're clinging to what you've got. Love will cost you your time, your money and your preoccupation with self. If you think you'll just go to church some Sunday morning, read a book or attend a 7-step seminar and turn into the kind of person we're talking about-good luck! There are no pre-packaged saints; no 'add-and-stir' formula that makes God's love gush forth. To be loving you've got to take up your cross, deny yourself and make others your priority. Remember the woman caught in adultery? Jesus stooped down to reach her, stood by her under attack, then sent her home redeemed and refocused. Do you want to be like Him? Go and find people who are hurting, hopeless, and even wrong. When you do, minister to them until they're redeemed, restored and right. That's living unselfishly!</p>

<alias><![CDATA[rules-for-living]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['His...power has given us everything we need for life...' 2 Peter 1:3 NIV<br /><br /><p>Here are three rules for living. First, learn to control the climate around you. Negativity is contagious; look out for its 'carriers'. Love them, lift them, but don't let them infect you. Filter what people say to you through God's Word. '...God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power (ability and a can-do attitude) and of love (which always looks for the best) and of a sound mind (which is stable and consistent).' (2 Timothy1:7 NKJV) Secondly, learn to laugh at yourself. A woman who'd been given a lovely plant took it home, watered it, fertilised it and set it in the sun. A year later she discovered it was silk-and she still laughs about it. When you're secure in God's love and approval you can laugh at yourself; it's a mark of spiritual maturity. Thirdly, learn to factor God in. Ever hear of the 90/10 rule? When 90 per cent of the circumstances are uncontrollable, focus on the 10 per cent you can do something about. Paul did that. '...We were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were fears. Nevertheless God...' (2 Corinthians 7:5-6 KJV) Note the words 'Nevertheless God'. When you're facing a mountain always remember: God can move it, He can level it, He can tunnel through it, or He can help you climb it. All you have to do is factor Him in by seeking His face and consulting His Word. 'Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom...' (Colossians 3:16 KJV) Keep a rich deposit of Scripture within you and draw on it daily.</p>

<title><![CDATA[You Must be Faithful]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[you-must-be-faithful]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...He was faithful to God, who appointed him...' Hebrews 3:2 NLT<br /><br /><p>Faithfulness is more than just a nice concept; you must be faithful to something or someone. Actually, it's in making and keeping commitments to others that we demonstrate our faithfulness to God. '...And whatever you do in word or deed,do all in the name of the Lord...' (Colossians 3:17 NKJV) That means: to be seen by Him, to bring glory to Him, and to be rewarded by Him. If you don't love those around you, you don't really love God. Jesus put it this way: '...Inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me.' (Matthew 25:40 NKJV) The Greek word for <i>faithful</i> means 'to be trustworthy and reliable'. When you give your word, can you be trusted to keep it? Many of us just aren't reliable. We can't be counted on to do what we say. It doesn't matter how gifted you are, if you're not trustworthy, God cannot use you. And God will test you! How? By assigning you to do something for a period of time that you don't want to do, something that's not fun or exciting, something that may require you to submit to someone else's authority, something you chafe under. Then He will say to you, 'Just be faithful.' And faithfulness is not merely showing up day after day-it's showing up with a good attitude. God rewards that kind of faithfulness. Jesus said, '...If you have not been trustworthy with someone else's property, who will give you property of your own?' (Luke 16:12 NIV) Simply stated, if you want to be successful, you must be faithful.</p>

<alias><![CDATA[god-hears-your-prayers]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Lord, the one you love is sick.' John 11:3 NIV<br /><br /><p>John records, '...Mary and Martha sent someone to tell Jesus, Lord, the one you love is sick.' (NCV) Someone went to Jesus on behalf of Lazarus and because they went, Jesus responded. The healing didn't take place for several days, but it was set in motion the moment the Lord was called on. Have you ever wondered where your prayers go? '...There was silence in Heaven... And...another angel came and stood at the altar, holding a golden pan...with the prayers of all God's...people. The angel put this offering...before the throne. The smoke...went up...to God with the prayers of God's people.' (Revelation 8:1-4 NCV) Why was there silence in Heaven? Because someone was praying! Heaven pauses to hear the prayers of someone like you. The prayers of all God's...people...went up...to God. Isn't that awesome! Your words don't stop until they reach the heart of God, so keep praying. Notice, the friend who went to Jesus on behalf of Lazarus said, 'Lord, the one you love is sick.' He didn't base his appeal on the imperfect love of the one in need, but on the perfect love of Jesus. He didn't say, 'The one who loves you is sick.' He said, 'The one you love is sick.' That's different. The power of prayer doesn't depend on the virtue of the one who prays, but on the unchanging love of the one who hears. Aren't you glad? You may be deeply flawed, you may not understand the mystery of prayer, but this much is clear: action begins in Heaven when someone on earth prays.</p>

<alias><![CDATA[your-weakness]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...He knows how weak we are...' Psalm 103:14 NLT<br /><br /><p>Any weakness you refuse to deal with will draw you towards the wrong things and set you up for defeat. To live victoriously you must recognise that, first, your weakness can emerge at any time. What you allow to take root will grow within you. What you fail to master now will master you later. The Psalmist prayed, 'Do not cast me away when I am old; do not forsake me when my strength is gone.' (Psalm 71:9 NIV) Secondly, God's Spirit will repeatedly warn you. Jesus told Peter: '...Satan has asked for you... But I have prayed for you, that your faith should not fail: and when you have returned to Me, strengthen your brethren.' (Luke 22:31-32 NKJV) Imagine the Lord praying for you. He does! '...if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.' (1 John 2:1 NAS) He intercedes for you, clothes you in His righteousness, and draws you back to Himself. Thirdly, God will continue to use you even while your weakness is growing within you. He provides opportunity after opportunity to reach for His help. Jesus warned Jerusalem, '...How often I have longed to gather your children together...but you were not willing...your house is left to you desolate.' (Matthew 23:37-38 NIV) When you neglect God's grace, what's left? Your consequences! You ask, 'What can I do?' Turn to God. He's neither shocked by your weakness nor unwilling to help you. Acknowledge your weakness. Become an enemy to it. Let God's Spirit empower you. Not only can He deliver you, He can turn your greatest weakness into your greatest weapon.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I have finished my course...' 2 Timothy 4:7 KJV<br /><br /><p>The course God sets before us is seldom easy. Running it takes commitment. James MacDonald says, 'I've lived long enough to know men and women whose lives were sold out to God a few years ago, but who've since walked off the track...gone AWOL...lost their longing for God. Fear of following in their footsteps haunts me...and it should you, too... The faithfulness of my walk with God depends on my willingness to stay in a relationship with Him. I never want to lose the grip His greatness has on my life and the privilege it is to...serve Him till the day I'm welcomed into His presence. That passion compels me. It keeps me honest and humble... the last thing I want to do is crawl across the finish line a defeated, derailed Christian, or worse-give up the race before my life's over. I want to break that tape with arms high, my face to the sun.' Paul said, '...I have finished my course... Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown...' (2 Timothy 4:7-8 KJV) Notice, courage plus endurance plus faithfulness equals reward. Photographer Jacob Riis said, 'When nothing seems to help, I go look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps 100 times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the 101st blow it will split in two, and I know it wasn't the last blow that did it, but all the blows that have gone before.' God's Word is '...a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces...' (Jeremiah 23:29 NKJV) So, '[hold] fast the word of life, so that in the day of Christ [you'll] have reason to glory because [you] did not run in vain...' (Philippians 2:16 NAS)</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...[The] high priest is [only] a man...' Hebrews 5:1 NLT<br /><br /><p>When it comes to appreciating your pastor, notice four Biblical principles. First, '[The] high priest is a man chosen to represent other people in their dealings with God.' Let's be clear: your pastor was chosen from among human beings, not angels. Secondly, because he is human, 'he is able to deal gently with...people because he himself is subject to the same weaknesses.' (Hebrews 5:2 NLT) The reason your pastor can empathise with you is because he fights many of the same battles you do. He too is tested and carries scars of failure. Thirdly, 'This is why he has to offer sacrifices for his own sins, as well as for the sins of the people.' (Hebrews 5:3 NLT) This may come as a shock, but pastors fail too and they need God's grace. Don't think because your pastor is a great preacher that he doesn't struggle with his family, his finances, his fears and his flesh. Actually, he may struggle more, for Satan would rather knock out one general than a hundred foot soldiers. When you fail you can go to your pastor, but who can he go to? Fourthly, 'No man takes this honour to himself, but he who is called by God...' (Hebrews 5:4 NKJV) Your pastor didn't call himself, God called him. So before you criticise him, ask yourself, 'Have I prayed for him?' Before you pronounce judgment ask yourself, 'Is God dealing with him in ways I don't know?' Someday you and your children may need your pastor's prayers and counsel. So don't tear down today what you need to be strong for you tomorrow. </p>

<title><![CDATA[Have You Been 'Burned'?]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[have-you-been-burned]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Watch out that no [bitter] root...grows up [among] you...' Hebrews 12:15 NLT<br /><br /><p>Have you been 'burned' by people? You're not alone, we all have. But instead of being consumed by it, God tells you to forgive it and let it go. When you deny your feelings and stew under the surface, you give the devil the advantage over you (2 Corinthians 2:11). But by dealing scripturally with the situation your painful experiences can make you better, not bitter. If you're struggling with bitterness today do these three things. First, forgive. Forgiveness isn't based on an emotion. Don't wait until you 'feel' like it, decide today to let the offence go. When you do, God's Spirit will calm your emotions and help you overcome the urge to retaliate. Jesus said, 'Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.' (Matthew 5:7 NKJV) Since you yourself will always need to make withdrawals, God calls you to keep making 'mercy deposits'. Secondly, pray about it. The moment you sense resentment, turn to God and He will give you the strength to act in love rather than react in anger. When you commit to living this way He promises to give you '...power to keep [yourself] calm in the days of adversity...' (Psalm 94:13 AMP) Thirdly, think scripturally. Look up every verse you can find on showing forgiveness and meditate on them. Remember, each time you choose to do the right thing, a little more of the old you dies and the new you develops. That's how God prepares you for greater blessing. But you must be in position to receive it. So decide now that although you've been 'burned', you won't become bitter.</p>

<alias><![CDATA[are-you-feeling-like-a-victim]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Turn...me, and I shall be turned...' Jeremiah 31:18 KJV<br /><br /><p>If you are tired of feeling like a victim, read this: 'I don't want to feel this way anymore. I thought if my pain touched their lives I'd feel better. I didn't. I thought by holding it over their heads I'd feel better. I didn't. I thought by telling everyone what they'd done to me I'd feel better. I didn't; it only cost me friends and kept the pain alive. I thought if they acknowledged how wrong they've been I'd feel better. It didn't. I thought if I could understand why I pick such relationships I'd feel better. So I read books and talked with counsellors. But that didn't work, because then I uncovered other issues I didn't have the emotional energy to deal with. I thought time would make me feel better. It helped, but it didn't heal, because there were still too many things that triggered old memories. I thought by moving to a new house in a new city and getting a new job I'd feel better. I didn't; I only changed addresses, not what was going on inside me. Finally, I did two things that worked; not overnight, but gradually, patiently, consistently as I kept doing them, they worked. First, I decided to forgive-and keep forgiving until the past no longer controlled me. Secondly, I cried out to God, Turn...me, and I shall be turned. He answered my prayer. My perceptions began to clear and my heart began to heal. Why? Because at last, getting well meant more, so much more to me than remaining a victim.'</p>

<title><![CDATA[Reduce the Stress of Serving]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[reduce-the-stress-of-serving]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Created in Christ Jesus to do good works...' Ephesians 2:10 NIV<br /><br /><p>We were saved to serve, not sit on the sidelines. But even in our appointed slot, overload is possible. We love serving the Lord, yet sometimes our attitudes stress us. The toxic mix of inadequacy and perfectionism in serving leads to burnout. It pushes us to behave obsessively and compulsively, decreasing our joy and increasing our tension. We feel trapped. We don't know whether to quit and feel bad, or keep going and feel overwhelmed. So we either become overly responsible by carrying our own workload plus everybody else's, or drop out, leaving everything to others. What's the solution? First, we must stop serving to please others. It's the wrong motive and never works. And when it doesn't, we work harder for approval and end up disappointed. Paul writes, '...I'm not trying to win the approval of people, but of God. If pleasing people were my goal, I would not be Christ's servant.' (Galatians 1:10 NLT) Our 'well done' must come from God, not people. Secondly, we must stop serving in our own strength. Jesus said, '...The Son can do nothing by himself. He does only what he sees the Father doing. Whatever the Father does, the Son also does.' (John 5:19 NLT) Like hand in glove, they move together. That's cooperation and interdependency. '...No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in Me.' (John 15:4 NIV) It's how Paul served. '...I labour, struggling with all His energy, which so powerfully works in me.' (Colossians 1:29 NIV). He worked hard, but the energy was God's, not his. So we must remember our source of effectiveness, and we'll reduce the stress of serving.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...The words that I speak to you are...life.' John 6:63 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Don't just read this devotional, interact with it. To get the most out of each day, find an insight and reflect on it; a nugget of truth you ponder throughout the day. Paul told Timothy, 'Reflect on what I am saying, for the Lord will give you insight into all this.' (2 Timothy 2:7 NIV) The more you reflect, the more God will reveal. Then, find a verse and memorise it. This verse should encapsulate a truth you've just read. If you want to improve the quality of your life, memorising Scripture is one of the most important habits you can begin. Write the verse down and read it every chance you get. Like a seed planted, it will produce life in you. Jesus said, '...The words that I speak to you are spirit, and they are life.' Then try to find a question and personalise it. This question should help you to think about what you've read and how it applies to you personally. The question is not just 'What is God saying?' but 'What is He saying to me?' By writing down your thoughts you can find the answer to that question. Finally, find a principle and act on it. Information only turns to transformation when you do something about what you've read. James writes, 'But the man who looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues to do this, not forgetting what he has heard, but doing it-he will be blessed in what he does.' (James 1:25 NIV) Your life is worth taking time to think about! So when you read this devotional, do these four things.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Having loved His own...He loved them to the end.' John 13:1 NKJV<br /><br /><p>On a busy morning, a nurse in the crowded emergency room seated an elderly gentleman who had come to have stitches removed from his hand. He said, 'I'm in a hurry, nurse. I have an appointment in an hour.' As the line of patients ahead of him moved slowly he kept looking anxiously at his watch. Knowing he'd never make his appointment, the nurse led him to an examination room, checked his vital signs and evaluated the condition of his wound. Seeing it was well-healed, she consulted with one of the doctors and got clearance to remove his sutures and re-dress his wound. She asked, 'Are you hurrying to another doctor's appointment?' He said, 'No, I'm on my way to have breakfast with my wife at the nursing home.' She asked about his wife's health and learned she was a victim of Alzheimer's disease. 'Will she be upset if you're late?' The old man told her she hadn't recognised him in five years. Surprised, the nurse asked, 'And you still go to see her every morning, although she doesn't know who you are?' The old man smiled, patted her hand and replied, 'Oh, yes. She doesn't know who I am, but I still know who she is!' Loving 'for better or for worse' means being committed to each other in every season and circumstance of life. It's how Christ loves us: '...Having loved His own...He loved them to the end.' And it's why He said, 'A new command I give you... As I have loved you, so you must love one another.' (John 13:34 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall.' 1 Corinthians 10:12 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The truth is that standing isn't inevitable, but it is possible! The moment you commit your life to Jesus, you're at war with Satan. And standing up to him requires staying armed. 'Put on the full armour of God, so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil...that you will...resist in the evil day...and...stand firm.' (Ephesians 6:11-13 NAS) War is a casualty-laden business; you must take it as seriously as the enemy does, for the Bible says he's out '...seeking someone to devour.' (1 Peter 5:8 NAS) Be alert, but not alarmed. 'A thousand may fall at your side...but it shall not [happen to] you.' (Psalm 91:7 NAS) In conflict, some stand and some fall. The difference is that those who stand 'have made the Lord...[their] dwelling place' (Psalm 91:9 NAS), whereas those who fall 'make flesh [their] strength.' (Jeremiah 17:5 NAS) The truth is also that falling isn't always preventable, but it's surmountable! It's not only the weak and immature who fall. Satan's strategy includes taking out the righteous, the unrighteous, the most vulnerable and the least vulnerable: high-rankers included. '...A righteous man falls seven times, and rises again...' (Proverbs 24:16 NAS) Now if the righteous fall so frequently, what's to be anticipated from everyone else? In war no one is guaranteed immunity from attack. But, '...A good man...though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the Lord upholds him with His hand.' (Psalm 37:23-24 NKJV) Don't focus on the unable, or the disabled, but on Christ the Enabler!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall.' 1 Corinthians 10:12 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Satan is out to tempt, trap and topple you. One of his favourite lies is that you can't fall. He appeals to your ego: 'You've got your spiritual act together; you're too strong to stumble. Weaker people wouldn't be able to handle it, but you can.' This lie is intended to make you over-confident, to lead you to '...Trust in man...depend on flesh for (your) strength' and '...turn away from the Lord.' (Jeremiah 17:5 NIV) It's designed to get you to lower your guard and make you vulnerable to his schemes. Don't play into his hands! Be wise: 'Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.' (Proverbs 16:18 NKJV) Live on your knees. Fortify yourself with God's Word. Another of Satan's favourite lies is that you can't stand. This appeals to your underlying sense of unworthiness, fear and inadequacy. He whispers, 'Look at your track record. Compared to all those other good folks in church, you're not worthy to be called a Christian. Just give up.' Satan wants to divert you from '...Him who is able to keep you from stumbling, and to make you stand in the presence of His glory blameless with great joy.' (Jude 1:24 NAS) He wants to get you focused on your negatives, your wayward friends, spiritual giants who fell, and tell you that because they couldn't make it, you've no chance. He'll replay your list of shortcomings to discourage you. Don't go for it. '...He is a liar and the father of lies.' (John 8:44 NAS) Believing him makes you his victim. Refuse to let either pride or inadequacy defeat you.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Did not our heart burn within us...' Luke 24:32 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Look at the two disciples on the road to Emmaus, and you'll discover how God speaks to us and gives us direction. They thought they'd seen the death of Jesus and His movement. Fearful and disillusioned, they packed their bags and headed for home, when suddenly Jesus appeared to them. How does the Lord reveal His will to us? The simplicity of the process may surprise you. First, through others. The travellers' first mistake was to disregard the words of their fellow disciples. '...Today some women among us amazed us. Early this morning they went to the tomb, but they did not find his body there. They came and told us... Jesus was alive!' (Luke 24:22-23 NCV) God still works that way. He still speaks to us through others. That's why you need to attend church regularly and build relationships that strengthen you. Secondly, through Scripture. '...Starting with what Moses and all the prophets had said about Him, Jesus began to explain everything that had been written about Himself in the Scriptures.' (Luke 24: 27 NCV) Their second mistake was disregarding the Word of God and listening to their fears. Are you doing that? God still speaks through His Word; the answers you need are in your Bible. Thirdly, through our heart's desire. 'They said to each other, It felt like a fire burning in us when Jesus talked to us....' God reveals His will to us by giving us a burning desire. What fuels and focuses you? Singles? The inner city? Untouched nations? Forgotten orphans? Whatever it is-heed the fire within you!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Out of weakness were made strong...' Hebrews 11:34 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The Bible speaks of '...Samson and Jephthah, also of David and Samuel...who through faith subdued kingdoms, worked righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong...' (Hebrews 11:32-34 NKJV) Who were these people? Jephthah was a social outcast born to an unwed mother. Samuel was a great prophet but not a great parent. David wrote the Psalms but had an affair. '...Out of weakness were made strong...' Notice, they didn't start out strong, they became strong. And if they can make it, you can too! For reasons God never explains, He chooses to work through people like us. He places us in difficult situations then unlocks our faith, compassion and creativity. When we don't know which way to go, He connects us with those who can open the right door at the right moment. Does that mean we won't experience fear? No, progress has always been made by people who faced their fears and rose above them. They knew that opportunity and security were opposites. The truth is, if the challenge you're facing doesn't place a demand on your faith, it neither pleases God nor involves Him. Phillips Brooks said, 'Do not pray for easy lives; pray to be stronger people. Do not pray for tasks equal to your powers; pray for powers equal to your tasks. Then the doing of your work shall be no miracle, but you shall be the miracle. Every day you shall wonder at yourself, at the richness of life which has come to you by the grace of God.'</p>

<title><![CDATA[Core Values]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[core-values]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...be...doers of the Word, and not hearers only...' James 1:22 NKJV<br /><br /><p>We talk about our 'core values'. In an ever-changing world they are principles that should govern your life. They explain why you do the things you do, and what you stand for. They're not just business strategies, cultural norms or responses to market changes; they're non-negotiables that dictate how you live your life. John Blumberg says, 'I've yet to meet anyone who would say they didn't want to operate from a solid set of values. However, it's more challenging than it appears. In leadership workshops all over the world I've seen the stunning realisation people face when they're given a blank sheet and challenged to write down their core values. My hope is you'll be challenged to investigate, indicate, and integrate your core values into the fabric of your life.' The Bible says, 'Be...doers of the Word, and not hearers only.' What you truly believe determines how you act and manifests itself in your daily routine. John Mason says that means 'Making yourself valuable to somebody today...tackling a problem bigger than yourself...getting to know God by reading His Word...helping someone who can't repay you...doing three things that take you outside your comfort zone...giving thanks for your daily bread...leaving others a little better than you found them...not being afraid to ask for help...giving the best time of your day to God...doing today what you want to put off till tomorrow...remembering that the time and place to be happy is here and now...taking small steps to conquer a bad habit...and evaluating your actions not by the harvest they produce, but by the seeds you're sowing.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...God...turned the curse into a blessing...' Deuteronomy 23:5 NCV<br /><br /><p>When Thomas Carlyle completed his manuscript on the French Revolution, he asked his neighbour John Stuart Mill to read it. Later, Mill came to Carlyle's house, shaken and pale. His maid had inadvertently used it to light the fire! Carlyle despaired-two years lost! Writing it initially was daunting enough; rewriting it was unthinkable. Then one day, watching a stonemason build a wall, he observed it was going up one brick at a time. Inspired, he thought, 'I'll write a page today and one tomorrow. One at a time; that's all I'll think about.' It was slow, tedious work, but he persevered and the result outshone his original. Jon Gordon writes, 'If you're concerned about the future...I know how you feel. I lost my job in 2001...the company sank faster than the <i>Titanic</i>... I thought it was the worst event of my life. I was two months away from bankruptcy. I'd a wife, two children, a mortgage, no health insurance, and very little savings. I was a paycheque away from losing it all and...I had to make some important decisions. Eventually they led to the work I now do as a writer, consultant and speaker. I went from Fired to Fired-up. My lay-off led to my life's mission... what I thought was the worst...led to the best... When the wave of change hits we have a choice...allow it to crush us, or learn from it and ride it to a positive future. We can move forward with determination and faith that our best days are ahead.' Rejoice. Refocus. God can turn the curse into a blessing.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Lord...closed her womb.' 1 Samuel 1:5 NKJV<br /><br />
<p>Sometimes the door will open only when you understand why it was shut in the first place. Consider the story of Hannah. She wanted a son but God wanted a prophet. When she prayed, 'If You...give me a son, I will give him back to You all his life...' (1 Samuel 1:11 NCV), God not only gave her Samuel, but also six more children (1 Samuel 2:5). When you pray for a harvest God will ask you to sow a seed. That seed may be something you love and want to cling to; but don't-rather, surrender it to God. Hannah discovered she couldn't be satisfied with less than God's will. Elkanah had two wives, but he loved Hannah the most and granted her 'a double portion' of his possessions (1 Samuel 1:5). But when you're not doing what you know God has truly called you to do, the love of people and material things won't satisfy you. 'Ordained' people are not just those in pulpits! Hannah was ordained to be a mother. You may be ordained to be a secretary, a landscape gardener or a teacher. Find whatever God's called you to do, and do it! Finally, Hannah's desperation led her to her destiny: 'The Lord...closed her womb.' Why? To get Hannah's attention, to draw her closer to Himself. Hard times cause us to re-examine our lives and seek God as never before. Our emphasis changes from 'Lord, here's what I want' to 'Lord, what do You want?' Then He blesses us, because '...He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.' (Hebrews 11:6 NKJV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He walked on the water...to Jesus.' Matthew 14:29 NKJV<br /><br /><p>There are many good reasons for stepping out of the boat and trying something new, or something you may have failed at before. It's the only way to develop faith, it's the alternative to being average, and it's how you discover your calling. But there's an even more important reason. '...He walked on the water...to Jesus.' Jesus isn't in the boat, He's on the water! And you only develop deep-water faith when you're willing to leave security and predictability and step out with Him. Perhaps you have worked for years creating a manageable and orderly life, maintaining the illusion of control. Now God is shaking everything up by asking you to step out in faith, allowing you to face waves that are over your head. He does this for a reason: to increase your dependence on Him. Maybe there was a time in your past when you risked sharing your faith, even though it meant facing rejection; or giving, even though it involved personal sacrifice; or serving, even though you felt totally inadequate. Sometimes you sank, sometimes you walked, but you lived on the edge by faith. Now look at you in your comfortable boat, you don't even get seasick! In fact, now you don't even feel the storm when it comes. Any time you leave the security of the boat two things will happen. First, when you fail, and you will, you won't be alone. Jesus will be no more than an arm's length from you. Secondly, every now and then when you do walk on water, it'll strengthen you and enable you to do greater things.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He walked on the water...to Jesus.' Matthew 14:29 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Peter discovered what we all discover in our walk with God: just because you sink doesn't mean you're sunk. Here are two reasons why. First, failing doesn't make you a failure, quitting does. Failure is just a part of learning. Sir Edmund Hillary made several attempts to scale Mount Everest before succeeding. After one such attempt he stood in front of a photograph of the mountain and shook his fist as he told his audience: 'Mount Everest, you will not beat me again. You have grown all you are going to, but I'm still growing!' He learned something from every unsuccessful attempt until one day he succeeded. Winston Churchill said, 'I've never failed at anything in my life. I was simply given another opportunity to get it right.' That's the winning spirit!</p>
<p>Secondly, the real failures were the ones who stayed in the boat. They failed quietly and privately; their failure went unnoticed and uncriticised. Although Peter crashed and burned publicly, he experienced the euphoria of walking on the water. He alone knew how it felt to be empowered by God to do what he could never have done by himself. Once you've walked on water you are never the same. Peter would take this moment to his grave! He also experienced the joy of being lifted by Jesus in a moment of despair. Peter knew, in a way the others couldn't, that if he sank Jesus would be there to save him. He shared a moment, a connection, a trust the others didn't. How could they, when they never left the boat! Failure doesn't come from sinking-it comes from letting your fears stop you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He walked on the water...to Jesus.' Matthew 14:29 NKJV<br /><br /><p>When Peter was certain it was Jesus who was calling him, he left the security of the boat and entrusted himself to the power of God. So far, so good. 'But when he saw the strong wind and the waves, he was terrified and began to sink. Save me, Lord! he shouted.' (Matthew 14:30 NLT) So you must focus on the Lord, not the storm. We all know what it's like to 'see the waves'. You begin a new venture-a job, a relationship, an area of spiritual growth-full of hope. Then you encounter storms and setbacks. Jesus said, 'Here on earth you will have many trials...' (John 16:33 NLT) Expect it; it's part of the journey of faith! You must feel the fear and do it regardless. Growth requires taking on new challenges. Each time you do you'll experience fear, because growth and fear go together. But each time you risk leaving the boat it means you're more likely to do it again. And each time you step out on the water without drowning, you realise that fear no longer has the power over you. On the other hand, each time you resist God's voice and choose to stay in the boat His voice becomes a little quieter until eventually you don't hear it at all. Wouldn't it be worth any risk to avoid that? Furthermore, staying in the boat doesn't guarantee your safety; it only guarantees you'll eventually die from something else. The answer to fear is to get out of the boat a little more each day, until fear loses its hold on you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He walked on the water...to Jesus.' Matthew 14:29 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The disciples were out fishing one night when a huge storm struck. About 3am they were terrified by a figure approaching them on the water. '...Immediately Jesus spoke... Be of good cheer! It is I; do not be afraid... Peter answered...Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You...So He said, Come. And when Peter had come down out of the boat, he walked on the water...to Jesus.' (Matthew 14:27-29 NKJV) This story teaches us, first, that if the Lord doesn't call us to do it, don't! There's a story about a man standing at the gates of heaven. Peter says, 'Name one great deed you've done.' The man replies, 'Well, a gang of bikers was threatening a woman so I smacked them, kicked over their bikes and ripped out their nose rings.' Impressed, Peter asks, 'When did this happen?' The man answers, 'About 30 seconds ago!' To walk on water you must learn to discern between God's voice and your own impulses. Secondly, it teaches us that to experience miracles, we must get out of our comfort zone. Exchange places with Peter. The storm is raging and he's afraid. The boat's secure and comfortable. Wouldn't you want to stay there? But you can't. God designed you to do more than simply avoid failure; He's calling you to step out in faith and accomplish things. You say, 'What's my boat?' It's anything you put your faith in when life gets stormy, like a job or a relationship. Your boat is anything that stops you from getting out of your comfort zone. Leaving it is the scariest but most rewarding step you'll ever take!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Serve...with gladness...' Psalm 100:2 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Anything God gives you is first a gift to enjoy, then a seed to sow. Do you have a good education? Leadership ability? More money than you need? God has given you seeds, so sow them. There are basically three kinds of people: those who can't see, or refuse to see the problem; those who see the problem, but because they didn't personally create it are content to leave it to others; those who see the problem and though they didn't create it, are willing to assume responsibility for solving it. Hudson Taylor, founder of the China Inland Mission, said, 'I used to ask God to help me. Then I asked if I might help Him. Finally I ended up asking Him to do His work through me.' When you come to believe, really believe that service is God working through you, you'll understand that serving others is the highest calling of all. Dr William DeVries thought that way. He's the surgeon who pioneered the artificial heart, and he's the kind of doctor who shows up at the hospital on Sunday just to cheer up discouraged patients. He even changes dressings, and if a patient wants him to stick around and talk he always does. His friends say he's 'an old shoe' who fits in wherever he goes. He wears cowboy boots with his surgical scrubs and repairs hearts to the music of Vivaldi. 'He's always got a smile lurking,' says his friend Dr Robert Goodin, 'and he's always looking for a way to let it out.' The truth is, 'arriving' is not a place where others serve you but where you serve them 'with gladness'.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['This is the day the Lord has made...' Psalm 118:24 NKJV<br /><br /><p>There's a built-in danger in goal-setting. What is it? It's believing we'll only be happy when we reach those goals. We tell ourselves, 'When I graduate, get married, have children, own my own home', and so on, so we keep postponing life.</p>
<p>A university professor tells of being invited to speak at a military base and meeting a soldier named Ralph at the airport. After they introduced themselves they headed towards baggage claim. As they walked down the concourse Ralph kept disappearing, once to help an older woman whose suitcase had fallen open, once to lift up two toddlers so they could see Santa Claus, and again to give directions to someone who was lost. Each time he came back with a big smile on his face. 'Where did you learn to live like that?' the professor asked. 'Oh,' Ralph said, 'during the war, I guess.' Then he told the professor about his last tour of duty, how it was his job to detect mines, and how he watched his friends blown up before his eyes, one after another. 'I learned to live between steps,' he said. 'I never knew whether the next step would be my last, so I learned to get everything I could out of the moment between when I picked up my foot and put it down again. Every step I took was a whole new world, and I guess I've been living that way ever since.' Ralph had it right! To get the most out of living we must live by the Scripture: 'This is the day the Lord has made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.'</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...He...presented Himself alive...by many infallible proofs...' Acts 1:3 NKJV<br /><br /><p>In Jesus' day when a carpenter completed a job, it was customary for him to wash his hands, dry them on a linen cloth, fold it, and leave it on top of his work. That cloth was his trademark; whoever inspected it knew the work was finished. On Easter Sunday Peter '...saw...the burial cloth that had been around Jesus' head...folded up by itself...and believed.' (John 20:6-8 NIV) Scientists say that infallible proof comes from getting the same result from repeated experiments and multiple confirmations. Here are five infallible proofs that Jesus rose from the dead. First, Mary Magdalene encountered Him. Secondly, the women at the grave saw Him. Thirdly, the disciples talked with Him. Fourthly, the apostles met Him. Finally, 500 people witnessed Him at one time. '...He...presented Himself alive...by many infallible proofs, being seen by them...' Christ's resurrection is the foundation of our salvation and the hope upon which our eternity rests (Romans 10:9-10). Paul writes, '...Christ died for our sins...was buried...rose again the third day and...was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve. After that He was seen by over five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain to the present... After that He was seen by James, then by all the apostles. Then last of all He was seen by me...' (1 Corinthians 15:3-8 NKJV) At an Easter service in Bangladesh the congregation wept at the crucifixion scene in the <i>Jesus</i> film. Suddenly a little boy at the back jumped up and shouted, 'Don't worry, He gets up again. I saw it before!' Rejoice, it's Easter. He got up again-and we will too!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be hospitable to one another without grumbling.' 1 Peter 4:9 NKJV <br /><br /><p>There's a story about a family who had the pastor over for dinner, and Mum asked their five-year-old to say grace. Puzzled, the child asked, 'What should I say?' Her mum replied, 'Just say what you've heard me say.' So, bowing her head, the little girl prayed, 'Dear God, why on earth did I invite the pastor over to dinner?' Let's be honest, hospitality is hard work. It involves sacrifice. And you are to 'do it ungrudgingly (cordially and graciously, without complaining...as representing Him).' (1 Peter 4:9 AMP) Who are you representing? God! That puts a new slant on it, doesn't it? Paul writes, 'Practise hospitality.' (Romans 12:13 NIV) Peter writes, 'Be hospitable...with brotherly affection for...unknown guests...foreigners, the poor, and all others.' (1 Peter 4:9 AMP) So, have you had any unknown guests, foreigners or poor folks over to dinner lately? A man conducting a church survey wrote to a nationally syndicated advice columnist, 'Of almost 200 churches I visited, I was spoken to in only one by someone other than an &quot;official greeter&quot;-and that was to tell me I was sitting in their seat!' It's easy to extend hospitality to people you know, but Jesus said, 'Why should God reward you if you love only the people who love you?' (Matthew 5:46 GNT) So, how about those you don't know? Those who don't fit in your social circle? Yes, you can find excuses-you're too busy, you don't want to get involved, and you're uncomfortable around strangers. But God says you represent Him, and that means sacrificing your personal agenda, giving of your time and money, going out on a limb for people you don't know or even like, and seeing others through God's eyes. That's practising hospitality!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[ 'Stephanas, Fortunatas, and Achaicus...have been a wonderful encouragement to me.' 1 Corinthians 16:17-18 TLB<br /><br /><p>Most of us have no idea how much other people's emotions, self-esteem and hopes are influenced by what we say. Paul said, 'Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus...have been a wonderful encouragement to me.' If you've never heard of them, it's because most encouragers hate being the centre of attention. They're happy to work in a supporting role. But without them very little would get done. The opposite of giving encouragement is spreading discouragement, and Paul says, 'Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up...that it may benefit those who listen.' (Ephesians 4:29 NIV) Jesus said, '...[You'll] give account...by your words you will be justified, and...condemned.' (Matthew 12:36-37 NKJV) What you say can never be taken back, and it'll be used as evidence for or against you one day. Dr Thomas Blackaby points out, 'Words...can leave scars for a lifetime, and many people will never forget some of the things you've said to them, both good things, such as words of encouragement, and bad things, such as criticism and rebuke... Make the best possible use of words so they bring blessings on others.' So, are your words encouraging? Can it be said that there's '...nothing crooked or perverse...in them'? (Proverbs 8:8 NKJV) Ask God to 'Set a guard...over [your] mouth...' (Psalm 141:3 NKJV) so whatever you say glorifies Him and lifts others up. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...that you may be...fully developed...' James 1:4 AMP<br /><br /><p>Overcoming obstacles is what develops in us the qualities needed to fulfil God's will for our lives. The truth is, it can't happen any other way. In 2 Corinthians Paul spells out the benefits of going through hard times. Yes, there are actually benefits! Let's take a moment and look at some of them.</p>
<p>First, '...so that we will be able to comfort those who are in any affliction...' (2 Corinthians 1:4 NAS) When people know you're qualified to speak, they listen. Otherwise, they politely tune you out. Built into every problem that forces you to grow are the answers those around you need. When you can say, 'I have been there,' people respect you and pay attention. Experience is one of your greatest assets and God will use it. Secondly, '...that we would not trust in ourselves...' (2 Corinthians 1:9 NAS) Anything that causes us to turn to God and lean harder on Him is an asset, not a liability. It's when we lose a job, a marriage, a loved one, our health or our peace of mind that we turn to God and discover what He can do. Thirdly, '...that thanks may be given...' (2 Corinthians 1:11 NAS) Do you remember what your life was like before you met the Lord? The Psalmist wrote, 'He...brought me up out of a horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock...' (Psalm 40:2 NKJV) Come on, lift up your voice and begin to praise God for what He has done for you! After all, where would you be without Him? It doesn't bear thinking about, does it?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Pleasant words are...healing...' Proverbs 16:24 NIV<br /><br /><p>Al had a hard time in school. He never seemed to be able to keep up. When his teacher called him 'Addled', his mother immediately withdrew him from school to teach him at home. The teacher thought he couldn't learn, but Al's mother had a different opinion- she was a nurturer; she believed in him. She schooled him at home, and each time he failed she gave him hope and encouraged him to keep trying.</p>
<p>Whatever happened to Al? Well, eventually he grew up and became an inventor holding more than 1000 patents, including the phonograph and the first electric light bulb. You probably guessed it-his name was Thomas Alva Edison. Wow! When people have love and hope, there's no telling how far they can go! Solomon writes: 'Pleasant words are...healing.' So, how about your words? Do they build up or tear down? How do people feel when they're around you? Do they feel small and insignificant, or do they leave you believing in themselves and realising what they can become? </p>
<p>With God every weed is a potential rose. His book, the Bible, is the ultimate book of hope. It tells us that Jonah got a second chance to go back to Nineveh and the whole city turned to God (Jonah 3:1-10); that the Prodigal Son came back from a wasted life and was restored to his family (Luke 15:11-24); and that Peter, the man who denied the Lord, became a leader in the New Testament church and died as a martyr for the cause of Christ. Do you want to become great in God's Kingdom? Become an encourager, a nurturer, and a restorer! </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...these things happened...as examples...' 1 Corinthians 10:11 NKJV<br /><br />
<p>A pastor was building a fence while the neighbour's 12-year-old son watched. The pastor smiled and said, 'Are you interested in carpentry?' 'No,' the boy replied. 'I just want to hear what a preacher says when he hits his thumb with a hammer!' You are the only Bible some people will ever read, and they're watching to see how your life lines up with what you profess. Some are hoping for confirmation of the life-changing power of Jesus; others for a chance to say, 'See, Christians are all hypocrites!' We want to set a good example, but sometimes we fall short. And as humbling as it is to mess up, God uses those failures to '...[make] it clear that our...power is from [Him], not...ourselves.' (2 Corinthians 4:7 NLT) God doesn't gloss over the shortcomings of even the most notable saints. They're 'examples...written down as warnings for us...' (1 Corinthians 10:11 NIV) Abraham, the 'friend of God', lied about Sarah being his wife (Genesis 12:10-20). Moses, the mighty leader, got angry and disobeyed God. David, a man after God's heart, committed adultery and then tried to cover his tracks with murder (2 Samuel 11:15). Peter, a leader of the early church, denied Jesus not once but three times (Luke 22:54-62), and John Mark gave up and went home during a missionary trip (Acts 15:38). They're all in there, warts and all, and Paul says, 'If you think you are standing strong, be careful, for you, too, may fall into the same sin.' (1 Corinthians 10:12 NLT) So don't get discouraged when you stumble. Get up, admit your mistake, apologise to the people involved, ask God for forgiveness, forgive yourself, learn from what happened, and move on.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Enjoy life with the woman whom you love all the days of your...life...' Ecclesiastes 9:9 NAS<br /><br /><p>Marital happiness requires an environment of unselfishness. Two people deciding to live out what Jesus taught in His Sermon on the Mount will find happiness together. Each beatitude (what our attitude should be) begins with the word 'blessed', which means 'happy'. True happiness is found in humility, a readiness to repent, gentleness, patience, being unassuming, loving what's right and just, pure-heartedness, and peacemaking. These are the qualities that make a marriage go the distance. And notice, they're the opposite of selfishness! An un-crucified self is the worst possible marriage material. The wedding ring symbolises unending commitment, but the key to lasting marital happiness is to superimpose it over the cross, the symbol of death to self. Self will put an end to love; love will put an end to self. Marriage is the ultimate invitation to growth in unselfishness. Living with another imperfect person pushes us to mature, mellow and master the art of relationship-enhancing self-denial. Paul writes, 'Excel in showing respect for each other.' (Romans 12:10 GWT) The test of a loving relationship lies in putting our partner's needs before our own. Asking, 'Whose good am I seeking in my handling of this situation?' reveals our real heart attitude, prompting us to put our partner first. Deliberately deferring to them applies the cross to self and the flesh, and promotes our marriage. The more self dies, the more our relationship lives! '...a grain of wheat must fall to the ground and die to make many seeds. But if it never dies, it remains only a single seed.' (John 12:24 NCV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Enjoy life with the woman whom you love all the days of your...life...' Ecclesiastes 9:9 NAS<br /><br /><p>Contentment is the key to a happy marriage. When asked what makes us contented in marriage, we inevitably point to things our partner does, or their characteristics, that please us. When asked what makes us discontented, we indicate what they do, or are, that displeases us. We focus on what's right or wrong about them, making ourselves happy or unhappy. But contentment is an inside job! It's how we react to others. Our attitude is the real issue. The problem's not what we see or hear, it's how we see or hear it: '...The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear...with hearing.' (Ecclesiastes 1:8 NAS) The eye and ear-our perceptions-are the culprits. That's why God says, '...be content with such things as you have...' (Hebrews 13:5 NKJV) We must choose to see things differently, in ways that don't make us unhappy. The controls are in our hands, not our partner's! Contentment is a choice. '...I have learned...to be content.' (Philippians 4:11 KJV) We learn contentment by considering how much harder others have it, asking God how He wants us to use our challenges and lacks for our growth and our partner's growth, and-remembering Erma Bombeck's advice-'The grass is always greener over someone else's septic tank.' Benjamin Franklin said, 'Keep your eyes wide open before marriage, and half shut afterwards'. Finally, we can learn contentment by praying for the courage to change what we can (especially our own attitude), the grace to accept what we cannot (most things are acceptable when we stop resenting them), and the wisdom to know the difference.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Enjoy life with the woman whom you love all the days of your...life...' Ecclesiastes 9:9 NAS<br /><br /><p>To be married and happy you must understand that love is a choice, not a sensation. The old Righteous Brothers' song <i>You've Lost That Loving Feeling</i> may make your toes tap but it won't make your marriage work. 'Feeling' is the fruit, 'doing' is the root. Your will is where the solution begins. God wouldn't have commanded, 'Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church...' (Ephesians 5:25 NKJV) or '...teach the young women to love their husbands...' (Titus 2:4 NCV) if love was a feeling and not an act of your will. When the will leads, the feelings follow. So let's correct four misconceptions about love. First, its foundation is <i>not</i> emotion, personality, beauty or sex-in other words, sources of pleasure. These things don't bring lasting happiness. What's needed is commitment, character and a Christ-like disposition. Secondly, think you can't love your partner? Check with God. 'We love because He first loved us.' (1 John 4:19 NIV) If you're loved by God, you've got love to give, because '...love comes from God...' (1 John 4:7 NIV) You don't have to initiate it; just give what has been given to you! Thirdly, think you've 'run out' of love? No, you've just abandoned the source: 'God has poured out His love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, whom He has given us.' (Romans 5:5 NIV) Tank up on the Spirit's supply and you'll have lots of love to give! Finally, investing yourself in your partner causes even a dead love to live again. 'For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.' (Matthew 6:21 KJV) </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Enjoy life with the woman whom you love all the days of your...life...' Ecclesiastes 9:9 NAS<br /><br /><p>Counsellors reckon that less than 25 per cent of marriages today are truly happy. What does it take to be one of them? Thinking about marriage in God's terms, not selfish terms. From God's perspective, happiness in marriage depends on distinguishing fact from fiction. The world of movie magic creates unrealistic expectations. To enjoy life with your spouse every day, you must re-examine your thinking. Every marriage is made up of two flawed people: 'For all have sinned and fall short...' (Romans 3:23 NIV) That includes you and your partner. It's not that we don't know this, it's that we keep forgetting it, or hoping we're the exception to the rule. Expecting perfection is nave and will keep undermining your relationship. Happiness in marriage depends on coming to terms with your mutual defects and dealing with them realistically. Recognise fiction; deal with facts-especially in certain vulnerable areas. For example, finances. Practise tithing, generosity, delayed gratification, and fiscal discipline. Secondly, personal appearance. Always try to look your best, but accept unchangeable features-both yours and your partner's. Ageing is God's idea, so accept it with dignity and become wiser with it. Thirdly, lifestyle. Happiness is about comfort and contentment, not materialism and pride that lead to crushing indebtedness. Then, courtesy. Small kindnesses, considerate acts and words are low-cost, high-yield investments. Finally, physical satisfaction. The greatest satisfaction results from providing satisfaction for your partner. Self-focus, manipulation and demanding your way can never match God's unfailing system: 'Give, and it shall be given unto you...' (Luke 6:38 KJV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I will not believe it until I...put my finger where the nails were...' John 20:25 NCV<br /><br /><p>In <i>The Odyssey</i>,<i> </i>when Odysseus returns home disguised as an old man, his family doesn't know him. Then his childhood nurse sees a scar she remembers from infancy. Until then, even she doesn't recognise him. When Thomas heard Jesus was alive, he said, '...I will not believe it until I...put my finger where the nails were...' Jesus' scars were proof-positive He'd been crucified and resurrected. When Thomas checked them out for himself, he responded, 'My Lord and my God!' (v. 28) It's the first time Scripture records a disciple directly addressing Jesus as <i>God</i>, and it came in response to seeing His scars.</p>
<p>We all have scars. Dr Will Willimon says, 'I've a friend who spent...his life in an orphanage. His mother took him there as a...boy...let him out under a big cedar tree, told him she'd return that afternoon, but didn't. He's now middle-aged. One day I was to meet him for lunch and I was late... I found him in a state of agitation, pacing about, perspiring, visibly upset... Later he said, I can't help it. I get bent out of shape when a friend is late, because my mother kept me waiting...and never returned. He was all grown up...but he still had scars...' You've got your scars, some visible, some invisible, some more visible with age. The Risen Christ also has scars to prove His love for you. If you don't know Him, or like Thomas, if you aren't sure you believe, He'll show you His scars '...that you may believe...and...by believing you may have life in His name.' (John 20:31 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Go...tell his disciples...especially Peter...' Mark 16:7 CEV<br /><br /><p>Max Lucado writes, 'I'd read the passage a hundred times, but never seen it. Maybe I'd passed over it in the excitement of the resurrection...the women's surprise when they find the stone moved...that beautiful phrase by the angel He is not here, He is risen. But go a bit further...and enjoy this jewel...Go...tell his disciples, <i>especially Peter </i>that he will go ahead of you to Galilee... All of heaven had watched Peter fall, and wanted to help him get back up. Be sure and tell Peter he's not left out...one failure doesn't make him a flop... Not many second chances in the world today...ask the kid who didn't make the little league team...the mother of three who got dumped for a pretty little thing... Nowadays it's Around here we don't tolerate incompetence or Not much room at the top or Three strikes and you're out or It's a dog-eat-dog-world!... Jesus has a simple answer...Be sure to tell Peter he gets to bat again. It's not every day you get a second chance. Peter must have known that. The next time he saw Jesus he got so excited that...he jumped into...the Sea of Galilee! It was also enough...to cause this backwoods Galilean to carry the Gospel of the second chance to Rome where they killed him. If you've ever wondered what would make a man willing to be crucified upside down, maybe now you know. It's not every day you find someone who'll give you a second chance-much less someone who'll give you a second chance every day. In Jesus Peter found both.' And you will too!</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...I have called you friends...' John 15:15 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Another step in developing your friendship with God is choosing to be honest with Him! God doesn't expect you to be perfect, but He does expect you to be honest. If perfection was a requirement not one of us would qualify. In the Bible, God's friends were honest about their feelings-sometimes even complaining and arguing with Him-yet He didn't seem to mind. In fact, He encouraged it. God listened patiently to David's accusations of unfairness, betrayal and abandonment. He didn't zap Jeremiah for claiming God had tricked him. Job was allowed to vent his bitterness and God actually defended him for being honest. On the other hand, He rebuked Job's friends for faking it: '...I am angry with you... because you did not speak the truth about Me, the way...Job did. Job will pray for you, and I will answer his prayer...' (Job 42:7-8 GNT) To be God's friend you must share your true feelings with Him, not what you think you ought to feel or say. Until you understand that God uses everything for good in our lives, you'll harbour resentment towards Him over your looks, your nationality, your economic background, your unanswered prayers, your past hurts, and the things you'd change if you were God. Actually, revealing your feelings and releasing your resentments to Him are the first steps to becoming spiritually whole. Isn't it encouraging to know that God's closest friends felt just like we do but, instead of masking their feelings in pious clich, they voiced them openly? Why? Because expressing them leads to healing and a deeper level of intimacy with Him.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...I have called you friends...' John 15:15 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Friendship with God is maintained and strengthened through continual meditation. It's impossible to be God's friend apart from knowing what He says. You can't love God unless you know Him, and that's only possible through the Bible. '...He revealed Himself to Samuel through His Word.' (1 Samuel 3:21 NIV) Now you can't spend all day studying the Bible, but you can think about it throughout the day, recalling verses you've read, mulling over them in your mind. Meditation isn't some mysterious ritual, it's simply focused thinking-a skill anybody can learn. When you think about a problem over and over, that's called worry. When you think about God's Word over and over, that's called meditation. If you know how to worry, you know how to meditate. Just switch your attention from the problem to the solution! The more you meditate on God's Word the less you'll have to worry about. The more time you spend meditating on the Scriptures the more you'll understand their secrets. The Psalmist said, 'The friendship of the Lord is for those who fear Him, and He makes known to them His covenant.' (Psalm 25:14 ESV) After Jesus told His disciples, '...I have called you friends...', He went on to say, '...I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain, that whatever you ask the Father in My name He may give you.' (John 15:16 NKJV) The benefits of friendship with God include abundant living and answered prayer. So if you want to become God's friend, read, digest and meditate in His Word.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['His unfailing love...is as great as the height of the heavens above.' Psalm 103:11 NLT<br /><br /><p>No matter what the other disciples told him about the resurrection, Thomas wanted to see for himself-so for seven days waited. He needed firsthand evidence. And Jesus gave it to him. 'Put your finger here and see My hands. Put your hand into the wound in My side. Don't be faithless any longer. Believe!' (John 20:27 NLT) And Thomas did- 'My Lord and my God!' (John 20:28 NLT). Only God could come back from the dead. And only a God of love would come back for a doubter. </p>
<p>Know what? Our doubts don't separate us from God's love! Listen: 'For His unfailing love toward those who fear Him is as great as the height of the heavens above.' (Ps 103:11 NLT) The big news of the Bible is not that you love God-but that He loves you! He says your name is engraved on the palm of His hand. His thoughts of you outnumber the grains of sand on the beach. He sees the worst in you yet still believes the best. Your sins of yesterday and your failings in the future don't surprise Him; He knows them all. Every day and every deed of your life has passed before His eyes and been calculated in His decision. He knows you better than you know yourself. And He's reached His verdict: 'I love you!' No discovery will disillusion Him, no rebellion dissuade Him. He loves you with an unfailing love, and that knowledge can lift you, restore you and put you back on your feet. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing.' James 1:4 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Just because it hasn't happened yet doesn't mean it won't, or that God has changed His mind. While you are waiting-God is working. The timing may not be right for Him to get the ultimate glory and you the ultimate benefit. That's why James writes: 'Let patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing.' Impatience is a sign of immaturity. Have you noticed that children can't wait for anything? But a wise parent knows what's best. God sets His watch to accomplish His purpose, not ours. Paul writes: 'We know that all things work...according to His purpose.' (See Romans 8:28). When you clearly understand God's purpose you won't permit things that are contrary to it, including hurry and worry. You'll also know how to allocate your time, your effort and your money-where to go and where not to go. </p>
<p>God says, 'I make known the end from the beginning.' (Isaiah 46:10 NIV) First God sets the goal, then He determines the steps that lead to it. And what are we supposed to do while we are waiting? Listen: 'Though the fig tree does not bud and there are no grapes on the vines, though the olive crop fails and the fields produce no food, though there are no sheep in the pen and no cattle in the stalls, yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will be joyful in God my Saviour.'

<introtext><![CDATA['...To bestow...beauty instead of ashes...' Isaiah 61:3 NIV<br /><br /><p>The Chinese have an interesting symbol for the word 'crisis'; it indicates both danger and opportunity. When the stakes are high and the outcome in doubt, purpose can emerge from pain like beauty from ashes. But real healing can't begin until you face the facts and express your pain. That means doing what David did: taking it to God. 'How long must I wrestle with my thoughts and every day have sorrow in my heart?' (Psalm 13:2 NIV) Just as lancing a boil is a necessary first step to healing, facing the truth is the first step towards becoming whole. Those who grow through a crisis learn which hopes, dreams and expectations were violated by the event. They identify where the repair work is needed, then they develop a road map for the future. At first you will feel as if 'nothing will ever be the same again'. That's normal. You may have to make adjustments in how you work, where you spend your leisure time, and how you relate to your family and friends. It's the nature of a crisis to destabilise your world. But it also forces you to reach deep within yourself and find hidden strength you didn't know existed. You may not feel courageous or hopeful right now, but that doesn't mean those things aren't there waiting to be tapped. Even though you don't feel strong today, you can draw strength from the One who is. 'The Lord is my Rock, my Fortress, and my Deliverer; my God...in Whom I will trust...' (Psalm 18:2 AMP) Face it. Find God in it. Follow Him, and He will give you a better tomorrow.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Everyone who loves is born of God...' 1 John 4:7 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Recently, a 12-year-old boy in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, hanged himself. Why? Because the next day was his first day at a new school, he was overweight, and he dreaded being taunted by other children. Few things are more painful than shame. One of the greatest kindnesses we can show others is to take away their false shame through love and acceptance. When the disciples met a man who was blind from birth they asked Jesus, '...Was it because of his own sins or his parents' sins?' (John 9:2 NLT) They weren't concerned that the man needed help or that he'd spent his life in total darkness. No, they started discussing his shortcomings-right in front of him! It's easier to label people than love them. We label things because we think we know what's inside, and we label people for the same reason. We'd rather debate homosexuality than befriend someone who's gay, condemn divorce than help its victims, argue about abortion than support an orphanage, or gripe about social services than help the poor. Jesus didn't see this blind man as a victim of fate, he saw him as an opportunity waiting to happen. He said to His disciples, '...This happened so the power of God can be seen in him.' (John 9:3 NLT) If you don't love people, you don't love God; actually, you don't even know Him! You need to pray, 'Lord, remind me today that the greatest gift I have to give others is Your love.' When you get serious and begin to pray that way, people will open up to God's help and healing.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...I have called you friends...' John 15:15 NKJV<br /><br /><p>If you're serious about becoming God's friend you must choose to obey Him! Jesus said, 'If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love...' (John 15:10 NKJV) You say, 'But if I fail, does that mean God won't love me?' No, it means you won't feel His love, or have confidence when you approach Him in prayer. We normally think of obedience as a characteristic of our relationship to a parent, a boss or a superior officer, not a friend. But Jesus said, 'You are My friends if you do whatever I command you.' (John 15:14 NKJV) True friendship isn't passive, it acts. When Jesus asks us to love people, help the needy, give our finances, live clean lives, extend forgiveness and bring others to Him-our love should motivate us to obey immediately! Great opportunities usually come once or twice in a lifetime, but small ones come every day. Through simple acts of obedience we bring a smile to God's face. '...What pleases the Lord more... sacrifices or obedience...? It is better to obey...' (1 Samuel 15:22 NCV) At the beginning of Jesus' public ministry, God announced, '...This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.' (Matthew 3:17 NKJV) So, what had Jesus been doing for 30 years that pleased God? The Bible says nothing except that He lived at home with His parents and '...was obedient to them.' (Luke 2:51 NLT). Thirty years of pleasing God were summed up in two words: 'lived obediently'! And the relationship Jesus had with His Father is an example of the one He wants you to have with Him.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I have called you friends...' John 15:15 NKJV<br /><br /><p>David desired to know God above all else. He used words like longing, yearning, thirsting and hungering. 'I ask only one thing of the Lord. This is what I want: Let me live in the Lord's house all my life.' (Psalm 27:4 NCV) Again he said, 'Your love means more than life to me...' (Psalm 63:3 CEV) Jacob's desire was so intense that he wrestled with God all night, saying, '...I will not let You go unless You bless me.' (Genesis 32:26 NIV) And the amazing thing is, God, who is all powerful, let Jacob win. Why? Because wrestling requires personal contact; it brings us close to Him. Paul was another man who was passionate about his friendship with God. '...[My determined purpose is]...that I may...become more deeply and intimately acquainted with Him...' (Philippians 3:10 AMP) You say, 'I'd like to have a closer relationship with God, but I'm so busy.' The truth is, you are as close to God as you desire and discipline yourself to be! Friendship with God must become your passion. You must intentionally seek it. That means answering questions like, 'Do I value it more than anything else? Is it worth giving up other things for? Is it worth developing the habits and skills required? Am I willing to say, 'Lord, more than anything else, I want to know You'? God's answer to that prayer has always been: '...you will...find Me when you search for Me with all your heart.' (Jeremiah 29:13 NKJV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Why...have You laid the burden...on me?' Numbers 11:11 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Some of us know how to give, but not receive. As a result we fail to reach our growth potential or accomplish what God planned for us. Somebody within your reach right now knows something you need to know; something you'll never discover on your own. Get close to them and draw water from their well. It's pride that keeps us weak. Weak people don't reach for others, wise people do. Moses asked God, '...Why...have You laid the burden of all these people on me?' God said, 'I didn't, you took it on yourself.' Then He instructed Moses, '...Gather...seventy men...whom you know to be elders... Then...I will take of the Spirit that is upon you and will put the same upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you...' (Numbers 11:16-17 NKJV) </p>
<p>A newspaper carried the story of a woman who fell asleep behind the wheel and plunged her car through a safety rail on the motorway. It dangled precariously, 20m in the air. Motorists stopped, grabbed ropes, tied them to the back of the woman's car and hung on till the emergency units arrived. A ladder was extended from below to help stabilise the car while firefighters chained the vehicle to tow trucks. Every time her car moved she screamed. It took over two hours for passers-by, the motorway patrol, tow-truck drivers and firefighters-about 25 people in all-to pull her to safety. The fire captain at the scene said later, 'It was funny. She kept shouting, I'll do it myself!' Are you like that? If you want to enjoy God's best, reach for others!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Gideon...crossed over, exhausted but still in pursuit.' Judges 8:4 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Are you thinking of quitting? You believed you could make a difference until they poured criticism and cold water on you. At that point you decided it was easier to adjust your expectations to their opinion and just keep smiling. Don't do it; God has too much invested in you! The comfort zone is for those who are exempt from pain but denied progress; protected from failure but held in the grip of mediocrity. Get up and get out of there while you still can: '...strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die...' (Revelation 3:2 NKJV) Open your Bible and begin to fill your mind with God's promises; they're powerful motivators. Pray, believing God for great things. Plug in at church. Rekindle your desire, for ultimately that's what determines your destiny! Jesus suffered the loss of His disciples, His friends, and even His clothes (John 19:23-24). But they couldn't rob Him of '...the joy that was set before Him...' (Hebrews 12:2 NKJV) Even while He was dying He continued to minister. Then He went into hell, came out with the lock and keys and announced, 'I am He who lives, and was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore...' (Revelation 1:18 NKJV) And He is your example!</p>
<p>When Gideon fought the Midianites we read that he '...came to the Jordan, he and the three hundred men who were with him crossed over, exhausted but still in pursuit.' Because Gideon refused to let the Jordan River intimidate him, or fatigue stop him, God gave him a great victory! And He will do the same for you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Jesus said...Get up!...' John 5:8 NIV<br /><br /><p>At the pool of Bethesda Jesus was drawn to a man who'd been physically incapacitated for 38 years and couldn't walk. That's a long time to wait for things to change. Many of us would have given up. 'When Jesus...asked...Do you want to get well?... [he] replied, I have no one to help me... While I am trying to get in, someone else goes...ahead of me. Then Jesus said...Get up! Pick up your mat and walk.' (vv. 6-8 NIV) How do you see yourself? As a helpless victim? Wendy Blight says, 'I lived like that...for a decade. At 21 I was raped by a masked stranger hiding in my apartment. Before that I loved life. I'd just completed college...graduated with honours...become engaged to a wonderful man...and had an amazing job waiting for me... My attacker's...act shattered my hopes and dreams. I lived in a prison of fear and despair. Then I encountered Christ... the words He spoke...pierced my soul. I...was the man on that mat (John 5:8)...accustomed to my place of sorrow... I enjoyed being the victim...I was comfortable. The Bible says, '...The Word of God is living and active...it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart' (Hebrews 4:12 NIV) and it spoke personally to me. I knew I needed to take the first step. I surrendered my fear, pity, and grief... I learned God had a plan for my life and a purpose for my pain. However, I'd never see it until I had the courage to get up and walk. If you're on the mat...open God's Word. Let Him speak...promises of hope and healing. Before you can get off the mat, you must surrender your fear, self-pity, and despair. Will you do it?'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Live...as temporary residents on earth...' 1 Peter 1:17 GWT<br /><br /><p>The fact that this world is not our ultimate home explains why we experience difficulty, disappointment and rejection. It also explains why some promises seem unfulfilled, some prayers unanswered, and some circumstances unfair. This life is not the end of the story! In order to keep us from becoming too attached to this world, God allows us to feel a certain amount of discontent-longings that will never be fulfilled this side of Heaven. We're not completely happy here because we're not supposed to be! Indeed, we won't be in Heaven two seconds before we'll look around and say, 'Why did I place such importance on earthly things?' The truth is, at death you don't leave home, you go home! Imagine being an ambassador in a hostile nation. You would have to learn its language and adapt to its customs. You couldn't isolate yourself. To fulfil your mission you'd have to understand what's going on and know how to relate to those around you. But what if you fell in love with that country, preferring it to your own? Your loyalty and commitment would be compromised. Instead of representing your country, you'd start acting like a traitor. The Bible says, '...We are Christ's ambassadors...' (2 Corinthians 5:20 NLT) So don't get too attached to what's around you, because it's temporary. 'Those who use the things of the world should not become attached to them. For this world as we know it will soon pass away.' (1 Corinthians 7:31 NLT) So use it, maximise it to fulfil God's purposes, but don't fall in love with it!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Find favour...in the sight of God and man.' Proverbs 3:4 NKJV<br /><br /><p>God can give you favour in the most unusual places and through the most unlikely people. Joseph's journey to the throne of Egypt involved being unjustly accused and thrown in prison. Now the prospects of an ex-con becoming your next Prime Minister are not good-unless, like Joseph, God is writing your story. '...Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief butler and the chief baker. So he put them...in the prison, the place where Joseph was confined.' (Genesis 40:2-3 NKJV) While they were there Joseph interpreted a dream for both men, and in each case what he said came to pass. So Joseph's gift became known. Later when Pharaoh was troubled by a dream that none of his counsellors could interpret, the butler remembered Joseph and told Pharaoh about him. At this point Joseph interprets Pharaoh's dream, helps him to prepare for seven years of coming famine, and is rewarded with being made the number two man in the country. At last, Joseph's dream came to pass. But notice who God used to fulfil it: a baker and a butler. Spiritually speaking, God can use <i>bakers</i> to bless you because they know the ingredients required to make the cake. Some of the stuff they use, such as salt, flour and baking soda, doesn't taste very good, but the finished product is delicious. God can use <i>butlers</i> because they're experienced in knowing how to open the door at the right time. Are you getting the idea? Keep your mind open and stay sensitive to God, for He will give you favour in the most unusual places and through the most unlikely people.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Find favour...in the sight of God and man.' Proverbs 3:4 NKJV<br /><br /><p>To see God's favour at work, examine the life of Joseph. 'Now Israel [Jacob] loved Joseph more than all his children... he made him a [coat] of many colours. But when his brothers saw that their father loved him...they hated him... Now Joseph had a dream, and he told it to his brothers; and they hated him even more.' (Genesis 37:3-5 NKJV) Notice two things in this story. First, God's favour is a gift, not a reward because you're better than others<i>.</i> Never apologise for God's blessing on your life, but never wear it as a badge of superiority. Paul asks, '...What do you have that you did not receive?' (1 Corinthians 4:7 NKJV) Answer, nothing! So keep that in mind and live with an attitude of gratitude. Secondly, walking in God's favour requires great wisdom<i>.</i> Joseph's brothers said, '...Look, this dreamer is coming... let us now kill him and...see what will become of his dreams!' (Genesis 37:18-20 NKJV) It's a mistake to share your dream with those who are incapable of appreciating it. Openly, they may rejoice with you, but secretly they'll resent you. The Prodigal's older brother wasn't upset that his younger brother was starving in a foreign pig pen. What he couldn't handle was his homecoming celebration. King Saul rejoiced when David killed Goliath. What he couldn't handle were people saying, '...Saul has killed his thousands, [but] David his ten thousands!' (1 Samuel 18:7 NLT) Jesus had strong words on this subject: 'Do not...cast your pearls before swine...' (Matthew 7:6 NKJV) So use wisdom, speak only when the time is right, seek to please God, and you'll walk in His favour.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The heart of her husband safely trusts her...' Proverbs 31:11 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Oscar Hammerstein wrote, 'Love in your heart wasn't put there to stay. Love isn't love, till you give it away.' We can be rejected by many, as long as we can come home and be loved by one. At times life will beat you down, so make your home a sanctuary. Here's a story to help you do that.</p>
<p>He'd finally decided to ask his employer for a pay rise. Before leaving for work he told his wife about it. All day long he felt apprehensive. Finally, late in the afternoon he summoned the courage to approach his boss. To his delight he got the pay rise. Elated, he arrived home to a beautiful table set with the best china and lighted candles. Smelling the aroma of a specially prepared meal, he guessed that somebody from the office had called his wife and tipped her off. Finding her in the kitchen he shared the good news. They embraced before sitting down to a wonderful meal. Next to his plate he found a note that read, 'Congratulations! I knew you'd get the pay rise. This dinner is to show how much I love you.' Later, on his way to the kitchen to help his wife serve dessert, he noticed a second card that had fallen from her pocket. Picking it up off the floor he read, 'Don't worry about not getting the pay rise. You deserve it anyway. This dinner is to show you how much I love you.' Acceptance! Love! She stood behind him no matter what-softening the blows, healing the wounds, believing in him. So the word for you today is-support your spouse!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...find favour...in the sight of God and man.' Proverbs 3:4 NKJV<br /><br /><p>To fulfil your God-given assignment in life you will need God's favour! How did Joseph go from being a lowly inmate to running the whole prison system? '...The Lord was with Joseph...and He gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison...whatever he did, the Lord made it prosper.' (Genesis 39:21-23 NKJV) Why did King Ahasuerus choose a Jewish slave girl named Esther to be his queen? '...She obtained grace and favour in his sight...so he set the royal crown upon her head...' (Esther 2:17 NKJV) How did Samuel go from being a custodian in the temple to being a prophetic voice of the nation? '...Samuel grew...in favour both with the Lord and men.' (1 Samuel 2:26 NKJV) What did all these favoured people have in common?</p>
<p>First, they gave their best effort<i>.</i> They excelled at what God gave them to do, and when the time came He promoted them. Secondly, they put others first<i>.</i> David served King Saul even though he was a ruthless boss. Ruth worked to support her widowed mother-in-law Naomi, unlike Naomi's other daughter-in-law Orpah. Thirdly, they sought guidance and had a teachable spirit<i>.</i> God answered Ruth's request by giving her Naomi, the right mentor; Boaz, the right boss; and making sure she got into the right field (Ruth 2:2-3). God's favour will connect you to the right people and get you to the right place. When your chosen field is the field God has chosen for you, you can't help but be blessed in it. No, you won't be exempt from trials, but you'll succeed in what you're called to do.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...it was a river...' Ezekiel 47:5 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Paul writes, 'Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us.' (Ephesians 3:20 NKJV) You say, 'With my lack of education, limited income, poor health and past mistakes, I don't see how I can succeed.' When you're dealing with God, put away your old measuring rod! Ezekiel had a vision. He saw a river flowing from the temple: 'When the man went out...with the line in his hand, he measured one thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the water came up to my ankles. Again he measured one thousand and brought me through the waters; the water came up to my knees. Again he measured one thousand and brought me through; the water came up to my waist. Again he measured one thousand, and it was a river that I could not cross; for the water was too deep, water in which one must swim...Then he said to me...it shall be that every living thing that moves, wherever the rivers go, will live...Along the bank of the river...will grow all kinds of trees used for food; their leaves will not wither, and their fruit will not fail. They will bear fruit every month, because their water flows from the sanctuary...' (Ezekiel 47:3-12 NKJV) Notice, this river flows from God. <i>He</i> is the One who determines your future and decides your abundance. No matter who sows or who reaps, '...God...gives the increase.' (1 Corinthians 3:7 NKJV) Who determines the extent of your blessing? God! So put away your old measuring rod!</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...I have called you by your name; You are Mine.' Isaiah 43:1 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Dr Martyn Lloyd-Jones said, 'Though you are one of the teeming millions in this world, and though the world would have you believe that you do not count and that you are but a speck in the mass, God says, 'I know you.' How wonderful is that? Take a moment and consider the things in life that rob us of self-esteem. Words such as, 'I don't want you; I don't love you anymore.' Or 'You're unsuitable for the job; sorry, we have to let you go.' Or, 'You keep making the same stupid mistakes. You'll never get it right.' Or, 'Why can't you be like your brother, or your sister, or so-and-so?' Understand this: </p>
<p>(1)<i> Your self-esteem cannot be based on what you do for a living.</i> Because when you can no longer do it you'll feel worthless. Think about some of the famous people you know: athletes, artists, speakers, etc. When they can no longer do what they do they often get depressed, even suicidal. (2)<i> Your self-esteem cannot be based on what you own.</i> Recently the US housing market lost up to 40% of its value in one year. Millions of people saw their social status go down and their financial security go up in smoke. (3)<i> Your self-esteem cannot be based on other people's opinion </i>because it will always make you vulnerable to rejection. What's the solution? Discover what God thinks about you and build your life on it. '...thus says the Lord, who created you...who...redeemed you; I have called you by your name; You are <i>Mine</i>.'(Isaiah 43:1 NKJV) It doesn't get any better than that!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...God has come to test you...' Exodus 20:20 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Do you remember the tests you took in school? You passed or failed, but you couldn't avoid them. Life works that way too. When it comes to life's testsyou must prepare yourself in advance! Jesus said: '...a wise man...built his house on the rock: and the rain descended, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house; and it did not fall... a foolish man...built his house on the sand: and the rain descended, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house; and it fell. And great was its fall.' (Matthew 7:24-27 NKJV) The first man built his house on rock because he knew it wasn't a question of 'if', but 'when', a storm will come. The second man built his house on sand because it was cheap and easy. When the storm came the first man's house stood and the second man's house fell. What's the point Jesus was making? Your talents, your rsum and your reputation may get you to the top, but if you haven't built strong character you won't stay there long. Furthermore, your beliefs may be sincere and line up with what other people around you think, but unless they're founded on God's Word they'll fail you when you need them most. Four times in the Bible we read, '...The just shall live by <i>faith</i>.' (Romans 1:17 NKJV) When the tests of life come you've got to be able to rise up and say, 'I may not have all the answers, but I have proven God's character and track record and I'm trusting Him to do what He's promised in His Word!' </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...God has come to test you...' Exodus 20:20 NKJV<br /><br /><p>God told His people: '...the Lord your God led you...these forty years in the wilderness, to...test you, to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep His commandments or not.' (Deuteronomy 8:2 NKJV) The tests of life reveal how well you take instruction, what you've learned, and what you'll do in any given set of circumstances. What you've been taught is only theory, until it's been tested. And life <i>will</i> test you! Chuck Swindoll tells the story of a bird named Chippy: 'Chippy the parakeet never saw it coming. One second he was peacefully perched in his cage singing, the next he was sucked in, washed up, and blown over. His problem began when his owner decided to clean his cage with a vacuum. She stuck the nozzle in to suck up the seeds and feathers at the bottom of the cage. Then the phone rang. Instinctively she turned to pick it up. She'd barely said 'hello' whensswwwwPPPPP! Chippy got sucked in. She gasped, let the phone drop, and snapped off the vacuum. With her heart in her mouth, she unzipped the bag. There was Chippyalive, but stunnedcovered with heavy black dust. She grabbed him and rushed to the bathtub, turned on the faucet full blast and held Chippy under a torrent of ice-cold water, power-washing him clean. Then she did what any compassionate pet owner would do: she snatched up the hairdryer and blasted the wet, shivering little bird with hot air.' Swindoll closes his story with these words: 'Chippy doesn't sing much anymore.' Life will test you, but don't let it steal your song!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...God has come to test you...' Exodus 20:20 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Do you remember your school days? When you were being tested the teacher was silent. The Bible says: '...Jesus made His disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of Him...When evening came, the boat was in the middle of the lake, and...He saw the disciples straining at the oars, because the wind was against them. About the fourth watch of the night [just before the dawn] He went out to them, walking on the lake...They cried out, because they...were terrified. Immediately He spoke to them and said, &quot;Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid.&quot; Then He climbed into the boat with them, and the wind died down. They were completely amazed.' (Mark 6:45-51 NIV) This story teaches that:</p>
<p>(1) <i>Being in the will of God requires you to go through storms.</i> 'Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the Lord delivers [them] out of them all.' (Psalm 34:19 NKJV) (2) <i>When you can't see Him, His eye is still on you.</i> You are never out of His sight, His care or His reach. (3) <i>He will never give you an assignment you can complete without His help</i>, so don't try it alone. (4) <i>If you let it, fear will cloud your thinking and keep you from recognising Him when He comes to you.</i> (5) <i>First He will speak to you, then to the circumstances that threaten you</i>. When He does, you'll experience supernatural peace. (6) When your boat is 'in the middle' of the storm, the best is yet to come! (7) <i>The darkest hour is just before the dawn</i>. Rejoice! The sun will shine again; God won't fail you.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts.' Colossians 3:15 NIV<br /><br /><p>When God speaks to us He gives us a deep sense of inner peace to confirm that the message is truly from Him. Beware of false peace! When we have a strong desire to do something it can produce a false sense of peace that actually comes only from our excitement. As time passes this false peace disappears and God's true will for our lives emerges. So we should never move too quickly on important decisions. </p>
<p>When the devil speaks to us he cannot give us peace. And when we try to solve things with our own reasoning, we cannot get peace. 'But if the Holy Spirit controls your mind, there is...peace.' (Romans 8:6 NLT) Lay your decision on the scales of peace. Don't proceed if your inner peace cannot hold its weight against what you think or hear. You don't have to explain to others why you don't have peace about it; sometimes you won't know why. Just say, 'It's not wise for me to do this because I don't have peace about it.' There's power in having peace! And once you know you've clearly heard from God, you must do all you can to 'keep your peace' and not become anxious. </p>
<p>Peace is an inner 'knowing' that your actions are approved by God. 'Let the peace (soul harmony which comes) from Christ rule (act as umpire continually) in your hearts [deciding and settling with finality all questions that arise in your minds, in that peaceful state] to which...you were also called [to live].' (Colossians 3:15 AMP) God leads us by peace. His peace is like an umpire who decides what's 'safe' or what's 'out'. No peace? It's 'out.'</p>

<alias><![CDATA[integrity-2]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['May integrity...protect me...' Psalm 25:21 NIV<br /><br /><p>Though repeatedly tempted by Potiphar's wife, Joseph said no. Faced with similar circumstances, David said yes. But the story doesn't end there. David married Bathsheba; when their son Solomon grew up 'He had seven hundred wives...and three hundred concubines, and his wives led him astray.' (1 Kings 11:3 NIV) Integrity may not seem like a big deal now, but your lack of it will have far-reaching consequences. Integrity means keeping commitments, even though the circumstances in which you made them have changed. One leader points out that when integrity is the referee, your lips and your life will be in agreement. Your beliefs will be mirrored by your behaviour. There'll be no discrepancy between what you appear to be and what you are, whether in good times or bad. Integrity is not only the referee between opposing value systems, it's the decision maker between being at peace and being fragmented within. It frees you to become a whole person no matter what comes your way. There's a story about a job applicant who was asked why he was discharged from his last position. He replied, 'Because I wanted to take work home with me.' When asked who he worked for, he replied, 'The First National Bank.' We smile, but in a recent survey of employees, 55% said they didn't trust their top management. Are <i>you</i> trustworthy? Will Rogers said: 'People's minds are changed through observation, not argument. People do what people see. What they hear, they understand; what they see, they believe and follow.' That's why a corrected and contrite Psalmist prayed, 'Guard my life...let me not be put to shame...May integrity...protect me...' (Psalm 25:20-21 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I have walked in...integrity...' Psalm 26:1 NKJV<br /><br /><p>To protect themselves from the barbaric hordes from the north, the people of China built the <i>Great Wall.</i> It was so high nobody could climb over it and so thick nobody could break through it, so they settled back to enjoy life. During the first hundred years of the wall's existence, China was invaded three different times. Not once did the enemy try to break down the wall or climb over it; they simply bribed the gatekeeper and marched in. While those who built it were relying on their wall of stone, they neglected to teach integrity to their children. As a result they grew up without moral and spiritual principles to guide them. Have you ever watched a big tree fall while others around it stood tall? How come the same storm that builds strength in one, topples another? You'll find the answer in the tree's core and roots. Getting the idea? When it comes to building integrity, here are some questions you should ask yourself regularly: (1) <i>Am I the same, no matter who I'm with?</i> (2) <i>Am I willing to make decisions that are best for others</i>, even though another choice would benefit me more? (3) <i>Can I be counted on to keep the commitments I've made to God, myself and others?</i> Can you say like the Psalmist, 'Judge me, O Lord; for I have walked in...integrity...'? (Psalm 26:1 KJV) Life is like a vice: at times it will squeeze you. In those moments whatever is inside will come out. Image-building and self-interest promise much but produce little, but integrity never disappoints. So, work on your integrity.</p>

<title><![CDATA[A Blueprint for Prayer]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[a-blueprint-for-prayer]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['After this manner...pray...' Matthew 6:9 KJV<br /><br /><p>Jesus taught us to pray: 'Our Father in Heaven, Hallowed be Your name. Your Kingdom come. Your will be done in earth, as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one: For Yours is the kingdom...the power, and the glory, forever. Amen.' (Matthew 6:9-13 NKJV) When it comes to praying, Jesus gave us a blueprint: </p>
<p>'Our Father' establishes the basis of your relationship with God. It reminds you that you're not just part of His creation, you're His child! Think about it; you can create something without being related to it, but once you father it, it's always part of you. <i>'In Heaven'</i> affirms your connection to the God of the universe. 'The Lord...made the heavens His throne; from there He rules over everything.' (Psalm 103:19 NLT) You are acknowledging God's power and His unique qualifications to answer your prayers. <i>'Hallowed be Your name'</i> reminds you that God is holy; that being His child doesn't give you the right to disobey or take Him for granted. When you 'Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, and into His courts with praise' (Psalm 100:4 NIV), it gets His attention, because by exalting His name you're recognising His character. <i>'Your will be done in earth'</i> is reminiscent of Jesus' prayer in Gethsemane: '...Your will...be done, not mine.' (Matthew 26:39 NLT) Christ taught us to seek God's agenda, not our own; to have the same mind as our heavenly Father; to walk with Him by praying in agreement with Him.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...if I didn't love others, I would have gained nothing.' 1 Corinthians 13:3 NLT<br /><br /><p>Former US Education Secretary William Bennett attended a contemporary wedding where the bride and groom pledged in their vows to remain together, 'As long as love shall last.' Bennett said, 'I sent them paper plates as a wedding gift.' If you want to build a great marriage, one that will go the distance, you must concentrate on doing these four things: </p>
<p>(1)<i> Take responsibility for your own happiness.</i> By blaming your mate you never have to face yourself honestly or change your own behaviour. That's a cop-out! Relationships aren't dumping grounds. Happiness is an inside job; it comes from having a healthy self-esteem and a growing relationship with God. (2)<i> Be a friend.</i> Ever notice how easily we accept our friends as they are, yet have trouble doing that with the one we're married to? Look out, familiarity breeds contempt! Doesn't your partner deserve at least the same respect, loyalty, patience, gratitude and appreciation you give others? (3)<i> Have a shared goal.</i> You always need something to plan for and work toward together. Doing this will enrich your relationship and take it to higher levels. So, what's your next goal? (4)<i> Have courage. </i>There are no perfect situations in life. You need courage to face whatever comes, to realise that what you can't solve, you can out-last and out-love! So work on your marriage today!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The thief comes only to steal...' John 10:10 NIV<br /><br /><P>Using his own home as a demo, TV anchorman Brandon Brooks showed his viewers how to protect their homes from robbers. He installed double locks on all the doors, windows that can't be opened from outside, sophisticated alarmsthe works. But what he failed to take into account was that thieves were also watching and learning the details of his security system and where the TV, VCR and furniture were located. The following week, while Brooks was on the air, they cleaned him outbecause that's what thieves do!<BR><SPAN lang=EN-AU>Satan is a thief! Jesus said he '...comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that [you] may have life...to the full.'(John 10:10 NIV) Henry Blackaby says: 'Since...Adam and Eve, people have had to choose whom to believe. Satan convinced them that [disobeying] God would gain them everything. Instead their disobedience robbed them of all they had. For the rest of their lives they experienced only a fraction of the blessing God had intended...The world seeks to convince you you'll find fulfilment by adopting its standards of morality for your marriage, raising your children, and advancing your career...If you believe <I>this</I> you'll never experience the blessings God intended... Sin brings death (Romans 6:23)...Jesus wants you to live your life with security, knowing that you are a beloved child of God. If you're not experiencing His love, joy and peace, you have settled for less than God intends... If you have been making excuses for why you're not living an abundant and joyful life, determine today to settle for nothing less than God's best. Instead of following the world's way...listen to the Saviour's voice and...find...fulfilment.'</P></SPAN><br /><br />SoulFood: Neh 8-10, John 18:25-40, Ps 105:1-7, Pr 30:1-4<br /><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=19647&amp;www=true' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Encourage him...' Deuteronomy 1:38 NKJV<br /><br /><P>Some of us 'self-starters' need little or no appreciation; the rest of us need it regularly. God told Moses to encourage Joshua, his replacement, because he'd big shoes to fill. Even Paul needed appreciation. '...we were troubled on every side...Nevertheless God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the coming of Titus.' (2 Corinthians 7:5-6 NKJV) When you show appreciation, you're doing God's work! We think wonderful things about people but we don't tell them. Appreciation only works when you express it! A psychologist interviewed the son of a successful business tycoon. The boy had refused to take over the family business after his dad's death, even though it would have made him very rich. The boy explained: 'You don't understand the relationship I had with my father. He was a driven man who came up the hard way. His objective was to teach me self-reliance, and he thought the best way to do it, was never to encourage or praise me. Every day we played ball in the yard. The idea was for me to catch the ball ten straight times. I'd catch it eight or nine times, but always on the tenth throw he'd do everything possible to make me miss it. He'd throw it on the ground or over my head so I'd no chance of catching it.' Then he paused tearfully and said, 'That's why I have to get away; I want to catch that tenth ball!' This young man grew up feeling he could never be good enough to please his father. Sound familiar? The Bible says, 'Anxiety in the heart of man causes depression, but a good word makes it glad.' (Proverbs 12:25 NKJV) So, show appreciation.</P>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['I prayed for this child...' 1 Samuel 1:27 NIV<br /><br /><p>Every saint was once a child; so was every criminal. What makes the difference? At the top of the listis the influence of a parent! The prophet Samuel led the nation of Israel for forty years, anointed David to be king and guided him in some of his most crucial decisions. But who was the dominant influence in Samuel's life? His mother Hannah. Listen to her prayer at his birth: 'I prayed for this child, and the Lord has granted me what I asked of him. So now I give him to the Lord. For his whole life he will be given over to the Lord...' (1 Samuel 1:27-28 NIV) Never underestimate the power that's released when a parent prays on behalf of a child. Only God knows how many prayers are being answered right now because of a faithful parent who prayed many years ago. If what you are doing in this fast-paced society is taking you away from prayer time for your children and your grandchildren, you're doing too much! There's <i>nothing</i> more important than the time you spend with God on their behalf. It's not too late for the child who has brought you tears and grief. Jesus' mother had to watch her son be crucified, but she also had the joy of seeing Him raised again from the dead. Indeed, you may go to your grave wondering if your prayers are effective and when they will be answered, but never, never stop praying, because: (a) God works according to His schedule, not ours (b) His ways and means are far superior to ours (c) When a parent praysGod moves!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Throw yourself into your tasks so that everyone will see your progress.' 1 Timothy 4:15 NLT<br /><br /><p>The average person in any line of work could double their productive capacity if they began right now to practice all the things they know they should do, and stopped practicing all the things they know they shouldn't do. Now, success doesn't come just by practice; you must practice right and do the right things. Dr. John Maxwell gives us some pillars of practice we should incorporate into our daily lives in order to succeed: (1) <i>A good coach</i>. Did you hear about the guy who entered his mule into the Melbourne Cup? 'He'll never win,' a friend said. 'I know,' he replied, 'but we only learn and grow by association.' You need to get around the right people. (2 Thessalonians 3:6-9) (2) <i>Your best effort</i>. Are you practicing in a way, a time and a place that allow you to give your best? Are you giving yourself incentives? Paul's motivation was: 'a crown is being held for me.' (2 Timothy 4:8 NCV) (3) <i>A clear purpose</i>. Be certain about what you're trying to accomplish. Effort without knowledge is like speed without direction. Paul's objective was to '...complete the task the Lord Jesus has given me...' (Acts 20:24 NIV) (4) <i>The right resources</i>. Paul challenges Timothy to become a reader (1 Timothy 4:13). What resources should you invest in to help you excel?</p>
<p>You only play well if you practice well. So, where are you on the practice continuum? Just starting out? At the phase of rapid progress? Have you already made your greatest gains, now you're fine tuning? Knowing where you are, helps you know what you need to do. So keep practicing.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...seventy...or...eighty years...pass quickly...' Psalm 90:10 NCV<br /><br /><p>Our souls aren't hungry for fame, comfort, wealth or power. Those things create as many problems as they solve. Our souls are hungry for <i>meaning</i>. We want our lives to matter. The Psalmist writes, 'Our lifetime is seventy years or, if we are strong, eighty...' (Psalm 90:10 NCV) Eighty years is just under 30 000 days. Think about that in financial terms: $30 000 will buy you a car or make a deposit on a house. It's not that much moneyand it's not that much time. None of us knows how many years we've left, but we know how many we've been given till now. If you were to draw a line and add them up, eternally speaking, what would you have to show for your life? Job said, 'My days fly faster than a weaver's shuttle...' (Job 7:6 NLT); '...they flee away...' (Job 9:25 NAS) Bryan Wilkerson says: 'Teens count the number of friends they have, the number of colleges they get into. College students count grade points...credit hours...how many countries they've visited... Adults measure success by the number of bedrooms in their house, cars in the garage...or the yield on their investments. Most make two mistakes...they think they've so much [time] they can afford to waste it, or so little time they can't possibly do something significant, so they don't try. Our days are like suitcasesall the same sizebut some can pack more into them than others. 'A person who chases fantasies has no sense.' (Proverbs 12:11 NLT) Numbering your days means offering them to God and seeking His direction for your life.' </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...My entire lifetime is...but a breath.' Psalm 39:5 NLT<br /><br /><p>Talking about a friend's funeral, Bryan Wilkerson says: 'The man...was a Christian - bright, hardworking, and dynamic. He helped start two hospitals...the local soccer association...travelled...sang in choirs around the world...a man of remarkable energy and ability...But nobody spoke of his spiritual influence. He introduced many to soccer but few...to Christ. The pastor could say nothing of his contribution...except he critiqued the sermon at the door on Sunday. His wife and children had few words; they got the short end of his attention and energy. Imagine what he <i>could</i> have accomplished by offering his time and talent to God. Compare that to another funeral I attended. This man was also...highly regarded in the secular community. But he was careful to number his days and resources and offer them to God. People didn't speak about his success and influence in the marketplace, but of his spiritual impact...how he pointed them to Christ...his leadership and support of Christian ministries...his years of church service...his mission trips to Moldova. His family spoke of his love of Scripture...his love for them...his faithfulness as a husband and father. I remember...wishing the whole church could be there to see what God can do with somebody who offers...every day of their life to Him.' So, how many people have you pointed to Christ? Where are you investing your time, treasure and talent? God's gifts are never loans, they're deposits and He expects a return. The only <i>even</i> thing in this world is the number of hours in a day. The difference between winning and losing is how you use them.</p>

<alias><![CDATA[your-visionyou-must-find-it-1]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Write the vision and make it plain...' Habakkuk 2:2 NKJV<br /><br />
<p>Notice two important things about vision: (1)<em> Your vision must come from God.</em> There's a difference between setting your own goals and having a God-given vision. When your vision is of God, '...it will surely come...' (Habakkuk 2:3 NKJV) You won't have to orchestrate events; God will provide the resources and open doors at the right time. Your steps will be directed by Him. Here's an interesting Scripture: '...time and chance happen to them all. For man also does not know his time: like fish taken in a cruel net, like birds caught in a snare, so the sons of men are snared in an evil time...' (Ecclesiastes 9:11-12 NKJV) God will reveal to you your destiny and give you an opportunity to fulfil it. But you can resist it, or postpone it, or give your life to other things and end up missing your 'time' and 'chance'. Don't get caught in that net or trapped in that snare and forfeit what God has for you.</p>
<p>(2)<em> Your vision will be connected to a certain field.</em> Joseph's dream started with a field of wheat (Genesis 37:6-7). What's your field? Whether God calls you to the field of medicine, education, finance, real estate, or some other field, it's to be a blessing to others. God told Abraham, '...I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing.' (Genesis 12:2 NIV) Don't seek fame, seek to serve others. If you do your impact will be greater than your image and your eternal reward greater than anything you can drive, wear, live in, or hang on a wall.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Write the vision and make it plain...' Habakkuk 2:2 NKJV<br /><br />
<p>Jesus said, '...for this reason I was born...' (John 18:37 NIV) When you know why you're here and what your God-given purpose is, you become virtually unstoppable. You won't be flawless, but you'll have the innate power to overcome each obstacle as you proceed. If you get turned around, God loves you enough to get your attention, correct and redirect you, and get you back on track. But to find the right answers you must first ask the right questions, such as:</p>
<p>(1) What desires have been living in me most of my life? (2) What motivates me to be productive? (3) What keeps me going forward when I'm worn out? (4) What makes me refuse to quit when I meet with resistance or opposition? (5) What do I do that doesn't seem like work? (6) What do I do that brings positive response and support from others? (7) What am I doing, or what's happening in my life when doors seem to open automatically and effortlessly? (8) What do discerning leaders and godly counsellors think about my work? (9) What makes me feel good about being who I am? (10) What makes my creative juices flow? (11) What am I willing to sacrifice to accomplish it? (12) What am I doing that I'd be proud to offer for God's approval? (13) What would I do without being paid for, if I could afford to? (14) What would I be willing to withstand Satan over, in order to accomplish it? What is God saying to you? It's not too late; 'find' your vision and follow it!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Write the vision and make it plain...' Habakkuk 2:2 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Paul was on a mission. He travelled light, practiced personal discipline, avoided distractions and kept his eye on the ball. '...one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forward to those things which are ahead, I press toward the goal...' (Philippians 3:13-14 NKJV) Successful companies live by a <i>mission statement</i> every team member can understand; they keep it before them at all times. God told Habakkuk, 'Write the vision and make it plain...that he may run who reads it.' (Habakkuk 2:2 NKJV) You must write your vision down, read it regularly, remember it at all times and run with it. Your greatest enemy isn't the opposition, it's the distractions. Ever heard of 'a white elephant'? When the King of Siam wanted to destroy an enemy, he supposedly gave them a white elephant. In those days white elephants were considered sacred, and nobody dared refuse a king's gift. The trouble was, white elephants couldn't be put to work but they had to be fed - a lot! So the king's 'gift' ended up causing his enemy's downfall. Hello! Guard against 'white elephants' that drain your time, energy and resources. In order to protect your vision, live by these words, '...lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God...consider Him...lest you become weary and discouraged...' (Hebrews 12:1-3 NKJV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Write the vision and make it plain...' Habakkuk 2:2 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Five times in Genesis 39 we read that the Lord 'was with' Joseph. Be encouraged: God is at work in what you're going through right now. Where did Joseph get the wisdom to lead a nation? By dealing with his own family problems, by handling Potiphar's household staff, and by running a prison system. Like rungs on a ladder, each one took him closer to the top. Notice how it worked: his brothers sold him to Ishmaelite slave traders, who sold him to Potiphar, who put him in prison where he met the butler, who introduced him to Pharaoh, who made him Prime Minister of Egypt, fulfilling his dream. Was it easy? No, until the time came,'...the word of the Lord tested him.' (Psalm 105:19 NAS) Your vision will be 'tried' by situations that either make or break you. The birth of the vision is often followed by its death and then its resurrection. When you've no funds, no friends, and no fight left in you (the death stage), remember the words of Jesus: '...unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies [to self], it produces much grain.' (John 12:24 NKJV) When your vision dies and God resurrects it, you begin to talk and act differently. With ego subtracted and grace added, you start saying with the Psalmist, 'I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living.' (Psalm 27:13 KJV) At that point God smiles and says, 'You're finally getting it right!' </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Write the vision and make it plain...' Habakkuk 2:2 NKJV<br /><br /><p>When a dream comes from God and you commit yourself to it, it will 'surely' be fulfilled. Yes, you'll stumble, be stretched to new limits and maybe even stagger across the finish line, but you'll make it. You'll get to the Promised Land. Look at Moses: he had a history-changing message to deliver to Pharaoh, yet he was a poor speaker. He had marriage problems. He was a 'sole trader' who had to reach his breaking point before he learned to delegate responsibility to others. He had a problem with his temper, as a result God said, 'This is the land I promised...I have let you see it... but you will not cross over into it.' (Deuteronomy 34:4 NIV) But Moses finally got there! 1400 years later he stood with Jesus on the Mount of Transfiguration: right in the middle of it! You say, 'I've failed so badly.' David committed adultery, yet his psalms bring strength to multitudes and he's quoted in pulpits around the world. God didn't excuse David, but He forgave him and used him. '...David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God...was buried...' (Acts 13:36 NKJV) The Bible describes God as, '...ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, abundant in kindness...' (Nehemiah 9:17 NKJV) Notice the words 'ready to pardon'. God is ready when you are, all you have to do is turn to Him. Before Habakkuk wrote about his vision, he said, 'I will...watch to see what He will say to me, and what I will answer when I am corrected.' (Habakkuk 2:1 NKJV) Corrected but not discarded! Isn't that wonderful? That's how God's grace works.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Write the vision and make it plain...' Habakkuk 2:2 NKJV<br /><br /><p>There's an interesting picture in Amos: '...A shepherd who tries to rescue a sheep from a lion's mouth will recover only two legs or a piece of an ear. So it will be...' (Amos 3:12 NLT) Picture Satan as that lion, you as that lamb, Jesus as that shepherd coming to pick up what's left of you, and see how God brings victory out of defeat. Has life torn your dream to pieces? With God, you only need two things for a comeback: (1)<i> An ear to hear. </i>Stop listening to voices that discourage you; it's not over until God says it's over! God told Ezekiel to prophesy to a valley full of dead, dry bones (Ezekiel 37:4): 'So I prophesied...and breath came into them, and they lived, and stood upon their feet, an exceeding great army.' (Ezekiel 37:10 NKJV) Your hopes may be dead and your soul dry, but if you listen to what God is saying your dream will live again. (2)<i> A leg to stand on.</i> The God who gave Job twice as much at the end of his trouble as he started with before it, isn't finished with you yet. Read what He's promised and stand on His Word. Achan was stoned to death in the Valley of Achor for stealing the spoils after the battle of Jericho. End of story? No, later, God in His mercy said, 'I will give...the Valley of Achor as a door of hope...' (Hosea 2:15 NKJV) You may be living with your consequences, but by God's grace you can still live to see your dream fulfilled.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...they continue practicing the former [habits]...' 2 Kings 17:34 NKJV<br /><br /><p>God said, '...they continue practicing the former [habits]; they do not fear the Lord, nor do they follow...the law...which the Lord...commanded...' (2 Kings 17:34 NKJV) Understand this: any habit you feed will strengthen its grip on your life. Ask anyone recovering from addiction; we only become willing to change when we hit the bottom. Prodigals don't come home until they've lost everything! But that doesn't have to be <i>your</i> story. Your heavenly Father is waiting to welcome you back. You are a child of the Most High; captivity is unnatural for you. You'll never be free until you despise your chains. Whether you're bound by a substance, a relationship or a life that's out of order, your circumstances won't change until your mind is released from the grip of old thought patterns and renewed by God's Word (Romans 12:2). So start putting in place new habits, for what you do consistently, you become permanently. Begin the Bible-reading habit. Put it first on your 'to do' list or you won't do it faithfully. '...for [these words] bring life and radiant health to anyone who discovers their meaning...' (Proverbs 4:22 NLT) Set a specific time for prayer, otherwise everything else will crowd it out. In prayer God will tell you how He feels about things. Can you afford to live without <i>His</i> input? Attend church regularly, support it with your finances, exercise your spiritual gifts and begin to invest time and energy into relationships that sharpen and strengthen you spiritually. God will say things to you in His house that He won't say anywhere else. Your daily habits are carving out an irreversible future. If you want to know where you're headed - examine them!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Write the vision and make it plain...' Habakkuk 2:2 NKJV<br /><br />
<p>Habakkuk describes his vision as, 'The burden which the prophet...saw.' (Habakkuk 1:1 NKJV) He 'saw' it wherever he went. It drove him to his knees. He prayed, 'O Lord, how long shall I cry, and You will not hear?...Why do You show me iniquity, and cause me to see trouble?...the law is powerless, and justice never goes forth. For the wicked surround the righteous; therefore perverse judgment proceeds.' (Habakkuk 1:2-4 NKJV) Before God blesses you with a plan of action He will burden you with the problem you've been called to help solve. Lewis Braille wanted to read and write. But at three years of age he was blinded in a tragic accident while playing in his father's harness shop. Refusing to settle for a world of darkness he said, 'I will make a system so that the blind can read and write.' As a result, millions of sight-impaired people have been blessed by the <em>Braille system</em>.</p>
<p>The Psalmist cried: 'The zeal for [my Father's] house has consumed me...' (Psalm 69:9 NAS) What's your all-consuming desire? What are you passionate about? What has God called and gifted you to do? Paul's burning desire was to reach the world for Christ. And he succeeded. When his enemies imprisoned him, instead of giving in to defeat he turned his cell into a writer's retreat and penned the epistles that would change more lives after he left the world than he could ever hope to touch while he was in it. What are you willing to give your life to, and for? If your vision is truly of God, you will 'feel' it.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...do not do your charitable deeds...to be seen...' Matthew 6:1 NKJV<br /><br /><p>God measures your giving in two ways: (a)<i> Your means;</i> how much do you have? (b)<i> Your motives;</i> why are you giving? 'Take heed that you do not do your charitable deeds before men, to be seen by them. Otherwise you have no reward from your Father in Heaven...do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, that your charitable deed may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will Himself reward you openly.' (Matthew 6:1-4 NKJV) Here are two stories that illustrate the point Jesus was making. </p>
<p>Story one: In 1977 a couple agreed to donate the three million dollars needed to build a new children's zoo in Central Park, New York. But problems arose because the 5 cm tall plaque acknowledging their gift wasn't big enough. Plus, a couple who'd donated half a million dollars thirty years earlier to build the original zoo had a bigger plaque. It was proposed that the names of the original donors be replaced by the names of the new donors. When the park commission refused, the couple withdrew their gift. Story two: It's said that Charles Spurgeon and his wife would sell, but refused to give away the eggs their chickens laid. Even close relatives were told, 'You may have them if you pay for them.' As a result the Spurgeons were misrepresented as being greedy. Only after Mrs. Spurgeon died was the full story revealed. All the profits from the sale of the eggs went to support two elderly widows. Apparently the Spurgeons were more concerned with how <i>God</i> felt about their giving, than how <i>people</i> felt.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...they saw the young child...and fell down, and worshipped him...' Matthew 2:11 NKJV<br /><br /><p>He was born in the humblest of settings, yet Heaven above was filled with the songs of angels. His birthplace was a cattle shed, yet a star brought the rich and noble from thousands of kilometres away to worship Him. His birth was contrary to the laws of life and His death was contrary to the laws of death, yet no miracle is greater than His birth, His life, His death, His resurrection and His teachings. He had no cornfields or fisheries, yet He spread a table for 5000 and had bread and fish to spare. He never stood on expensive carpeting, yet He walked on the waters and they supported Him. His crucifixion was the crime of crimes, yet from God's perspective no less a price could have made possible our redemption. When He died, few mourned His passing, yet God hung a black cape over the sun. Those who crucified Him did not tremble at what they'd done, yet the earth shook under them. Sin never touched Him. Corruption could not get hold of His body. The soil that was reddened with His blood could not claim His dust. For over three years He preached the Gospel. He wrote no book, He had no headquarters and He built no organisation. Yet two thousand years later He's the central figure of human history, the perpetual theme of all preaching, the pivot around which the ages revolve, and the only redeemer of the human race. At this season of celebration and gift-giving, let's join the wise men who '...fell down and worshipped Him...' (Matthew<b> </b>2:11 NKJV)</p>
<p>Let's remember, Christmas is about -  Christ!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Lord is close to the brokenhearted....' Psalm 34:18 NIV<br /><br /><p>When you find yourself alone at Christmas, the sights and sounds that once brought joy can reinforce your sense of sadness and loss. There is no magic, get-well-quick formula; processing what you've lost takes time and God's sustaining grace. But here are some insights to help you:</p>
<p>(1)<i> Don't assume.</i> Don't buy into the myth that everybody else is having a perfect Christmas while you struggle. The truth is, we all experience the unrealistic demands and pressures of shopping, entertaining and gift-giving. And it's worse in times of heartache. That's why we're so relieved when it's over. (2) <i>It's just one day out of 365</i>. You can handle it for twenty four hours because God has promised to give you '...strength...equal [to] your days.' (Deuteronomy 33:25 NIV) (3)<i> Take the focus off yourself.</i> Reach out. See if there's a needy family or a hurting acquaintance who'd enjoy spending an hour with you. It'll probably be the last thing you feel like doing, but it is therapeutic, restores your perspective and brings a sense of wellbeing and gratitude. (4)<i> Start some new traditions,</i> especially when old ones just make you feel worse. '...forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forward to those things which are ahead...' (Philippians 3:13 NKJV)</p>
<p>If you're feeling lonely, here's a prayer for you. 'Lord, you know my heart aches today. Your Word says You are close to the brokenhearted. Let me feel Your nearness. Become more real to me than the activity without and the emptiness within. Help me draw close to You, and in so doing make this Christmas like none I've ever known.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...that is why I was sent.' Luke 4:43 NIV <br /><br /><p>The story's told of a mother putting away the nativity set after Christmas when she noticed the Baby Jesus was missing. She asked her four-year-old if he knew where Jesus was. He replied, 'Yes, but He doesn't want me to tell anybody.' 'Why not?' she asked. 'Because He doesn't want you to put Him away with the decorations,' he said. Wisdom from the lips of a child! When you know why Jesus came, you'll celebrate Christmas every day. He said: (1)<i> '...I came to...fulfill [the law].' </i>(Matthew 5:17 NKJV) The songwriter wrote: 'The maker of the universe, as man for man, was made a curse. The claims of law that He had made, unto the uttermost, He paid.' Total coverage! Your sins of omission, commission and disposition, were all paid for at Calvary. (2)<i> '...the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve...' </i>(Matthew 20:28 NKJV): Jesus was responding to a mother's request: 'Grant...these two sons of mine may sit [on thrones] at Your right and...Your left in Your Kingdom.' (Matthew 20:21 NIV) He said, 'It's about serving, not striving!' (3)<i> '...I must preach...the Kingdom of God...'</i> (Luke 4:43 NIV)<i> </i>Each time we obey God's will instead of our own, we 'preach' to others what it's like to live as a citizen of His Kingdom. (4)<i> '...the Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost.'</i> (Luke 19:10 NIV) Imagine meeting someone you worked with or lived with, saying to you in Heaven, 'How come you never told me?' Keep these four things in mind and you'll celebrate Christmas every day of the year!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...the Lord, whom you seek, will suddenly come...' Malachi 3:1 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Sometimes God shows up dramatically: like an unexpected cheque in the mail, a door suddenly opening, or the Lord protecting you from a situation that would otherwise destroy you. (See Psalm 91:11.) Other times He shows up quietly, replacing your anxiety with assurance, whispering, 'Fear not...I am with you...' (Isaiah 41:10 NKJV) And when those around you say, 'You're different today, what's changed?' you reply, 'I don't know, I just have peace about it.' That's because, '...the Lord, whom you seek, will suddenly come...' (Malachi 3:1 NKJV) Here are two Bible stories which illustrate this: The first story demonstrates how God intervenes in situations where you are misunderstood and mistreated. 'After they had been severely flogged...About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns...Suddenly...all the prison doors flew open...' (Acts 16:23-26 NIV) Midnight prayers and songs of praise help you see beyond the problem to God, the great problem-solver. By taking the focus off yourself and putting it on Him, your whole outlook begins to change. The second story demonstrates how God intervenes when we are overwhelmed by the sheer size of the challenge. Faced with leading two million Israelites into the Promised Land, Moses prays, '...show me now Your way...' (Exodus 33:13 NKJV) And God replies, 'Here is a place by Me...I will put you in the cleft of the rock, and will cover you with My hand...' (Exodus 33:21-23 NKJV) When God tells you, 'Here is a place by Me,' get into it and stay there! Even when you can't see Him clearly, you'll feel His presence, experience His goodness, and know that everything is going to be ok.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...we become more and more like Him.' 2 Corinthians 3:18 TLB<br /><br /><p>Becoming more Christ-like doesn't mean losing your individuality and being a mindless clone. God created the characteristics that make you unique, so He certainly doesn't want to destroy them. Christ-likeness is about transforming your character, not your personality. Paul writes, '...throw off...your former way of life, which is corrupted by lust and deception... Put on your new nature, created to be like God - truly righteous and holy.' (Ephesians 4:22-24 NLT) Every time you forget that character, not comfort, is God's first priority in your life you become frustrated and wonder, 'Why is all this happening to me? Why doesn't God do something about it?' Abundant life isn't the absence of adversity, it is growth in the midst of it. 'As the Spirit of the Lord works within us, we become more and more like Him.' You say, 'Yes, but how does this happen in real life?' Through our choices - we choose to do the right thing, then trust God's Spirit to give us the power, love, faith and wisdom to do it. Since His Spirit lives inside us, these things are available for the asking. But when you ask Him and God tells you what to do, you must obey Him. When Joshua stood at the River Jordan, its floodwaters only receded <i>after</i> he stepped in. Obedience unlocks God's power! God waits for you to act on His instructions. You can't wait until you <i>feel</i> capable or confident, you must move ahead in your weakness, doing the right thing in spite of your fears. That's how you cooperate with the Holy Spirit, and how Christ-like character is developed in you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...we become more and more like Him.' 2 Corinthians 3:18 TLB<br /><br /><p>Spiritual growth could be compared to a seed, a building, and a child. Each requires our participation. When planted, seeds must be watered, fertilised and protected. When erected, buildings must be maintained. When born, children must be cared for, taught and disciplined. Getting the idea? Now, effort has nothing to do with your salvation, but it has everything to do with your spiritual growth. You can't just sit around and hope to evolve into spiritual maturity. Paul explains our three responsibilities in becoming more like Christ: </p>
<p>(1)<i> Deciding: </i>'...throw off...your former way of life, which is rotten through and through...' (Ephesians 4:22 NLT) We must decide each day to let go of our old ways. (2)<i> Renewing:</i> '...do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind...' (Romans 12:2 NKJV) The Greek word for transformed is 'metamorphosis', which describes the amazing way in which a caterpillar morphs into a butterfly. It's a picture of what happens when we spend time in prayer, feed on God's Word and allow Him to direct our thoughts. As we take on the beauty of Christ's character we begin to grow and soar to new heights. (3)<i> Clothing:</i> We must clothe ourselves each day with the character of Christ. How do you do that? By developing new habits. Your character is made up of the sum of your daily habits. What you do, you become! So, '...put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.' (Ephesians 4:24 NIV) To become Christ-like you must commit yourself to doing these three things.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...we become more and more like Him.' 2 Corinthians 3:18 TLB<br /><br /><p>To make us more Christ-like God will use His Word, other people, and difficult circumstances. God's Word provides the truth we need to know, God's people provide the support we need to grow, and difficult circumstances provide the environment we need to show Christ-likeness. If you apply God's Word, connect regularly with other believers, and learn to trust God in every situation, you will become more like Jesus. Count on it; it will happen! You say:</p>
<p>(1)<i> 'Some days I wonder if I'll ever get there.</i>' Spiritual maturity is neither automatic nor guaranteed. It's a gradual, progressive development that will require commitment and discipline. 'This will continue until we are...mature, just as Christ is...' (Ephesians 4:13 CEV) Even when you falter and fail, God will be faithful to you. He is committed to your spiritual growth as long as you are! (2)<i> 'Sometimes I wonder if I've chosen the right career.'</i> All of us have times of doubt and confusion. Don't worry about it. God's more concerned about your character than your career, because you'll take your character into eternity with you. The Bible says: 'Don't let the world around you squeeze you into its own mould, but let God re-mould your minds from within, so that you may prove in practice that the plan of God for you is good, meets all His demands and moves towards the goal of true maturity.' (Romans 12:2 PHPS) Every day you must make a decision, a counter-cultural decision to focus on becoming like Jesus. As you do, God's indwelling Spirit will empower you to carry it out.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Teach us to realise the brevity of life, so that we may grow in wisdom.' Psalm 90:12 NLT<br /><br /><p>He logged twelve-hour days, and sometimes weekends. Even when he wasn't working, he was <i>thinking</i> about work. His wife tried to slow him down. He knew they weren't as close as they once had been. He hadn't intended to drift away, it's just that she always seemed to want <i>time</i>, and that's the one thing he didn't have to give. He was vaguely aware that his kids were growing up and he was missing it. They complained about books he wasn't reading to them, games he wasn't playing with them and trips he wasn't taking with them. After a while they stopped complaining or expecting their lives might ever be different. 'I'll be more available when things settle down,' he thought. When he felt guilty he told himself, 'I'm doing it for them.' His wife asked him about going to church but he said, 'There'll be plenty of time for that sort of thing when things settle down.' His doctor told him he had elevated blood pressure and high cholesterol - but he told himself there'd be plenty of time for that when things settle down. Quietly, efficiently, irresistibly, his body was preparing to do him in. One morning his wife woke at 3 a.m. and he was not beside her. She went downstairs to drag him to bed and saw him sitting still in front of the computer, his head hanging low. She touched him but he didn't respond. When the paramedics got there they told her he had suffered a massive heart attack. Things had finally settled down! </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Who dares accuse us whom God has chosen?...' Romans 8:33 NLT<br /><br /><p>When you tear someone down, you're on thin ice with God. The Bible says: 'Who dares accuse us whom God has chosen for His own? Will God? No! He is the one who has given us right standing with Himself<b>...</b> Will Christ Jesus? No, for He is the one who died for us and was raised to life for us and is sitting...next to God, pleading for us.' (Romans 8:33-34 NLT) Your fellow-believers are not perfect, but God says they '...belong to his dear Son.' (Ephesians1:6 NLT) There's <i>nothing</i> you can bring against them that God doesn't already know. Stop and think; by discrediting them you're questioning the One who redeemed them, implying He made a mistake and doesn't know what He's doing. You say, 'But shouldn't I speak up when something is wrong?' Yes, but be careful about overstepping your bounds and condemning the <i>person.</i> Your attitude should be one of helpfulness, forgiveness and reconciliation. Anytime you try to judge what you've no authority over, you're out of your jurisdiction! Paul writes, 'Who are you to judge someone else's servant? To his own master he stands or falls. And he will stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand.' (Romans 14:4 NIV) It's God's job to judge othersand He doesn't need your help to do it!</p>

<alias><![CDATA[legalism-or-grace-2]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[ ' ...we have been made holy through the sacrifice...of Jesus Christ once for all.' Hebrews 10:10 NIV<br /><br /><p>Rigid adherence to a list of do's and don'ts appeals to our pride and self-sufficiency by fostering the myth that if we work hard enough we can earn God's favour. That's fear-based thinking, and '...God has not given us a spirit of fear...' (2 Timothy 1:7 NLT) 'There is no fear in love...fear has to do with punishment...' (1 John 4:18 NIV) Legalism is fear that God isn't big enough to forgive your sins, that unless you do the right thing in the right way at the right timeand do it perfectlyyou're in trouble. Jon Walker writes: 'When we fear making mistakes we become timid, and limit ourselves from living abundantly. We let...analysis permeate our decisions as we lead quiet, desperate, anti-faith lives, afraid to move with the bold confidence that grace gives us to walk in uncertainty...unafraid of rejection.' Speaking against works-based religion, Martin Luther said, 'Be a sinner and let your sins be strong, but let your trust in Christ be stronger...rejoice in Christ...the victor over sin.' No, Luther wasn't excusing sin! He was restoring grace to its rightful place, affirming that nothing can separate us from God's love. (Romans 8:38-39) He wasn't downgrading the law, He was upgrading grace. Grace means talking to God and listening for His voice when it would be easier to just consult the rule book. The truth is, when '...[Jesus] entered...Heaven...to appear...before God on our behalf' (Hebrews 9:24 NLT), He freed us to have a relationship with Him without fear of sin separating us.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...they...searched the Scriptures daily...' Acts 17:11 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The Devil doesn't mind you paying lip-service to God's Word as long as you don't take the time to read and study it. How long have you been <i>talking</i> about reading your Bible? When are you going to get around to doing itand applying its principles in your everyday life? Dr. Howard Hendricks writes: 'Anybody can come up with a grandiose scheme for change. One person says he wants to reach the world for Christ. Somebody else wants to study every book in the Bible over the next five years. Somebody else plans to memorise a hundred verses. Somebody else is going to become a Christ-like spouse. Wonderful! When are you going to begin? Until you answer that, all you have is good intentions. Those have about as much value as a worthless cheque. After all, what good does it do to dream of reaching the world with the Gospel if you can't share Christ with the person in the office next to you? How are you going to study the entire Bible when you don't even know what verse you're going to study tomorrow? How can you memorise a hundred verses when you've never even tried to memorise one? Rather than fantasise about a Christ-like marriage, why not start with something simple such as doing the dishes if you're a husband, or encouraging your husband if you're a wife? Too much &quot;application&quot; stays at the level of good intentions because we talk about the end of the journey without specifying <i>when, where, </i>and <i>how</i> we're going to take the first step. As someone has well said, &quot;We don't plan to fail, we fail to plan.&quot;'</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...wisdom is better than strength...' Ecclesiastes 9:16 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Are you raising a teenager? Welcome to the tough years! There's nothing wrong with you, you're just parenting an adolescent. You say, 'But they are just ten, this craziness shouldn't be happening yet!' Sorry, but now they develop faster! Puberty hits them between ten and twelve years of age, and learning how this accelerated genetic mix functions is vital to good parenting. So here are some helpful updates: </p>
<p>(1)<i> Some of your old ways aren't likely to work anymore. </i>What worked with young kids frequently fails with older ones. Do you remember when raising your voice to your seven-year-old brought instant obedience? Try that with your hormone-charged teenand get ready for battle! Teenage chemistry defies the old logic, so learn what makes them tick, pray for grace and respond based on what works, not what doesn't. If you treat teens like pre-teens you will get nowhere! (2)<i> What didn't come naturally, can be learned.</i> Those 'model parents' you heard about are either understating it, enjoying a short-term break, or they earned their stripes the hard way. It's not easy. You learn to do it well by first doing it poorly, then doing it better, then asking God to do what you can't. And He will! (3)<i> Your only unforgivable mistake is the one you won't acknowledge. </i>Your children know you're not flawless and they can handle it. They also know how big you have to be to admit it, and they're quick to forgive. So forget modelling perfection; just show them, humbly and constructively, how to handle it when they've been imperfect!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...wisdom is better than strength...' Ecclesiastes 9:16 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Parent, you influence your child more than anyone else! You say, 'But they seem to pay little or no attention to me, and lots to their friends!' Peers are very influential, and if you're dismissive or judgmental with them you'll just increase your child's negative peer pressure. Your teenager's resistance isn't necessarily saying they disagree with your opinions or think you're wrong, they're just experiencing two powerful, life-shaping, natural tendencies. <i>First</i>, for healthy social growth they need peer relations. Appearing 'cool' to friends promotes those relations, so they'll seem to downplay your influence. Don't take it personally; it's about them and their growing needs, not about you. <i>Second</i>, normal development is pushing them towards becoming more independent. When they push back it's usually more about this than about rebellion or even substantial disagreement with you. These God-designed inclinations prepare them to 'leave father and mother and become one flesh' with someone else for life. (Genesis 2:24) In fishing, 'you let out the line or risk breaking the rod and losing the catch.' Discover the natural flow of teenage development and work with, not against it! Try to redirect your teen by helping them find constructive ways to express their new autonomy and you'll help them harness it the right way. What you think or believe isn't the problem, how you handle it with them is. Remaining rational, loving, affirming, prayerful and patient invites cooperation rather than confrontation. In God's timing they'll embrace your values, beliefs and attitudes. '...when he [or she] is old, he will not depart from it.' (Proverbs 22:6 NKJV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...wisdom is better than strength...' Ecclesiastes 9:16 NKJV<br /><br /><p>If you're serious about changing your childwork on changing yourself! Trying to change others usually doesn't work anyway. Adolescents perceive such efforts as saying, 'You're not acceptable to me.' That's a perfect way to turn them into freedom-fighters whose cause becomes resisting your efforts to change them. The best way to change someone is to change how you handle them. When you change <i>your</i> steps, the entire dance routine changes because you've changed what they're responding to. If what you're doing isn't working, stop it and do something that will! You don't have to come up with the perfect solution at first. Just stopping the tired, frustrating dance of conflict will improve your environment, decrease stress and opposition, and help make way for a more effective strategy. Nagging only makes your kids ask, 'Why are you always on my back?', diverting them from the real issues. Decreasing tension, while affirming your child's value to you, increases your likelihood of success. The adolescent mind is wired differently. They're not crazy, they're just dealing with rapidly changing chemistry. There was a time when we thought that by five years of age the brain was finished changing. Were we ever wrong! We know now its most sophisticated development happens throughout adolescence. In the emerging teen brain neurons fire off spontaneously, without warning or conscious reasons, leaving your child overwhelmed by feelings they don't understand and haven't yet learned to control. So they behave irrationally, inconsistently, unpredictably, irritatingly. Your job is to try to understand this and become a calming influence. The 'craziness' will pass. In the meantime, pray: '...wisdom is better than strength...' (Ecclesiastes 9:16 NKJV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...he who is of a faithful spirit conceals a matter.' Proverbs 11:13 NKJV<br /><br /><p>We all need a shoulder to cry on. When we're battling habits and hang-ups we need a safe place to go, confident we'll be loved, understood, supported and prayed for. If those who are hurting can't find these qualities in church, <i>where</i> are they supposed to go? The betrayal of a confidence is a terrible sin. 'But what I said was true,' you object. So what? 'A talebearer reveals secrets, but he who is of a faithful spirit conceals a matter.'(Proverbs 11:13 NKJV) Note the words 'reveals' and 'conceals'. The Hippocratic Oath says: 'Whatsoever I shall see or hear in the course of my profession, I will never divulge, holding such things to be holy secrets.' That oath is taken by physicians and other professionals in positions of trust. But it ought to be binding on every one of us! How would <i>you</i> feel if your doctor, counsellor, minister or a trusted friend violated your confidence and broadcast your holy secrets? Hurt? Betrayed? The longer we live the more we realise there's a severe shortage of people who can be trusted to keep their mouths shut, and the more we value them. If you were asked to define a person of integrity, wouldn't the ability to keep a confidence be close to the top of your list? So here are some ground rules to live by: (a) Instead of talking, pray about it; (b) Instead of criticising, look for something good; (c) Instead of showing anger, show grace. <i>How you handle others determines how God will handle you!</i></p>

<introtext><![CDATA['..do not set aside...grace...' Galatians 2:21 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Imagine going to the emergency room and being asked to leave because you're bleeding all over the floor! Jesus encountered that legalistic mindset when He healed a crippled woman on the Sabbath. 'Indignant...the synagogue ruler said...&quot;There are six days for work...come and be healed on those days...&quot;' (Luke13:14 NIV) Observing the law was more important to him than the people he was supposed to care for, Max Lucado says: 'All...religions can be placed in one of two camps: legalism or grace. A legalist believes...if you look right, speak right and belong to the right group, you will be saved...The outside sparkles...but something's missing...Joy. What's there instead? Fearthat you won't do enough. Arrogancethat you've done enough. Failurethat you've made a mistake. Legalism is...slow suffocation of the spirit, amputation of one's dreams...enough religion to keep but not nourish you...Your diet is rules and standards. Legalism...doesn't need God...It's the search for innocencenot forgiveness...a systematic process of defending...explaining...exalting...justifying...[It] turns my opinion into your burden. There's only room for one opinion...and guess who's wrong? [It] turns my opinion into your boundary. Your opposing opinion makes me question not only your right to fellowship with me, but your salvation. It turns my opinion into your obligation. Christians must toe the company line. Your job isn't to think, it's to march...Salvation is God's business. Grace is his idea, his work, and his expense. He offers it to whomever he desires, when he desires. Our job is to inform...people, not screen [them].' Paul writes, 'Do not set aside...grace...for if righteousness comes through the law...Christ died in vain.' (Galatians 2:21 NKJV) Thank God 'He saved us because of His mercy...not...good deeds we did...' (Titus 3:5 NCV)</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Be kindly affectionate to one another...' Romans 12:10 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Sometimes we defend our lack of love, kindness, gentleness, patience, and all those other 'fruits of the spirit' in the name of productivity and hard work. But we can't square it with Christ's teachings. He said, '...whatever you want [others] to do to you, do also to them...' (Matthew 7:12 NKJV) When was the last time you went out of your way to help somebody, expecting nothing in return? Mother Teresa said, 'A day lived without doing something good for others is a day not worth living.' Loving people must be a way of life, a fixed attitude, a commitment we make every day. William Barclay said: 'More people have been brought into the church by the kindness of real Christian love than by all the theological arguments in the world. And more people have been driven from the church by the hardness and ugliness of so-called Christians than by all the doubts in the world.'</p>
<p>Have you ever stopped to think that all those little irritations which come your way each day, are just God giving you an opportunity to become more Christ-like? Years ago Chuck Swindoll wrote: 'What does the Lord do to help broaden my horizons and assist me in seeing how selfish I am? Very simple: He gives me four busy kids who step on toes, wrinkle clothes, spill milk, lick car windows and drop sticky candy on the carpet...being unselfish in attitude strikes at the very core of our being. It means we are willing to forego our own comfort, our own preferences, our own schedule, our own desires for another's benefit. And that brings us back to Christ.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[you should follow His steps. 1 Peter 2:21 NKJV<br /><br /><p><i>Jesus knew He didn</i><i>t have to prove Himself.</i> At the cross, sceptics said, If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross. (Matthew 27:40 NKJV) His reaction? He refused to let their comments intimidate Him or alter His plans. He didnt need their approval; He already had His Fathers: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. (Matthew 3:17 KJV) <i>Jesus didn</i><i>t waste time answering His critics. </i>Jesus made no reply, not even to a single chargeto the great amazement of the governor. (Matthew 27:14 NIV) Jesus responded to hunger, to need, to seekers, but not to people trying to trap Him. You owe nothing to a critic. Do not speak in the hearing of a fool, for he will despise the wisdom of your words. (Proverbs 23:9 NKJV) Do you know why theres never been a monument built to a critic? Because critics are spectators, not players! <i>Jesus didn</i><i>t focus on the past, but the future.</i> His mother was pregnant with Him before she was married. Only a few people knew the truth. Jesus grew up with this, yet He didnt feel the need to explain it. Stop complaining that your family was poor, or talking about your limited education, or repeating stories of those who failed you, or advertising your pain, or meditating on your flaws. All of us are challenged in some way. Do not remember the former things, nor consider the things of old. Behold, I will do a new thing (Isaiah 43:18-19 NKJV) Satan discusses our yesterdays; apparently thats the only information he has about us. Jesus discusses our tomorrows. So if you want to follow in His footsteps, focus on whats ahead.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[a good wifeis worth more than rubies. Proverbs 31:10 NCV<br /><br /><p>Do you have <i>any</i> idea how hard your wife works to be a good mother? Imagine this: six dads are dropped on a desert island with one car and three kids each for six weeks. Each child will play two sports and take music or dance lessons. Theres no fast food, and every man has to correct homework, help with science projects, cook meals, do laundry, budget for groceries, pay the bills without enough money, know the birthdays of friends and relatives and send cards. In addition, he has to take each kid for haircuts and to doctor and dentist appointments, bake cakes for school functions, plant flowers and keep his home presentable at all times. He can only watch TV after the kids are in bed and his chores are done, and then he must have enough energy to be intimate with his spouse at a moments notice. He should be well-groomed, go to church at least once a week, read to his kids, pray with them every night, pack their lunches and favourite snacks, fix breakfast, make sure theyre dressed and on the school bus by 8.00 am. At the end of six weeks every guy will be tested on his childs height, weight, shoe size, favourite colour, song, drink, toy and their biggest fear. And heres the best partthe winner gets to play the game over and over again for the next eighteen to twenty-one years! So, do you still think you want to change places with your wife? The Bible says: the husband must give his wife the same sort of love that Christ gave to the Church, when He sacrificed himself for her (Ephesians 5:25 PHPS) because a good wife is worth more than rubies. (Proverbs 31:10 NCV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['You will keep him in perfect peace...' Isaiah 26:3 NKJV<br /><br /><p>We lose our peace of mind for four reasons: (1)<i> We try to change the people in our lives.</i> As you grow wiser you begin to realise that you can't change other people, only God can! And He does, when you back off, and love them as they are. This doesn't mean agreeing with everything they do. It means committing to love them regardless, claiming God's promises on their behalf and allowing Him to deal with them His way, in His time and for His glory. The reason you're stressed out may be because you keep trying to do somethingabout something you can't do anything about! (2)<i> We try to make things happen when it's not the right time.</i> 'There is a time for everything...' (Ecclesiastes 3:1 NIV) If you've raised children you know that one of their chief characteristics is impatience; they can't wait for anything. God wants us to outgrow our childishness so He makes us wait, trust, and mature! (3)<i> We get upset because we're not progressing fast enough.</i> You can slow down your spiritual growth through neglect, but ultimately, '...We all...are being changed...[by] the Spirit.' (2 Corinthians 3:18 NCV) So learn to enjoy your life while God works on your problems, for you'll always have problems! (4)<i> We push ourselves harder and harder.</i> We do what we think God wants without consulting Him as to what He actually wants, when He wants it, or how He wants it done. As a result we wear ourselves out. What's the solution? 'You will keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is [focused] on You, because he trusts in You.' (Isaiah 26:3 NKJV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...the Lord has kept me alive...' Joshua 14:10 NKJV<br /><br /><p>At the ripe old age of eighty-five, Caleb said to Joshua, '...the Lord has kept me alive...just as my strength was then, so now is my strength for war...give me this mountain of which the Lord spoke in that day...And Joshua blessed him, and gave Hebron to Caleb...because he wholly followed the Lord...' (Joshua 14:10-14 NKJV) There was nothing half-baked or half-hearted about Caleb. His dream kept him alive; he got out of bed every morning intent on pursuing it. When God gives you a dream as big as a mountain, it will keep you going while others around you are giving up. But be careful who you listen to. Don't let the critics discourage you by saying, 'You're too old.' The Bible says that like a palm tree, you can produce your greatest harvest of fruit in your final years (Psalm 92:12-14). When the sun goes down the stars come outso you can shine brightest in the closing chapters of your life. Barbara Klassen says: 'My great-great uncle lived to one hundred and six. He was healthy and spry and took joy in chauffeuring his less able-bodied senior friends around town. On his hundredth birthday his driver's licence came up for renewal. When he went to the licensing bureau a sceptical clerk said, 'You're a hundred years old! What do you need a driver's licence for?' My uncle, completely nonplussed, replied, '<i>Somebody</i> has to drive the old folks around!' He continued to have a legal driver's licence for the next five years.' Do it Caleb's way: live right up to the moment you die! </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...My servant Caleb...has a different spirit in him...' Numbers 14:24 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Caleb said to Moses, '...&quot;Let us go up at once and take possession [of the Promised Land] for we are well able...&quot; But the men...with him...gave...a bad report...saying...&quot;There we saw the giants...and we were like grasshoppers in our own sight...&quot;' (Numbers 13:30-33 NKJV) Notice two attitudes at work in this story: (1)<i> An attitude of doubt.</i> Ten of twelve spies came back saying, 'It can't be done!' But the majority isn't necessarily right. If God promises you something, it's yours, even if you're in the minority. The majority report terrified God's people; they got spiritual amnesia; they forgot all about God's supernatural provision. They talked themselves into believing that Egypt was actually the land of milk and honey. '...you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness...' (Numbers16:13 NKJV) Incredible! Egypt was a land of straw and slavery, not milk and honey. What was their problem? They allowed their surroundings to influence them more than God's promises. When that happens you dry up spiritually, begin to grumble and say stuff like, 'God may have worked miracles in the past, but He doesn't do it anymore.' As a result of their unbelief, not one of them entered the Promised Land except Joshua and Caleb. (2)<i> An attitude of faith.</i> God said, 'But My servant Caleb, because he has a different spirit in him and has followed Me fully, I will bring into the land...and his descendants shall inherit it.' (Numbers 14:24~NKJV) So, which attitude do you have?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...earnest prayer...produces wonderful results.' James 5:16 NLT<br /><br /><p>In the Old Testament Abraham journeyed south. When he reached Gerar we read that he '...said of his wife Sarah, &quot;She is my sister.&quot; Then Abimelech king of Gerar sent for Sarah and took her.' (Genesis 20:2 NIV) Can you imagine how Sarah felt, trapped and alone in the palace, contemplating what lay ahead at the hands of her captor? And what's worse, her husband, the man she trusted with her life, let it happen! We're not privy to how Sarah prayed that night. But she must have touched the heart of God because He '...came to Abimelech in a dream...and said...&quot;the woman you have taken...is...married...return the man's wife...and you will live...if...not...you...will die.&quot;' (Genesis 20:3-7 NIV) God's directives are always clear; there's never any ambivalence about what He says. 'The king's heart is in the hand of the Lord; He directs it...wherever He pleases.' (Proverbs 21:1 NIV) That means authority figures who don't even know you exist, have to stop and listen when God speaks, because to Him '...one man is not different from another.' (Romans 2:11 AMP) So what can you do when you're helpless to change a situation you didn't create? Or when someone you loved and trusted lets you down? Pray! Instead of giving in to bitterness or fear, cry out to God. He will hear you like He heard Sarah. How can you be sure? Because His Word says, 'The earnest prayer of a righteous person has great power and produces wonderful results.' No matter how bad things may look right now, and they looked pretty bad for Sarah that night, your prayers carry weight with God.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Look to the Lord and His strength; seek His face always.' 1 Chronicles 16:11 NIV<br /><br /><p>To help you remember the four parts of prayer, think of the acrostic P-R-A-Y:</p>
<p>P - Praise the Lord! Not sure how? Think you'll run out of words? Not if you use the Scriptures. David gives us a beautiful example in 1 Chronicles 29:11-13. It's one you can use: 'Yours, O Lord, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the majesty and the splendour...Yours, O Lord, is the Kingdom...In Your hands are strength and power to exalt and give strength to all. Now, our God, we give You thanks, and praise Your glorious name.'</p>
<p>R - Repent of your sins! Just as heat forces impurities to the surface so the metal refiner can remove them, your prayer time will reveal attitudes that must be changed, habits that must be broken, and barriers to blessing that must be removed. It's not enough to tell God about your sins. He already knows them. You must ask Him to help you turn away from them. This is true repentance.</p>
<p>A - Ask for yourself and others! Your prayers invite God into the situation, and your faith activates His power to change it. There's no distance in prayer, no culture or language barrier it can't overcome. It's like throwing on a power switchthings begin to move when we pray. Jesus said, 'I will give you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven...whatever doors you open on earth shall be open in Heaven.' (Matt 16:19 TLB)</p>
<p>Y - Yield yourself to God's will! Declaring the Lordship of Jesus Christ in your life is like signing your name to your autobiography, and inviting Him to write your life's story. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['A spiritual gift is given to each of us...' 1 Corinthians 12:7 NLT<br /><br /><p>One of the great benefits of finding and fulfilling your life's calling is that it settles the question of what constitutes true success. Many of us have a faulty definition. We've bought into the idea that success is measured by how well we docompared to how well others do. That's a recipe for frustration! No matter what you do, someone else will always do it better. But when you define success in terms of <i>God's</i> purpose for your life, the standard changes completely. True success is not what you've done compared to what others have done, but what you've done compared to what God assigned you to do: 'A spiritual gift is given to each of us as a means of helping the entire church.' (1 Corinthians 12:7 NLT) Jesus said He was successful because He accomplished the work His Father had sent Him to do (John 17:4). Paul could say at the end of his life, '...I have finished my course...' (2 Timothy 4:7 KJV) By this standard, success may mean leaving a lucrative job to follow God's call. It may mean using your talents for His glory, instead of chasing fame and fortune. Whatever it is, once you know you're in your calling you can stop comparing yourself to others or wishing you were someone else. The Bible says we are each given gifts '...for the common good.' (1 Corinthians 12:7 NAS) Only when you're using your gifts to bless others will you experience true satisfaction. Pay cheques and promotions are good, but they can't take the place of divine purpose. Only in your calling will you experience lasting joy.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['He must manage his own family well...' 1 Timothy 3:4 NIV<br /><br /><p>Balancing family and career calls for tough, unselfish choices. If you make the right ones you'll look back with joy, not regret. John Ortberg writes: 'A friend of mine is a professional musician. For many years he made his living on the road. He was becoming increasingly successful. Then three years ago he became a father. He was on the road about half the time. He realised that when his daughter was about a year old she hardly knew him. He knew he needed to make a change but it was frightening to him. What if his career slowed to a crawl? What if being home more actually made life harder? He took a job as the head of a music department at a university. He still performs, but he travels now only a fraction of the time. His relationship with his daughter has become a source of pride and joy in his life that he otherwise never would have known. He did have to let go of some of his old dreams, but he has since recorded a bestselling CD and been nominated for a Grammy. Most importantly, he realises his daughter will grow up a fundamentally different human being now, than she would have if she had grown up with a hole in her heart where her father was supposed to be. By the end of his life he will have a title that means much more to him than Rock Star. The title is &quot;Dad!&quot;' The Bible says a leader '...must manage his own family well...' (1 Timothy 3:4 NIV) And that doesn't just apply to leaders, it applies to <i>all</i> of us!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...the leader should be like a servant.' Luke 22:26 NLT<br /><br /><p>Michael Bruner writes about how, as a brash young college student, he attended a lecture by a former US Attorney General. He says: 'Afterwards I approached him to see if we could meet for coffee. To his associates' shock, he said, &quot;How about tomorrow&quot;...We met and talked for an hour...I peppered him with questions. What famous people had he met? What was it like to be Attorney General in the 60s? When I asked him who was the greatest person he'd ever met, he said, &quot;I don't think of people in those terms.&quot; He went on to tell me something I'll never forget. &quot;Don't ever seek to be the greatest. Seek instead to do great things. If you aspire to greatness, your greatness will die with you. But if you aspire to do great things, your legacy will live on. The only way to do this is by being a servant. Lead by serving and you'll do great things.&quot; I was too young in the faith to know he'd taken those words from Scripture...Jesus was the embodiment of servant leadership. He didn't just tell the disciples what they should do, He did it along with them...As I left the hotel that morning and waited to cross the street, a blind man with a seeing-eye dog came up alongside me. I stared at the beautiful Lab...his senses alert, his sole purpose in life to serve his...master. Then the light turned green and gently the dog led [him] across the street...God had sent me a living parable. I learned a lesson that morning I would never forget. Pursue great things, not greatness; lead by serving.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...clothe yourselves...with the beauty that comes from within...' 1 Peter 3:4 NLT<br /><br /><p>When it comes to beauty, get your perspective right: 'Don't be concerned about the outward beauty of fancy hairstyles, expensive jewellery, or beautiful clothes...clothe yourselves...with the beauty that comes from within...' (1 Peter 3:3-4 NLT)</p>
<p>It's said the public relations department of a beauty products company asked its customers to send pictures along with brief letters, describing the most beautiful women they knew. Thousands of letters came in. One caught the attention of the employees and was passed on to the president. It was written by a boy from a broken home who lived in a run-down neighbourhood. With lots of spelling errors, an excerpt from his letter read: 'A beautiful woman lives down the street from me. I visit her every day. She makes me feel like the most important kid in the world. We play checkers and she listens to my problems. She understands me. When I leave she always yells out the door that she's proud of me.' The boy ended his letter saying, 'This picture shows you that she is the most beautiful woman in the world, and one day I hope to have a wife as pretty as her.' Intrigued, the president asked to see the woman's picture. His secretary handed him a photograph of a smiling, toothless woman, well advanced in years, sitting in a wheelchair. Sparse grey hair was pulled back in a bun. The wrinkles that formed deep furrows on her face were somehow diminished by the twinkle in her eyes. 'We can't use this woman,' said the president, smiling. 'She would show the world that our products aren't necessary to be beautiful.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.' Genesis 12:3 NKJV<br /><br /><p>In order to bless all the families of the earth, Abraham had to start with his own family. Before a man could qualify for leadership in the New Testament church, they examined his home life (1 Timothy 3:5). Their thinking was, 'If he doesn't succeed there, don't enlarge his territory.' But if you're going to enjoy God's blessing as a family you must learn to cope with difficulties. So: (1)<i> Try to remember that you're all on the same team. </i>Don't take your frustrations out on your loved ones. Too often, home is where we go when we're tired of being 'nice'. (2)<i> Before you speak, get the facts.</i> Nothing's more damaging than jumping to conclusions. 'Those who control their tongue will have a long life; opening your mouth can ruin everything.' (Proverbs 13:3 NLT) (3)<i> Handle it with wisdom. </i>List all your options and you'll be more objective. That's how you'd handle a problem at work; why not do the same with your family? (4)<i> Find something good in the situation.</i> 'And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God...' (Romans 8:28 NKJV) No matter how bad things seem, every situation holds something positivelook for it. (5)<i> Make sure they know you love them. </i>It's okay to express how you feel so long as you do it graciously. But make sure your family knows you love them. When people feel loved they can weather almost any crisis. Think: when do <i>you</i> need God's love most? When you deserve it least! Try to follow suit.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...that Satan might not outwit us...' 2 Corinthians 2:11 NIV<br /><br /><p>Addressing a worldwide convention of demons, Satan told them: 'As long as Christians stay close to God we've no power over them, so: (1) Keep them busy with non-essentials. (2) Tempt them to overspend and go into debt. (3) Make them work long hours to maintain empty lifestyles. (4) Discourage them from spending family time, for when homes disintegrate there's no refuge from work. (5) Overstimulate their minds with television and computers so that they can't hear God speaking to them. (6) Fill their coffee tables and nightstands with newspapers and magazines so they've no time for Bible reading. (7) Flood their letter boxes with sweepstakes, promotions and get-rich-quick schemes; keep them chasing material things. (8) Put glamorous models on TV and on magazine covers to keep them focused on outward appearances; that way they'll be dissatisfied with themselves and their mates. (9) Make sure couples are too exhausted for physical intimacy; that way they'll be tempted to look elsewhere. (10) Emphasise Santa and the Easter Bunny; that way you'll divert them from the real meaning of Christmas and Easter. (11) Involve them in 'good' causes so they won't have any time for 'eternal' ones. (12) Make them self-sufficient. Keep them so busy working in their own strength that they'll never know the joy of God's power working through them. Do these twelve things faithfully. I promiseit'll work!' Have you figured out the difference between being busy and being successful in what God's called you to do? Sometimes being B-U-S-Y just means <i>Being Under Satan's Yoke!</i></p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...God has arranged the parts...just as He wanted them...' 1 Corinthians 12:18 NIV<br /><br /><p>Ever tried to complete a jigsaw puzzle with a piece missing? It changes the end result, doesn't it? In the church God is building today, everyone has a place. Paul writes, '...the whole building...fitted together, is growing...' (Ephesians 2:21 NAS) A bundle of sticks is stronger than a single twig. So, '...in Christ we...form one body, and each member belongs to all the others.' (Romans 12:5 NIV) A non-serving Christian is a contradiction in terms. In Nehemiah's day, it was the farmers of Tekoa who helped repair the wall, '...but their nobles would not put their shoulders to the work.' (Nehemiah 3:5 NRS) Bricklaying wasn't part of their job description, so they let others do the heavy lifting. We all know people who subscribe to <i>that</i> philosophy! Never underestimate the significance of your assignment. '...parts...that seem...least important are...the most necessary.' (1 Corinthians 12:22 NLT) Think about who's more important: a world leader or a sanitation worker. When Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981, although he was the leader of the free world, it was 'business as usual' for the nation. Conversely, when Philadelphia refuse collectors went on strike the city descended into chaos as piles of rotting refuse built up everywhere. The point is, you don't have to be a seminary graduate to pray and read the Bible, or a prophet to hear from God, or a specialist to minister to hurting people. To do great things for God, be faithful in little ones (Luke 16:10). Until you are willing to serve time on the assembly line, God can't promote you to management!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['How good...when [people] live together in unity.' Psalm 133:1 NIV<br /><br /><p>Synergy is when the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. And creating positive synergy means having the right people, in the right place, at the right time, focusing on the right goal. After World War II, Chester Nimitz, Chief of US Naval Operations, wanted to keep alive public interest in naval aviation. As a result the <i>Blue Angels Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron</i> was created and performed its first exhibition within the year. To this day the team has clear objectives. They select only qualified candidates who consistently operate at peak performance. After being carefully screened, a pilot must receive sixteen votes from the existing members. If one votes no, the candidate is out of the running. No reasons or explanations requiredthat's the level of trust and respect the members have for one another's judgment. As a Blue Angel your teammates become like your family, and when a new member is enlisted you're entrusting him with your life. Making the squad isn't a one-shot deal either. You're responsible for playing your part, demonstrating your value and pursuing excellence on a daily basis. You have to earn the right to wear the crest. Nothing short of total commitment is accepted. So, would you qualify to be a Blue Angel? Are you a sole-trader or a team player? Are you loyal and reliable? When the chips are down, can others rely on you to put their interests ahead of your own?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...They...recognised them as men who had been with Jesus.' Acts 4:13 NLT<br /><br /><p>Luann Prater says: 'I got a company-logo licence plate...now everybody can see who I work for. I was excited and proudtill somebody cut me off in traffic and I realised I can't react now without considering the impression it'll leave! If you had to wear &quot;God's seal on your forehead&quot; (Revelation 9:4) would you be nicer to the store clerk, the grumpy boss, the bratty kid? If the world could see at a glance who you are, would it alter your behaviour?...When you're filled with the Holy Spirit it's as evident as having a nameplate saying you belong to Christ...I've gotten used to the nameplate now...I think before I react...consider the consequences...It no longer makes me anxious...afraid I'll discredit my company. Now people see me coming and wave...Who's reading <i>your</i> nameplate? Can they tell you've &quot;been with Jesus?&quot;' Jesus laid it out clearly: 'This is to My Father's glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be My disciples.' (John 15:8 NIV) If somebody were to videotape your life, would it show you're a loving husband or wife, a good parent, a conscientious worker and a joy to be around? Author Lysa TerKeurst says: 'Let's just be honest, it's tough being a sold out soul for Christ stuck in a flesh-filled body...I must allow...His teaching to seep into my heart and mind...ask Him to interrupt my natural flesh response with truths He taught me...So if my husband forgets to do something, or my kids punch my buttons, or somebody cuts me off in traffic...causing my flesh to rear up...I can say, &quot;Not my will God, but yours be done.&quot;'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Whoever wants to be a leader...must be your servant.' Matthew 20:26 NLT<br /><br /><p>Mac Anderson says: 'Like every human being, I have doubts, fears and disappointments... As leaders, however, we must manage our attitude...we can't underestimate the influence of our actions and attitudes. Churchill said, &quot;The price of leadership is responsibility...to stay positive whether you feel like it or not.&quot; A good leader launches out before success is certain...doesn't run from confrontation...talks about his own mistakes before anybody else's, and acknowledges them before others have to discover and reveal them. He looks for opportunities to find his teammates doing something right, and encourages the smallest improvement. He doesn't tolerate murmuring in himself or in others...is specific in his expectations...values accountability...does what's right instead of what's popular or convenient.' What does the word 'servant' bring to your mind? The guy who works behind the scenes? The personal assistant who makes you look good? The mate who worked so you could complete your degree? Charles Stanley says: 'Godly servants are all around us, but, sadly, we frequently take them for granted. This is a tragedy we need to correctnot only for their sakes but for our own. Their faithful service brings untold blessings... Wherever Joseph went, the people he served were blessed. Potiphar wasn't a God-fearing man, yet he prospered because of Joseph. Find the people in your life who have the gift of godly service and spend time with them...When you turn your nose up at someone doing &quot;servant's work&quot; you cut yourself off from a relationship that could literally change your life.' Each of us has the potential to be greatnot famous, but great, because greatness comes by serving!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...work together with the same purpose...' 1 Corinthians 3:8 NLT<br /><br /><p>Church growth consultant Jim Wideman highlights some things you can do to help those looking to you for direction: (1)<i> Put their goals and needs first.</i> You're a part, not the whole enchilada. Think about how your actions affect others. Be observant of the challenges and setbacks they're experiencing, and find ways to lighten their load even if they don't ask. (2)<i> Help others to win. </i>Let others take a slam-dunk while you take an assist. Keep the ball moving till someone has a chance to score. Adopt the motto, 'It doesn't matter who gets the credit.' Be willing to accept blame and reluctant to assign it. Maintain an authentic desire to share victories. 'A kingdom divided by civil war will collapse' (Mark 3:24 NLT); you can't sink someone else's end of the boat and keep your own afloat. (3)<i> Over-communicate. </i>Keep everyone in the loop, spend time with your peers, invest in your teammates, and admit when you need help. Be open to correction and advice. Leadership coach Rick Tate said, 'Feedback is the breakfast of champions,' and a good communicator is a good listener. (4)<i> Don't take things personally.</i> Leadership, by definition, is about 'others'. When you start thinking it's all about 'you', you lose perspective. (5)<i> Give it all you've got.</i> Paul, Timothy's mentor, said to him: 'Do your best... [be] a worker who has no need to be ashamed...' (2 Timothy 2:15 NRS) Good leaders empower others. Henry Mintzberg said: '...the best managing of all may well be silent. That way people can say, &quot;We did it ourselves.&quot;'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife...' Ruth 4:13 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Look at the instructions Naomi gave Ruth for approaching Boaz, her future husband, and you'll see that there's a certain protocol involved in walking with God. Once you understand it, the things you've been waiting for begin to happen. So:</p>
<p>(1)<i> Be sure it's God's will for you.</i> Ruth wasn't looking for just any man, she had a specific one in mind. And because Naomi had done her homework, she was able to tell Ruth where to find him: '...he is winnowing barley tonight at the threshing floor.' (Ruth 3:2 NKJV) Research what you want from God before you start claiming things in prayer. Be sure it's what He wants too! If your name's not on it, don't pursue it. Don't go after something because it looks good in someone else's life. God has a plan for youone that's unique and specific. Seek Him and He will reveal it to you. (2)<i> Deal with your past. </i>Naomi said to Ruth, '...wash yourself...' (Ruth 3:3 NKJV) In order to gain acceptance with Boaz, Ruth couldn't approach him looking and smelling like Moab, the famine-stricken place she'd come from. She needed to settle her past so it didn't sabotage her future. God will open the door for you, but until you've resolved your old issues you won't be able to walk through it. You can't receive what He has for you now if you're still contaminated by what you went through then. Whether it takes six months or six years, sort out your emotional baggage. God says: 'Forget the former things...I am doing a new thing...I am making a way...' (Isaiah 43:18-19 NIV) </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife...' Ruth 4:13 NKJV<br /><br /><p>In order to prepare Ruth for meeting Boaz, her future husband, Naomi taught her two important principles about succeeding in life: </p>
<p>(1)<i> You must have the right attitude. </i>Naomi said to Ruth, '...anoint yourself...' (Ruth 3:3 NKJV) In Bible times people anointed themselves with oil in order to be refreshed and renewed. So Ruth was, in essence, adopting the right attitude. If you're praying for a good job or a suitable partner or about an outcome in a particular area but it hasn't happened yet, don't automatically blame Satancheck your attitude. 'Let God re-mould your minds from within so that you [move]...towards true maturity.' (Romans 12:2 PHPS) To get the right result, you need the right approach. (2)<i> You must be willing to stand out in the crowd. </i>Naomi instructed Ruth, '...put on your best garment...' (Ruth 3:3 NKJV) But why get dressed up for something that hasn't happened yet? Because you need to be prepared! When your time comes you must be ready. Ruth's story teaches us that it's those who are willing to stand out in the crowd who get noticed. Any time you dress for where you're going, there's a good chance you'll look out of place where you are. That's okay. Your highest priority should be God's approval, not man's. You must know you have a definite destination, otherwise you'll be tempted to make excuses and try to explain why you're so different from everyone else. When you know where God is taking you, you won't care. The truth is, when others look at your preparation they should be in no doubt as to your destination. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife.' Ruth 4:13 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Observe two more things Naomi taught Ruth, in preparation for meeting Boaz:</p>
<p>(1)<i> Make sure you're in the right place.</i> Naomi told Ruth, 'Go down to the threshing floor.' (Ruth 3:3 NKJV) Why? Because that's where Boaz was! To receive what God has for you, you must be in the right place spiritually. Satan will tell you you're unworthy. He will try to convince you to stay where you are and to listen to those who'd keep you from where God wants you to be. He will make you feel out of place even when you're in the right place. Don't believe his lies; when God calls you He equips you, empowers you, and uses you for His glory. (2)<i> Understand the importance of timing.</i> 'Do not make yourself known to the man until...' (Ruth 3:3 NKJV) Ruth had waited a long time for this moment; now she had to learn to be quiet because the person God planned to bless her through was sleeping. It's hard to be all keyed up about something nobody else is excited about; you want to get them excited too. But sometimes God says, 'Wait.' Stop working to make things happen before their time! Don't try to promote yourself. 'The vision is yet for an appointed time...Though it tarries, wait for it; because it will surely come.' (Habakkuk 2:3 NKJV) God may not respond when you think He should, but His timing is perfect. He has blessings with your name on them, and no matter how many others want them, when the time is right He will give them to you.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...let us run with endurance the race that is set before us...' Hebrews 12:1 NKJV<br /><br /><p>In Greece there's a place tourists seldom visit. The writer of Hebrews may have had it in mind when he wrote, '...lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares us, and...run with endurance...' (Hebrews 12:1 NJKV) It's where the Isthmian Games, a forerunner to the modern Olympics, were held: a place where athletes were hailed as heroes. To develop muscle they trained with weights strapped to their legs, but on the day of the race they stripped off anything that wasn't essential. There's a lesson here. We think what we're clinging to is important. If we didn't, letting go wouldn't be a struggle; we'd simply set it down. </p>
<p>The Christian life is a race that starts the day you accept Christ and ends when you meet Him face-to-face. In order to cross the finish line as a winner you must eliminate: (1)<i> Anything that slows you down.</i> In other words, anything that hinders your spiritual progress. In and of itself, it may not be wrong, but it becomes a 'weight' when it stops you from living for God to the fullest. (2)<i> Anything that causes you to stumble short of the finish line.</i> You must constantly monitor the level of your commitment to Christ, the growth of your faith, your home life, your relationships, your integrity, your work ethic, your thought life and your habits. Make up your mind to stay focused on the prize. Greek athletes who won received a garland that eventually withered, but '...you will receive the crown of glory that will never fade...' (1 Peter 5:4 NIV) Isn't that worth running the race for?</p>

<alias><![CDATA[two-thoughts-about-elisha]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...that your fruit should remain...' John 15:16 NKJV<br /><br /><p><i>Elisha served others until he died.</i> We read: 'Elisha had become sick with the illness of which he would die. Then Joash the king of Israel came down to him [for advice].' (2 Kings 13:14 NKJV) On his deathbed, Elisha gave the king a strategy for defeating his enemies. So, you can lift others even when you yourself are down. You can feel like a hypocrite because things aren't so great in your own life, yet still minister to them. The truth is, when you reach out in love to someone else it takes the focus off you, your discouragement lifts, and it works for your good. <i>Elisha's impact continued after he died.</i> One day '...Elijah said to Elisha, &quot;...what can I do for you...?&quot; [He replied] &quot;Let me inherit a double portion of your spirit&quot;...' (2 Kings 2:9 NIV) Elijah, his mentor, performed seven major miracles recorded in Scripture. When he died, Elisha had performed only thirteen. Did God fail to grant his request? No. 'Then Elisha died, and they buried him. And the raiding bands from Moab invaded the land...So it was, as they were burying a man, that suddenly they spied a band of raiders; and they put the man in the tomb of Elisha; and when the man was let down and touched the bones of Elisha, he revived and stood on his feet.' (2 Kings 13:20-21 NKJV) Miracle fourteen; Elisha got his double portion! Jesus said, '...I chose...you that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain...' (John 15:16 NKJV) So pray, 'Lord, give me a legacy of righteousness. Make my impact greater than my lifespan. Give me fruit that remains.'</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...I have played the fool...' 1 Samuel 26:21 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Your obituary says a lot about you. Towards the end of his life, King Saul said, '...I have played the fool...' (1 Samuel 26:21 NKJV) Israel's first king was destined for greatness till he decided to do things his own way instead of God's way. When the Philistines attacked Israel he tried to rally his troops, who were immobilised by fear. He knew he should wait for the prophet Samuel to come and offer a burnt sacrifice as required by the law. But he said, 'I'll just do it myself. Under the circumstances, God won't mind.' That one act of disobedience ended his career. He died by committing suicide on the battlefield; a life filled with promise, ended in disgrace. You play the fool by: (1)<i> Disregarding God in little things.</i> Saul's fall didn't happen overnight. Little sins morph into big ones. Thinking, 'It's no big deal,' Saul took matters into his own hands. He said, '...I felt compelled to offer the burnt offering myself...' (1 Samuel 13:12 NLT) Note the words, 'I felt.' It can feel so right, yet be so wrong. Only trust your feelings when they line up with God's Word. (2)<i> Trying to justify your behaviour.</i> Saul rationalised, '...I saw my men scattering...you didn't arrive when you said...the Philistines are...ready for battle.' (1 Samuel 13:11 NLT) Stop rationalising, repent, and obey God! (3)<i> Letting resentment control you.</i> Though he had the makings of a great leader, when David started to gain popularity, Saul's resentment ended up destroying him. Most people learn from their own mistakes; wise people learn from other people's! Learn from Saul; don't play the fool.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...in honour giving preference to one another.' Romans 12:10 NKJV<br /><br /><p>It's said that William Gladstone and Benjamin Disraeli were great leaders but intense rivals. Gladstone, leader of the Liberal Party, is considered by many to personify the best qualities of Victorian England. A career public servant, he was a great orator, master of finance, and a staunchly moral man. He was made Prime Minister of Great Britain four different times, the only person in history to achieve that honour. Under his leadership Great Britain established a national education system, instituted parliamentary reform and saw the vote given to a significant number of people in the working classes. Disraeli, who served twice as Prime Minister, had a different kind of background. In his thirties he entered politics and built a reputation as a diplomat and social reformer. His greatest accomplishment was masterminding Britain's purchase of the Suez Canal. Both men accomplished much. <i>But what really separated them was their approach to people!</i> The difference can be best illustrated by a story told by a young woman who dined with each of the two rival statesmen on consecutive nights. When asked for her impression of them, she said, 'When I left the dining room after sitting next to Mr. Gladstone, I thought he was the cleverest man in England. But after sitting next to Mr. Disraeli, I thought I was the cleverest woman in England.' There's an important lesson here. Good leaders win the confidence, trust and friendship of people they lead by taking the spotlight off themselves and putting it on others. In fact, this principle will work for <i>anybody.</i> It's why the Bible says, '...in honour giving preference to one another.' (Romans 12:10 NKJV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The lips of the godly speak helpful words...' Proverbs 10:32 NLT<br /><br /><p>A World War II poster reads, 'Careless words cost lives'. So when you hear something negative about someone, ask yourself four questions. First, is it true? 'You shall not bear false witness against your neighbour.' (Exodus 20:16 NKJV) That's one of the Ten <i>Commandments</i>, not the ten <i>suggestions</i>! Until you're certain it's true, say nothing. Wait; time always reveals the truth. Secondly, is it confidential? Did you hear it as a result of someone else's having broken a confidence? If you speak it, will you be contributing to the violation of a confidence? Remember, 'Whoever goes about slandering reveals secrets, but he who is trustworthy in spirit keeps a thing covered.' (Proverbs 11:13 ESV) Your usefulness to God requires that you don't sacrifice your integrity by betraying trust. Thirdly, is it helpful? Will it tear others down or build them up? Satan is devoted to pulling down, discouraging and defeating; don't be his accomplice. 'Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen.' (Ephesians 4:29 NIV) Will it be beneficial and encouraging to those who hear it? Finally, is it necessary? Stop and ask yourself, 'What do others and the cause of Christ gain by my saying it, or lose by my not saying it?' Always keep this in mind: you're more likely to regret the things you said than the things you didn't. 'A fool vents all his feelings, but a wise man holds them back.' (Proverbs 29:11 NKJV) Be wise; be careful what you say.</p>

When Nabal refused to feed King David and his soldiers, David's anger almost drove him to murder. Only Abigail, Nabal's wife, saved David from the destructive potential of his own unchecked emotions. Looking back, David told Abigail, 'Blessed is your advice...because you have kept me this day from coming to bloodshed.' (1 Samuel 25:33 NKJV) Our anger is often rooted in pride. Naaman the leper felt insulted when Elisha told him to dip seven times in the Jordan River. '...Naaman became furious, and went away and said, Indeed, I said to myself, He will surely come out to me, and stand and call on the name of the Lord his God, and wave his hand over the place, and heal the leprosy.' (2 Kings 5:11 NKJV) The <i>Arizona Republic, </i>a US newspaper, reported that when Steve Tran of Westminster, California, closed the door on 25 activated bug bombs, he thought he had seen the last of the cockroaches that shared his apartment. But when the spray reached the pilot light of the stove, it ignited, blasting his screen door across the street, breaking all his windows and setting his furniture ablaze. 'I wanted to kill all of them,' he said. 'I thought if I used a lot more, it would last longer.' According to the label, just two canisters of the pesticide would have solved Tran's roach problem. The blast caused over $10000 damage to the apartment building. And the cockroaches? Tran reported, 'By Sunday, I saw them walking around.' Yes, 'A quick-tempered man acts foolishly.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...You will...be led...with peace...' Isaiah 55:12 NAS<br /><br /><p>Have you ever felt 'checked' in your spirit when you were about to do something? Chances are, God is trying to get your attention. His promise is, '...I will make you wise... show you where to go...and watch over you.' (Psalm 32:8 NCV) A Christian couple were buying their first home. When it came time to sign the papers the wife said, 'I couldn't shake the feeling of uneasiness. My husband had the same sick feeling in his stomach, so we decided not to go forward... A few months later my husband died in an accident. I wouldn't have been able to make the payments and support a new baby and myself... Our lack of peace was the Holy Spirit calling time out...' We don't know the future, God does, and He directs our steps by the way of peace, or lack of it. The Holy Spirit acts like a referee. When the players stay within the boundaries, they're free to move about. But when there's trouble, or the ball goes out of bounds, the referee blows the whistle, stops play and restores order. The absence of peace can mean 'the heavenly referee' has blown the whistle. Sometimes the ball gets kicked out of bounds by unexpected adversity; at other times we step out of bounds by giving way to temptation and sin. If we're smart, when we hear the whistle we'll wait for God to restore our peace.</p>
<p>The Bible says, '...You will...be led...with peace...' Does that mean you'll always feel certain about your decision? No, but the right decision will be accompanied by a sense of God's peace.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let your eyes look straight ahead...' Proverbs 4:25 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Behind every success story you'll find sacrifices made to fulfil a dream, principles that govern lives in public and in private, the ability to turn a single victory into a system of success, and finally a relentless quest for personal growth. One Bible teacher writes, 'As a boy I loved to watch the older men play draughts. One day one of them invited me to play. At first it looked easy. I captured one, then another of his draughts. Then suddenly he took one draught and hopped across the board yelling, King me! With that king he proceeded to wipe me off the board. That day I learned about long-range vision. Nobody minds losing a few draughts as long as they're headed for king territory!'</p>
<p>What sustained Moses in the wilderness? His vision! '...He persevered because he saw Him who is invisible.' (Hebrews 11:27 NIV) A God-given vision will keep you going when nothing else will. The Bible says, 'Let your eyes look straight ahead... Ponder the path of your feet... Do not turn to the right or the left...' (Proverbs 4:25-27 NKJV) What do you see in your future? You'll never seize it until you see it! So, write down your vision and the reason you want to fulfil it, and what you're willing to go through to make it happen. Then write down every challenge you can think of that you'll have to overcome in order to pursue it. Do that, and you'll be prepared for much of what comes your way. The difference between winners and losers is in how they view failure. Losers see failure; winners see beyond it!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['What I feared has come upon me...' Job 3:25 NIV<br /><br /><p>Nick was a tough guy with a bad outlook. He worked on the railways. One night after all his fellow workers had gone home he accidentally locked himself in a refrigerated carriage. Worried that the temperature was below freezing, he yelled for help, but to no avail. The more he thought about his situation the colder he felt, until eventually he started shivering uncontrollably. Convinced he was dying, he wrote a letter to his family outlining what had happened. The next morning they found Nick's body. An autopsy revealed that he had indeed frozen to death. But the investigators discovered something puzzling. The carriage in which Nick was trapped was out of order and had been disconnected. The night he froze to death the temperature in the boxcar was 16.1 degrees, just below room temperature. But because he expected to die, he lost the battle in his mind.</p>
<p>What you believe about your life is more important than what anyone else believes. Job said, 'What I feared has come upon me.' Be careful what you anticipate; negative expectations become self-fulfilling prophecies. God has promised to help you, but you get the deciding vote. By focusing on the negative you're agreeing to let Satan defeat you. Jesus said, 'According to your faith will it be done for you.' (Matthew 9:29 NIV) Another translation puts it like this: 'Let it happen...just as you believe...' (GNT) So get into agreement with God's Word and focus on His promises instead of your problems. When you do, your faith will take you to new levels of victory. But it's up to you to take the first step!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He is able to accomplish infinitely more than we would ever dare to ask or hope...' Ephesians 3:20 NLT<br /><br /><p>It's said that the king of Saudi Arabia once invited a famous golfer over for a tournament. Before the man returned home the king said, 'I'd like to give you a gift. Anything you want; name it.' The golfer declined politely, saying he didn't need anything. But the king was adamant, so he conceded, 'Well, Your Highness, I collect golf clubs.' He imagined perhaps a gold putter or a diamond-studded driver. Imagine his shock weeks later when he got a letter containing the deed to an 800-hectare golf club! Paul says, 'God...is able to accomplish infinitely more than we would ever dare to ask or hope...' Kings don't think like we do, and when you serve the King of Kings that's doubly true! God's plan for you is far beyond anything you could envision for yourself. The Psalmist said the Lord had dealt 'bountifully' with him. (Psalm 13:6 NKJV) God values the smallest effort-it's small-mindedness He objects to! If you truly believe He is directing your steps and that goodness and mercy follow you all the days of your life, then you can expect great things from God. Barbara Johnson says, 'Anticipate the best!' Remember, '...Faith is being sure of what...we do not see.' (Hebrews 11:1 NIV) So even when you can't 'see' it, trust God to work on your behalf, to arrange for you to be in the right place at the right time, and for others to go out of their way to help you-and watch God work.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...He [will] command his children...after him...' Genesis 18:19 NKJV<br /><br /><p>At a Promise Keepers' conference in Texas, James Ryle told this story. When he was two years old his father was sent to prison. When he was seven, authorities placed him in an orphanage. At 19, he was in a car crash that killed a friend. He sold drugs to raise money for his legal fees and was arrested, charged with a criminal offence and sent to prison. While in prison James accepted Christ. After he served his time he eventually went into the ministry. Years later he sought out his father to reconcile with him. Their conversation turned to prison life. James' father asked, 'Which prison were you in?' When James told him, his father said, 'I helped build that prison.' He'd been a welder who went from place to place building penitentiaries. Looking at that audience of men, Ryle said, 'I was in the prison my father built.' Your children may not always heed your advice, but they'll never escape your influence. Any time a child spends the first 18 to 21 years of their life with you, they'll probably pick up some of your bad habits, have memories of you that may not all be happy ones, but good or bad, you will have left them a legacy. God said of Abraham, '...I have known him... he [will] command his children...[to] keep the way of the Lord...' Can God say that about you? Philip the evangelist won the city of Samaria to Christ, but he has an even greater claim to fame. He had '...four virgin daughters who prophesied.' (Acts 21:9 NKJV) His children made it morally and spiritually. So, how are your children doing?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Because you say so, I will...' Luke 5:5 NIV<br /><br /><p>Ever notice how much energy it takes to keep a tight grip on something? Come on, you know what you're holding on to, don't you? You're in turmoil because you can't control the people or circumstances in your life. Hey, release your grip. Go ahead: surrender it to God. You'll be amazed at how much more energy you'll have, and how much easier life will be. Once you make the choice to surrender it to God, your hardest days become your easiest.</p>
<p>AW Tozer wrote: 'Father... my coward heart fears to give up its toys. I cannot part with them without inward bleeding, and I do not try to hide from [You] my terror of the parting. I come trembling, but I do come. Please root from my heart those things which I have cherished so long and which have become a very part of my living self, so that [You may] enter and dwell there without a rival.'</p>
<p>You say, 'Surrender what?' (1) Your position! Place it all before your God. Find your security, your identity and your contentment in Him. (2) Your plans! Plan wisely, but be ready for God to rearrange things and take you along paths that may be uncomfortable for you. Nothing this side of Heaven is permanent, including relationships. Enjoy the time you have with your loved ones, but avoid the temptation to cling. (3) Your anxiety! If your emotions are wrapped around some issue involving a possession, a job, a particular expectation or a relationship, you aren't fully relying on God. No, you're still clinging to lesser things. Stop. Let it go! You're delaying the surprise God has waiting for you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies...' Psalm 23:5 NKJV<br /><br /><p>If you are going through a difficult time right now, read these words: 'You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; You anoint my head with oil; my cup runs over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life...' (Psalm 23. 5-6 NKJV). Underline the word 'surely'. It's God's guarantee! When does God cause your cup to overflow with blessing? When does He empower you to overcome? When does He demonstrate His goodness and mercy? In the presence of your enemies! The odds and the opposition can't stop God from blessing you. 'But I'm really struggling,' you say. Struggle is proof that you haven't been conquered, that you refuse to surrender, that victory is still possible, and that you're growing. As long as you keep walking with God and trusting Him, He will work on your behalf. He will send His Spirit to guide you, His Word to illuminate your mind, and friends to strengthen you in your time of struggle. If you're teachable, you're reachable. Keep your heart open, keep listening to God, keep obeying Him and you will see that your problem is just a platform for Him to 'show Himself strong on your behalf.' (2 Chronicles 16:9 NKJV) You'll also discover that His strength comes when you're at your weakest point (2 Corinthians 12:7-9). Finally, you'll be able to thank God for your enemies, because He's promised to bless you right there in front of them. People and circumstances don't decide your future, God does - so look to Him!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...As...Peter was standing by the fire...' John 18:25 NLT<br /><br /><p>John records, '...the servants and officials stood around a fire... Peter also was standing with them... he was asked, You are not one of his disciples, are you? He denied it, saying, I am not.' (John 18:18, 25 NIV) Earlier that day Peter had drawn his sword in order to defend Jesus; now he's denying Him. Has that ever happened to you? Under pressure you falter. Now what do you do? <i>Dismiss it</i>: 'Everybody slips; it's no big deal.' <i>it</i>: 'Fall? Are you joking? Not me!' <i>Distort it</i>: 'Don't blame me; it was their fault!' But there's another option-<i>to deal with it honestly</i>. Frederick the Great is said to have visited Potsdam Prison, where every prisoner claimed to be innocent. Only one said, 'I'm guilty; I deserve my punishment.' When the emperor heard this he told the warden, 'Quickly, release him before he corrupts all these other innocent men!' The Bible says, 'Nothing in all creation is hidden from God. Everything is naked and exposed before His eyes, and He is the one to whom we are accountable.' (Hebrews 4:13 NLT) Confession isn't just telling God what you've done, He already knows. It's agreeing that it's wrong and asking forgiveness. God can't heal what you won't reveal or cleanse what you won't confess. </p>
<p>That night Peter faced his first of two fires: a fire made by men before the crucifixion; the second fire he faced was made by the Master after His resurrection. At the first fire Peter denied Jesus; at the second fire He acknowledged Him as Lord. But in between, Peter had two life-changing experiences: his tears and Christ's cross. When your tears of repentance meet Christ's forgiveness, you lose your guilt and find new joy!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let us examine our ways and test them...' Lamentations 3:40 NIV<br /><br /><p>One child complains about the other: 'Mummy, he hit me!' She's convinced it's her brother's fault, that he ought to be punished, that she should have Mum's sympathy and be absolved of all responsibility. But her brother is equally certain: 'She started it. She took my toy.' We grow older, but not always wiser! It 'just happened', we say, then proceed to blame people and circumstances. We dance to the tune but we don't want to pay the piper, so we complain about our consequences, saying it wasn't our fault. This is not the way God does business, and it doesn't work. 'Why should any living man complain when punished for his sins?' (Lamentations 3:39 NIV) What works with God is this: First, acknowledge your wrong behaviour. Someone else may have initiated it, but your part in it is your responsibility. Plus, complaining offends God. '...The people complained...in the hearing of the Lord, and...His anger was aroused.' (Numbers 11:1 NIV) Leave other people's sin to God and deal with your own. Secondly, look at your behaviours: 'Let us examine our ways...' Look beyond this specific event to how you typically act in similar situations. Learn from it, so you can change! Thirdly, determine whether your ways really work: 'Let us...test them...' Analyse, observe and judge how well your 'ways' have actually worked-or not! Finally, if they don't work, change them; '...Let us return to the Lord.' (Lamentations 3:40 NIV) Repeating wrong behaviours guarantees continued failure. Returning to doing things God's way, brings the end of frustration and the beginning of joy and fulfilment! </p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...After these things...God tested Abraham...' Genesis 22:1 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The life of Abraham teaches you several things. First, you can walk with God, yet not know the details of your destiny: '...And he went out, not knowing where he was going.' (Hebrews 11:8 NKJV) Secondly, when God makes you a promise, the timeline is up to Him. Abraham waited 20 years for Isaac to be born and fulfil the promise, 'I will make you a great nation...' (Genesis 12:2 NKJV) Thirdly, sometimes you'll get it wrong before you get it right. Tired of waiting, Abraham fathered Ishmael. If he'd just waited, Isaac would have been born on God's schedule. Often your greatest mistakes come from impatience. Finally, it teaches that you can have faith in one area, yet experience fear in another. When Abraham got to Gerar, King Abimelech took a fancy to his wife Sarah. Thinking only of himself, 'Abraham said...She is my sister. And Abimelech... took Sarah.' (Genesis 20:2 NKJV) We all have our 'Gerar moments', times when we cave in to fear, self-interest or other people's demands. Were it not for God's grace we'd all be disqualified! Next we read, '...After these things...God tested Abraham, and said...Take now your son...whom you love...and offer him...as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.' (Genesis 22:1-2 NKJV) Notice the words, 'After these things'. The tests you've been through begin to make sense when you face your biggest test. When you pass it, like Abraham, you can call God 'Jehovah Jireh', which means 'The-Lord-Will-Provide' (Genesis 22:14 NKJV). And at that point God will say, 'Now you've arrived at a place where I can use you!'</p>

<alias><![CDATA[surrender-1]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Because you say so, I will...' Luke 5:5 NIV<br /><br /><p>Until we accept and cooperate with the law of gravity, we can't fly. Until we accept and cooperate with the law of economics, we can't succeed in business. Getting the idea? Surrendering to God is not weakness, it's wisdom. Only a fool resists God, because it's a fight we can't win. It's in surrendering to Him that we are empowered to succeed in what He's called us to do. Surrender is demonstrated by obedience. It's saying, 'Yes, Lord,' to whatever He asks. To say, 'No, Lord,' is a contradiction. How can we call Jesus 'Lord', and refuse to obey Him? (Luke 6:46) </p>
<p>Peter demonstrated true surrender when Jesus told him to try again. '...Master, we have toiled all night and caught nothing; nevertheless at Your word I will let down the net. And when they had done this, they caught a great number of fish...' (Luke 5:5-6 NKJV) Surrendered people obey God even when it doesn't seem to make sense. Abraham followed God without knowing where it would take him. Hannah waited on God's timing without knowing when. Mary expected a miracle without knowing how. Joseph trusted God's plan without knowing why circumstances happened as they did. Each was fully surrendered to God, and they came out on top. 'How will I know I'm fully surrendered?' we ask. When we rely on God to work things out instead of trying to manipulate others, force our own agenda or control the situation. We don't have to be in charge, we simply let go and let God have His way.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Because you say so, I will...' Luke 5:5 NIV<br /><br /><p>When we start to do things God's way instead of our own, we experience three great benefits. First, we have peace: 'Submit to God, and you will have peace; then things will go well for you.' (Job 22:21 NLT) Secondly, we have freedom: '...I will live in freedom, because I...follow your orders.' (Psalm 119:45 NCV) Thirdly, we have power: '...submit to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you.' (James 4:7 NKJV) Stubborn temptations and overwhelming problems are defeated by Christ the moment we surrender. As Joshua approached the walls of Jericho he encountered God, fell down and worshipped, surrendered his plans and said, 'What does my Lord say to His servant?' (Joshua 5:14 NKJV) Joshua's surrender led to a spectacular victory. Here's a paradox: victory comes through surrender! Surrender doesn't weaken us, it strengthens us. Surrendered to God, we don't have to fear surrendering to anything else. William Booth, founder of the Salvation Army, said, 'The greatness of a man's power is the measure of his surrender.' Eventually everybody surrenders to something. If not to God, we'll surrender to the opinions and expectations of others, to money, to resentment, to fear, to our own lusts or ego. We're free to choose whatever we surrender to, but we're not free from the consequences of that choice. E. Stanley Jones said, 'If you don't surrender to Christ, you surrender to chaos.' The supreme example is Jesus. The night before His crucifixion He surrendered to God's plan, saying, 'I want your will, not mine.' And He is our example!</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...Let...patience...do a thorough work...' James 1:4 AMP<br /><br /><p>Larry Moyer tells the story of a prison warden who asked a man on death row what he would like to eat for his last meal. He said, 'A huge piece of watermelon.' The warden said, 'You must be joking! This is December. Watermelons haven't even been planted, let alone harvested.' The inmate replied, 'That's ok, I don't mind waiting.' So here's the question: do you mind waiting? How do you act when things don't move fast enough for you? Graciously, or not so graciously? A well-known minister writes, 'I happened to be in a store and had waited a long time in a slow-moving line to pay for one little item. The people in front of me had stacks of items. Then I was overlooked while somebody else was served ahead of me. When it was finally my turn, the sales assistant looked at me and said, Thank you for waiting. Are you who I think you are... that preacher on TV? I knew the minute you walked in that it was you. I thought to myself, What if I'd been angry and mouthing off because I wasn't served in the proper order? Impatient behaviour can adversely affect our witness.' When you view life's irritations through God's eyes, it changes how you feel about situations that are testing your patience. You begin to see them as friends, not enemies. You realise that God permits them to help mature you. So, '...Let...patience have full play and do a thorough work, so that you may be...perfectly...developed [with no defects], lacking in nothing.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...encourage the fainthearted, help the weak...' 1 Thessalonians 5:14 NAS<br /><br /><p>A mouse looked out through a crack in a farmhouse wall and was distraught to discover a mousetrap. When he went to tell his buddies, the chicken said, 'Sorry, pal, not my problem.' The pig said, 'I'll pray for you.' The cow was busy and said, 'Come back later.' Dejected, the mouse was left alone to handle his problem. That night, a poisonous snake got caught in the mousetrap and when the farmer's wife went to investigate she got bitten. She developed a raging fever, and everyone knows you treat a fever with chicken soup. So the farmer took his axe to the barn for the main ingredient! As his wife's condition deteriorated and neighbours gathered, he had to butcher the pig to feed them. Finally she died. So many people came to the funeral that he ended up slaughtering the cow to make dinner for them all. In the end, everybody lost!</p>
<p>The Bible says, '...encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with everyone.' It only takes one thing to be an encourager: a willingness to '...bear the weaknesses of those without strength and not just please ourselves.' (Romans 15:1 NAS) Before deciding somebody else's problem has nothing to do with you, read this: '...If one member suffers, all the members suffer...' (1 Corinthians 12:26 NKJV) You can't sit on the sidelines while someone's hurting; tomorrow it may be you! We are told to 'Share each other's burdens...' (Galatians 6:2 NLT) When one of us is threatened we're all at risk. Our lives are woven together for a reason; each of us is a vital thread in another person's tapestry.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...the Lord...has pleasure in [our] prosperity.' Psalm 35:27 NKJV<br /><br />
<p>God delights in seeing His children succeed; what good parent wouldn't? Jesus said, 'If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!' (Matthew 7:11 NKJV)</p>
<p>David wanted to build the temple, but God chose his son Solomon instead. Sometimes our desires differ from God's, so we need to consult Him before we make a move. Usually God reveals His plan one step at a time. If your desire for something persists, it's an indication that God is leading you. So look for the signs, listen to the Holy Spirit, prayerfully evaluate everything, cultivate an instant response to God, reject all feedback that breeds doubt, ask God for wisdom and expect it. And don't be selective about who you're willing to receive wisdom from. After all, God once spoke through a donkey and changed history. The Bible says, '...Ask...God, and He will give it to you.' (James 1:5 NLT) Wisdom is the ability to see and interpret things through God's eyes. What an advantage! The Psalmist says, 'The entrance of Your words gives...understanding...' (Psalm 119:130 NKJV) When God saves you, He renews your mind because that's the drawing-board for your future. Mind management should be one of your top priorities: '...Whatsoever things are...good...think on these things.' (Philippians 4:8 KJV) Don't justify failure another day; refuse to stay bogged down; stop placing blame on others. Instead circle today's date on your calendar and declare that the best days of your life are beginning-right now!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['These commandments... Impress them on your children.' Deuteronomy 6:6-7 NIV<br /><br /><p>Teach your children the value of hard work. <i>Navigators</i>' president, Lorne Sanny, would smile as he remembered four words from his father that changed his life, 'Son, get with it!' Parents who think that they are doing their kids a favour by letting them avoid hard work are deluded. Your children will become irresponsible, dependent, under-developed and end up resenting your over-indulgence. 'Lazy hands make a man poor, but diligent hands bring wealth. He who gathers crops in summer is a wise son, but he who sleeps during harvest is a disgraceful son.' (Proverbs 10:4-5 NIV) If you keep doing for your child what they should do for themselves, you're crippling their development and creativity. Honest work is God's provision for human happiness, as well as for personal, social and spiritual growth. This is more than a financial issue; it's a spiritual issue. Hard work is good for you! 'The soul of the sluggard craves and gets nothing, but the soul of the diligent is made fat.' (Proverbs 13:4 NAS) One day your child will thank you for requiring them to participate in family life and do their fair share. Their future husband or wife will thank you too! You say, 'But they're so young and they've school work to do.' If they master the three Rs, but fail to become responsible and mature they'll pay for it in the future. 'It is good for a man that he should bear the yoke (of responsibility and work) in his youth.' (Lamentations 3:27 NAS) What they learn in youth they'll enjoy for the rest of their lives, as they become men and women of God!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...that you may know that you have eternal life...' 1 John 5:13 NKJV<br /><br /><p>When ten-year-old Mary's mother died, she became 'mother of the house', caring for her father who worked the night shift at a local mine. One evening as she was packing his lunch she slipped a Gospel booklet inside, hoping he'd find comfort after the loss of his wife. Suddenly at 1am an emergency whistle sounded, telling the town's people that miners had been caught in a collapsed mine. Emergency workers worked through the night and finally broke through to a small cavern where they found the miners. Sadly, it was too late. All eight men had suffocated, including Mary's father. The rescuers were devastated. As they surveyed the scene they noticed that the men had died seated in a circle. Looking closer, they discovered that Mary's father was sitting with a small booklet in his lap, open to the last page where the plan of salvation was explained. On that page he had written a special message to her: 'My dear Mary, by the time you find this I'll be with your mother. I read your little book several times to the others while we waited to be rescued. Our hope is fading for this life-but not for the next. We did as the book told us and prayed. I love you, and one day we'll all be together in Heaven.' Are you going to Heaven? Do you know for sure? You can. 'These things I have written...that you may know that you have eternal life.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Why are we sitting here until we die?' 2 Kings 7:3 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The armies of Syria had besieged Samaria and the people were dying of starvation. Four lepers, whose disease forced them to live outside the city walls, had got used to living on scraps of bread people threw over the wall each day. But now no more scraps were coming their way. So they said to themselves, 'Why are we sitting here until we die?' So they took action. '...They rose at twilight to go to the camp of the Syrians... to their surprise no one was there. For the Lord had caused...the Syrians to hear...the noise of a great army... Therefore they arose and fled...and left...their tents, their horses, and their donkeys... These lepers...went into one tent and ate and drank, and carried from it silver and gold and clothing... Then they said to one another, We are not doing right. This day is a day of good news, and we remain silent... let us go and tell the king's household.' (2 Kings 7:5-9 NKJV) This story teaches us three important truths. First, that crisis becomes our friend when it moves us to take action. Only when we're sick and tired of being sick and tired, will things begin to change for the better. Secondly, that-once we take a step of faith-God will move on our behalf. The only thing that can limit Him is our doubt, our stubbornness and our complacency. His Word says, '...Therefore the Lord will wait, that He may be gracious to you...' (Isaiah 30:18 NKJV) Finally, it teaches us that when God blesses us, we can't keep it to ourselves. Others need what God has given us, and we must get it to them-on time.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Noah found favour with the Lord.' Genesis 6:8 NLT<br /><br /><p>If you want to enjoy God's blessing, observe two things about the life of Noah. First, he honoured God. 'By faith Noah, being warned by God concerning events as yet unseen, took heed and constructed an ark for the saving of his household.' (Hebrews 11:7 RSV) Noah had never seen rain, nor had anyone else. He lived more than 100 km from the nearest ocean. Even if he could learn to build a ship, how would he get it to water? And how about rounding up all those animals? For over 100 years he was a laughing-stock. But because he honoured God, he came out on top. Secondly, Noah obeyed God. '...Noah did everything exactly as God had commanded him.' (Genesis 6:22 NLT) Understanding can wait; obedience can't. Instant obedience will teach you more about God than a lifetime of Bible discussions. In fact, there are many of God's commandments you won't understand until you first obey them. When Noah emerged from the ark after the flood, God said to him, '...Be fruitful and increase...I now give you everything.' (Genesis 9:1-3 NIV) With God, your reward will always be greater than your obedience. Sometimes we try partial obedience: 'I'll attend church but I won't give sacrificially. I'll read my Bible but I won't forgive the person who hurt me.' Partial obedience is disobedience! The Bible says, '...A person is justified by what he does and not by faith alone.' (James 2:24 NIV) Why is obedience so important? Because Jesus said, 'If you love me, [you will] obey my commandments.' (John 14:15 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Noah found favour with the Lord.' Genesis 6:8 NLT<br /><br /><p>Do you think that the only time God is pleased with you is when you're doing things such as reading the Bible, attending church, praying, giving, or sharing your faith? No, He enjoys every detail of your life, whether you are working, playing, resting or eating. He doesn't miss a thing: 'The Lord directs the steps of the godly. He delights in every detail of their lives.' (Psalm 37:23 NLT) Every human activity except sin can be done for God's pleasure if you do it in faith and with an attitude of gratitude. You can sell cars, wash dishes, practise medicine, teach children, write a computer program or raise a family for the glory of God. Like a proud parent, God enjoys watching you use the abilities He's given you for His glory. After the flood God told Noah, '...Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the earth... Everything that lives and moves will be food for you. Just as I gave you the green plants, I now give you everything.' (Genesis 9:1-3 NIV) God told Noah, 'It's time to get on with your life! Do the things I designed you to do. Marry. Have children. Plant crops. Eat meals. Excel in business. Be the best you can be.' In the Academy-Award-winning movie <i>Chariots of Fire</i>, Eric Liddell said, 'I believe God made me for a purpose, but I also believe he made me fast, and when I run I feel His pleasure.' There are no unspiritual abilities, just misused ones. The Bible says, '...The Lord was pleased with Noah.' (Genesis 6:8 CEV) So start using your energies and talents for God's pleasure.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...the Lord...has pleasure in [our] prosperity.' Psalm 35:27 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Ignatius Loyola prayed, 'Teach us, Lord, to serve you as you deserve, to give and not count the cost, to fight and not heed the wounds, to toil and not seek for rest, to labour and not ask for any reward save that of knowing we do your will.' Success is knowing and doing God's will for your life. Here are four laws that govern it. First, be clear about the cost. For everything you gain, you give up something. How much are you willing to sacrifice for your dream? Your answer will determine your future. Sometimes the greatest obstacle to tomorrow's success is today's success. Paul writes, '...do not bring sorrow to God's Holy Spirit by the way you live...' (Ephesians 4:30 NLT) Secondly, focus like a laser. Chart a detailed course and establish deadlines. List the things you need to do each day, set regular checkpoints, and when necessary be accountable to someone. '...Walk...making the most of your time...' (Ephesians 5:15-16 NAS) Thirdly, see yourself achieving it. Maureen Dowd says, 'The minute you settle for less... you get even less than you settled for.' The Bible says that God '...calls those things which do not exist as though they did.' (Romans 4:17 NKJV) So start to think now like the person you expect to be then! Finally, keep learning<i>.</i> Look for opportunities to learn. Paul told Timothy, '...Give attention to reading...' (1 Timothy 4:13 NKJV) The person who won't read is more to be pitied than the person who can't read. Meditate constantly on God's laws and you will succeed in whatever you do (Joshua 1:8).</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...if anything is excellent or praiseworthy-think about such things.' Philippians 4:8 NIV<br /><br /><p>You do not have more problems than other people-you just think about them more often! Stop: go back and reread that sentence. Take a moment and consider what it means. It is what you think about that produces how you feel. If you do not believe that, try getting angry without first having angry thoughts, or getting sad without first having sad thoughts. You cannot do it, can you? To experience a feeling you must first have the thought that produces it. That is life-changing information; it is knowledge the devil doesn't want you to have. If you change how you think you will change how you feel! Nothing can hold your negative feelings in place other than your own thinking. The truth is, it is your thinking that is negative not your life! Once you understand that you can get back on the path to happiness again. </p>
<p>But change takes time. You did not become negative overnight and you won't become positive overnight. But you can start. How? By doing two things: First, by treating your negative thoughts in the same way you treat flies at a picnic-shoo them away and replace them with thoughts that are 'excellent and praiseworthy'. You have that choice! Secondly, by thinking about God's goodness. David did: 'Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits: Who forgives all your iniquities; who heals all your diseases; who redeems your life from destruction; who crowns you with lovingkindness and tender mercies.' (Psalm 103:2-4 NKJV) So, if you are serious about changing your life, start changing how you think!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['These commandments... Impress them on your children.' Deuteronomy 6:6-7 NIV<br /><br /><p>A great preacher once said, 'When times are troubled we cry, God, give us men to match our mountains. In reply, God gives us children and says, Here's the building material.' We are expected to nurture them so they develop into men and women of God. Here's a Bible blueprint. First, 'These commandments that I give you today are to be upon your hearts'. Parent, if you don't practise Scriptural principles, your children won't either. Indeed, if you don't live what you preach your words will fall on deaf ears and create rebellious hearts. You don't have to be perfect, but you must be genuine. Secondly, 'Impress them on your children'. You must emphasise, stress, prompt, make clear, drum in and imprint. Nothing passing or passive there! It's to be a deliberate, thorough, active and repeated process. Thirdly, 'Talk about them'. Your kids won't catch the truth by osmosis. You have to talk, not in religious-sounding tones they don't understand, but in natural language, in natural ways, at natural times. 'Talk about them when you sit at home', in the comfort of familiar surroundings. 'When you walk along the road', in the easy give-and-take environment on the way to the park or to school. 'When you lie down and when you get up', watching for opportunities, because teachable moments come and go unannounced. <i>Carpe diem!</i> Parents who 'seize the day' discover that God has equipped them to mould their children into men and women of God. </p>

<introtext><![CDATA['These commandments... Impress them on your children.' Deuteronomy 6:6-7 NIV<br /><br /><p>Teach your child the importance of standing up for what's right. Our children gravitate towards whatever pleases the important people in their lives-right or wrong-out of their need for acceptance. If their peers are doing it, peer approval will be a powerful influence on them. It's not always about good kids versus bad, or about morality versus immorality-it's about being kids! Solomon, recalling his own youthful tendencies, counselled, 'My son, if sinners entice you, do not give in to them. If they say, Come along with us...do not go along with them...' (Proverbs 1:10-15 NIV) We become like the company we keep, and if our kids are to stand for God against destructive influences they need instruction in several areas. First, the qualities of true friendship. Teach them that true friends seek each other's best interests, and whoever leads them into danger or sin is not a friend. Secondly, the inevitable law of consequences. '...A man reaps what he sows. The one who sows to please his sinful nature...will reap destruction; the one who sows to please the Spirit...will reap eternal life.' (Galatians 6:7-8 NIV) And reinforce your teaching by refusing to rescue them from their consequences. Finally, the right kind of heroes. Instead of rock stars or sports celebrities of questionable character, introduce your children to Bible heroes who modelled godliness, righteousness and courage under pressure!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['These commandments... Impress them on your children.' Deuteronomy 6:6-7 NIV<br /><br /><p>Teach your children to respond the right way to God's direction and correction. Help them to understand that God's correction is not rejection. 'My son, do not despise the Lord's discipline and do not resent His rebuke, because the Lord disciplines those He loves, as a father the son he delights in.' (Proverbs 3:11-12 NIV) To help them understand this, first teach them to respond correctly to your discipline. The rules you don't enforce now will be enforced by others later, at a higher cost. But let your discipline be fair, not excessive. And be consistent. Don't permit today what you punished yesterday. Saying things like, 'How many times have I told you?' or, 'If you do that again you're grounded' means you're not serious and that they have several warnings before you act. Enforce it! Don't threaten unless you intend to follow through. Secondly, teach them to respond correctly to authority figures. 'Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established...' (Romans 13:1 NIV) Don't belittle police, teachers, head teachers, pastors, and so on. If you do, it will come back to bite you and your children. Thirdly, share your own experiences of personal growth through correction. Let them know you're not perfect; it will help them relate to your humanity as a parent and it'll give them hope. 'If Mum and Dad learned by being corrected when they blew it, I can too.' Well-chosen times of personal sharing are much more effective than nagging and 'sermonising'!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['These commandments... Impress them on your children.' Deuteronomy 6:6-7 NIV<br /><br /><p>Teach your children to handle temptation. Tell them to expect it and not be overwhelmed by how often they face it. '...Every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.' (James 1:14 KJV) Your children need to know how to handle two powerful sources of temptation. First, temptation in the area of sexual sin. Television and the internet make everything from normal to perverse as available as oxygen, enticing them to experiment with behaviours that destroy health, relationships and life. And they need more than a brief, embarrassed 'birds and bees' talk. Instruct them early, regularly and clearly. 'My son...the lips of an adulteress drip honey...but in the end she is bitter as gall... her steps lead straight to the grave... Keep...far from her... At the end of your life you will groan, when your flesh and body are spent.' (Proverbs 5:1-11 NIV) Solomon spelled it out for his children. Do likewise. Secondly, temptation in the area of addictions. Again Solomon is right on the mark: '...Who has strife? Who has complaints? Who has needless bruises? Who has bloodshot eyes? Those who linger over wine...' (Proverbs 23:29-30 NIV) The addict's life is not fun! 'In the end it bites like a snake... Your eyes will see strange sights and your mind imagine confusing things' (v. 32-33 NIV) Don't let the enemy deceive your children. Pray faithfully, speak His life-changing Word into their hearts, believe God and watch Him work!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['These commandments... Impress them on your children.' Deuteronomy 6:6-7 NIV<br /><br /><p>Teach your children to handle money. Your home is a classroom for teaching money-management skills, so teach them that if they honour God financially, He will honour them. 'Honour the Lord with your wealth, with the firstfruits of all... then your barns  will be filled...' (Proverbs 3:9-10 NIV) Before you give your son or daughter money, teach them how to handle it responsibly so that they can avoid the 'prodigal syndrome' (Luke 15:11-32). The Prodigal Son's attitude towards money and his misuse of it cost him dearly. Give your child Biblical wisdom in four areas-earning, giving, spending and saving. Teach your children God's Word regarding borrowing, lending and credit. In a culture driven by slick advertising and easily obtained, high-interest credit cards, children need to understand the consequences of their financial decisions. The verse 'Train up a child in the way he should go, even when he is old he will not depart from it' (Proverbs 22:6 NAS) is not an isolated statement. Read the next verse: 'The rich rules over the poor, and the borrower becomes the lender's slave.' (Proverbs 22:7 NAS) Teach them that what looks like the fast lane to plenty, can become the sure road to poverty. Train them to delay gratification until they can afford what they want. Don't unwisely guarantee loans for them. The Bible says, 'Do not be a man who...puts up security for debts... your very bed will be snatched from under you.' (Proverbs 22:26-27 NIV)</p>

<alias><![CDATA[the-importance-of-sound-doctrine]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...teach...sound doctrine.' Titus 2:1 NIV<br /><br /><p>Today 'sound doctrine' is being replaced by 'feel good theology,' and we should be concerned! Pilots fly by fixed laws. Surgeons operate by fixed protocols. Aren't you glad <i>they</i> think doctrine is important? The story's told of a psychology student in the army who was given kitchen duty. He decided to test the response of different groups of soldiers to apricots. First he took the negative approach: 'You don't want apricots, do you?' Ninety percent said no. Then he tried the positive approach: 'You do want apricots, don't you?' Over half said yes. With a third group he tried the either/or technique: 'Would you like one dish of apricots or two?' In spite of the fact that most of them didn't like apricots, forty percent took two dishes and fifty percent took one dish. Be careful; when you have no fixed belief system of your own, you'll fall for somebody else's. Paul instructed Timothy: 'Preach the Word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage - with great patience and careful instruction. For the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear. They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths.' (2 Timothy 4:2-4 NIV) When your feelings won't sustain you, sound doctrine will, for one rests on emotion and the other rests on the eternal Word of God.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...I will praise You more and more.' Psalm 71:14 NLT<br /><br /><p>Don't limit yourself to worshipping God in church. Be like the Psalmist: 'I will bless the Lord at <i>all</i> times...' (Psalm 34:1 NKJV) When you don't feel like praising God but you do it because you want to please Him, that's called '...the sacrifice of praise...' (Hebrews 13:15 NKJV) And when praise becomes a lifestyle it has a domino effect (that's where one change causes another, which in turn causes another). When you tell God how wonderful He is, how much you love Him and want to spend time with Him, you're more likely to find your mate telling you how wonderful <i>you</i> are, how much they love and enjoy being around you. Over time your family and friends start to feel the effect. On the other hand, when you withhold from God the praise He deserves, you deprive yourself of what you need in your own life. David said, '...magnify the Lord with me...let us exalt His name together.' (Psalm 34:3 NKJV) God inhabits [occupies, sets up house in] the praises of His people. (Psalm 22:3) When you tell Him, 'You're wonderful, there's no problem You can't solve and no need You can't meet. I'm casting all my care on You. I know You love me and I'm not going to give in to depression and defeat. I'm trusting You to conquer my enemies, break down the doors that are locked and give me victory,' God sends angels to fight and win the battle on your behalf. (Hebrews 1:14) No wonder David said, '...I will praise you more and more.'(Psalm 71:14 NLT) It works! Isn't it time you started thinking along the same lines?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['My mouth is filled with Your praise...all day long.' Psalm 71:8 NAS<br /><br /><p>In 2007, after battling leukaemia, pianist/song-writer Roger Bennett died. He thought he was in remission but the disease returned with a vengeance. He wrote on his website: 'Our enemy stalks us exactly the way the Bible describes, as a roaring lion. He hides in the bushes waiting for any sign of weakness. Then he strikes. He didn't strike me physically. He struck a more critical part - my joy...confidence...and hope. Every thought I turned towards Heaven bounced back like it was made of brass. Every time I tried to look on the bright side, I ended up imagining a dark future. Then he threw his most effective dart - doubt. &quot;You call yourself a Christian. What a hypocrite! You're more afraid than ever...more filled with despair. So much for your faith, Mr. Gospel Singer!&quot; I believed everything he said. I tried everything I knew to pull out of it...I thought if I dozed off it would pass...but the clock seemed to move in slow motion. Sleep was nowhere near. I tried to lose myself in the Bible, but the words blurred and I couldn't make sense of them.' Then Bennett had an epiphany, as he thought about Paul and Silas in prison. 'They didn't despair,' he wrote. 'They sang praises and <i>that</i> became their weapon. One after another...old songs came to me and I sang them to my empty room. It wasn't a great performance, but it may be the most powerful blessing I've received.' The Psalmist wrote, 'My mouth is filled with Your praise...all day long.'(Psalm 71:8 NAS) Try it. It's a strategy that works!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...How are the dead raised? With what kind of body...?' 1 Corinthians 15:35 NIV<br /><br /><p>Ever wonder what your heavenly body will be like? The Bible gives us three answers to the questions, 'How are the dead raised? With what kind of body will they come?' <i>First, it speaks of anatomy:</i> '...Men have one kind of flesh, animals have another, birds another and fish another.' (1 Corinthians 15:39 NIV) Just as fish are designed to handle the pressures of the ocean and birds are designed to fly, your heavenly body will be custom-made for eternity. (Imagine travelling not merely at the speed of light, but the speed of thought!) <i>Next, it speaks of astronomy:</i> 'The sun has one kind of splendour, the moon another and the stars another; and star differs from star in splendour. So will it be with the resurrection of the dead...' (1 Corinthians 15:41-42 NIV) There will be degrees of honour and differences of reward when we get to Heaven. Your service now is what determines your status then 'God &quot;will give to each person according to what he has done.&quot;' (Romans 2:6 NIV) <i>Finally, it speaks of agriculture:</i> '...it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power.' (1 Corinthians 15:43 NIV) It's said the old Saxon word for <i>cemetery</i> means 'God's acre.' How wonderful; Christians don't get buried, they get planted!</p>
<p>There's a bulletin board in the Mayo Clinic which reads: 'Cancer is limited: it cannot cripple love, it cannot shatter hope, it cannot erode faith, it cannot eat away peace, it cannot destroy confidence, it cannot kill friendship, it cannot shut out memories, it cannot silence courage, it cannot invade the soul, it cannot reduce eternal life, it cannot quench the spirit, and it cannot lessen the power of the resurrection.'</p>

<alias><![CDATA[hows-your-prayer-life]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...it is time to seek the Lord...' Hosea 10:12 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The place of prayer is where you meet with God to be instructed, corrected, cleansed, loved, built up and prepared to do His will. It can be anywhere, but it must be <i>somewhere!</i> It can be anytime, but it must be a <i>set time.</i> Without prayer, what do you have to draw on? You'll work harder and harder and accomplish less and less because you're operating in your own strength. But after you've prayed you'll struggle less and accomplish more because you're operating in God's strength. If you're spending hours watching television but say you've no time to pray, 'It is time to seek the Lord.' If you're living comfortably with sins that once troubled you, 'It is time to seek the Lord.' If you're speaking words of bitterness towards someone who hurt you, 'It is time to seek the Lord.' If having material things consumes so much of your energy that there's none left for God and your family, 'It is time to seek the Lord.' The New Testament church grew so fast that the apostles found themselves with no time to pray. So they said, '...It is not right...' (Acts 6:2 NCV) That's where <i>you</i> must start! If you've forsaken the place of prayer it will show up in your attitudes and actions. What did the apostles do? They said, '...we will give ourselves continually to prayer...' (Acts 6:4 KJV) And look what happened: '...the Word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied...' (Acts 6:7 KJV) If you've come this far with little prayer, inconsistent prayer, or no prayer, think how far you'll go when you begin to pray.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Love is always supportive, loyal, hopeful, and trusting.' 1 Corinthians 13:7 CEV<br /><br /><p>Clara Null writes: 'At a wedding my granddaughter Melissa asked, &quot;Why is the bride always dressed in white?&quot; I replied, &quot;Because white represents happiness, and today is the happiest day of her life.&quot; Her next question was: &quot;Then why's the groom dressed in black?&quot; Marriage only works if you &quot;work at it.&quot;' So here are three principles for strengthening yours: (1)<i> Become a good listener.</i> Jesus said, '...consider carefully how you listen...' (Luke 8:18 NIV) Sometimes the most important thing in communicating with your mate is to hear what is not being said, to learn to read between the lines. Just 'being there' isn't enough; your mate needs to feel heard - and validated. When they are, they'll open up and accept what you have to say. (2)<i> '...speak the truth in love...'</i> (Ephesians 4:15 NLT) Nobody likes to be corrected, but when someone is heading down the wrong road, love will 'get in your face'. Our marriages break down when truth is violated, integrity is forsaken, trust is broken, manipulation is allowed, self-interest is the rule, control is the goal, and time isn't invested. (3)<i> Always believe the best.</i> Love sees you at your worst but never forgets your best; thinks you're a little bit more wonderful than you really are; will talk with you endlessly or just sit with you in silence; is happier about your success than you are; doesn't try to know more, act smarter or be your constant teacher; it listens even when what you have to say is not particularly interesting. That's because love believes you're important!</p>

<alias><![CDATA[where-you-are-matters]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['You have been wandering around...long enough; turn...' Deuteronomy 2:3 NLT<br /><br /><p>God's plan for your life always involves your gifts, His timing, and being in the right place. But three things can keep that from happening: fear of failing, unwillingness to leave your comfort zone, and being swayed by the opinions of others. There came a point where, in order to enter the Promised Land, God said to Israel, 'You have been wandering around...long enough; turn...' (Deuteronomy 2:3 NLT) When you reach this point it's crucial that you say yes to God and be willing to step out in faith.</p>
<p>During a famine God said to the prophet Elijah: '&quot;Leave here, turn eastward and hide in the Kerith Ravine, east of the Jordan. You will drink from the brook, and I have ordered the ravens to feed you there.&quot; So he did what the Lord had told him...and stayed there. The ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning and bread and meat in the evening, and he drank from the brook.' (1 Kings 17:3-6 NIV) God's plan for your life is always connected to a place. Jesus '...had to go through Samaria.' (John 4:4 NIV) Why? To meet a woman who was destined to reach that city with the Gospel. You can't just go where you like, God will honour you when you're where <i>He</i> wants you to be. God has promised to bless you, but sometimes He has to reposition you in order to receive His blessing. It was when Ruth moved to Bethlehem that she met Boaz and married him. It was when Bartimaeus went to where Jesus was that he received his sight. Where you are matters!</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...by Him actions are weighed.' 1 Samuel 2:3 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The story's told of a lady who answered the knock on her door and saw a man with a sad expression. 'I'm sorry to disturb you,' he said, 'but I'm collecting money for an unfortunate family in the neighbourhood. The husband is out of work, the kids are hungry, the utilities will soon be cut off, and worse, they're about to be kicked out of their apartment if they don't pay the rent by this afternoon.' With great concern the woman said, 'I'll be happy to help. But who are you?' He replied, 'I'm the landlord.' Clearly, this man was more concerned with his own interests than with anyone else's. What he was doing was not illegal, but it was wrong. Under the pretence of serving, he was self-serving. Hello! What's your heart-motive? </p>
<p>The Pharisees prayed, fasted and gave money to the poor, but they did it to impress others. So Jesus said in the Sermon on the Mount: 'Watch out! Don't do your good deeds publicly, to be admired...for you will lose the reward from your Father in Heaven...When you pray, don't be like the hypocrites who love to pray publicly on street corners and in the synagogues where everyone can see them...' (Matthew 6:1-5 NLT) Then Jesus said, '...let your good deeds shine out for all to see, so that everyone will praise your heavenly Father.' (Matthew 5:16 NLT) You're supposed to make God look good - not yourself. Check your heart-motive; are you doing a good thing with a bad motive? 'The Lord is the God of knowledge; and by Him actions are weighed.'</p>

<title><![CDATA[Blessed in Giving!]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[blessed-in-giving]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...It is more blessed to give than to receive.' Acts 20:35 NCV<br /><br /><p>Wendy Pope writes: 'When God calls me to give, I don't always <i>feel</i> like I'm being blessed. Perhaps you've had a similar experience. He prompts you to prepare a meal for a family hit by illness, and after a long day you're barely able to prepare one for your own family. Or when you're exhausted, He nudges you to go get your friend's children because she needs a break. No matter what the situation, when God calls us to give...we come out blessed...His ways and thoughts are higher than ours. He has the master plan, and all we need be concerned about is doing what He asks without complaining. You may question His reasoning when [He] nudges you to take your rude co-worker to lunch...or teach your child's Sunday school class and give the teacher a break. The bottom line is, whether we think it or not...it means something to eternity and to the person we're giving to. Basically, without Jesus I'm a selfish person. I wonder what kind of blessing I'll get...money, a new car or a finer home? I'm ashamed of those thoughts, but they came from an infant Christian who didn't understand that the blessing...is a closer walk with the greatest Giver who ever lived.' Do you sometimes give out of obligation, or guilt, or to gain other people's approval? Giving is the true measure of our love for God, and He always blesses us when we do it. So, '...don't give reluctantly or in response to pressure...' (2 Corinthians 9:7 NLT), do it with a willing heart.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...It is more blessed to give than to receive.' Acts 20:35 NCV<br /><br /><p>Wendy Pope writes: 'When God calls me to give, I don't always <i>feel</i> like I'm being blessed. Perhaps you've had a similar experience. He prompts you to prepare a meal for a family hit by illness, and after a long day you're barely able to prepare one for your own family. Or when you're exhausted, He nudges you to go get your friend's children because she needs a break. No matter what the situation, when God calls us to give...we come out blessed...His ways and thoughts are higher than ours. He has the master plan, and all we need be concerned about is doing what He asks without complaining. You may question His reasoning when [He] nudges you to take your rude co-worker to lunch...or teach your child's Sunday school class and give the teacher a break. The bottom line is, whether we think it or not...it means something to eternity and to the person we're giving to. Basically, without Jesus I'm a selfish person. I wonder what kind of blessing I'll get...money, a new car or a finer home? I'm ashamed of those thoughts, but they came from an infant Christian who didn't understand that the blessing...is a closer walk with the greatest Giver who ever lived.' Do you sometimes give out of obligation, or guilt, or to gain other people's approval? Giving is the true measure of our love for God, and He always blesses us when we do it. So, '...don't give reluctantly or in response to pressure...' (2 Corinthians 9:7 NLT), do it with a willing heart.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['They go from strength to strength...' Psalm 84:7 NIV<br /><br /><p>In an old <i>Peanuts</i> cartoon Charlie Brown says to his friend Linus, 'What would you do if you felt that no one liked you?' Linus replies, 'I'd see what I could do to improve.' To which Charlie Brown replies, 'I <i>hate</i> that answer!' There are three reasons we hate that answer and want to freeze life where it's at: (1) When it took everything we had to get to where we are, 'Let's go' is not what we want to hear. (2) We're creatures of habit; we form our habits, then our habits form us. (3) Change makes us feel insecure; deep down, we fear we don't have what it takes. Near the top of a mountain in the Alps is an epitaph to a Swiss guide which reads, 'He died climbing.' (What a great way to be remembered!) Growth is an uphill climb. If you want to keep growing you must never stop climbing: '...the path of the just is like the shining light, that shines every brighter unto the perfect day.' (Proverbs 4:18 NKJV) How do we grow and change? 'They go from strength to strength.' In his book <i>Teaching to Change Lives,</i> Dr. Howard Hendricks asks teachers these soul-searching questions. 'How have you changed lately? In the last week, let's say? Or the last month? Can you be very specific? Or must your answer always be incredibly vague? You say you're growing, okay - how?' 'Well,' you say, 'In all kinds of ways.' Great; name one! You see, effective teaching only comes through a changed person. When you stop changing, you stop leading. Today ask God to pinpoint the areas in which you need to change and grow.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...everyone who has will be given more...' Matthew 25:29 NIV<br /><br /><p>Every accomplishment starts with a decision. Choice, not chance, determines your destiny. Jesus gave us the parable of a businessman who gave one employee ten talents to invest, and he doubled them. A second employee received five talents, and he doubled them too. A third employee got one talent, but he buried it. Afraid of losing it, he failed to take even a modest risk. '&quot;You bad and lazy servant!&quot; his master said. &quot;You knew, did you, that I reap harvests where I did not plant, and gather crops where I did not scatter seed?&quot;' (Matthew 25:26 GNT) The Bible says '...we walk by [the eye of] faith, not by [natural] sight.' (2 Corinthians 5:7 NJKV) Unless you're willing to take prayed-over, carefully-considered and well-advised risks, you're not operating in faith. And '...without faith it is impossible to please Him...' (Hebrews 11:6 NKJV) Jesus ended His parable saying, '...everyone who has will be given more...Whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.' (Matthew 25:29 NIV) Your goal should be to maximise the investment on everything you do. Ken Blanchard calls this getting the highest return on life. It means putting all your eggs in God's basket (don't worry, He won't drop them!) To get more, you must use what God's already given you. When you step out in faith, God moves, and extraordinary things happen. John Mason says: 'Not what we <i>have</i> but what we <i>use</i>, not what we <i>see</i> but what we <i>choose</i>these are the things that mar or bless human happiness.' When you limit what you <i>will</i> do, you limit what you <i>can</i> do. Think: if you don't act now, what will it ultimately cost you?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...It is no trouble for me to write the same things to you...' Philippians 3:1 NIV<br /><br /><p>Have you any idea how often the people you admire got it wrong, half right, almost right, before they got it right? Making mistakes is the unenjoyable, unavoidable part of making progress. That's why Paul said, '...It is no trouble for me to write the same things to you again, and it is a safeguard for you.' (Philippians 3:1 NIV) He understood that you have to <i>keep</i> hearing and doing it in order to get it right.</p>
<p>Stop comparing yourself with others. The Bible says, '...When they measure themselves by themselves...they are not wise.' (2 Corinthians 10:12 NIV) Some of us are given five talents, some two, and some one. Your talents, not your wishes, determine your potential. One-talent people who make the most of what they've been given receive the same 'well done' as five-talent people. The person who gets into trouble is the one who's afraid to take the risk; their biggest mistake is their unwillingness to make a mistake! Dr. John Maxwell says that your performance depends on your commitment to practice. 'Consistently good practice leads to consistently good play. It sharpens your talent. Successful people understand this...and develop the discipline to do it.' If you want to sum up what lifts most successful individuals above the crowd, you could do it in these four words: <i>a little bit more.</i> Successful people do what's expected of them - plus a little bit more. So, the word for you today is - strive for progress, not perfection!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['We get knocked down, but we get up again.' 2 Corinthians 4:9 TLB<br /><br /><p>Failure can feel like a punch in the gut. And when it keeps happening it's tempting just to give up. But you can't; you must 'get up again'. Failing doesn't make you a failure, quitting does. HE Jansen said, 'The man who wins may have been counted out several times, but he didn't hear the referee.' A failure-free life feels safe, but it fosters boredom, apathy and low self-esteem. Ever noticed that the devil never reminds you of what you've learned? No, he wants you to keep reliving the painful details. Learn the lesson, then forget the details! Victory requires building on what you've learned and moving on. Theologian Brooke Foss Westcott said, 'Great occasions do not make heroes or cowards, they simply unveil them...Silently, as we wake or sleep, we grow strong or weak, and at last some crisis shows us what we have become.' This article ran in <i>The Wall Street Journal:</i> 'You've failed many times although you may not remember. You fell the first time you tried to walk. You almost drowned the first time you tried to swim. Did you hit the ball the first time you swung the bat? Heavy hitters, the ones who hit the most home runs, also strike out a lot. RH Macy failed seven times before his store in New York caught on. English novelist John Creasey got 753 rejection slips before publishing 564 books.' H. Jackson Brown gives us two rules for winning: Rule One: Take one more step. Rule Two: When you don't think you can take one more step, refer to rule number one.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...no...messenger [is] greater than the one who sent him.' John 13:16 NIV<br /><br /><p>One of the reasons God chose John the Baptist as Jesus' forerunner is because he was humble. He's introduced simply as a '...voice...crying in the wilderness' (Mark 1:3 NKJV), no pretentious preambles or highfalutin' titles. Many notable saints came before John, but Jesus said, '...Among those born...no one has arisen greater than John...' (Matthew 11:11 NRSV) John had no hidden agenda or overblown ego; his message was: 'He must increase, but I must decrease.' (John 3:30 NKJV) John Barnett says: 'Pride is the sin of competing with God...it makes me self-reliant, self-absorbed, self-deceived, self-confident, self-conscious, self-sufficient, self-satisfied, self-focused, self-centred and self-driven. It makes me <i>unreliable</i>, because nobody can tell me what to do...<i>unloving</i>, because I won't sacrifice for you...<i>unteachable</i>, because you can't correct me...<i>competitive</i>, because I will always try to outdo you. Humility means not always having to be asked, reminded and recognised ...I go round <i>looking</i> for ways to serve.' Somebody asked Hudson Taylor, 'Are you conscious of the way God has prospered you in the China Inland Mission? I doubt any man has had greater honour.' Taylor replied, 'I don't see it like that. I think God must have been looking for someone small enough and weak enough to use so that all the glory might be His...and He found me.' Bottom line: 'God gives special blessings to those who are humble, but sets Himself against those who are proud.' (1 Peter 5:5 TLB) So, be humble!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['After you have suffered...God...will...establish you.' 1 Peter 5:10 NAS<br /><br /><p>Stephanie Voiland writes: 'My friend...spent months job-hunting, and as leads failed to pan into pay-cheques she became discouraged. Yet...she refused to anaesthetise the waiting ache...She fasted from TV, believing God had given her this time to reflect on where she was headed. Through those agonising months God showed up in ways more profound than a job offer. She looked for a way to support herself; He taught her a new level of dependence on Him. As she waited for a potential employer's call, God spoke into her soul... She searched for a 'genie-god' to instantly meet her needs; God blew her away by revealing He's bigger than she ever dreamed. Eventually she landed a job and was grateful...but she was even more grateful to learn how God meets us through waiting in ways beyond those we can ask or imagine... Sometimes in the bleakest moments, His intervention manifests itself...we receive the perfect job, the physical healing, the necessary funds, and the wait is over. Other times He does the miracle in us.'</p>
<p>Gold only becomes valuable when the impurities have been removed in the fire, and God uses tough times like a refining process to bring out the best in us. He controls the heat, because His goal isn't to destroy you but to develop you. He tailors the trial to the area in your life that needs work, and as you mature He ups the intensity. Athletes start out training with light weights, and as they grow stronger they progress to heavier ones. As you grow in Christ, obstacles that once seemed overwhelming will be par for the course.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Go! I am sending you.' Luke 10:3 NIV<br /><br /><p>Jesus sent His disciples out on a mission saying, 'Do not take a purse or bag...and do not greet anyone on the road.' (Luke 10:4 NIV) Observe three things He emphasised: (1)<i> 'Do not take a purse'</i><i> - no hoarding!</i> God will bless the man or woman who says, 'Every penny You give me above my needs, Lord, I'll use to fulfil Your purposes.' Imagine standing at the judgment seat of Christ with your riches uninvested, your assignment unfulfilled, and your sphere of influence unreached for Christ. What could you possibly say? (2)<i> 'Do not take a...bag'</i><i> - no excess baggage!</i> God's Word says, '...let us strip off every weight that slows us down, especially the sin that so easily trips us up. And let us run with endurance the race God has set before us.' (Hebrews 12:1 NLT) Whatever can get your attention can influence you, and whatever can keep your attention can master you. Satan dreads the completion of your assignment, so you must fight to keep your focus. (3)<i> 'Do not greet anyone on the road'</i><i> - don't waste time!</i> Question any relationship that doesn't contribute to your destiny. Paul was single-minded on this issue: '...if anyone does not obey our word in this epistle, note that person and do not keep company with him...' (2 Thessalonians 3:14 NKJV) The hour is too late and the need too great. In the old days, in certain agricultural states in America they closed the schools for a few weeks and everyone was sent into the fields to gather the harvest. Why? Because to wait is to be too late! </p>

<title><![CDATA[When a Child Dies]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[when-a-child-dies]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...I shall go to him...' 2 Samuel 12:23 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The first child David had with Bathsheba lived only a week, then died. Heartbroken, with his thoughts towards Heaven, David said, '...I shall go to him...'</p>
<p>When a child dies, numerous questions arise. For example, first, will I see them in Heaven? Yes, David's story confirms it. Picture a shepherd leading his flock to greener pastures. The journey requires crossing a river. The sheep stare at it, paralysed with fear. So the shepherd picks up a lamb, carries it over and sets it on the other side. At first its parents are upset, but eventually they overcome their fear and become willing to follow the shepherd through the waters to a glorious reunion on the other side. Think: when what you value most is in the next world, the appeal of this one diminishes with each passing day. Secondly, we may ask, will I know them in Heaven? Yes, on the Mount of Transfiguration the disciples knew Moses and Elijah even though they'd died centuries before. Would we know less in Heaven than we know on earth? Paul writes, '...Then I shall know just as I also am known.' (1 Corinthians 13:12 NKJV) Finally, we may ask, what will they do in Heaven? The Bible says that in Heaven, '...His servants shall serve Him.' (Revelation 22:3 NKJV) Have you ever said to yourself, 'I wish I could do better'? In Heaven, you will. You'll be at your best-forever.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Then Pharaoh...clothed him in garments of fine linen...' Genesis 41:42 NKJV<br /><br />
<p>To be used by God, you must wear the two coats Joseph wore-namely, those of favour and integrity.</p>
<p>First, the coat of favour. 'Now [Jacob] loved Joseph...and he made him a coat of many colours.' (Genesis 37:3 KJV) Like Joseph's multicoloured coat, the favour of God will cause you to stand out in the crowd; it will open doors, protect and promote you. The Bible says, 'For You, O Lord, will bless the righteous; with favour You will surround him as with a shield.' (Psalm 5:12 NKJV) Secondly, the coat of integrity. Joseph left his physical coat in the hands of Potiphar's wife when he refused her advances but not his coat of integrity. 'When Joseph went into the house to do his work... she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me. But he left his garment in her hand, and fled...' (Genesis 39:11-12 NKJV) Your temptation may be different from Joseph's. You may be tempted to gossip, cut corners on a job, lie to save face, or claim credit for something you didn't do; whatever it is, you'll be tested. And your character will be revealed. Passing the test of integrity is what qualifies you to be used by God. Dr Joseph Parker, the great English preacher and contemporary of Charles Spurgeon, said, 'An un-tempted minister will never do us any good, and an untried one will talk over our heads.' When your hour of testing comes, the thing that will hold you steady and get you through is knowing, standing on, and speaking God's Word. That's why the Psalmist wrote, 'Your word I have hidden in my heart, that I might not sin against You.' (Psalm 119:11 NKJV)</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...He...will not be anxious in the year of drought...' Jeremiah 17:8 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The mother of eight children came home one afternoon and noticed it was quieter than usual. She looked in the living-room and five of her little darlings were sitting in a circle, playing with five of the cutest skunks you've ever seen. Instantly she began to scream, 'Run, children, run!' Each child grabbed a skunk and ran in different directions. Instead of helping, her screams scared the children so much that they each squeezed their skunk... That day she learned-it's always too soon to panic!</p>
<p>In tough economic times the difference between peace and panic depends on who you are trusting in. When you've done all you know, give it to God-and don't take it back! We live in a fear-filled world. If you read the headlines and not the Scriptures, or listen to the 'shock jocks' instead of those who strengthen your faith, you'll experience what Jesus described as 'men's hearts failing them for fear...' (Luke 21:26 KJV) As a redeemed child of God you live by His rules, under His protection, supplied by '...His riches...' (Philippians 4:19 KJV) Here's a promise you need to stand on: 'Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord... For he shall be like a tree planted by the waters, which spreads out its roots by the river, and will not fear when heat comes; but its leaf will be green, and will not be anxious in the year of drought, nor will cease from yielding fruit.' (Jeremiah 17:7-8 NKJV) 'In the year of drought', don't panic. Instead, trust God to come through for you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I will instruct you...in the way you should go...' Psalm 32:8 NIV <br /><br /><p>Paul writes, '...I go...not knowing the things that will happen to me...except that the Holy Spirit testifies...saying that chains and tribulations await me. But none of these things move me...' (Acts 20:22-24 NKJV) It's only human to want to know where you're going and what you're getting into. But God will inform you on a 'need to know' basis. Like Abraham, when you follow Him, you do it 'not knowing' where the Lord leads, but believing what He promised, confident that no matter how He does it nor how long it takes, He will keep His word to you (Hebrews 11:8). Being in God's will doesn't exempt you from problems. God doesn't promise a carpet on the race track or a bed of roses on the battlefield. But you can be '...confident of this, that He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion...' (Philippians 1:6 NIV) Jon Walker says, 'God knows every step of the journey...the blessings and dangers...where you've been...where you're going, and...the best path to take... He never intended you to figure out the steps without Him. How you get on mission and succeed...are God's responsibilities. Your responsibility is to seek His guidance and obey His instructions. He said, I will instruct you...in the way you should go...and watch over you. (Psalm 32:8 NIV) Your job is to trust Him with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding. His job is to set your path straight (Proverbs 3:5-6). There's no requirement for you to figure it all out.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The lips of the godly speak helpful words...' Proverbs 10:32 NLT<br /><br /><p>Your tongue can be a source of great blessing because it can provide people with two things they need. First, it gives wisdom. 'The mouth of the godly person gives wise advice... The lips of the godly speak helpful words...' (Proverbs 31-32 NLT) Paul told Timothy, 'You have heard me teach [many] things... teach these truths to other trustworthy people who will be able to pass them on to others.' (2 Timothy 2:2 NLT) Pass on what God has taught you to those who need guidance and are hungry for knowledge. Don't be pushy, but don't be timid; share with them what God has shared with you. If you give a hungry man a fish he will live for a day; if you teach him how to fish he will live for a lifetime. Secondly, your tongue can give correction. Nobody enjoys being corrected. But if you '...listen to constructive criticism, you will be at home among the wise... reject discipline, you only harm yourself... listen to correction... grow in understanding... humility precedes honour.' (Proverbs 15:31-33 NLT) Nobody likes to risk rejection by being the truth-teller, but: 'You can trust a friend who corrects you...' (Proverbs 27:6 CEV) Three important principles apply here. First, you speak truth on the basis of friendship. If you haven't proven yourself, leave the truth-telling to someone who has. You have to earn that right. Secondly, truth-telling isn't a licence to go hunting. A true friend cares about others' feelings, and speaks the truth in love (Ephesians 4:15). Thirdly, appreciation will come-but be prepared, it may be delayed! 'In the end, people appreciate honest criticism far more than flattery.' (Proverbs 28:23 NLT)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Strike the ground...' 2 Kings 13:18 NKJV<br /><br /><p>When the king of Israel needed a strategy for defeating the Syrians he turned to the prophet Elisha, who told him: 'Take a bow and some arrows.' 'So he took himself a bow and some arrows. Then he said to the king of Israel, Put your hand on the bow. So he put his hand on it, and Elisha put his hands on the king's hands. And he said, Open the east window, and he opened it. Then Elisha said, Shoot, and he shot. And he said, The arrow of the Lord's deliverance and the arrow of deliverance from Syria; for you must strike the Syrians at Aphek till you have destroyed them. Then he said, Take the arrows, so he took them. And he said to the king of Israel, Strike the ground, so he struck three times, and stopped. And the man of God was angry with him, and said, You should have struck five or six times; then you would have struck Syria till you had destroyed it! But now you will strike Syria only three times.' (2 Kings 15-19 NKJV)</p>
<p>What are you asking God to do? To save someone you love? To provide finances? To help you break a habit? To succeed in your career? Find out what He has promised you in His Word, and use those promises like arrows. Aim them at your problem, shoot, and keep shooting until God moves on your behalf. If this story teaches you anything, it's this: there are situations in life when faith and persistence not only determine your victory, but also the extent to which you win. So aim, shoot, and keep shooting!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...If God is for us, who can be against us?' Romans 8:31 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Some of the world's greatest people have faced the world's greatest challenges, but have overcome them. Cripple a man with polio, and you have Sir Walter Scott. Lock a man in prison, and you have John Bunyan. Raise a man in abject poverty, and you have Abraham Lincoln. Subject a man to bitter religious prejudice, and you have Benjamin Disraeli. Strike a man down with paralysis, and you have Franklin Roosevelt. Have someone born black in a society filled with racial discrimination, and you have Booker T. Washington, Harriet Tubman, Marian Anderson and George Washington Carver. Make a man the first child to survive in an impoverished Italian family of 18, and you have Enrico Caruso. Have a man born to parents who survived a Nazi concentration camp, paralyse him from the waist down when he's four years old, and you have the incomparable violinist Itzhak Perlman. Call a man a slow learner and mentally challenged, write him off as beyond education, and you have Albert Einstein. Helen Keller was born blind and deaf, yet she graduated from college with highest honours and impacted the world. Margaret Thatcher, England's first and only woman Prime Minister, lived upstairs over her father's grocery store. For a while her childhood home had no running water and no indoor plumbing. Golda Meir, Israel's first and only woman Prime Minister, was a divorced grandmother from Milwaukee. What do these people teach us? That success doesn't depend on our circumstances, but on overcoming our circumstances. And with God on our side we can do it! Paul, one of the world's great overcomers, wrote, 'If God is for us, who can be against us?'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...be persistent in your prayers...' Ephesians 6:18 NLT<br /><br /><p>Andrew Murray wrote, 'Many Christians look upon it as a burden and a duty and a difficulty to get alone with God! That is the great hindrance to our Christian life everywhere.' God says, 'Call to Me, and I will answer you, and show you great...things, which you do not know.' (Jeremiah 33:3 NKJV) The answers you seek can be found on your knees. Jesus said, 'If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you.' (John 15:7 NKJV) Prayer is like a platinum card; it gives you access to God's wisdom and resources. Paul writes: '...continuing steadfastly in prayer.' (Romans 12:12 NKJV) The story's told of a soldier in World War II who was caught creeping back into his quarters from some nearby woods. Brought before his commanding officer and charged with communicating with the enemy, he said he had just gone out to pray. His commanding officer asked, 'Do you make a habit of spending hours alone in prayer?' 'Yes, sir,' he replied. 'Then get down on your knees and pray now,' roared the officer, 'for you've never needed it more!' The soldier kneeled down and prayed so powerfully that his CO shouted, 'Enough, you may go, I believe you! If you hadn't been so often at drill, you wouldn't have done so well at review.' Prayer isn't like a spare tyre; you can't just leave it in your boot and expect it to be effective when you need it. You must 'be persistent in your prayers'. In other words, stay in constant contact with God.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['He always does exactly what He says.' 2 Corinthians 1:19 TLB<br /><br /><p>Ever had a friend break a promise? The cheque doesn't come, the repairman doesn't show up, your date doesn't call? Count on it, people will let you down. But God won't: 'He always does exactly what He says. He...fulfils all...[His] promises.' (2 Corinthians 1:19-20 TLB) Knowing that enables you to keep walking by faith while you wait for them to be fulfilled. James MacDonald says: 'It's this not-knowing that crushes us. We doubt...worry...despair...falter and fail...If we knew how this was going to play out we'd be ok. We...can take a bad day...month...year...or decade...as long as we know how it will end. A health crisis...a question about your marriage...uncertainty over a child...we all have areas...where we need to hold on to what God has said... He knows what He promised, He can't lie, and He can't forget. He'll deliver on time. Who else can make promises like that? Now I wish I could tell you it always figures out perfectly in our lifetimes, but I'd be lying...You cannot make sense of [His] promises...with this life only. You must factor in the reality of eternity... Eternity brings it all together...eternal life...and the assurance of Heaven are what make His promises so precious.' Victor Frankl, who survived the horrors of the Holocaust, said, 'A weak faith is weakened by predicaments and catastrophes, whereas a strong faith is strengthened by them.' A Sunday school class was memorising Psalm 23 and little Tommy couldn't get beyond the first verse. On the big day he stepped up to the microphone, grinned at the audience and announced, 'The Lord is my Shepherd - and that's all I know!' And it's all <i>you</i> need to know for now.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Love...keeps no record of being wronged.' 1 Corinthians 13:4-5 NLT<br /><br /><p><i>Story one:</i> Debra K. Johnson writes: 'My seven-year-old daughter wanted to take violin lessons, so I took her to a music store to rent an instrument. Hoping she would understand the importance of making a commitment to practice, I explained that lessons were expensive. I was willing to make the financial sacrifice if she promised to work hard. &quot;There may be times you'll feel like giving up,&quot; I said, &quot;but I want you to hang in there!&quot; She nodded, understanding, then in her most serious voice she said, &quot;It will be just like marriage, right, Mum?&quot;' <i>Story two:</i> A husband asked his wife, 'Tell me, dear, have you ever been in love before?' She thought for a moment and replied, 'No, darling. I once respected a man for his great intelligence. I admired another one for his remarkable courage. And I was captivated by yet another for his good looks and charm. But with you, well, how else could I explain it, except love?' Have you been finding fault with your mate instead of remembering the qualities that attracted you to them? Attitudes are like weeds, they spring up overnight and if you don't deal with them they take over the whole garden. Don't let that happen! Next time you're too busy to show love, or you react in anger, read these words: 'Love is patient and kind. Love...does not demand its own way. It is not irritable, and it keeps no record of being wronged...Love never gives up, never loses faith, is always hopeful, and endures through every circumstance.' (1 Corinthians 13:4-7 NLT)</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Nothing can ever separate us from His love.' Romans 8:38 NLT<br /><br /><p>Paul asks five life-changing questions you'd do well to think about: </p>
<p>(1) <i>'If God is for us, who can ever be against us?' </i>(Romans 8:31 NLT) The presence of God tilts the scales forever in our direction. Really, who can hurt us? (2) <i>'Since God did not spare even His own Son but gave Him up for us all, won't God... also give us everything else?'</i> (Romans 8:32 NLT) Would God save our souls then leave us to fend for ourselves? Would He address our eternal needs and ignore our earthly ones? Of course not! (3) <i>'Who dares accuse us...? Will God? No! He is the one who has given us right standing with Himself.' </i>(Romans 8:33 NLT) Every voice that accuses you, including your own, means nothing in the court of Heaven. God's acceptance trumps man's rejection. (4) <i>'Who then will condemn us?... the One who died for us... is sitting at the place of highest honour next to God, pleading for us.' </i>(Romans 8:34 NLT) Let your accusers rise up and speak against you. Jesus, your defence attorney, silences them. Why? Because His grace covers you. (5) <i>'Can anything ever separate us from Christ's love?' </i>(Romans 8:35 NLT) Paul answers his own question: 'Death can't, and life can't. The angels can't, and the demons can't. Our fears for today, our worries about tomorrow, and even the powers of hell can't keep God's love away...nothing in all creation will ever be able to separate us from the love of God that is revealed in Christ Jesus our Lord.' (Romans 8:38-39 NLT) Isn't that great?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...teach them diligently to your children...' Deuteronomy 6:7 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Abraham had a nephew called Lot who succeeded in business, but lost his family. How come? Because: (a)<i> he had the wrong emphasis - </i>he placed material success above spiritual success; (b)<i> he had the wrong environment - </i>he thought his children could live in Sodom and not be affected by it; (c)<i> he had the wrong expectation</i> - he thought he could change his surroundings by compromising with them; (d)<i> he set the wrong example</i> - he thought his family would follow his instructions; instead they followed his lifestyle; (e)<i> he had the wrong relationship - s</i>he didn't realise, until it was too late, how much Sodom had influenced his family (Genesis 19:4-5). If you think you can live by the world's rules and expect your children to follow God's, you're kidding yourself. Instead of preaching about the shoes you want your children to fill, walk in them! Lead by example. Outside of your influence as a parent, the four greatest influences in your child's life are their peers, the internet, media and music. And all four are either working for you or against you. You say, 'But I'm really busy right now.' Get un-busy! Rethink your priorities. Your child's character is being moulded each day; the question is, by whom? God's Word clearly states that these six things constitute your job description as a parent: (1) <i>Instruct them</i> (Deuteronomy 6:6-7). (2) <i>Train them</i> (Proverbs 22:6). (3) <i>Provide for them</i> (2 Corinthians 12:14). (4) <i>Nurture them</i> (Ephesians 6:4). (5) <i>Discipline them</i> (1 Timothy 3:4). (6) <i>Love them</i> (Titus 2:4). The truth is, you have no greater responsibility!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...pray about everything...Tell God what you need...' Philippians 4:6 NLT<br /><br /><p>The four-year-old son of a missionary family in Africa spotted a picture of a little pink dinosaur in a magazine and set his heart on having one. His mum knew it was impossible (the magazine was three years old), but her son never doubted God would come through for him. On Christmas Eve, a box packed ten months earlier arrived from home. At first glance it seemed to contain something special for everyone - except a four-year-old boy. Then they reached the bottom - and they were stunned. The lady who sent the box had no way of knowing God would use her to answer a little boy's prayer. Before taping up the box, at the last minute, she tossed in the one item impossible for his parents to provide - something so insignificant no rational adult would ever have been foolish enough to ask God for...a pink plastic brontosaurus from a fast-food restaurant promotion! </p><p>Sometimes we feel foolish bothering God with little things, but we shouldn't. The Bible says: '...pray about <i>everything</i>. Tell God what you need, and thank Him for all He has done.' (Philippians 4:6 NLT) God is interested in every detail of your life; if something is important to you, it's important to Him. In Bible times two sparrows were sold for a penny (on sale you could buy five for two pennies!) yet Jesus said, '...not a single sparrow can fall to the ground without your Father knowing it...the very hairs on your head are all numbered.' (Matthew 10:29-30 NLT) When you learn to trust God in little things, you'll be able to trust Him in big ones.</p><p></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ex 16:1-35, Jn 6:30-40<br /><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=20315&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Examine yourselves...' 2 Corinthians 13:5 NKJV<br /><br /><p>If you are serious about changing: (1)<i> The first person you must know is yourself.</i> Human nature seems to endow us with the ability to size up everybodyexcept ourselves. If you're not comfortable with yourself, you won't be comfortable with others. And if you don't believe in yourself, your lack of self-worth will undermine you in life. One marriage counsellor says, 'The most important relationship you will ever have is with yourself. You've got to be your own best friend first.' But how can you be best friends with someone you don't know, like, or respect? That's why it's important to discover what God's called you to be, then work at becoming that person. And you won't get there overnight; it's a processone that requires a mindset of honesty, frequent repentance and constant self-correction. But if you commit yourself to it God will help you. (2)<i> The first person you must work on is yourself.</i> Dr. Samuel Johnson said, 'He who has so little knowledge of human nature as to seek happiness by changing anything but his own disposition, will waste his life in fruitless efforts, and multiply the grief which he purposes to remove.' The Bible says, 'Examine yourselves.' Only as we examine ourselves before God do we discover where our true battles lie. Then we've a choice. We can be like the man who visited his doctor and found out he'd serious health issues. When the doctor showed him his x-rays and suggested surgery, the man asked, 'Ok, but how much would you charge just to touch up the x-rays?' Or, you can decide to change!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The lips of the godly speak helpful words...' Proverbs 10:32 NLT<br /><br /><p>Your words can bring two things. First, encouragement. Ella Wheeler Wilcox said, 'A pat on the back is only a few vertebrae removed from a kick in the seat of the pants, but is miles ahead in results.' Solomon said, 'Kind words bring life, but cruel words crush your spirit.' (Proverbs 15:4 GNT) When life is hard, '...a word spoken at the right moment-how good it is!' (Proverbs 15:23 AMP) Hope pierces the despair, and people begin to believe that they really have a chance to make it. Many a wounded soul has got through their deepest valley on the strength of a word of encouragement. 'Pleasant words are a honeycomb, sweet to the soul and healing to the bones.' (Proverbs 16:24 NIV) People wounded by life are healed by words of encouragement. Just a card, an email, a phone call-the Bible calls them '...apples of gold in settings of silver.' (Proverbs 25:11 NKJV) Secondly, your words can bring salvation. 'The fruit of the...righteous is a tree of life, and he who is wise captures human lives [for God, as a fisher of men-he gathers and receives them for eternity].' (Proverbs 11:30 AMP) The highest use of your tongue is telling others about Jesus. He doesn't need to be defended, just introduced. 'The words of a good person give life, like a fountain of water...' (Proverbs 10:11 NCV) You can speak life-giving words to those who are lost, and help change their past, their present and their future. Your words can also help people to mature and grow in their relationship with God. Yes, 'The lips of the righteous feed many...' (Proverbs 10:21 NAS)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...do not...be anxious about tomorrow...' Matthew 6:34 AMP<br /><br /><p>Most of the stuff we worry about never happens, or turns out better than we anticipate. Worry, like faith, is a spiritual force. Like a magnet, it attracts the very things we fear, clouds our judgment and distorts our perspective. God never intended us to carry tomorrow's burdens along with today's. So, here are three steps to help you conquer worry: (1)<i> Replace it.</i> Telling somebody not to worry doesn't work. Worry is like an emotional spasm; the only way to break it is to replace it. '...whatever is lovely, whatever is admirableif anything is excellent or praiseworthythink about such things.' (Philippians 4:8 NIV) In other words, switch the channel! (2)<i> Dissect it.</i> '...fear involves torment...' (1 John 4:18 NKJV) Worry torments you; your imagination runs amok, conjuring up all kinds of scary scenarios. But it's also illogical; when you take it apart rationally and systemically, it loses its power to control you. (3)<i> Rise above it.</i> A well-known pastor was flying over the Mississippi River one day when the sky grew dark. 'We can't see where we're going!' he exclaimed. Calmly the pilot replied, 'We just need to rise above the ground heat, dust and smoke.' After climbing another 300 metres they emerged into a clear, beautiful world. Corrie Ten Boom called faith 'the radar that pierces through the fog.' When worry tries to fog you in, you can rise above it by placing your trust in the Lord. '...those who trust in the Lord...will soar...like eagles...' (Isaiah 40:31 NLT)</p>

'...Live purposefully...' Ephesians 5:15 AMP
<br />




Are you easily swayed by what others say and do, or do you have a plan and stick with it? Are you doing what you love, or just doing things out of mindless routine? Mark Twain said, 'The secret of success is making your vocation your vacation.' In other words, love what you do and do what you love! Many of us never get around to fulfilling God's purpose for our lives because we're so busy keeping everybody happy. This world is filled with people who think they know what you should be doing with your life. No, it's your life, and when you stand before God He won't ask anybody else about it except you! Are you courageous enough to follow your heart rather than the crowd? Are you focused, even when many voices try to draw you away from your purpose? An interesting phenomenon occurs when you have no strong convictions or clear purpose of your own; you tend to get irritated with those who do.


The term 'whatever' seems to be especially popular these days. While we must always strive to live in harmony and to consider other people's feelings and viewpoint, God's Word condemns complacency, indifference and an unwillingness to stand up for what we know is right. We need to be intentional. We can't just stand around waiting to see what everyone else is going to do, then follow the crowd. There are basically two kinds of people: those who wait for something to happen, and those who make things happen. Don't say, 'I wish they would do something about this problem.' You are they?do something!

'Live joyfully with the wife whom you love...' Ecclesiastes 9:9 NKJV
<br />




You say, 'My mate is a terrible housekeeper. What can I do?' Although keeping house is historically seen as a woman's responsibility, today roles have changed. Financial necessity may dictate that you both work outside the home. In many instances the husband helps run the house. It's not a 'right or wrong' issue; what's important is that you make sure you're both singing from the same song sheet concerning your expectations. When you expect one thing and your mate expects another, there's trouble ahead! So, here are a few suggestions to help you. (1) Pick the right time. Don't discuss difficult issues when you're upset, wait until you both feel better. The Bible says, '...be willing to listen and slow to speak...anger will not help...' (James 1:19-20 NCV) When emotions run high, instead of solving problems you just end up making things worse. (2) Try to compromise. Look for the middle ground. Recognise that what seems important to you may not be important to your mate. Maybe it wasn't important to you either in the early days, so you let it slide. (3) Learn to negotiate or you'll always be frustrated. Aim for a 'win-win' solution. This may mean washing the dishes or helping put the children to bed so you can have more time together. It involves giving on both sides. (4) Pray with and for one another. Ninety per cent of couples today don't do this, yet it's the most important thing you can do, because Jesus said, '...if two of you agree... concerning anything that they ask, it will be done for them by My Father in Heaven.' (Matthew 18:19 NKJV)

'Live joyfully with the wife whom you love...' Ecclesiastes 9:9 NKJV
<br />




Men and women often speak a different language. Men tend to be physical while women tend to be more verbal. Sometimes a wife's memory for details can make her husband wonder if he's losing his mind. And when you don't understand each other it can feel like you're living in the Tower of Babel. That's the place in the Old Testament where families were divided because they couldn't understand each other's language, all progress stopped and confusion reigned. Before that happens, here are a few basics you need to weave into your daily communication. First, start by asking your partner to share why they do what they do, and say what they say. Study their methods of communication, and try to explain yours. In many instances you'll be surprised, if not shocked. You may be saying one thing while your mate is hearing something entirely different. Second, men tend to avoid confrontation, so cornering and interrogating your husband may bring you the opposite result to what you want. Solomon said, 'It is better to dwell in a corner of a housetop, than in a house shared with a contentious woman.' (Proverbs 25:24 NKJV) The goal is to win your mate over, not win the argument. Finally, the Bible says, '...God...creates new things out of nothing.' (Romans 4:17 NLT) The love you planned to show once your partner has changed, show it now, be patient, and watch things improve. Grace can transform your Tower of Babel into a home of love and unity. Ask God, He'll show you how!

'Live joyfully with the wife whom you love...' Ecclesiastes 9:9 NKJV
<br />




What if you're single, looking for a mate and haven't found one yet? God created Eve specifically for Adam. 'Then...He brought her to the man. And Adam said: ?This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh?...' (Genesis 2:22-23 NKJV) When God brings you the right person, a spiritual and emotional bonding will take place. When you try to get ahead of Him you end up with regrets and recriminations. Peter de Vries explains it this way, 'The difficulty with marriage is that we fall in love with a personality, but must live with a character.' So, wait on God!


When God looked across eternity He saw you. He gave you certain traits and abilities that make you unique. He knew exactly who you would need to help fulfil His purposes and develop the gifts He's given you. Until that happens, remember, He is your spiritual partner! He's been caring for you all along: protecting you, providing for you and directing your steps, right? So be careful how you treat Him. If you can't keep your vow to the Lord, it's doubtful you'll keep it to anybody else. Speaking to those who are single, Paul writes, 'Let each one remain in the same calling in which he was called...Do not be concerned about it...rather use it.' (1 Corinthians 7:20-21 NKJV) Stop wrestling with your singleness and use this time to develop your relationship with God. Never forget that one of the greatest visitations of the Holy Spirit happened to a single, small-town girl named Mary, proving that when you trust God's timing He always sends you the best!

 '...These are the children God has given me...' Genesis 33:5 NCV
<br />




It's easy to complain about the things you don't have, and overlook or take for granted the things you do?simple things that enrich your life! Maybe this story by Dr James Dobson will help change your perspective.


'Some time ago a friend of mine punished his three-year-old daughter for wasting a roll of gold wrapping paper. Money was tight and he became upset when she tried to decorate a box to put under the Christmas tree. Nevertheless, the little girl brought the gift to her father the next morning and said, ?This is for you, Daddy.? He was embarrassed by his earlier over-reaction. But his anger flared again when he opened the box and found it empty. He shouted at her, ?Don't you know that when you give someone a present there's supposed to be something inside?? The little girl looked up at him in tears and said, ?Oh, Daddy, it's not empty. I blew kisses into it. I filled it with my love and I wrapped it up just for you.? He was crushed. Quickly he put his arms around her, hugged her and asked for her forgiveness. My friend told me that he kept that gold box by his bed for years, and whenever he got discouraged he'd take out an imaginary kiss and remember the love of the child who had put it in there. In a very real sense, each of us parents has been given a gold container filled with the unconditional love of our children. There's not a more precious possession anyone could hold.'

'...Shamgar...killed six hundred...Philistines with an ox goad...' Judges 3:31 NKJV
<br />




The Bible says, '...Shamgar...killed six hundred...Philistines with an ox goad; and he also delivered Israel.' (Judges 3:31 NKJV) Shamgar was just a farmer who owned a field, but he was willing to fight for it. His odds weren't good: 600 to 1. But he beat the odds, saved his field, and delivered Israel. So you can start out small and end up blessing others greatly. The Bible says, 'Do not despise these small beginnings, for the Lord rejoices to see the work begin...' (Zechariah 4:10 NLT) Every oak tree started as an acorn. Tom Monaghan started Domino's Pizza in 1960 with one little shop. He struggled for eight years. When his shop burned to the ground, the insurance company paid him only one cent on the dollar to cover his losses. All he knew was pizza, so he started another shop. He worked 100 hours a week. Up to this point he had only taken one week-long holiday?for his honeymoon. By 1971 he was $1.5 million in debt. But he stayed in his field, which was the pizza business, and tried something new. He limited his menu to pizza only, and decided to deliver it hot and fresh to customers at no extra charge. It worked. By 2007, Domino's Pizza had grown to 6100 stores across the United States and other countries. Today he's one of the richest men in the nation, and he gives most of his profits to charity. What was his secret? He started where he was. He fought for what he believed to be his God-given purpose. And when he got knocked down he got back up.

'...Shamgar...killed six hundred...Philistines with an ox goad...' Judges 3:31 NKJV
<br />




Shamgar lived in dangerous times. Philistine gangs roamed the countryside, robbing people: 'In the days of Shamgar...people avoided the main roads; and travellers stayed on...pathroads.' (Judges 5:6 NLT) Shamgar's only weapon was an ox goad, a long wooden staff with a steel tip used to prod oxen. But it wasn't until he came under attack that he discovered its full potential. Understand this: God has given you an 'ox goad', something you can use to win in the situation you're facing. If you seek Him, He'll show you what it is. Like the boy with the five loaves and two fishes, God will take something small, bless it, then multiply it to bless others. The Bible says we are to '...be instant in season, out of season...' (2 Timothy 4:2 KJV) The Greek words for 'be instant' could be translated 'be prepared'. The Greek word for 'season' means 'opportunity'. You need to be preparing yourself now, when it looks like nothing is happening, because your season will change and the opportunity to act will suddenly present itself. When it does, you must be ready. In life, opportunities are either coming towards you, or passing you by. In college, a professor told Dr Martin Luther King Jr that if he kept using such lofty words, he would never be a very effective public speaker. You have to wonder what that professor thought as he listened to Dr King's 'I have a dream' speech, and watched him go on to champion civil rights. What's your ox goad? Use it, and God will bless it!

'...He chose them to become like his Son...' Romans 8:29 NLT
<br />




Bill was a drunk, converted in a Skid Row mission. Before his conversion he had gained a reputation as a tramp and an alcoholic for whom there was no hope. But when he gave his life to Christ everything changed. He became the most caring person at the mission. He spent his days there doing whatever needed to be done. There was never anything he was asked to do that he considered beneath him. Whether it was cleaning up vomit left by some sick alcoholic or scrubbing toilets used by men who had left them filthy, Bill did it all with a heart of gratitude. He could be counted on to feed any man who wandered in off the streets, undress him and tuck him into bed when he was incapable of taking care of himself. One evening after the mission director delivered his evangelistic message to the usual crowd of solemn men with drooped heads, one of them came down to the altar and kneeled to pray, crying out for God to help him change. The repentant drunk kept shouting, 'O God, make me like Bill! Make me like Bill! Make me like Bill!' The director of the mission leaned over and said, 'Wouldn't it be better if you prayed, 'Make me like Jesus'?' After thinking about it for a few seconds, the man looked up and asked, 'Is He like Bill?' Live, so that others see Jesus in you!

'...You desire truth in the inner parts...' Psalm 51:6 NIV
<br />




Lisa Whittle says, 'Pornography...excessive shopping...[and] eating disorders develop in isolation... What we watch...think...how we spend our time are the 'secret places' Satan uses. It's not that we don't want to be honest...but fear of being discovered keeps us...[trapped]... If Satan can get us to...bury our secret[s]...we can't be effective for God... our private sins will eat away at us, making us feel fraudulent and unworthy... The truth is we're the ones who don't love and accept ourselves, not God! 'What is hidden He brings to light' (Job 28:11 NKJV) because He's ?after...truth from the inside out?.' So, practise honesty. When you catch yourself telling a lie, stop, admit it and apologise. It's embarrassing, but you'll think twice next time! Develop a strong faith. Make authenticity a top priority. Strengthen your walk with God through daily prayer and Bible-reading. Consider your motivation. Make sure the improvements you're working on in your life aren't just to impress others. Appreciate your God-given attributes. Make a list, stop and look at it when you feel 'less than'. Value your own judgment. Consider what you've already accomplished and the good decisions you've made in the past. Dr Edwin Locke says, 'Think independently...be mindful of what's suitable for you regardless of what the rest of the world says.' Stop trying to be perfect or look super spiritual. Openness means living without pretence and giving others permission to be transparent. Remember, seemingly 'together people' have their not-so-together moments, and falling apart is sometimes how you get put back together. Live with a genuineness others will want to emulate. Honesty facilitates honesty. When you're real, people can tell.

 '...set free...[from] the fear of dying.' Hebrews 2:15 NLT
<br />




Joe Bayly, who lost three sons, says, 'At the hospital [after] we buried our five-year-old...I saw a little boy playing on the floor. ?He has the same problem your son had,? the secretary said. I sat down next to his mother. ?It's hard bringing him here for tests, isn't it?? I said. ?Hard! I die every time,? her voice trailed off. ?It's good to know,? I spoke slowly, choosing my words carefully, ?that although the medical outlook is hopeless, after our children die they'll be removed from suffering and be well and happy.? She replied, ?If only I could believe that, but I don't. I'll just have to cover him up with dirt and forget I ever had him.?' Bayly wanted to be alone with his grief, but he felt compelled to speak. 'I'm glad I don't feel that way. We covered our little boy with dirt yesterday, and I'm here today to thank the doctor for his kindness.' She replied, 'You look like a rational person. How can you possibly believe the death of a man or a little boy is any different from the death of an animal?'


Max Lucado writes, 'Heaven enjoys a maternity-ward reaction... angels watch, the way grandparents monitor delivery-room doors... They can't wait to see the new arrival. While we're driving hearses...they're hanging streamers... Jesus came to 'free all...who...lived...as slaves to the fear of dying.' (Hebrews 2:15 NLT) Heaven knows no untimely death. David said, ?Before I was born, every day of my life was recorded in Your book...? (Psalm 139:16 NLT) Fear and dread end when you know that Heaven is your true home.'

'...I am...discouraged, but I will remember you...' Psalm 42:6 NLT
<br />




Max Lucado says, 'When God doesn't do what we want it's not easy. Never has been. Never will be. But faith is the conviction that God knows more than we do...and He'll get us through. Disappointment is caused by unmet expectations...[and] is cured by revamped expectations... Don't panic...don't give up...be patient...God's in control. It ain't over till it's over.' So, when you're disappointed: (1) Look inward. David asked, 'Why am I discouraged? Why is my heart so sad?...' (Psalm 42:5 NLT) Admit how you feel. You can't deal with what you don't acknowledge. Ask God to show you the root of the problem. Is it pent-up anger? Envy? Unforgiveness? Pride? Lust? Physical and mental fatigue? Be open to what He reveals. (2) Look upward. David said, '...I will...hope in God! I will praise Him...' (v. 5) Instead of focusing on your discouragement, focus on the One who knows the way out. (3) Remember God's past faithfulness. David said, 'I am...discouraged, but I will remember You.' Through every trial Joseph clung to the assurance that God still controlled his destiny. Recalling God's faithfulness builds your confidence that He'll continue to provide. (4) Remember, you don't have to understand. Just because you can't figure out what God's doing right now, doesn't mean it won't make sense later. He '...causes all things to work together for good to those who love [Him]...' (Romans 8:28 NAS) (5) Don't give in to bitterness. When your hopes are dashed, resentment can set in. '...If God is for us, who can be against us?' (Romans 8:31 NKJV) Regardless of how deep the pit may seem, God is on your side!

<introtext><![CDATA[<br />Make allowance for each others faults... Colossians 3:13 NLT<br />When it comes to forgiving, you cant say it better than Tim Stafford did: I would rather be cheated a hundred times, than develop a heart of stone. The Bible says, Make allowance for each others faults, and forgive anyone who offends you. You dont get to choose who youll forgive. Love is a command, forgiveness is an act of obedience. He has given us this command: Whoever loves God must also love his brother. (1 John 4:21 NIV) You cant be closer to God than you are to the people you love least. God sets the bar high because grudges are like cancer, and forgiveness is the laser that removes them. Bitterness chains us to the past, destroys families, divides churches and sours relationships. Forgiveness is the key that unlocks the handcuffs of hate. Take your hurt feelings to God and say, Point out anything... that offends you... (Psalm 139:24 NLT) It takes courage, but thats the kind of prayer He answers. It gets easier as you grow in Christ; in the meantime you have to work at it. As a child of God His Spirit lives inside you. Youre no longer a slave to sin. (Romans 6:14) God knows its hard to forgive deepseated hurts, but He will give you grace to do it. To make allowance means to take a charitable view and consider extenuating circumstances. People change and grow over time, so dont insist on clinging to a limited, outdated view of them. Try to see them as they are today. Most folks are doing their best based on the knowledge and understanding they have now, so give them a break!<br /><br />SoulFood: Eph 1:14:16, John 1:113, Ps 92, Pr 22:2425<br />]]></introtext>

'Live joyfully with the wife whom you love...' Ecclesiastes 9:9 NKJV
<br />




You say, 'My mate is a terrible housekeeper. What can I do?' Although keeping house is historically seen as a woman's responsibility, today roles have changed. Financial necessity may dictate that you both work outside the home. In many instances the husband helps run the house. It's not a 'right or wrong' issue; what's important is that you make sure you're both singing from the same song sheet concerning your expectations. When you expect one thing and your mate expects another, there's trouble ahead! So, here are a few suggestions to help you. (1) Pick the right time. Don't discuss difficult issues when you're upset, wait until you both feel better. The Bible says, '...be willing to listen and slow to speak...anger will not help...' (James 1:19-20 NCV) When emotions run high, instead of solving problems you just end up making things worse. (2) Try to compromise. Look for the middle ground. Recognise that what seems important to you may not be important to your mate. Maybe it wasn't important to you either in the early days, so you let it slide. (3) Learn to negotiate or you'll always be frustrated. Aim for a 'win-win' solution. This may mean washing the dishes or helping put the children to bed so you can have more time together. It involves giving on both sides. (4) Pray with and for one another. Ninety per cent of couples today don't do this, yet it's the most important thing you can do, because Jesus said, '...if two of you agree... concerning anything that they ask, it will be done for them by My Father in Heaven.' (Matthew 18:19 NKJV)

'...the number of the disciples multiplied greatly...' Acts 6:7 NKJV
<br />




The New Testament church experienced phenomenal growth when its leaders recognised what they were not called to do, delegated it to others and got back to doing what only they could do. As a result, '...the number of the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem...' (Acts 6:7 NKJV) Keeping your mind on what's important for you requires simplification, and simplification means trade-offs. It means saying no to certain things you'd like to do. If you don't choose what trade-offs you make, someone else will. The 'Pareto Principle' teaches that 20 per cent of your effort produces 80 per cent of your success. So identify your 20 per cent, stay there, delegate the rest or let it go. To help you do this, answer these three questions: (1) What takes up most of your time and energy? Determine how your activities can be categorised according to the following list: (a) something I was taught or told I should do; (b) something I see other successful people doing; (c) something I know I should be doing. (2) Are you maximising your strengths? If you need help determining what your strengths are, seek advice from others who know you well, then ask yourself, 'Am I doing them? Am I growing in my ability to do them? Am I enlisting others to do what I can't or shouldn't do?' (3) Are you spread out too thinly? Are you determined to know everything that goes on in every area of your life? Is your philosophy, 'If you want something done right, do it yourself?' No, nobody has that much time and energy! Learn to let some stuff go, get back into focus and start concentrating on what's important for you.

'...And he who believes in [...relies on] the Son has [now possesses] eternal life.' John 3:36 AMP
<br />




It's said that the wealthy English Baron Fitzgerald had only one child, a son. Early in his teens the boy's mother died. Tragically, in his late teens the boy also died. In the meantime, Fitzgerald's financial holdings greatly increased due to acquiring the artwork of Europe's greatest masters. Before his death, Fitzgerald left explicit instructions that an auction be held at which his entire art collection would be sold. A big crowd of prospective buyers gathered. Among them were many well-known museum curators and private collectors eager to bid. The artwork was displayed for viewing before the auction began. Among the paintings was one that received little attention. It was of poor quality and by an unknown local artist. It happened to be a portrait of Fitzgerald's only son. As the auction began the auctioneer read from Fitzgerald's will, which clearly instructed that the first painting to be sold was of 'my beloved son'. Because of its poor quality the painting didn't receive any bids?except one. The bidder was the old servant who'd helped raise the boy and had dearly loved him. For less than a pound he bought the painting. At that point the auctioneer stopped the bidding and asked the lawyer to read again from the will. The crowd was hushed as he read, 'Whoever purchases this painting of my son, gets all my art collection?the auction is over!'


Christ: without Him you have nothing. But with Him you have the best of both worlds: this one, and the one to come.

 '?...Test me in this,? says the Lord...' Malachi 3:10 NIV
<br />




It's estimated that less than one-tenth of all those who attend church give a tenth of their income to God's work, even though the Bible clearly teaches that the first tenth of all we earn belongs to God. 'A tithe of everything...is holy to the Lord.' (Leviticus 27:30 NIV) Today it is estimated that two-thirds of the church's income comes from people aged 69 or older. That's alarming! We need to teach our children the responsibility and rewards of tithing. Perhaps you think tithing only applied to those who lived under the Old Testament law, like the Pharisees. No, Jesus said, '...unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees... you will certainly not enter the Kingdom of Heaven.' (Matthew 5:20 NIV) The tithe is a minimum; your love and faith should determine the maximum. Abraham paid tithes 600 years before the law (Genesis 14:20), then Jesus endorsed it saying we 'ought' to tithe (Matthew 23:23), and the writer to the Hebrews confirmed that it is still God's plan. (Hebrews 7:4-5) As believers, we are the spiritual seed of Abraham, and as such, his blessings have been promised to us. (Galatians 3:14) But if you want what Abraham had, you've got to do what Abraham did?and he was the first man in Scripture to tithe! Giving God the first tenth of your income makes Him number one in your priorities. His Word says, 'Bring the whole tithe... Test Me in this...and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of Heaven and pour out so much blessing that you will not have room enough for it.' (Malachi 3:10 NIV) Do you want to walk in God's blessings? Become a tither!

'Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me...' Matthew 11:29 NKJV
<br />




Too many of us are like the man who said, 'When I rest, I rust.' Here's a newsflash?there will always be something else to do! If you're constantly driven by 'what needs to be done', you'll burn out and fail to do what God has assigned you to do. So here are some practical suggestions for pacing yourself. First, change your eating habits. The Bible says that it's not smart to stuff yourself with too many sweets. (Proverbs 25:27) You wouldn't put sugar into your petrol tank, so be wise: educate yourself about good nutrition. Second, be clear about where you want to go. Set specific goals, and have a plan and a timetable for reaching them. Don't be controlled by mindless routine. Third, instead of ignoring your problems, resolve them. Act before they become chronic and start sapping your energy. Next, don't 'veg' on TV. Too much television dulls you mentally and lulls you into lethargy, 'But they that wait upon the Lord...renew their strength...' (Isaiah 40:31KJV) Then, if you're overloaded, don't take on more. Don't say yes out of a sense of guilt, false responsibility or the need to be needed. Sixth, take a break. When did you last take time to get away? A change of pace and fresh scenery are great battery-chargers. Finally, get to bed earlier. When you burn the candle at both ends, you are the one who burns out. You say, 'But I'm doing it for the Lord.' Notice what the Lord says, 'It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late...for so He gives His beloved sleep.' (Psalm 127:2 NKJV)

'Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me...' Matthew 11:29 NKJV
<br />




Galileo said, 'I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with sense, reason and intellect, has intended us to forego their use.' When Jesus says, '...My yoke is easy and My burden is light' (Matthew 11:30 NKJV), His intention for you is to discover His will for your life, unlock and develop the gifts He's given you, draw daily on His power, use your common sense, and don't live stressed out. That means you need to change your attitude. Have you ever noticed how some people on a rollercoaster close their eyes, clench their teeth and wait for the ride to end, while up front the wide-eyed thrill-seekers relish every peak and plunge? They're all on the same trip, but their attitudes are entirely different. You can't always control what happens to you, but you can decide how you'll respond to it. For instance, choosing to see problems as opportunities for growth develops you instead of draining you. You also need to get physical. 'Physical exercise has...value.' (1 Timothy 4:8 GNT) You don't have to drive 40 minutes to a health club, then wait for 30 minutes to get on a treadmill for 20 minutes?just start walking! A brisk walk works wonders for you physically and mentally. Come on, get moving! Finally, you must tap into the power of God's Word. Practise scriptural affirmations: 'Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly...' (Colossians 3:16 NIV) But before that can happen you must feed your mind with the Scriptures, then meditate on them until they take root and grow within you. That way they'll be there when you need them!

'...Those...hired last...you paid...the same as...us.' Matthew 20:12 NCV
<br />




In Christ's parable five different groups of workers are hired. The first group complained when those who worked only the last hour got paid the same wages as those who worked all day. They are typical of performance-based Christians. They think that because they avoid certain sins, God's getting a good deal. Instead of rejoicing with those who come late to the Kingdom, they're resentful. They're easy to spot because they've three characteristics. They show a complaining spirit. They overlook the good, home in on the negative, and seek out people who agree with them. What's the cure? A good memory! Recalling what God has done for you, and all the grace-based benefits of His love you enjoy each day. Performance-based Christians have also got a resentful spirit. Instead of resting in God's grace they act like duty-bound soldiers?conscripts, not volunteers. They struggle constantly for God's approval, never feel like they measure up, and their hostility prevents them from experiencing joy. But the moment they begin to reflect on God's goodness to them, their resentment begins to lessen. Finally, they show a judgmental spirit. 'It's not fair,' they think. 'I did the work and they get the credit.' They forget that God dispenses gifts?not wages. 'He does not...repay us according to our iniquities' (Psalm 103:10 NIV), but lavishes us with grace and mercy. So who are these grace-based Christians? Latecomers with no contracts or merits; their relationship with God is based solely on grace. They're happy with whatever He's offering, humbled by His goodness, and motivated to work by overwhelming gratitude.

'Honesty guides good people...' Proverbs 11:3 NLT
<br />




Joseph refused the advances of Potiphar's wife, not because he thought he couldn't get away with it, but because he knew he couldn't live with himself if he accepted them. Ted Engstrom writes, 'The world needs people who cannot be bought; whose word is their bond; who put character above wealth; who possess opinions and a will; who are larger than their vocations; who don't hesitate to take chances; who won't lose their individuality in a crowd; who will be as honest in small things as they are in great things; who will make no compromise with wrong; whose ambitions are not confined to their own selfish desires; who will not say they do it 'because everybody else does it'; who are true to their friends through good report and evil report, in adversity as well as in prosperity; who do not believe that shrewdness, cunning and hard-heartedness are the best qualities for winning success; who are not afraid to stand for the truth even when it's unpopular; who say 'no' with emphasis, even though the rest of the world says 'yes'.'


In what he calls a compromise of integrity, psychiatrist Leo Rangell analyses the relationship between former President Nixon and some of his closest confidants in the Watergate scandal. He records a conversation between Senator Howard Baker and Nixon aide Herbert Porter. Baker: 'Did you ever have qualms about what you were doing?' Porter: 'Yes, I did!' Baker: 'Why didn't you [do anything]?' Porter: '...Group pressure... the fear...of not being considered a team player.' So strive for integrity, not popularity!

'...The race is not to the swift...' Ecclesiastes 9:11 NKJV
<br />




In ancient Greek marathons a torch was handed to each runner at the starting line. To win, they had to cross the finishing line with their torch still burning. What a picture! '...For everyone to whom much is given, from him much will be required...' (Luke 12:48 NKJV) In God's Kingdom you are called to run your best race and cross the finishing line with the fire in your heart still burning. The torch race was a tough one that led through mountains and valleys. Doubtless there were times when others would pass you by, when your strength would fail, when you lost your way and had to get back on track, or stumbled and had to get back up. What counted in this race was not style, but staying power!


The Bible says, 'Run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus...lest you become weary and discouraged...' (Hebrews 12:1-3 NKJV) How did Jesus run His race? As a boy of twelve He told His parents, '...I must be about my Father's business...' (Luke 2:49 NKJV) Later, when the crowd tried to take Him in a different direction and impose their agenda on Him, He said, 'I must work the works of Him that sent Me...' (John 9:4 NKJV) Facing the cross, He announced, '...For this cause I was born...' (John 18:37 NKJV) On the cross, He announced, '...?It is finished!?...' (John 19:30 NKJV) In Revelation we see one of our last recorded glimpses of Christ, and '...His eyes [are] like a flame of fire.' (Revelation 1:14 NKJV) He crossed the finishing line with the torch still burning. And He is our example!

'Live joyfully with the wife whom you love...' Ecclesiastes 9:9 NKJV
<br />




Sonja Ely writes, 'I was watching my five-year-old granddaughter play with her toys. At one point she staged a wedding, first playing the role of the mother who assigned specific duties, then suddenly becoming the bride with her 'teddy bear' groom. She picked him up and said to the 'minister' presiding, ?Now you can read us our rights.? Without missing a beat, she became the minister who said, ?You have the right to remain silent, anything you say may be held against you, you have the right to have an attorney present, you may kiss the bride.?' To know what your marriage rights are, you must understand that, first, marriage is God's idea. In Eden He said, 'It is not good that man should be alone; I will make him a helper comparable to him.' (Genesis 2:18 NKJV) The word 'comparable' means 'compatible with his (or her) needs'. When you marry someone, you marry everything they've been through. Each of you brings your own baggage. Unless you sort out what to keep and what to discard, things can quickly erode. You must also understand that when you leave God out, you have problems. Satan has made marriage one of his prime targets. He loves to promote strife. When it comes to marriage we must learn to forgive, 'lest Satan should take advantage of us; for we are not ignorant of his devices.' (2 Corinthians 2:11 NKJV) God's plan for your relationship is strength and harmony, not strife and confusion. He wants to help you build a strong, loving union that glorifies Him. To do that, you must show grace, and resolve to make Jesus Lord of your relationship.

'Live joyfully with the wife whom you love...' Ecclesiastes 9:9 NKJV
<br />




In discussing marriage on his TV sitcom, Jerry Seinfeld tells his friend why he's not married: 'No healthy person would want the neglect I have to offer.' Let's face it, even the best marriages are made up of two imperfect people who sometimes neglect each other. And when you've been hurt it's easy to react in the flesh instead of responding in the Spirit. Some hurts go deep. At this point we must remember that forgiveness is a decision, but trust is a process; when it's been torn down, it takes time to rebuild. Men and women often perceive trust differently. When a woman's been hurt, her husband may think an apology should immediately enable her to trust him again, move on, and not talk about it. That's not so; two things need to happen. First, the offending partner needs to acknowledge what they've done. Don't just tell your partner to 'get over it'. Validate their feelings, even though they act like they don't want you to. Acknowledge their pain. When others rationalise or trivialise what's hurting us, it only makes us angrier. Only when we feel validated do our wounds begin to heal. Second, the offended partner needs to make sure that bitterness doesn't creep in. 'How can I do that?' you ask. By refusing to stay hurt any longer than is absolutely necessary, and by allowing God to heal your heart and restore your love. The Bible says, '...If you hear His voice today, don't be stubborn!' (Hebrews 4:7 CEV) When God gives you the grace to forgive and release the hurt, you need to seize it!

'Live joyfully with the wife whom you love...' Ecclesiastes 9:9 NKJV
<br />




After the death of the child David fathered with Bathsheba, we read, 'Then David got up...washed himself...changed his clothes...went to the Tabernacle and worshipped the Lord. After that, he returned to the palace and...ate. His advisers were amazed. ?We don't understand you,? they told him. ?While the child was still living, you wept and refused to eat. But now that the child is dead, you have stopped your mourning and are eating again.?' (2 Samuel 12:20-21 NLT) Why did David mourn more intensely before the baby died than he did after? Because men grieve hard, but not necessarily as long. Once something's over, they've a tendency to move on. This can cause problems. Often men genuinely don't understand why their wives can't accept that 'what's done is done', and move on too. Listen to David's logic: '...I fasted and wept while the child was alive, for I said, ?Perhaps the Lord will be gracious to me and let the child live.? But why should I fast when he is dead? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him one day, but he cannot return to me.' (2 Samuel 12:22-23 NLT) The Bible says that God '...comforts us...so that...when they are troubled, we will be able to give them the same comfort...' (2 Corinthians 1:4 NLT) David's next move was crucial. He '...comforted Bathsheba, his wife...' (2 Samuel 12:24 NLT) Notice, David didn't ask, 'What's wrong with you? When are you going to get over this?' He recognised that even though he was beginning to heal, his wife was still hurting. The healing process accelerates once you begin to empathise with and comfort your mate.

'Live joyfully with the wife whom you love...' Ecclesiastes 9:9 NKJV
<br />




When your husband loses his job and you find yourself suddenly going through a season of financial uncertainty, here are three things you need to keep in mind. First, remember it's just a season. The important thing is to guard your attitude while you're waiting for things to turn around. Unless he's lazy or an outright freeloader, your husband already feels bad because he can't provide. He knows the children need shoes, the bills are piling up and that you're tired of eating noodles or beans on toast, so don't keep reminding him! Second, now is the time to get behind him and strengthen his ego, not deflate it. 'How?' you ask. By asking yourself, 'Am I always complaining? Do I highlight the things we don't have? Do I covet stuff that's beyond our budget right now? Am I doing my part to cut back and make ends meet, or am I splurging on non-essentials, going shopping every day and wanting to eat out every night?' Finally, remember 'this too shall pass'. Now is not a good time to remind your husband (or your wife if she's the breadwinner) about the new car your brother bought or the great house your friend just acquired. Now is the time to practise saying with Paul, '...I have learned to be satisfied with the things I have and with everything that happens...I have learned the secret of being happy...' (Philippians 4:11-12 NCV) Has God ever failed you? No, and He won't now, so make up your mind to trust Him. How you handle this season may well determine whether your relationship emerges weaker or stronger.

'Make allowance for each other's faults...' Colossians 3:13 NLT
<br />




CS Lewis said, 'Everyone says forgiveness is a lovely idea until they have something to forgive.' Author Mac Anderson writes, 'A few times in my life I've been wronged. My first reaction...was anger and resentment. I...felt my stomach tie up in knots, my appetite wane, and the joy slip out of my life...like I'd played the first half of a basketball game in steel shoes. In the locker room the coach said, ?Try these new Nikes in the second half.? Multiply that by ten and you'll understand how it feels to unload your emotional baggage through the power of forgiveness.' Jesus debunked the myth that love is based on feelings. It's an act of your will, and if you love God you'll keep His commandments. It's that simple. If you're struggling to forgive someone who's hurt you, here are some scriptural guidelines to help you.


Don't seek retribution. Instead, '...overcome evil with good.' (Romans 12:21 NKJV) God said, '...Vengeance is mine; I will repay.' (Romans 12:19 NKJV) Don't rush to judgment. That's not always easy when you're the injured party, but the ultimate Judge said, 'With what judgment you judge, you will be judged...' (Matthew 7:2 NKJV) Make things right. Jesus said, '...be reconciled to your brother...' (Matthew 5:24 NIV) Don't wait for the other person to make the first move, you do it. 'Make every effort to live in peace with all men...' (Hebrews 12:14 NIV) Pray for the offender. As much as it goes against your grain, when you '...pray for those who mistreat you' (Luke 6:28 NIV), God gives you the grace to forgive and see them through His eyes.

&amp;apos;Cast your burden on the Lord...&amp;apos; Psalm 55:22 NKJV<br>
A hiker with two heavy holdalls was walking down a road in 35° heat. A truck driver stopped and told him to hop on. Later when the driver looked in his rear-view mirror, the hiker was standing in the truck-bed still holding his bags! We smile, but as Jon Walker points out, many of us &amp;apos;stand in the truck of faith still carrying our burdens, thinking they&amp;apos;re independent of the ride we&amp;apos;re taking. We think God can carry us but not our burdens... The Psalmist said, ?Cast your burden on the Lord, and He shall sustain you.? Rest in His power and grace...confident He&amp;apos;s looking out for your best interests. Rest requires dependence, and one sign that you&amp;apos;re not resting in God...is worry...the need to control... Next time you feel overwhelmed...settle into a chair, ?Be still, and know that [He is] God...? (Psalm 46:10).&amp;apos; In this instance, the command to &amp;apos;be still&amp;apos; here comes from a Hebrew word which means &amp;apos;to let go, release, lift up&amp;apos;. You&amp;apos;ve struggled long enough; give your burden to the Burden Bearer. Set it down! In order to do that you must do two things. First: practise saying no. If you&amp;apos;re constantly available you&amp;apos;ll end up stretched so thin you&amp;apos;ll be no good to anybody. Jesus didn&amp;apos;t try to please everybody. He prayed, got God&amp;apos;s agenda and stuck to it. God will give you the grace to do only what He has commanded, not what you think or what others would like. Second, value solitude. Turn off your pager and mobile phone. The sign of a well-ordered mind is the ability to sit quietly in one place and linger in your own company.<br><br>

<introtext><![CDATA[you should follow His steps. 1 Peter 2:21 NKJV<br /><br />
<p>If you want to follow in the footsteps of Jesus, observe the following things about Him: (1)<em> He never acted in haste.</em> He didnt make decisions in response to the pressure tactics of others. Skilled negotiators know that waiting is a weapon; whoever is the most hurried usually ends up with the short end of the deal. Waiting reveals the weakness in any plan, plus the motives of those around you. Your greatest mistakes will often happen because of impatience, so think long term. (2)<em> He knew when to work and when to rest.</em> In the storm on the Sea of Galilee the disciples sweated, but Jesus slept. In the garden of Gethsemane the disciples slept, but Jesus sweated. Thats because He knew when to work and when to rest. Knowing when to act and when to trust, what to give your attention to and what to leave in Gods hands, is a secret you must learn if youre to do Gods will and not burn out. Nobody was busier than Jesus. Everybody wanted something from Him. The more successful you are the more people will reach for you. Jesus separated Himself in order to receive. He understood that you cant give what you dont have. Work means giving; rest means receiving. Jesus understood the balance; thats why He accomplished so much in three short years. When youre rested you think more clearly, you make better decisions, you see life through confident eyes, you accomplish more in less time, and what you build is built to last. So stop your frantic rush. Following in the footsteps of Jesus means being led, not driven!</p>

'...for His name's sake.' Psalm 23:3 NKJV
<br /><br />




Have you ever asked, 'How could God use someone like me?' The Psalmist answers, 'For His name's sake'! Only one name counts--and it's not yours! With the same intensity that God hates pride, He loves humility. His Word says, '...God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.' (James 4:6 NIV) So here are a few tips on staying humble. First, evaluate yourself honestly. Don't be like the beaver who told the rabbit as they stared up at the immense wall of Hoover Dam, 'No, I didn't actually build it myself. But it was based on an idea of mine.' The Bible says, 'Don't cherish exaggerated ideas of yourself...but try to have a sane estimate of your capabilities.' (Romans 12:3-4 PHPS) Second, learn to celebrate others. Paul writes, '...don't try to impress others. Be humble, thinking of others as better than yourselves.' (Philippians 2:3 NLT) Every goal scored in life is usually a team effort. Be like the little boy who came home from the auditions for the school play and announced, 'Mummy, I got the part. I've been chosen to sit in the audience and cheer.' When you can do that, your head finally fits your hat size. Finally, don't announce your success before it occurs. '...One who puts on his armour should not boast like one who takes it off.' (1 Kings 20:11 NIV) When one of Charles Spurgeon's students proudly stepped up to preach, but came back down having failed miserably, Spurgeon supposedly said something like, 'If you'd gone up the way you came down, you'd have come down the way you went up.' God blesses our efforts only when they're done 'for His name's sake'.

'Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for You are with me...' Psalm 23:4 NKJV
<br /><br />




One day Jesus will come and take each of us to His house. 'How do we get there?' you ask. 'Through the valley of the shadow of death.' This verse is quoted at the graves of paupers and carved on the headstones of presidents for a couple of reasons. First because we must all face death. Some senior citizens were lounging on the patio of their retirement community. One looked up as a large flock of birds flew overhead. He nudged his buddy who'd dozed off, 'Frank, you'd better move around a little, those vultures look like they're closing in on us.' The Bible says, '...it is appointed unto men once to die...' (Hebrews 9:27 KJV) Sooner or later the buzzards will move in; will you be ready? It's also quoted to remind us that we don't have to face it alone. Donna Spratt writes, 'To begin a discussion on values, our youth pastor asked the teens this question: &quot;What would you do if your doctor told you that you had only 24 hours to live?&quot; The teens' responses were typically, &quot;Be with friends and family.&quot; But the discussion came undone when Jason, our 13-year-old, said, &quot;I'd get a second opinion.&quot;' When it comes to opinions about death, only one counts: Jesus said, 'I am the Resurrection and the Life. He who believes in Me will live, even though he dies; and whoever lives and believes in Me will never die. Do you believe this?' (John 11:25-26 NIV) Rejoice, you won't have to make the journey alone. Furthermore, whatever you give up for Christ in this life will be nothing to what you inherit in the next.

'You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies...' Psalm 23:5 NKJV
<br /><br />




To protect his sheep the shepherd must constantly be on the lookout for a small, brown snake called the adder that can pop up out of its hole, bite the sheep and kill them. And that's what the Lord has done for us! He's dealt with Satan, the old serpent, and has prepared for us 'a table in the presence of [our] enemies'. He's done for us what He did for Peter after his infamous chapter of denial: invited us back into fellowship with Him. Three days after Jesus rose from the dead, the angel said, 'Go, tell His disciples--and Peter--that He is going before you into Galilee...' (Mark 16:7 NKJV) The biggest failure was the only one Jesus singled out by name. When Peter reached the shore that morning beaten and weary, the fire was burning, the meal was prepared, and Jesus was saying, '...Come and dine...' (John 21:12 KJV) Have you failed badly? Jesus invites you to come, be fed, be healed and restored to fellowship with Him. But a word of caution: Peter didn't think he would fail, but he did. And so can you. St Augustine said, 'The devil is like a mad dog that's chained up. He's powerless to harm us when we are outside his reach, but once we enter his circle we expose ourselves again to injury or harm.' You're no match for the enemy! But God has given you a strategy for dealing with him: 'Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.' (James 4:7 NIV)

'...You anoint my head with oil...' Psalm 23:5 NKJV
<br /><br />




The shepherd anoints his sheep with oil for two purposes. First, to repel insects. If allowed to deposit their eggs into the soft membrane of a sheep's nose they can drive the sheep insane; the ewes stop giving milk and the lambs stop growing. So the shepherd anoints his sheep with an oil-like repellent that keeps the enemy at bay and the flock at peace. Second, to heal wounds. Most wounds result from living with the flock. So the shepherd regularly inspects his sheep because he doesn't want today's wound to become tomorrow's infection. Whether circumstances are driving you crazy, or you've just been wounded as a result of living with the flock, always go to the Shepherd. Before you go to anybody else, go to God because 'He heals the broken-hearted and binds up their wounds.' (Psalm 147:3 NIV) Then, bow before Him. In order to be anointed the sheep must lower their heads and let the shepherd apply the oil. Humble yourself, call on the Lord. 'God will always give what is right to His people who cry to Him... He will not be slow to answer them.' (Luke 18:7 NCV) The Psalmist writes, '...I have been anointed with fresh oil.' (Psalm 92:10 NKJV) Yesterday's oil is quickly contaminated by the dirt and grime of the journey, so you must go to God daily and ask Him to empower you with His Spirit. A sheep doesn't understand how the oil works, but it doesn't have to. It's enough to know that something happens in the presence of its shepherd that happens nowhere else.

'...My cup runs over.' Psalm 23:5 NKJV
<br /><br />




Paul writes, 'Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think...' (Ephesians 3:20 NKJV) Our God is a God of abundance! In Scripture, the overflowing cup is a powerful symbol. As long as your cup was kept full you were welcome. But if it sat empty, the host was hinting that it was time to go. If he really enjoyed your company he kept filling it until it ran over the edge and down onto the table. Is your cup overflowing today? That means you're welcome at God's table, your seat is guaranteed, nobody can take your place, and your needs will be abundantly supplied. FB Meyer wrote, 'Whatever the blessing in your cup, it's sure to run over. With Him, the calf is always the fatted calf, the robe is always the best robe, the joy is unspeakable, the peace passeth understanding... God's way is always characterised by...overflowing bounty.' So the last thing on earth we need to worry about is 'making ends meet'. Our cup overflows. Take grace, for example: 'The more we see our sinfulness, the more we see God's abounding grace forgiving us.' (Romans 5:20 TLB) To abound is to have a surplus! The cup God gives overflows with mercy. Are you afraid it will run dry? That your warranty will expire? That your mistakes are too great? No way! Before Paul became a Christian he went around persecuting, imprisoning and killing Christians. Yet he wrote, '...grace...was poured out on me abundantly...' (1 Timothy 1:14 NIV) Whatever you need today, God has--in abundance. So ask, and believe Him for it!

'Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life...' Psalm 23:6 NKJV
<br /><br />




Let's break this Scripture down: 'Surely goodness and mercy.' People may disappoint you, but God's goodness and mercy are sure things! 'With [God] there is never the slightest variation or shadow of inconsistency.' (James 1:17 PHPS) Our devotion to God may falter, but His devotion to us never does: 'If we are unfaithful, He remains faithful...' (2 Timothy 2:13 NLT) David didn't say, 'maybe, possibly, I hope so, I've a hunch.' No, he said, 'Surely' and that's a promise you can stand on. 'Shall follow me.' That sounds like another promise God made to His people: 'all these blessings shall come on you, and overtake you...' (Deuteronomy 28:2 NKJV) Note the words: 'follow...come on...overtake'. You can't get away from them! God's goodness and mercy followed Jonah to the bottom of the sea, Daniel into the lions' den, and John into exile, opening Heaven to him. Stop and look back. Think of the scrapes God's brought you through, the messes He's helped clean up, the doors He's opened, and what do you see? Blessings you don't deserve, can't escape, and are new every morning. With God, it's a sure thing! 'All the days of my life.' Think of the days ahead and what do you see? Days at home raising a family? Days in a dead-end job, struggling to get ahead? Days of loneliness and poor health? Days of caring for a sick loved one? Days of battling disappointment and depression? 'Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life.' Goodness to provide, and mercy to pardon; you'll never have a day without them!

'...I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.' Psalm 23:6 NKJV
<br /><br />




When we're young, Heaven has limited appeal. We've too many dreams such as love, marriage, children, career, and so on. Ageing is God's way of keeping us headed homeward. And what about death? Christians don't get buried, they get planted. Paul writes, '...The body that is sown is perishable, it is raised imperishable...it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power.' (1 Corinthians 15:42-43 NIV) Calvin Miller writes, 'The world is poor because her [treasure] is buried in the sky and all her treasure maps are of the earth.' Have you heard the story of the bird named Pootsie? When nobody claimed her, the Humane Society gave her to Sue. They became fast friends. One day the little bird did something incredible; it perched on her shoulder and whispered, 'Fifteen hundred South Oneida Street, Green Bay.' Sue was dumbfounded. She discovered that the address actually existed, went there and found a man named John Stroobants. 'Do you have a parakeet?' she asked. 'I used to. I miss her terribly,' he replied. When he saw Pootsie he was thrilled. 'You know,' he said, 'she even knows her phone number.' This story isn't as crazy as you might think. You see, we all have an eternal address within us. God has '...set eternity in the hearts of men...' (Ecclesiastes 3:11 NIV) Deep down, we know we're not home yet, so we must be careful not to live like we are. Would you set up house in a hotel? The greatest calamity is not to feel far from home when you are, but to feel right at home when you're not. And we're not home yet, because 'our homeland is in Heaven.' (Philippians 3:20 TLB)

Elijah the prophet told King Ahab that the drought in the land was over and the rains were coming. Then Elijah 'told his servant, &quot;Go up now, look toward the sea.&quot; So he went up and looked, and said, &quot;There is nothing.&quot; And seven times he said, &quot;Go again.&quot; Then it came to pass the seventh time, he said, &quot;There is a cloud, as small as a man's hand, rising out of the sea!&quot; So he said, &quot;Go up, say to Ahab, 'Prepare your chariot, and go down before the rain stops you.'&quot; ...in the meantime...the sky became black...and there was a heavy rain...' (1 Kings 18:43-45) Notice, seven times Elijah said, 'Get up and go again.' You must persist! If you don't, you'll miss what God wants you to have. Furthermore, if you don't recognise and celebrate small miracles 'the size of a man's hand', you'll miss the bigger ones so essential to your future. 


Beth Anne DeCiantis had to complete a 42 km marathon in less than two hours and 45 minutes to qualify for the Olympics. She reached the final straight in 2 hours 43, with just two minutes left. Two hundred metres from the finish she stumbled and fell. Dazed, she stayed down for 20 seconds. The crowd yelled, 'Get up!' The clock was ticking--less than a minute to go. Beth Anne staggered to her feet and began walking. Five metres short of the finish, with ten seconds to go, she fell again. As the crowd cheered her on, she crossed the finish line on her hands and knees. Her time? Two hours, 44 minutes, 57 seconds. So the word for you today is: 'Get up and go again.'

'...called according to His purpose.' Romans 8:28 NKJV
<br /><br />




Nobody can give you a vision for your life, but here's how to find yours: (1) Look within you. What moves you? What are you excited about? Paul said, '...I am compelled to preach...' (1 Corinthians 9:16 NIV) (2) Look behind you. What has life taught you? Experience provides us with the wisdom needed to fulfil our destiny. What does your past tell you about your future? (3) Look around you. God never calls us alone. Moses needed 70 elders. Jesus picked 12 disciples. Paul spoke of those who worked with him. Fulfilling your destiny requires having the right people in your life. (4) Look ahead of you. Helen Keller said, 'The only thing that's worse than being blind, is having sight but no vision.' What do you see through the eye of faith? St Augustine said, 'Faith is to believe what we do not see, and the reward of faith is to see what we believe.' (5) Look beside you. What resources are available to you, for example, books, CDs, conferences and mentors? If your vision is not bigger than you, it's not of God. And the greater it is, the more resources it will require. (6) Look above you. Jeremiah writes, '...They speak a vision of their own heart, not from the mouth of the Lord.' (Jeremiah 23:16 NKJV) We are 'called according to His purpose', not according to the need, or the fact that the door is open, or that our talent will be appreciated and well rewarded. Your vision must fulfil your God-ordained destiny, nothing else. So, do you need to recognise your vision, resurrect your vision or refocus on your vision?

'Keep your [life] free from the love of money...' Hebrews 13:5 NIV
<br /><br />




A lot of us think that the goal of work is to accumulate enough money so that we can quit working. No, if your work is not fulfilling, eventually you'll resent it. That's so, whether you make much or little. Money alone is not worth giving your life to. 


John Ortberg writes, 'I have a friend. He's a businessman. He is in his seventies now. Years ago I attended his church when he gave a terrific message. We talked afterwards and he said to me, &quot;You know, when I was a young man I always felt that I ought to go into pastoral ministry.&quot; I asked him, &quot;Why didn't you?&quot; Well, when it came right down to it, it was just money. He was doing well in the business world so he didn't follow what he sensed was God's calling on his life. Now he was financially secure--but he was running out of time. It's only money! We get all twisted up in knots over it, stay awake at night thinking about it, stew, get anxious, scheme, trade away our integrity to get a little more of it...and we worry that somebody else might get hold of it. It's only money! It's never a reason not to follow Christ. It's never a reason not to do the thing that He has called you to do.'


Billy Graham hit the bull's-eye when he said, 'If a person gets his attitude toward money straight, it will help straighten out almost every other area of his life.' It's okay to make money, and enjoy money, but 'Keep your [life] free from the love of money'.

'...He leads me in the paths of righteousness...' Psalm 23:3 NKJV
<br /><br />




How could a God who is perfect live side by side in Heaven with people like us who aren't? That's like asking if a top university would admit someone with only a kindergarten education. Then what are we to do? Find a worthy substitute, or be lost forever! That's where Jesus comes in; He's the Good Shepherd who gave His life for the sheep. It's the great transfer! At the cross God placed all our sins on Christ, and at the point of believing faith He places all Christ's righteousness on us. Awesome! 


Actor Kevin Bacon recalls when his six-year-old son saw the movie Footloose for the first time: 'Hey, Dad, you know that part in the movie where you swing from the rafters? That's really cool, how did you do that?' I said, 'Well, I didn't do that part...it was a stuntman.' 'What's a stuntman?' he asked. 'That's someone who dresses like me and does things I can't do.' 'Oh,' he replied, and walked out of the room looking a little confused. Later, he said, 'Hey, Dad, you know that part in the movie where you spin around on that gym bar and land on your feet? How did you do that?' I said, 'Well, I didn't do that either. That was a gymnastics double.' 'What's a gymnastics double?' he asked. 'That's a guy who dresses in my clothes and does things I can't do.' Then my son asked, 'Dad, what did you do?' 'I got all the glory,' I sheepishly replied.


The songwriter put it this way: 'Dressed in His righteousness alone, faultless to stand before Thy throne. On Christ the solid rock I stand, all other ground is sinking sand.'

'He restores my soul...' Psalm 23:3 NIV
<br /><br />




When life overwhelms us we usually look for one of two things. We may look for somebody with all the answers. The trouble is, when you look to someone for that which only God can provide, you set that person up to fail and yourself up to be disappointed. Alternatively, we may look for somewhere with fewer problems. Paul Harvey wrote, 'After Hurricane Andrew devastated South Florida, Patricia Christy vowed she was going to leave on the first plane. She was determined to get as far away from the horror of hurricane damage as she possibly could and have a restful vacation.' Harvey said, 'I just heard from Patricia Christy. She was standing in line for fresh water on the Hawaiian Island Kauai, having just gone through Hurricane Iniki!'


Sheep get anxious when storms come, predators roar, or they're forced to move to unfamiliar territory. How do they handle such times? By moving closer to the shepherd! Have you lost your peace of mind today? Read the following Scriptures; they'll help you move closer to your Shepherd: 'But let all those rejoice who put their trust in You; let them ever shout for joy, because You defend them...' (Psalm 5:11 NKJV) 'The eternal God is your refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms...' (Deuteronomy 33:27 NIV) 'You will keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on You, because he trusts in You.' (Isaiah 26:3 NKJV) 'The Lord is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; and He knows those who trust in Him.' (Nahum 1:7 NKJV) For 'The Lord remembers us and will bless us...' (Psalm 115:12 NIV)

<introtext><![CDATA['...it was not you who sent me here, but God...' Genesis 45:8 NIV<br /><br />Are you in the dark about the direction God seems to be leading you? Jon Walker says, 'The choice to do His will before we know the specifics...develops trust of His character... This is where many people get into a battle of wills...wanting Him to reveal His plan first... That's not how He works. God wants you to decide in advance to trust Him...believing that His will is best for your life... He knows your hesitancy. He won't be surprised if you say, &quot;I don't know that I'm willing to step out in faith without knowing everything that's going to happen, but I'm willing to be made willing.&quot; One reason God doesn't give you the full picture...is you may be overwhelmed...it may appear impossible...but that's the point--there's no way you can fulfil your mission without Him.'

When Joseph was reunited with his brothers in Egypt, he told them, '...do not be angry with yourselves...it was not you who sent me here, but God...' (vv. 5;8) Joseph's brothers sold him out, 'but God' used it to preserve the Jewish race. The Israelites were in slavery, 'but God' sent Moses to lead them to the Promised Land. Jesus died on the cross, 'but God' used His death to save a lost world. Oswald Chambers calls God 'The Great Engineer, creating circumstances to bring about moments...of divine importance, leading us to divine appointments.' Think back; can't you recall some 'but God' moments of your own where you'd reached the end of your rope and He came through for you?<br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Sam 3:22-7:17, John 1:43-51, Ps 23, Pr 23:4-5<br />]]></introtext>

'...He will purify...and refine them like gold...' Malachi 3:3 NIV
<br /><br />




When gold is refined over extreme heat the first thing to come to the surface is dross. The next thing to be separated from it is silver, a less precious metal that blends with the raw gold ore. There's an important lesson here. Most of us are unable to separate the good from the best, so Malachi writes, 'He will purify...and refine them like gold'. God does it, because we don't know how! After committing adultery with Bathsheba, David writes, 'Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me.' (Psalm 51:10 NKJV) David prays for two things: a clean heart and a steadfast desire to walk in purity. 


Personal failure is usually the result of a slow, steady build-up, rather than a single act of disobedience. It happens when we focus on the wrong things and neglect our spiritual life. So God calls us to the place of solitude, a place with no distractions, in order to probe our deepest thoughts and open our eyes to certain issues that need attention. It is here He makes us aware of what we excuse, or try to hide from others. It's here the junk we've collected during the busy hours of our day gets filtered out. With the debris out of the way, we're able to see things more clearly and respond to God's nudgings. There's no way to have a deeper, more intimate relationship with God without the discipline James talks about: 'Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands...and purify your hearts...' (James 4:8 NKJV)

 '...I have never seen the righteous forsaken...' Psalm 37:25 NIV
<br /><br />




For many who've lost their jobs or who don't earn enough to live on, debt has become a harsh reality. So much so, that they're afraid to even think about their situation. But burying your head in the sand isn't the answer. With God's help and some common-sense suggestions you can start moving towards financial freedom. A respected financial consultant offers these suggestions. First, be truthful. Before you can change anything you need to know where your money's going. There's nothing to be ashamed of; like an alcoholic entering recovery, the first step is admitting you have a problem. On a card jot down every dollar you spend for 30 days. It adds up quickly, '...all...those little foxes...ruin the vineyard...' (Song of Solomon 2:15 NLT) By looking at the big picture, you'll see areas you can cut back. Second, learn from your past experiences. If you don't learn from the past you'll keep repeating it. For example, if you didn't receive many Christmas gifts as a child, it can be tempting to overcompensate with your own kids and end up maxing out your credit cards. Or, growing up in an atmosphere of financial turmoil can make it difficult to talk about money with your spouse. Third, value yourself more than your payslip. Jesus said the important things in life aren't 'things'. (Matthew 6:25) Beating yourself up won't help you earn more; it will just blind you to the real blessings in life. Remember, no matter how tough it gets, God is faithful. David said, 'I have never seen the righteous forsaken or their children begging', and you won't either!

'...God...will supply all your needs...' Philippians 4:19 NLT
<br /><br />




Here are three more steps you can take to deal effectively with debt. First, start digging yourself out. It's disheartening to find bills piling up on your doormat every day, but you need to know the bottom line. List your debts from the highest interest rate to the lowest. Try to pay as much as possible towards the highest and the minimum towards the rest. Make a start, no matter how long it takes; there's too much at stake not to. Second, model sound financial principles for your children. Be open with them and explain that electricity, food, toys and clothes cost money, and that the reason you're not driving the latest car is because you can't afford it. Your kids are making money memories now, so '...teach them diligently...' (Deuteronomy 6:7 NKJV) Third, 'give, and it will be given to you...' (Luke 6:38 NAS) Suze Orman says, 'One day I was in a terrible [state]. I turned on the TV and happened to catch a fundraiser. I picked up the phone and pledged as much as I could. Those people needed money more than me. Immediately I felt like a burden had been lifted. From then on whenever I felt down, I'd give...and I'd feel better. Amazingly in every instance the amount was showered back on me tenfold.' The rewards of giving aren't always financial; sometimes it's the sense of freedom and purpose that comes from doing it. Plus, money should never be so important that you can't let it go. Remember, by helping others you're paving the way for God to 'supply all your needs', and His shovel is much bigger than yours!

'God...is the...controller of all things.' 1 Timothy 6:15 PHPS
<br /><br />




We all worry from time to time, but wise people have learned to avoid over-anxiety by following these guidelines. (1) Define the situation clearly. What exactly is it you're worrying about? Be specific. Often when we take time to clarify the problem, a way to solve it will present itself. 


(2) Face the worst that can happen. Would you lose your job? Your relationship? Your investment? In most cases even if the worst did happen, chances are it wouldn't ruin you. It may be inconvenient or painful, but does it really warrant all the anxiety you're giving it? 


(3) Resolve to accept the outcome, whatever it is. Most of the stress of worry comes from denial, from not being willing to face the worst that could happen. Once you make up your mind to accept whatever happens, you'll find worry loses its power over you. 


(4) Work to improve the situation. Renowned neurologist James H Austin said, 'Chance favours those in motion.' Do all you can to ensure the best possible outcome, and '...after you have done everything...stand.' (Ephesians 6:13 NIV) Stand on God's promises! 


(5) Give the problem to God. He's 'the...controller of all things'. The Psalmist said, 'Those who know Your name will trust in You, for You, Lord, have never forsaken those who seek You.' (Psalm 9:10 NIV) Remember, nothing can happen to you today, or any other day, that God is not aware of, in control of, and able to bring you through.

'...Having believed, you were marked...with a seal...' Ephesians 1:13 NIV
<br /><br />




If you are having doubts about your salvation, understand this clearly: the moment you trusted in Christ as your Saviour, His blood cleansed you from all sin. At that point 'you were marked...with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit...guaranteeing [your]...redemption.' (vv. 13-14 NIV) The Bible says, 'You should not be like cowering fearful slaves. You should behave instead like God's very own children, adopted into His family--calling Him, &quot;Father, dear Father!&quot; For the Holy Spirit speaks to us deep in our hearts and tells us we are God's children. And since we are His children, we will share His treasures--for everything God gives to His Son, Christ, is ours too.' (Romans 8:15-16 NLT)


In the book of Ruth we read that 'the custom...in Israel concerning redeeming...[was] one man took off his sandal...gave it to the other, and this was a confirmation...' (Ruth 4:7 NKJV) Notice, the 'redeemer' put on another man's sandal, signifying his willingness to stand in his place. That's what Jesus did for us at the cross. He stood in our shoes so we could stand before God in His--redeemed and righteous! Don't let doubt steal your joy. Refuse to go by your feelings. Make up your mind to believe what God says, for until you do you'll be plagued by uncertainty. Study God's Word until you can say with assurance, '...I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is able to keep what I have committed to Him until that Day.' (2 Timothy 1:12 NKJV) Are you trusting in Christ as your Saviour? Then your salvation is not in doubt. The deal is sealed!

'...He leads me beside quiet waters.' Psalm 23:2 NIV
<br /><br />




Philip Yancey says, 'Faith means believing in advance, what will only make sense in reverse.' If you fear the future, look back and see how God took care of you in the past. 'This I call to mind and therefore I have hope: Because of the Lord's great love we are not consumed, for His compassions never fail. They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness... The Lord is good to those whose hope is in Him, to the one who seeks Him.' (Lamentations 3:21-25 NIV) You say, 'I don't know what I'll do if my loved one dies.' You will--when the time comes. You say, 'I don't know how I'll pay these bills.' Jehovah Jireh, the Lord who provides, will be there--when the time comes. You say, 'I'm not qualified to handle this, there's too much I don't know.' Maybe you want to know everything too soon. God will give you wisdom--when the time comes. The key is to meet today's problems with today's strength, and leave tomorrow in God's hands. During World War II, Arthur Sulzberger, publisher of The New York Times, found it hard to sleep or rid his mind of fear until he adopted these words from the hymn 'Lead, Kindly Light': 'I do not ask to see the distant scene; one step enough for me.' And God isn't going to let you see the distant scene either. No, He promises a lamp for your feet, not a crystal ball for your future. 'He leads me' and that's enough for today. And tomorrow? '...we will find grace to help us when we need it...' (Hebrews 4:16 NLT)

'He makes me lie down in green pastures...' Psalm 23:2 NIV
<br /><br />




Are you like the man who said, 'The devil never takes a vacation, so why should I?' Since when did the devil become your role model? The words 'He makes me lie down in green pastures' teach us that only the shepherd can choose the path, prepare the pasture, and protect us. Our role is simply to follow, feed and fellowship with Him. Getting the idea?


Of the Ten Commandments God gave to Moses, which one do you think required the most words? Adultery? No, that only took five words. Murder? No, that only took four words. The longest of the Ten Commandments is about taking a day off: 98 words! (Exodus 20:8-11) God knows us so well: He knew the store owner would say, 'Somebody's got to work that day; if I can't, my son will.' So God says, 'Nor your son.' 'Then my daughter will.' 'Nor your daughter.' 'Then an employee.' 'Nor your...servant.' God says, 'One day a week you'll say no to work and yes to worship. You'll slow down, sit down, lie down and rest. After all, I rested on the seventh day and the world didn't crash. So repeat after Me, 'It's not my job to run the world.' Charles Spurgeon said, 'The very sea pauses at ebb and flood; earth keeps the Sabbath of the wintry months, and man...must rest or faint, trim his lamp or let it burn low... In the long term we shall do more, by sometimes doing less.' The bottom line is that if you honour God's principles you will find rest for your body, mind and emotions.

'...I shall not want.' Psalm 23:1 KJV
<br /><br />




Do you remember when all the stuff you now have was stuff you only dreamed of? Now you realise that lasting joy doesn't come from what you drive, deposit or dwell in. The words 'The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want' teach us that what we have in God is greater than whatever else we don't have. Here are two stories to help you realise that. Story one: while on a short-term mission trip, Pastor Jack Hinton was leading worship at a leper colony when a woman who'd been facing away from the pulpit suddenly turned around. 'It was the most hideous face I'd ever seen,' Hinton said. Her nose and ears were entirely gone. She lifted a fingerless hand in the air and asked, 'Can we sing Count Your Blessings?' Overcome, Hinton left the service. He was followed by a team member who said, 'I guess you'll never be able to sing that song again.' 'Yes, I will,' he replied, 'but I'll never sing it the same way.' Story two: Doug McKnight was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis at 32. Over the next 16 years it would cost him his career, his mobility, and eventually his life. But he never lost his sense of gratitude. When his church friends asked him to compile a list of prayer requests, he responded by sending them 18 blessings for which to be grateful and six concerns for which to be prayerful. His blessings were three times greater than his needs! Doug McKnight discovered that what he had in God was greater than whatever else he didn't have in life. Have you discovered that yet?

'The Lord is my shepherd...' Psalm 23:1 KJV
<br /><br />




Abraham Lincoln wrote, 'I have been driven many times to my knees by the overwhelming conviction that I had nowhere else to go. My wisdom, and that of all about me, seemed insufficient for the day.' All of us feel that way at times. That's because we are all sheep in need of a shepherd. Of all God's creatures, sheep seem the least able to care for themselves. They're directionless: they'll walk off a cliff or wander into a river and drown. They're defenceless: they've no claws so they can't fight, run fast or climb a tree to safety. They're dirty: your cat and dog can clean themselves, but sheep get dirty and stay that way. You say, 'I don't like being compared to sheep.' All right, then answer these questions. How well do you control your impulses? Do you ever play the victim? Can you relate to Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde? Are you always upbeat and upright? Do you add to the conflict and confusion, or do you always make peace? Do you truly love people, or do you just use them for your own ends? Are you generous, or do you mostly give to those who have something to give back to you? On a scale of one to ten, how do you score when it comes to the fear of people, or failure, or sickness, or death, or rejection or risk? Is your life an open book? How often do you fail and need forgiveness: weekly? daily? hourly? It sounds like you need a shepherd! So instead of saying, 'The Lord is my shepherd', try saying, 'Because I need a shepherd, I make You Lord of my life'.

'...the sin that so easily trips us up...' Hebrews 12:1 NLT
<br /><br />




Achilles, the Greek hero of the Trojan War, was invulnerable, with one exception: his heel. Shoot him there and he'd go down. Guess what? He died from an arrow to the heel! We all have our Achilles' heel--the 'sin that so easily trips us up'. Here, blindness, indifference or denial sets us up for failure. So how do we overcome our Achilles' heel? Author John Piper offers us a solution in the form of an acronym: ANTHEM.


A: avoid sights and situations that arouse unfitting desires. Prevent what fuels your appetite for sin. N: say no to every lustful thought within five seconds. In the first two seconds shout 'No, get out of my head!' In the next two, cry out, 'Oh God, in the name of Jesus, help me. Save me now. I am yours.' Say it out loud. The Puritan writer John Owen said, 'Be killing sin, or it will be killing you.' T: turn the mind forcefully towards Christ. Attack sin with the promises of Christ. H: hold the promise and pleasure of Christ firmly in mind. For how long? Until it pushes other images out. Hold it. Don't let it go. Hold it until you win! E: enjoy a superior satisfaction, namely, pleasure in Christ. If you have little taste for Jesus, competing pleasures will triumph. M: move into useful activity, away from idleness and other vulnerable behaviours. Abound in the work of the Lord. (1 Corinthians 15:58) Replace deceitful lusts with a passion for good deeds. Today, using this simple acronym, you can move from vulnerability to victory by drawing on the power of God's Spirit within you. (Galatians 5:25)

'...forgiving one another...even as Christ forgave you...' Colossians 3:13 NKJV
<br />




The greatest power you have over anyone who hurts you is the power of forgiveness. When you say, 'I forgive, and no longer hold it against you', both sides are set free from the negative bond that exists between you. But there's more: we also free ourselves from the burden of being the 'offended one'. As long as we don't forgive those who've wounded us we take them with us, or worse, carry them like an albatross around our neck. One of our great temptations is to cling in anger to our enemies, then define ourselves as being wounded by them. Forgiveness, therefore, not only liberates the other party, but it also liberates us! It's the way to true freedom. Now, forgiving doesn't always mean forgetting. Though we forgive somebody, the memory of what they did might stay with us a long time. We can carry it in our emotions as a scar, or even in our bodies as a physical sign. But forgiveness changes how we remember. It turns the curse into a blessing. When we forgive our parents for their divorce, our children for their lack of love, our friends for their unfaithfulness in times of need, our counsellors for their bad advice, or our boss for treating us unfairly, we no longer have to experience ourselves as the victims of events over which we have no control. Forgiveness allows us to take back our power and not let the events embitter, limit or destroy us. Is there someone you need to forgive?

'Work...as...for the Lord...' Colossians 3:23 NLT
<br />




Dr Adrian Rogers said, 'God takes ordinary people and gives them power to do extraordinary things. Whether you put hub caps on tyres...key in data...dig ditches or wash dishes, ?Work...as...for the Lord...?(Colossians 3:23 NLT) Jesus' home was the cottage of a working man. Mending ploughs or mending souls, Jesus was doing God's work because people need houses and furniture. Knowing you're serving the Lord puts dignity in running a machine, servicing cars, carrying mail, painting houses, or cutting grass. Tell God, ?I'm doing this for you and I'll do it with all my might?... That kind of attitude puts a spring in your step... You're a priest of God...in full-time service, and if that doesn't ring your bell?your clapper's broken!' As Leigh Priebe Kearney says, 'No job's perfect...there'll always be things you aren't thrilled about. See the big picture: find out where the company's heading and how you fit in. Reach out: ask what's important to your co-workers and how you can help them.' You can have almost anything you want, if you help enough other people get what they want. Remember the three Cs: (1) Commitment. Workers who get ahead share a sense of commitment: they're fully engaged in their work. (2) Control. They're proactive, not passive. (3) Challenge. They see stressful situations as opportunities for growth. Don't wait for your ship to come in?swim out to meet it! Management won't suddenly recognise your potential, pluck you from obscurity and rocket you to the top. Draft a plan, then talk to your boss. A game plan shows you're open to professional growth. Keep learning: talk to people from other departments, take classes, and tackle projects outside your comfort zone.

<introtext><![CDATA[<br />Now the Lordsaid to Abram... Genesis 12:1 NKJV<br />Abraham trusted God to fulfil His promise, come what may. By faith he dwelt in the land of promise as in a foreign country, dwelling in tents... (Hebrews 11:9 NKJV) Some nights Abraham probably thought, I wish I was back home sleeping in my own bed. Being in Gods will gives you confidence, but it wont always make you comfortable. Following a plan you didnt devise, to a destination you see in your mind but cant explain, is called walking by faith. God decides the plan, moves you from point A to point B, and says, Trust me; Ive got it all worked out.  In 1945, before he met Billy Graham, Cliff Barrows and his fiancée, Billie, had scraped together enough funds for a simple wedding and two train tickets to a city with a resort hotel. On arrival, however, they found the hotel shut down. Stranded in an unfamiliar city with little money, they hitched a lift. A sympathetic driver took them to a grocery store owned by a woman he knew. The newlyweds spent their first night in a room above the store. The next day, when the lady overheard Cliff playing Christian songs on his trombone, she arranged for them to spend the rest of their honeymoon at a friends house. Several days later the host invited them to attend a youth rally where a young evangelist was speaking. The song leader that night was sick, and Cliff was asked to take charge of the music. The young evangelist, of course, was Billy Graham. The two became partners from then on. When things dont go your way, God has plans of His own. Better plans!<br /><br />SoulFood: Ezek 37:1 - 40:9, Luke 20:41-47, Ps 78:9-16, Pr 20:11-14<br />]]></introtext>

'These words which I command you...teach them diligently to your children.' Deuteronomy 6:6-7 NKJV
<br />




On Father's Day a pastor was making the point that it's not enough to 'talk the talk,' you must also 'walk the walk.' He said, 'It doesn't matter what you tell your kids, they'll turn out just like you. That scares me. Does it scare anyone else?' Looking over the congregation he saw that the only hand raised was his son's! 'As the twig is bent, so grows the tree.' As a father it's your responsibility to 'Train up a child in the way he should go.' (Proverbs 22:6 NKJV) Just as you nourish them with good food, the attitudes you transmit become food for their minds. Don't feed them cynicism and half-baked theology; feed them spiritually by talking to them about the things of God 'when you sit...walk...lie down...rise up.' (Deuteronomy 6:7 NKJV). Dr. D. James Kennedy observed: 'Sending children to public schools and [expecting] school to teach them everything is a relatively recent development. From the 1600s until the mid 19th century parents maintained responsibility for their children's education. And...the curriculum included Bible reading and prayers. Today...society has allowed the eradication of both. We can no longer rely on the school system to support Christian views, we must work even harder to ensure our children grow in Christ. How do we bend the twig? With a God-centred education that teaches sound moral principles...kids need high academic standards...and direction towards attaining them through discipline...guidelines, boundaries and rewards...Those of you who have children...don't give up. Keep bending [and shaping] the twig...one day you'll have a tree that stands tall and bears fruit for God's glory.'

'Exalt the Lord our God, and worship at His footstool...' Psalm 99:5 NKJV
<br />




Never lose your sense of wonder, or you'll lose your motivation for worship. Unless you believe God is all-powerful, ever-present and approachable, you'll live in a state of anxiety believing that everything depends on you. You'll shrink from sharing your faith in case you're ridiculed or can't find the right words. You'll fail to be generous because the source of your security is in yourself. You'll avoid confronting those who need it, because without the certainty of God's acceptance you become a slave to people's opinions.


We live in a cynical age that discourages wonder. We've diminished the marvel and awe, yet deep down we still ache for it. When you shrink your concept of God to fit your own rationale, you pray without faith, work without passion, serve without joy, and suffer without hope. And the result is fear, retreat and loss of vision. But there's one thing that's guaranteed to restore your understanding of how big and wonderful God is?worship. God created us so that when we experience something awe-inspiring we need to praise it, to wrap words around it. We don't worship God because He needs it, but because we do. Without worship our perception of Him is incomplete; we forget how great He is; we overlook our calling and become self-involved. We lose our sense of wonder and gratitude by plodding through life with blinkers on, and we become self-reliant, stubborn and proud. So, each day let us pause and say with the Psalmist, 'Exalt the Lord our God, and worship at His footstool...' (Psalm 99:5 NKJV)

'Lazy hands make a man poor, but diligent hands bring wealth.' Proverbs 10:4 NIV
<br />




Ruth was working as a farmhand when Boaz picked her to be his wife. Elisha was ploughing his fields when Elijah hired him to be his assistant. Peter, James and John were fishing when Jesus chose them to be disciples. God calls people with a proven work ethic. Not once did Jesus call lazy people, or those sitting around waiting for their big break. 


In God's eyes there are no menial jobs, only menial attitudes. Whether you're the caretaker or the CEO, '...it is required of stewards that one be found trustworthy.' (1 Corinthians 4:2 NAS) God will only give you more when you've proven yourself with what you've got. The Bible says, 'He who has a slack hand becomes poor, but the hand of the diligent makes rich.' (Proverbs 10:4 NKJV) 'The soul of a lazy man desires, and has nothing; but the soul of the diligent shall be made rich.' (Proverbs 13:4 NKJV) 'Do you see a man who excels in his work? He will stand before kings...' (Proverbs 22:29 NKJV) Blessing follows work just as surely as reaping follows sowing. 'The Lord will command the blessing on...all to which you set your hand...' (Deuteronomy 28:8 NKJV) God blesses dreams, but not daydreamers. You've got to get up and go to work! 'Then the Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to tend and keep it.' (Genesis 2:15 NKJV) When God made Adam He put him to work, because productivity is essential to self-esteem. So discern where you belong, work hard, then when something needs to be done God will know where to find you.

'Now the Lord...said to Abram...' Genesis 12:1 NKJV
<br />




We can learn so much from the life of Abraham. For example, that God can call us at any time of life. Without protesting or postponing, Abraham said, 'Yes, Lord!' And his unquestioning obedience is a rebuke to those of us who say, 'I'm too old, leave it to the younger ones,' or 'I've earned the right to relax and take it easy; let others do the heavy lifting.' There's no retirement in the service of the King of Kings! He has the right to ask us for anything, and send us anywhere at any season of life. We also learn that God's plan brings fulfilment, but it's always greater than our own personal fulfilment. Abraham was called to populate the entire Middle East: 'I will make you...a great nation...I will bless you...make your name great, and you shall be a blessing.' (Genesis 12:2 NIV) These words are a rebuke to those among us who seek to make a name for ourselves rather than allowing God to do it for us. In God's Kingdom you don't seek status, you earn it by being of service to others. Finally, we learn that God will treat others according to how they treat us. God told Abraham, 'I will bless those who bless you, and I will curse him who curses you...' (Genesis 12:3 NKJV) When we are in God's will we don't have to promote or protect ourselves, God will do it for us. 'He permitted no man to do them wrong; yes, He rebuked kings for their sakes, saying, 'Do not touch My anointed ones...' (1 Chronicles 16:21-22 NKJV) Knowing that sets us free to go where God wants us to go and do what He wants us to do.

'Now the Lord...said to Abram...' Genesis 12:1 NKJV
<br />




Abraham had the ability to hear God's voice. 'Now the Lord...said to Abram: 'Get out of your country, from your family and from your father's house, to a land that I will show you.' (Genesis 12:1 NKJV) Abraham couldn't turn to the Scriptures for guidance, and there were no prophets around to say, 'Thus saith the Lord.' Getting it right was critical. He was being called to leave his job, his home and his security. He needed to know that the voice he was hearing was truly God's voice. This leads us to conclude that Abraham had developed a relationship with the Lord, and building a relationship takes time, effort, sensitivity and commitment. Others may counsel you and confirm what God is telling you, but ultimately you must learn to hear from God for yourself. Nothing increases your confidence like knowing God has given you clear direction for your life.


Author Gary Thomas says he and his wife prayed extensively about buying a house and gave God many opportunities to close the door. Five years later, when the house was worth considerably less than they paid for it, they asked God, 'Why didn't You stop us?' At that point God's Spirit whispered, 'Have you ever considered the possibility that I wanted you in that neighbourhood to minister there, rather than to bolster your financial equity?' God didn't tell Abraham, 'Stay here, and I'll make you even richer.' No, He said, 'Get out.' Yes, he became rich. But does obedience obligate God to bless us in the way we think He should, or can it call us to sacrifice? Think about the Cross before you answer that one!

'The Lord demands fairness in...business... He sets the standard.' Proverbs 16:11 NLT
<br />




The Human Resources Director was taken aback when he heard what the job applicant asked to be paid. 'You certainly expect to be compensated well for a beginner.' The applicant replied, 'Well sure, work is a lot harder when you don't know what you're doing.' A cute story, but 'The Lord demands fairness in...business...' (Proverbs 16:11 NLT) You should give an honest day's work for an honest day's wages. Eric Harvey says, 'Think about somebody you know who's of good character, and reflect on the characteristics that make them a role model... Chances are that high on the list is commitment?an unwavering dedication to being a good family member and friend?to doing their best on and off the job...to doing what's right, noble and decent. Committed people...have their heads and hearts in the right place. They keep their priorities straight...stay focused on what's important... What they believe drives how they behave, and how they behave determines their character...their reputation...and the legacy they leave.' Abraham Lincoln observed, 'Commitment is what transforms a promise into reality. It's the words that speak boldly of your intentions, and the actions which speak louder than the words. It's making time when there is none...it's coming through time after time, year after year. Commitment is the stuff character's made of...the power to change the face of things...the daily triumph of integrity over scepticism.' An admirer approached the world-renowned pianist Van Cliburn after one of his concerts and said, 'I'd give my life to be able to play like you.' Smiling, Cliburn replied, 'I did!'

'...My Father never stops working, and so I keep working, too.' John 5:17 NCV <br />
A salesman stopped to visit a client and was amazed to find a big dog emptying wastebaskets. 'All part of the job!' the dog said cheerfully. 'Does your boss know how fortunate he is to have a talking dog?' the salesman asked. 'No,' replied the dog, 'and don't tell him?or he'll have me answering phones next!' The Bible says, '...there is nothing better than to...find satisfaction in work... these pleasures are from...God.' (Ecclesiastes 2:24 NLT) Max Lucado says, 'Before God gave Adam a wife or a child...He...gave him a job...in 'the garden...to cultivate...and keep it.' (Genesis 2:15 NAS) God deems work worthy of its own engraved commandment: 'You shall work six days, but on the seventh...you shall rest...' (Exodus 34:21 NAS) But emphasis on the day of rest can make us miss the command to work... your work matters to God...and society... Cities need plumbers. Nations need soldiers. Traffic lights break. Bones break... Someone has to raise kids, raise cane, and manage the kids who raise Cain! Whether you log on or lace up...you imitate God... Jesus said, 'My Father never stops working...so I keep working too.' (John 5:17 NCV) Your career consumes half of your lifetime. Shouldn't it broadcast God? Don't those 40-60 hours a week belong to Him too? The Bible never promotes workaholism...as pain medication, but God calls the physically able to till the gardens He gives... So use your uniqueness (what you do), to make a big deal out of God (why you do it), every day of your life (where you do it).'      <br />

'...do your work willingly...' Colossians 3:23 CEV
<br />




One of Michelangelo's greatest masterpieces was his sculpture of David. He worked on it with such passion that he often slept in his clothes, resenting the time it took to take them off and put them on again. He repeatedly examined and measured the marble to see what pose it could accommodate. He made hundreds of sketches of possible attitudes, and detailed drawings from models. He tested his ideas in wax on a small scale, and only when he was satisfied did he pick up his chisel and mallet. He approached the painting of the Sistine Chapel with the same intensity. Lying at uncomfortable angles on hard boards, breathing the suffocating air just under the vault, he suffered from inflamed eyes and skin irritation from the plaster dust. For the next four years he literally sweated in physical distress; but look at what he produced! Dr Martin Luther King Jr said, 'If a man is called to be a street sweeper he should sweep streets as Michelangelo painted, or Beethoven composed music, or Shakespeare wrote poetry. He should sweep streets so well that all the hosts of Heaven and Earth will pause and say, ?Here lived a great street sweeper who did his job well.?' If you're not passionate about what you do, find something you can be passionate about! Don't just strive to make money, strive to make a difference. Significance should be your goal, not survival. Paul gives us the ultimate reason for always giving our best: '...do your work willingly as though you were serving the Lord Himself...' (Colossians 3:23 CEV)

'I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.' Philippians 4:13 NKJV
<br />




When David first arrived at King Saul's palace he was a simple, unknown shepherd boy. But he had an impressive CV! God, in essence, said, 'I saw you kill the bear and the lion; I was watching when you didn't realise it.' Solomon wrote, 'A man's gift makes room for him...' (Proverbs 18:16 NKJV) David's gift may have been only a slingshot, but it opened the door to his future as Israel's king. So even though what you've got doesn't seem like much, give it to God and watch what He can do with it. You say, 'But I'm not formally trained.' All God requires is that you show up, say yes, and make yourself available. When you give God what you've got, He gives you what He's got; that makes your odds unbeatable. 'But I don't have the right credentials,' you say. So what? Benjamin Franklin had less than two years of formal schooling yet at 25 he founded America's first library, at 31 he started its first fire department, at 36 he designed a heating stove that's still in use today, at 40 he harnessed the power of electricity, at 45 he founded the nation's first university, and at 79 he invented bifocals. He was an economist, philosopher, diplomat, inventor, educator, publisher and linguist who spoke and wrote in five languages. Chances are, you already have more education than he had when he was your age. Add to that these two promises, 'The Lord is my helper...' (Hebrews 13:6 NKJV) and 'I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me', and you have what's required!

'...the Child grew and became strong...' Luke 2:40 NKJV
<br />




When do we get our first clue that Jesus knows He is the Son of God? In the temple when He was 12 years old. His parents are three days into the return trip to Nazareth before they notice He's missing. The temple is the last place they search, but it's the first place Jesus goes. By the time Joseph and Mary locate their son, He has confounded the most learned scholars in the temple. As a boy, Jesus already senses the call of God. But what does He do next? Recruit disciples and preach sermons? No, He goes back home and learns the family business. That's what you should do! Before you attempt to do great things for God, go home, love your family and take care of business. 'But I'm called to be a missionary,' you say. Good, because your first mission field is where you live! What makes you think you'll be believed by those who barely know you, if you're not credible to those who know you best? Charity begins at home! The Psalmist says, '...I will lead a life of integrity in my own home.' (Psalm 101:2 NLT) For His first 30 years, Jesus' neighbours remembered Him as a worker. '...He's just a carpenter...' (Mark 6:3 NLT) Jesus spent years developing a work ethic, sharpening His vocational skills and supporting His family. '...He had to be one of us...' (Hebrews 2:17 CEV) Why did Jesus do it that way? So He would know how we feel, and so we'd be confident in going to Him with our needs, knowing He's qualified and able to meet them. So, start where you are!

'...Those you allow to remain will become...thorns in your sides...' Numbers 33:55 NIV
<br />




Earthquakes result from two tectonic plates on a fault line shifting against one another, then lurching in opposite directions. And that's what happens when you bond with the wrong people. It's why God instructed the Israelites concerning the hostile nations in the Promised Land, 'Those you allow to remain will become...thorns in your sides.' When a relationship is not working, when your efforts to rehabilitate it have failed, acknowledge it. Sometimes you just have to swallow your pride and admit that instead of you lifting them up, they're dragging you down. Releasing somebody doesn't mean they'll never improve, it just means God is better suited to the job. Be careful around those who are always trying to make you feel guilty for not 'being there'. Only God can always be there! There's a difference between helping somebody and carrying them. Your help may actually be a hindrance. Why should they even try, if you're always there to do it for them? Your need to be needed could be getting in the way of their need to grow. Step back and let them walk on their own. Not everybody will be happy when you do that, but they're not supposed to be. Jesus said, 'Woe to you when all men speak well of you...' (Luke 6:26 NKJV) Don't let fear of criticism overwhelm your common sense. People don't take confrontations well, but this is a matter of survival. Every relationship is for a reason, and a season. Discern those who belonged in your past, from those who belong in your life now.

'...the Lord's unfailing love surrounds the man who trusts in Him.' Psalm 32:10 NIV
<br />




The most important choice you make each day is your choice of an attitude. So choose, first, an attitude of thanksgiving. 'In everything give thanks; for this is the will of God...for you.' (1 Thessalonians 5:18 NKJV) Paul was in prison when he wrote those words, so his attitude wasn't based on his surroundings; it was a choice he made. Second, choose an attitude of trust. '...the Lord's unfailing love surrounds the man who trusts in Him.' Where does such trust come from? Feeding daily on God's Word! Nehemiah's wall-builders were surrounded by enemies, yet they were able to 'celebrate...because they understood the words which had been made known to them.' (Nehemiah 8:12 NAS) God's Word gives you confidence! Satan doesn't fear your sin; he knows God can forgive it. He doesn't fear your depression; he knows God can drive it away. He doesn't fear your lack; he knows God can provide. He fears your discovery of God's Word, because your ignorance of it is the most effective weapon he can use against you. Finally, choose an attitude of love. 'These things I have spoken to you...that your joy may be full. This is My commandment, that you love one another...' (John 15:11-12 NKJV) Love says, 'I accept you as you are, care when you hurt, desire only what's best for you, and erase all offences.' It refuses to look for ways to run, and opts for working things through. It's resilient. While the world around gives the opposite advice, love stands firm.

'...you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you...' Acts 1:8 NLT
<br />




When Ray and Dorothy Buker went to Burma in 1926, there were other missionaries there. These missionaries had established their own banking system and afternoon tea routine, complete with trained butlers, none of which fitted Buker's concept of preaching the Gospel. A former Olympian, accustomed to hardship, he wanted to go where others wouldn't, and that brought him north into China. When his wife suffered a nervous breakdown and help wasn't available, Buker prayed, read to her, and nursed her back to health. During World War II he fled for his life from the Japanese army, and when he died at 92 he left a legacy of souls won to Christ. Where did Buker get his grit and tenacity? Jesus said, 'When the Holy Spirit has come upon you, you will receive power to preach with great effect.' (Acts 1:8 TLB) During the early days of computers, when the power went out, if you hadn't saved your work you lost it. Now an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) stops that from happening. God never intended us to operate using the world's system, because His Spirit gives us the power to do five things. First, we are given the power to choose, by keeping us 'established...[strong in...purpose]...having control over [our]...will and desire...' (1 Corinthians 7:37 AMP) Second, we have the power to endure. Handling trials with grace proves that 'our...power is from God, not from ourselves.' (2 Corinthians 4:7 NLT) Third, we are given the power to overcome: 'We are weak...but...we...live...by the power of God.' (2 Corinthians 13:4 RSV) Fourth, we are given the power to minister: 'According to the...working of His power.' (Ephesians 3:7 RSV) Finally, we have the power to witness: 'For the Kingdom of God depends not on talk but on power.' (1 Corinthians 4:20 NRS) You have the power, so use it!

'...God loves a person who gives cheerfully.' 2 Corinthians 9:7 NLT
<br />




A child who had just learned to tie his shoelaces was crying, so his mum asked, 'Is it that hard?' 'No,' he sobbed, 'but now I'll have to do it for the rest of my life!' Is that how you feel about giving? You want to learn, but you're not sure that you want to make it a lifestyle? 


Some swallows were teaching their young to fly from a branch overhanging a lake. One by one the mother bird pushed each of her chicks to the end, until somewhere between the branch and the water they discovered they could fly. Their mother understood what they didn't: until you learn to fly you're not really living! Understand this: giving is an action built into us by God; it's the air into which we were born. But until you realise that, you'll cling to everything you have! The Bible says, '...Whoever sows generously will also reap generously.' (2 Corinthians 9:6 NIV) Everything in life begins with a seed. Your seed is anything that can multiply: your love, your time or your money. Your harvest is what comes back to you in benefits such as joy, good relationships, and?yes?finances. If what you have is not enough to be a harvest, sow it as a seed, believing God will multiply it back to you in the areas you need it most. Go ahead, you'll love the results! Giving is like flying. When you learn to let go of what you're clinging to and launch out, you will realise, 'This is how I was born to live!'

<introtext><![CDATA[<br /> '...When he was still a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion [on him]...' Luke 15:20 NKJV <br /> Chuck Colson writes, 'When I was at Buckingham Palace...Prince Philip asked me, &quot;What can we do about crime here in England?&quot; I replied, &quot;Send more children to   Sunday school.&quot; He thought I was joking. But I pointed out a study by sociologist Christy Davies, which found that in the first half of the 1800s British society was marked by high levels of crime and violence, which dropped dramatically in the late 1800s and early 1900s. What changed an entire nation's national character? Throughout that period attendance at   Sunday schools rose steadily until, by 1888, a full 75 percent of children in England were enrolled. Since then attendance has fallen off...with a corresponding increase in crime and disorder. If we fill the   Sunday schools we can change hearts and restore society.   Does that mean our children will never lose their way? No, it just means they'll realise the truth of what they were taught, recall the joys of being in 'Father's house', and return because they know they'll be welcomed back. You'll notice, no charge of parental neglect is laid at the doorstep of the prodigal's father. He was a great role model. He supported his children financially and emotionally. He guided them without forcing them to conform. He gave them room to fail and a place to return. What does reflect on us as parents, however, is our attitude towards our children. Your child may be 'a great way off', but they need to know you care, that you love and pray for them, and that you'll welcome them home.      <br /><br /> SoulFood: Ezek 14:1-16:52, Luke 19:1-10, Ps 103:1-12, Pr 19:12-16 <br />]]></introtext>

'...love your neighbour...' Mark 12:31 NKJV
<br />




There are two things we should never do: First, to expect to feel fully at home in this world, because '...we are citizens of Heaven...' (Philippians 3:20 NLT), and second, to become so heavenly minded that we are no earthly use. The 'salt' and 'light' principles Jesus taught call for us to influence and illuminate others for good and for God. That means taking responsibility to do things better at home, on the job, and in all our dealings. If the only people you show genuine care for are in your church, your salt isn't flavouring and your light isn't dispelling darkness. Christ's command to 'Love your neighbour' includes the less-than-lovable. And you only love others when you add value to their lives! You may ask, 'How do I do that?' Here are four suggestions. First, by truly valuing them. That calls for believing in them before they believe in you, serving them before they serve you, loving them before they love you, and giving to them without expecting anything in return. Second, by making yourself more valuable. You can't give what you don't have, so you must earn and grow in order to give and guide. Third, by knowing what they value. What happens when you're interested only in your own agenda? You know very little about the people around you. Make others' priorities your priorities. Ask to hear their stories. Discover their hopes and dreams. Make their success part of your mission. Finally, by doing things that God values. When your life is done, what will you have lived for? Eventually, everything on earth will turn to dust? including you! So give yourself to things that will last beyond your lifetime.

<introtext><![CDATA[<br /> ‘...when he saw him, he had compassion.’ Luke 10:33 NKJV <br /> <br /> The priest and the Levite in the story of the Good Samaritan saw the plight of the injured man, but the Good Samaritan exercised compassion and did something about it. So, ask yourself, ‘Have I become too calloused to care or too busy to be bothered?’ There’s so much need around us, and—God knows—we can’t meet all of it. But what needs are you called to meet? Next time you see the Salvation Army asking for donations, remember how it all started. There was a couple who were living in London 155 years ago. For the first ten years of their time there, William Booth was in a quandary: what was God calling him to do? One day his wife Catherine, a Bible teacher, was invited to speak at a local event. While they were there William took a late–night walk through the slums of the East End. Every fifth building was a pub. Most had steps at the counter so little children could climb up and order gin. That night he told Catherine, ‘I seem to hear a voice sounding in my ears, “Where can you go to find such heathen as these, and where is there so great a need for your labours?” Darling, I have found my destiny!’ Later that year, 1865, the couple opened the East London Christian Mission in London’s slums. Their life’s vision: to reach the down–and–outers who other Christians ignored. That simple vision of two people grew into the Salvation Army, which ministers through over three million members in 113 nations. Now, stop and ask yourself, ‘Do I have compassion for others?’ <br /> <br /> <br /><br /> SoulFood: Judges 7:1–9:33, Luke 13:18–35, Ps 119:65–72, Pr 17:23–26 <br />]]></introtext>

‘...let us follow the Spirit’s leading...’ Galatians 5:25 NLT
<br />


<br />
Charles Spurgeon said that if we are not seeking the Lord, the Devil is seeking us. And he gets us when we lower our guard and become complacent. If you’re serious about living a godly life, read on.
<br />
‘Live according to your new life in the Holy Spirit. Then you won’t be doing what your sinful nature craves. The old sinful nature loves to do evil, which is just the opposite of what the Holy Spirit wants. And the Spirit gives us desires that are the opposite of what the sinful nature desires. These two forces are constantly fighting each other, and your choices are never free from this conflict… When you follow the desires of your sinful nature, your lives will produce these evil results: sexual immorality, impure thoughts, eagerness for lustful pleasure, idolatry, participation in demonic activities, hostility, quarrelling, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambition, divisions, the feeling that everyone is wrong except those in your own little group. Envy, drunkenness, wild parties, and other kinds of sin… But when the Holy Spirit controls our lives, He will produce this kind of fruit in us; love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self control… Those who belong to Christ Jesus have nailed the passions and desires of their sinful nature to His cross and crucified them there. If we are living now by the Holy Spirit, let us follow the Holy Spirit’s leading in every part of our lives.’ (Galatians 5:16–25 NLT) When you get serious about living a godly life, God will help you.

'...Bring me seventy...who are known...as leaders...' Numbers 11:16 NIV
<br />




A group of neighbourhood children built a treehouse and formed their own club. When the grown-ups were told who had been selected for each office, they were astonished to hear that a four-year-old boy had been elected president. 'He must be a born leader,' one dad observed. 'How did it happen that all you bigger boys voted for him?' His son replied, 'Well, he can't very well be secretary because he doesn't know how to read or write. He couldn't be treasurer because he can't count. He would never do for sergeant-at-arms because he's too little to throw anybody out. If we didn't choose him for anything, he'd feel bad. So we made him president.' Life doesn't work that way! You don't become successful by default; instead, you must work from your God-given strengths. In life, your purpose is always connected to your giftedness. God doesn't call you to do something you've no talent for. God told Moses, 'Bring me seventy...who are known to you as leaders.' You cannot grow to your full potential if you continually work outside your core strengths. Improvement is always related to ability. Do you know what happens when you spend all your time working on your weaknesses, and never develop your strengths? If you work really hard you could claw your way up to mediocrity, but you'll never get beyond it. Economic necessity and family responsibility may require you to work for a season outside the area of your core strengths, but don't settle there. Seek God's guidance, sharpen your gifts, be patient, and God will open doors for you.

<introtext><![CDATA[<br /> '...who may enter Your presence?...those who...do what is right...' Psalm 15:1-2 NLT<br /> Charles Swindoll writes, 'Behind the scenes...life can be...a facade held together with cheap material. Solomon was a man upon whom God showered wisdom, success and wealth... But he let his relationship with the Lord slip... Some say success can ruin a man. I say it reveals who he was all along. Success doesn't destroy character, it exposes it. During Solomon's reign Israel's wealth continued to build. David had won peace with an aggressive military campaign, and surrounding kingdoms held Israel in high regard... The threat to Solomon's kingdom came from within. Like his father David, Solomon had many wives. They enticed him into idolatry, and when Rehoboam became king Israel was divided. The public man appeared genuine...but behind the scenes he emulated his father and grandfather. (2 Chronicles 11:18-23) He nurtured a public image while passing on a dark legacy to his sons...polishing his image by appearing to seek wise counsel, then rejecting it in favour of advice from his peers... When the kingdom's wealth was pilfered by Egypt, Rehoboam replaced the gold shields with bronze ones polished to shine like gold, but worthless in comparison...a third-class substitute after a first-class blunder... &quot;Like produces like&quot;-a lust for sensuality produced children with lust in their hearts. Within a generation or two a seed of compromise grew to rebellion in full bloom. David's compromise weakened Solomon, and Solomon's impacted Rehoboam. Finally, the sin mum loved and dad permitted, entangled the son. Have you fooled yourself into thinking you can manage the consequences of sin? Or considered the effect on the people you influence? If cameras were to film every aspect of your life, what would we see?'      <br /><br /> SoulFood: Lam 1:1-3:39, Luke 16:19-31, Ps 119:121-128, Pr 18:13-20<br />]]></introtext>

'...I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision.' Acts 26:19 NKJV
<br />




Paul had a 'heavenly vision'. But there are those who '...speak a vision of their own heart, not from the mouth of the Lord.' (Jeremiah 23:16 NKJV) So you must be sure you are operating according to God's plan, neither your own nor somebody else's. The story of the Tower of Babel teaches us two things. First, that when people make up their mind to do something, they often succeed; and second, that succeeding doesn't mean that you're in the will of God. The word Babel (confusion) means others can think you're right, yet you're wrong. You ask, 'But isn't it all right to make plans and set goals?' Yes, but your plans and goals should come out of a vision that God has given you.


When Paul said, 'I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision', he meant that there's only one acceptable response to God's plan?obedience! Partial obedience, selective obedience or delayed obedience are still all disobedience. William Carey, who is considered the father of modern missions, gave up comfort and fortune to go to India and introduce the Gospel. One of his more memorable quotes is: 'Expect great things from God; attempt great things for God.' But you can only say that with confidence when you know what God has called you to do. What He ordains, He sustains! When you set your own goals you lack a heartfelt confidence that God is doing the work, so you wear yourself out thinking it's all up to you. However, when you know God has given you a vision for your life, you trust Him, even when you can't see any way to bring it to pass.

'...I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision.' Acts 26:19 NKJV
<br />




When God gives you a vision: (1) It will interrupt you. Sometimes God will speak in a voice you can't tune out. Other times, like Jonah, God will let you go to the bottom to get your attention. Either way, things won't go right until you say yes to Him. (2) It will illuminate you. You may not like what God says. Ananias didn't like going to pray for Saul of Tarsus, a man with the power to put Christians to death. But God said, 'Go, for he is a chosen vessel... I will show him how many things he must suffer for My name's sake.' (Acts 9:15-16 NKJV) Notice the word 'suffer'. The devil isn't going to send you a congratulatory telegram because you have decided to do God's will, so be prepared for attack. (3) It will inspire you. You will accomplish things you never dreamed possible. Look at Gideon. When God found him he was hiding in a winepress (Judges 6:11 NKJV); not exactly a promising start. When the angel called him 'a mighty man of valour' (v 12 NKJV), he replied, 'I am the least in my father's house.' (v 15 NKJV) When the angel said, 'The Lord is with you,' he replied, 'If the Lord is with us, why then has all this happened to us?' (vv 12-13 NKJV) When he finally took the job, he wondered, 'How can so few of us defeat so many of them?' Yet at that very moment his enemies were having nightmares about him. (Judges 7:13-15) The secret of victory lies in knowing that it is God working in me. (Philippians 2:13)

'No...I am still not all I should be, but I am focusing...on...forgetting the past and looking forward...' Philippians 3:13 NLT
<br />




A little boy came home one day with his clothes all muddy so his Mum sent him to the basement to drop them into the washing machine. Later, thinking things were a bit too quiet, she shouted, 'Young man, I hope you're not down there running around in your underwear.' Imagine her embarrassment when a strange voice replied: 'No ma'am, I'm down here servicing your furnace.' James says, '...we all make...mistakes...' (James 3:2 NLT) The trick is learning to forgive yourself. Much of the time we're guilty of doing the wrong thing with the right motive. Remember the famous Leaning Tower of Pisa in Italy, where the architect designed a  three metre deep foundation for a 55 metre tall building? How would you like that on your CV? The Apostle Paul said, 'No...I am still not all I should be, but I am focusing...on...forgetting the past and looking forward...' (Philippians 3:13 NLT) Chuck Swindoll writes: 'Show me the guy who wrote the rules for perfectionism, and I'll guarantee he's a nail biter with a face full of tics...whose wife dreads to see him come home.' God said, 'I...am He who blots away your sins...and will never think of them again.' (Isaiah 43:25 TLB) Now, if God is willing to pardon your mistakes and even bury them, isn't it time you stopped beating yourself up, received His grace and moved on?

'...take the stumbling block out of the way...' Isaiah 57:14 NKJV
<br />




To fulfil your God-given purpose in life you must confront your defects of character, see them as stumbling blocks and begin to remove them. Here are six of the most common ones. (1) Pride. Spiritual pride, social pride?God hates all forms of pride. His Word says, '...with humility...regard one another as more important than yourselves.' (Philippians 2:3 NAS) Pride toppled Satan from his high position in Heaven, and it will topple you too if you let it. (2) Insecurity. Insecure people aren't willing to take risks. They complain about their lot in life, yet they're afraid to embrace change and do something about it. They prefer to remain comfortable. What's the solution? Stepping out in faith, being confident in God! (3) Moodiness. Moody people are like the wind?you don't know which way they'll blow. You can't depend on them. Confidence is never built on a person who's fickle. (4) Perfectionism. Perfectionism is the obsessive need to perform flawlessly. It stifles your creativity, and turns others off. Perfectionists can't affirm themselves, therefore it's difficult for them to affirm anybody else. (5) Over-sensitivity. Over-sensitive people are always licking their wounds and looking inward; as a result, they're unaware of the needs of others. Ironically, they never understand why they're so lonely. (6) Negativity. Negative people are hard to be around. Their personality says no to life in general, and people tend to avoid them like the plague. Do you recognise any of these stumbling blocks in your life? If so, pray, ask God for help, and start to remove them.

'God has given gifts to each of you.' 1 Peter 4:10 NLT
<br />




Your work is important to God. Your job might use as much as 40 hours in a week, so it should represent Him. 'God has given gifts to each of you...Manage them well...then God will be given the glory.' We've each been given talents for the purpose of honouring God in this world. Undiscovered, undeveloped gifts dishonour Him; so do misused ones. God has gifted you to do something in a way nobody else can. By tapping into your unique abilities and using them to promote His Kingdom, you're fulfilling His will in the truest sense. Paul says, '...everything comes from Him...and is intended for His glory...' (Romans 11:36 NLT) The breath we breathe, the blood that courses through our veins, the grey matter between our ears are all God's investment in us, and He expects a return. Max Lucado writes, 'We exist to exhibit God, to display His glory. We serve as canvases for His brush strokes, papers for His pen, soil for His seeds, and glimpses of His image... He uncommons the common by turning kitchen sinks into shrines, cafes into convents, and nine-to-five workdays into spiritual adventures... When you magnify your Maker with your strengths...your days grow suddenly sweet.' So, be like the great New England preacher Jonathan Edwards, who lived by two resolutions: 'Resolved first: that all men should live for the glory of God. Resolved second: that whether others do or not, I will.'

‘...we…are…one body, and each member belongs to all the others.’ Romans 12:5 NIV
<br />


<br />
If you’re wise you’ll pray, ‘Lord, who do I need in my life at this time?’ and, ‘Who do you want me to help?’ The first question requires humility, the second requires unselfishness. There’s no limit to what can be accomplished when nobody cares who gets the credit. A great illustration of this is the life of Tenzing Norgay, a Sherpa born in Nepal. He tells how he and Edmund Hillary, a New Zealander, accomplished what no other human beings ever had: conquering Mount Everest. Tenzing says, ‘For each level we reached, a higher degree of teamwork was required. One group would exhaust themselves just getting the equipment up the mountain for the next group. Two–man teams would work finding a path, cutting steps, securing ropes, spending themselves to make the next leg of the climb possible for others. You don’t climb a mountain like Everest by trying to race ahead on your own or by competing with your comrades. No, you do it slowly and carefully, by unselfish teamwork. Certainly I wanted to reach the top myself; it was the thing I’d dreamed of all my life. But if the lot fell to someone else I would take it like a man, not a crybaby. Where would Hillary and I have been without the others? Without the climbers who made the route? The Sherpas who carried the loads? Those who cleared the path ahead? It was only through the work and sacrifice of them all that we had our chance at the top.’ The Bible teaches, ‘We…are…one body, and each member belongs to all the others.’ So let’s keep that in mind today and try to work together!

<introtext><![CDATA[<br />
‘...Seek out…men of good reputation…whom we may appoint over this business.’ Acts 6:3 NKJV
<br />


<br />
Good leaders practise four qualities. First, submission. Only a leader who has followed well knows how to lead others well. Connecting with people becomes possible because you’ve walked in their shoes. Leaders who’ve never submitted to authority tend to be proud, unrealistic and autocratic. Second, self–discipline. To make consistently good decisions requires character and self–discipline. To do otherwise is to lose control of ourselves. British essayist John Foster writes, ‘A man without decision of character can never be said to belong to himself. He belongs to whatever can make a captive of him.’ Peter writes, ‘Knowing God leads to self–control.’ (2 Peter 1:6 NLT) Third, patience. Leaders look ahead, think ahead and want to move ahead. That’s what makes them leaders. But the true goal of leadership is not to cross the finishing line first, but to take as many others with you as you can. For that reason you have to deliberately slow your pace, stay connected to your people, keep them informed and inspired, enlist the help of others to fulfil your vision, and keep going. And you can’t do that if you’re running too far ahead of everybody. Solomon writes, ‘Finishing is better than starting. Patience is better than pride.’ (Ecclesiastes 7:8 NLT) Finally, accountability. Many people feel that accountability is a willingness to explain your actions. In reality, real accountability begins long before you take action. Most wrong actions come about because we are not being accountable early enough.

‘The Lord was with Joseph...’ Genesis 39:2 NKJV
<br />


<br />
Joseph didn’t come from an ideal family. He was the eleventh son of Jacob, a con–man and a conniver. By this time, however, Jacob had got his spiritual act together. But his ten older sons took after their dad. They once deceived and killed an entire town of men because one of them raped their sister (Genesis 34). Now they’re about to commit another deed of treachery, selling Joseph into slavery. Yet Joseph turned out to be a man of greatness. What’s the bottom line? That you can rise above your beginnings! Look at Joseph. Perhaps you’ve been rejected, or discovered the people you thought loved you really didn’t. That’s Joseph’s story. But, ‘The Lord was with Joseph’. Those words change everything! Regardless of what happened yesterday, if you remain faithful to God He can rearrange tomorrow in your favour. Many people who’ve been mistreated are still focusing on the people who hurt them, waiting for them to make things right. In a lot of cases that isn’t going to happen. If you’ve been wronged you need to turn to the One who won’t hurt you, and who is there to help and heal you. Face it; some relationships aren’t going to get fixed! Your parents may never accept you. You may not be able to escape the problem you’ve been living with or resolve it to your liking. God’s not limited by your past, He’s only limited by your lack of faith. So trust Him. ‘...If God is for us, who can be against us?’ (Romans 8:31 NIV) If God is for you, in the final analysis it doesn’t matter who’s against you.

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<br /> ‘...we are not ignorant of [Satan’s] devices.’ 2 Corinthians 2:11 NKJV <br /> <br /> Satan, whom the Bible refers to as ‘the tempter’, works like a seasoned fisherman in two ways. First, he knows that fish get hungry, and he knows when they’ll be biting. Understand this: you were born with a hole in your soul that only God can fill, and unless you turn to God and build a relationship with Him, you’ll keep trying to fill that hole with the wrong things. ‘Where can I find the right things?’ you ask. The Psalmist answers, ‘...In Your presence is fullness of joy; at Your right hand are pleasures forevermore.’ (Psalm 16:11 NKJV) There’s a marked difference in how Joseph responded to temptation with Potiphar’s wife and how David responded to it with Bathsheba. David looked, and kept looking, but Joseph fled. The Bible says, ‘...if sinners entice you, do not consent.’ (Proverbs 1:10 NKJV) Be honest with yourself. Acknowledge that there are places you shouldn’t go, habits you shouldn’t indulge, and company you should never be in. Second, he knows what bait will hook the fish. Next time somebody fails and you’re tempted to think, ‘I’d never do that,’ stop and ask yourself, ‘What would it take to make me bite?’ You may not know the answer to that question at the moment, but Satan does. And he is patient; he’ll wait a lifetime if he has to, he’s in no hurry. He doesn’t mind whether you fall through ‘youthful lusts’, or on the last few laps through more subtle sins, so long as you lose the race. So, ‘don’t take the bait’. <br /> <br /> <br /><br /> SoulFood: Judges 1–3, Luke 12:49–59, Ps 119:49–56, Pr 17:18–21  <br />]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<br /> ‘God is…a very present help in trouble.’ Psalm 46:1 NKJV <br /> <br /> Randy Reid, a 34–year–old construction worker, was welding on top of a nearly completed water tower outside Chicago. According to writer Melissa Ramsdell, Reid unhooked his safety gear to reach for some pipes when a metal cage slipped and bumped the scaffolding on which he stood. It tipped, and Reid lost his balance. He fell about 35m, landing face down on a pile of dirt, just missing rocks and construction debris. A fellow worker called the emergency services. When paramedics arrived, they found Reid conscious, moving, and complaining of a sore back. Apparently the fall didn’t cost Reid his sense of humour! As paramedics carried him on a backboard to the ambulance, Reid had one request: ‘Don’t drop me.’ Doctors later said Reid came away from the accident with just a bruised leg.  <br /> Sometimes we resemble Randy Reid. God protects us from harm in a 35m fall, yet we are not willing to trust Him to get us over the next 35cm hurdle. Being sinful, we fail. Being prone to sickness, we hurt. Being mortal, we die. Pressure wears on us. Anxiety gives us ulcers. People intimidate us. Criticism offends us. Disease scares us. Death haunts us. What’s the answer? ‘God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.’ (Psalm 46:1 NKJV) Note the words ‘very present’. When we hit life’s rough spots our tendency is to feel abandoned, yet the opposite is true. At that very moment we are more than ever the object of His love and concern. Yes, even when our vision is blurred, our thinking foggy, our faith fleeting, and we look up and can’t see Him clearly—He is ‘very present’. <br /> <br /> <br /><br /> SoulFood: Esther 4:13–5:3, Matt 6:16–21, Mark 2:18–22  <br />]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<br /> ‘Look at the birds in the sky!...’ Matthew 6:26 CEV <br /> <br /> Lost and stray geese are always welcomed into the formation. It’s not an exclusive club for the elite. Birds separated from other formations, isolated by weather, accident or infirmity, are given full family status. The formation will alter its plans, reschedule its arrival time and inconvenience itself to accommodate any strangers seeking its acceptance. Many newcomers arrive dirty, bedraggled and ill–fed. They’re never turned away. In the same way, God’s church isn’t a museum for masterpieces—it’s a hospital for those who have been hurt by life, even self–inflicted hurt. Jesus said, ‘...All…who are weary and carry heavy burdens...’ are accepted. (Matthew 11:28 NLT) ‘I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also… there shall be one flock and one shepherd.’ (John 10:16 NIV) Christ has no higher agenda than to recruit, save and adopt the stranger into His flock. You say, ‘But they’re not my kind of people; they don’t look, talk or smell like me!’ So what? We don’t get to choose our biological or spiritual siblings; God does. If they rub us like sandpaper, they’re helping rub off rough edges and polish us up. Want to see the material God builds the church with? Prepare yourself for a shock. ‘...The unrighteous…fornicators…idolaters… adulterers…homosexuals…thieves…covetous…drunkards…revilers…extortioners… And such were some of you. But you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God.’ (1 Corinthians 6:9–11 NKJV) When we were taken into the formation we were washed, sanctified, justified and given full family status! <br /> <br /> <br /><br /> SoulFood: Deut 32:29–34:12, Luke 12:1–12, Ps 119:17–24, Pr 17:7–10 <br />]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<br /> ‘You will seek Me and find Me when you seek Me with all your heart.’ Jeremiah 29:13 NIV <br /> <br /> Is your prayer life consistent? Is it rich and rewarding? Do you see measurable growth in it? If not, François Fénelon, a 17th–century Frenchman, tells us how to pray and get results. It’s a tried and true formula worth following: <br /> ‘Tell God all that is in your heart, as one unloads one’s heart, its pleasures and its pains, to a dear friend. Tell Him your troubles that He may comfort you; tell Him your longings that He may purify them; tell Him your dislikes that He may help you conquer them; tell Him your temptations that He may shield you from them; show Him the wounds of your soul that He may heal them; lay bare your indifference to good, your depraved taste for evil, your instability. Tell Him how self–love makes you unjust to others, how vanity tempts you to be insincere, how pride hides you from yourself and from others. If you thus pour out all your weaknesses, needs and troubles, there will be no lack of what to say. You will never exhaust the subject, for it is continually being renewed.  <br /> People who have no secrets from each other never want for subjects of conversation. They do not weigh their words for there is nothing to be held back. Neither do they seek for something to say. They talk out of the abundance of their heart. Without consideration, they simply say just what they think. When they ask, they ask in faith, confident that they will be heard. Blessed are those who attain such familiar, unreserved communication with God.’ <br /> <br /> <br /><br /> SoulFood: 1 Pet 1–5, Luke 12:13–21, Ps 119:25–32, Pr 17:11–15  <br />]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<br /> ‘Look at the birds in the sky!...’ Matthew 6:26 CEV <br /> <br /> In the world of geese, the aged, very young, and infirm are kept protected in the rear of the formation. But they aren’t isolated, discounted or considered useless; in fact they fulfil a vital role. They become the honking section and cheer for the leaders. Inevitably, bad weather threatens the mission. The going gets tough and the tough are struggling. From the rear of the formation a lone honk sounds, initiating a geese chorus honking encouragement to the point goose. Paul understood this: ‘...encourage one another and build each other up...’ (1 Thessalonians 5:11 NIV) He knew we need a ‘honking section’ supporting us with uplifting words and prayer. We need those who say, ‘We are behind you. We’ve got your back covered!’ ‘But…you, brethren, do not grow weary in doing good.’ (2 Thessalonians 3:13 NKJV) Many a servant of Christ has crossed their deepest valley on a wing, a prayer and a honk from some old scarred, battle–hardened, straggle–feathered, half–bald honker of encouragement who was too stubborn to let a brother or sister quit on their watch! Occasionally, a strident, out–of–tune goose complains loudly and irritatingly. Within moments the honking section kicks in, drowning out the grumbler, restoring order and unity. The church’s problem isn’t too many people speaking negatively, it’s too few speaking positively! When someone cries, ‘defeat’, honk back, ‘victory’! When they cry, ‘fear’, honk back, ‘faith’. A few words of encouragement can overpower a storm of complaints. So join the honking section and be known like Barnabas, whose name means ‘Son of Encouragement’. (Acts 4:36 NIV) <br /> <br /> <br /><br /> SoulFood: Deut 28–29, Luke 11:29–44, Ps 119:1–8, Pr 17:3 <br />]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<br /> ‘Look at the birds in the sky!...’ Matthew 6:26 CEV <br /> <br /> Every formation has to have a ‘point goose’ out front who leads and sets the pace for the others. It’s a tough position because the point goose cuts the headwinds, meets the changing weather conditions, and is first to feel the rain in his face, the snow in his eyes and the ice on his wings. He keeps the formation on target whatever the situation. It’s hard, exhausting and lonely at times because there’s nobody ahead of him to be the wind beneath his wings. The formation depends on him to persevere, stay on track and get the skein safely to its destination. <br /> Every church has its point goose: the pastor. Each department has its point geese: youth, finance, evangelism, care ministries, and so on. They lead, set the pace and give direction to those who follow. There are two common roles in the church: the under–employed and the over–functioning. Point ministries are the latter, so they tend to burn out frequently. Just before the point goose is exhausted, a space opens in the formation and he slips back into it while another bird replaces him, seamlessly becoming the next point goose. Standing in for each other preserves the life of the formation. This is what Paul meant: ‘The whole body [is] held together by what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part...’ (Ephesians 4:16 NAS) Don’t be content to be a consumer; instead, be a producer! A great church isn’t about paid staff; rather, it’s about volunteers willing to stand in whenever needed. <br /> <br /> <br /><br /> SoulFood: Deut 25–27, Luke 11:14–28, Ps 78:65–72, Pr 17:1–2 <br />]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<br /> ‘Look at the birds in the sky!...’ Matthew 6:26 CEV <br /> <br /> With geese, their relationship is ‘till death do us part’. They take it seriously. They’re fully committed. When the ravages of time or circumstances make it impossible for a bird to continue the trip and it begins to lose altitude or fails to keep abreast of the formation, the gaggle provides it with comfort, nurture and protection. Two strong geese leave the formation, flying with the ‘patient’ safely between them, find a sheltered location with food and water and make a home for the needy bird. They’ll stay with their ward until it either recovers or dies, before joining another formation. For them, everything goes ‘on hold’ to care for another bird! What an example of Christ–like relationship and self–sacrificing love. ‘...God has combined the members of the body…that its parts should have equal concern for each other. If one part suffers, every part suffers with it...’ (1 Corinthians 12:24–26 NIV) In today’s culture we discount and marginalise the needy, including those no longer functioning as they once did. But God demands that we ‘have equal concern for each other’, especially with those suffering. If a gaggle of birds can do it, surely God’s family ought to do it too. ‘Look at the birds in the sky!’ Jesus directs. If they can do it for each other, ‘...Aren’t you worth more than birds?’ (Matthew 6:26 CEV) One of the two greatest commandments (not suggestions) Christ gave us is, ‘...Love your neighbour as yourself. There is no commandment greater...’ (Mark 12:31 NIV) When word circulates that we love each other in this way, they’ll beat down the doors of our church to get in! <br /> <br /> <br /><br /> SoulFood: Deut 30:1–32:28, Luke 11:45–54, Ps 119:9–16, Pr 17:4–6  <br />]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<br /> ‘Look at the birds in the sky!...’ Matthew 6:26 CEV <br /> <br /> Speaking to an anxiety–ridden crowd, Jesus said, ‘I tell you not to worry about your life… Look at the birds in the sky!’ You say, ‘What can I learn from looking at a bunch of birds?’ If you’ve ever been to Pennsylvania USA in early winter, you’ll have seen the skies literally darken as multitudes of Canadian geese gather for their annual flight to the sunny south. For the next few days let’s look at their behaviour, and learn from it. <br /> Geese fly united; they don’t fly separately, in random style, because no goose alone can go that distance. They’re designed to fly in their characteristic ‘V’ formation. When a bird flaps its wings the air movement created provides an uplift, easing the workload of the bird behind it. Together, their flight range increases about 70 per cent. Even the youngest, weakest and oldest geese can make the trip. They accomplish together what they could never accomplish separately. There’s a lesson here: when the Bible says, ‘Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another...’ (Hebrews 10:25 NIV), it means, ‘Stay in fellowship with one another, and enjoy the uplift it provides.’ You’re not called to fly solo. ‘The eye cannot say to the hand, “I don’t need you!” And the head cannot say to the feet, “I don’t need you!”’ (1 Corinthians 12:21 NIV) Occasionally a goose strays off on its own but soon becomes exhausted, loses altitude and ultimately pulls wearily back into the formation. ‘Look at the birds’, and learn. <br /> <br /> <br /><br /> SoulFood: Deut 22–24, Luke 11:1–13, Ps 78:56–64, Pr 16:33 <br />]]></introtext>

'...If someone slaps you on the right cheek, offer the other cheek also.' Matthew 5:39 NLT




<br />
Do you feel taken for granted? You thought they cared about you, but they were just 'using' you. That's what happens when we put our lives into the hands of people. Men and women are not creators; they can't make anything out of us, they can only use us. You snapped at your kids. You yelled at a co-worker. You screamed at the driver who cut you off. You fought with your mate again, now you're pouring out your frustrations to anybody who'll listen. Ever think that perhaps your anger is just a by-product of the resentment you've allowed to invade your soul? That's hard to acknowledge, but you won't get on top of the situation till you do. The answer's not to take it out on those around you, it's to take it to the Lord in prayer and let Him help you. It's got to start on the inside before it shows outside. That means spending time with God, allowing Him to forgive your resentments, remove your pain, heal your memories and enable you to love; as He loves. And that's a job for God. Don't try it without Him! Why don't you pray this prayer: 'Father, I want to act in love, not react in anger. Instead of being short-tempered and striking back, help me to be patient and turn the other cheek. Today let Your love rule my life, for Christ's sake. Amen.' That's a prayer God will answer, for His Word says, '...Above all things have fervent love for one another, for &quot;love will cover a multitude of sins&quot;.' (1 Peter 4:8 NKJV) 
<br />

'...Daniel distinguished himself...because an excellent spirit was in him...' Daniel 6:3 NKJV




<br />
Daniel is remembered for three things: (1) Standing by divine principles even when it lands you in the lions' den (2) Hearing God's Word and recording it (3) Having an attitude that strives for excellence in all things. John Gardiner said, 'The society which scorns excellence in plumbing because plumbing is a humble activity, and tolerates shoddiness in philosophy because it is an exalted activity, will neither have good plumbing nor good philosophy. Neither its pipes nor its theories will hold water.' Horace Mann was one of America's greatest educators. A lawyer, not a teacher, he entered politics in 1837 and became president of the Massachusetts State Senate. As a visionary he saw great possibilities for developing a public education system for the nation. His efforts resulted in Massachusetts creating the nation's first Board of Education as 'an experiment'. When the Board's leadership position was offered to him, his friends, who believed his political career might culminate in the US Presidency, urged him to decline. But Mann took the job. He told his disappointed friends, 'If the title is not sufficiently honourable, then clearly it is left to me to elevate it!' Not only did the job have little prestige, the $1,500 annual salary was only a fraction of what he'd have earned as a lawyer. Concerning this he said, 'Only this is certain; if I live and have good health, I'll do more than $1,500 worth of good.' He did. From his position, he gave Massachusetts a public school system that other states adopted, enriching the lives of millions of children for years to come. So, strive for excellence!

'...The blood...makes atonement for the soul...' Leviticus 17:11 NKJV 




<br />
Jeffrey Ebert says: 'When I was five years old, before factory-installed seat belts and automobile airbags, my family was driving home at night on a two-lane country road. I was sitting on my mother's lap when another car driven by a drunk driver swerved into our lane and hit us head on. I don't have any memory of the collision. I do recall the fear and confusion I felt as I saw myself literally covered with blood from head to toe. Then I learned that the blood wasn't all mine, but my mother's. In that split second when the two headlights glared into her eyes, she instinctively...curled her body around mine. It was her body that slammed against the dashboard, her head that shattered the windshield. She took the impact...so that I wouldn't have to. It took extensive surgery for my mother to recover from her injuries.' At the cross Jesus took the impact of our sin, and the moment we place our trust in Him, His shed blood reconciles us to God. Consider God's problem. The Bible says God is '...of purer eyes than to behold evil, and cannot look on wickedness...' (Habakkuk 1:13 NKJV) So God solves His problem by repositioning us 'in Christ', and seeing us 'through the blood'. The songwriter wrote: 'When God looks at me He doesn't see the things I've done, He only sees the blood of His crucified Son.' God's Word says, 'The blood...makes atonement for the soul.' The word 'atonement' means 'at-one-ment'. Wonderful, the blood of Jesus bridges the gap and makes us one with God!

'...Abide in My love...' John 15:9 NKJV




<br />
If 'abiding' is the key to 'abounding', why don't we achieve it? Because: (1) We think abiding is based on our feelings. No, it's about a relationship, not a sensation. That'll probably come as a relief, especially if you think you must have an emotional rush when you spend time with God. You won't always, and you don't need to. We understand this in our marriages. Abiding is an act of faith. It says you value God's presence in your life more than any immediate sensation. If you think you must always have strong feelings in order to know you've been with God, you'll be disappointed and conclude, 'This isn't for me.' But it is! (2) We think we can abide in Christ without obeying Him. Jesus said, 'If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love...' (John 15: 10 NKJV) Disobeying creates a breakdown in your fellowship with Christ. You can enjoy an emotional worship service on 
Sunday but, if you pursue a sinful lifestyle during the week, you'll never succeed at abiding. One of the greatest pictures of abundant living is the picture of what the spies found in the Promised Land. In the Bible, grapes, which produce wine, represent abundance. 'They came to the Valley of Eshcol, and there cut down a branch with one cluster of grapes; they carried it between two of them on a pole...' (Numbers 13:23 NKJV) Think, it took two of them to carry just one cluster. Wow! Have you ever heard of such abundance? Keep that picture in mind. Remind yourself constantly that it belongs to those who hear and obey God's Word!

'...Abide in My love...' John 15:9 NKJV




<br />
If our need for a relationship with God is so deep and constant, why do we fail to pursue it? One reason is, we're convinced He remembers all the bad we've done and is quick to judge us for how we're doing now. That's not so. Think of the qualities of a best friend: they accept you and make time for you; you always leave their presence feeling better. What you appreciate in a best friend is exactly what God offers you today. He wants to abide with you even more than you want to abide with Him. 'As the Father loved Me, I also have loved you; abide in My love.' (John 15:9 NKJV) If we were really abiding in His love we'd come away feeling so cherished that we'd rush back to Him each day. 
<br />
The word abiding means to 'be at home' in God's love; to be convinced of your acceptance as a member of His family in good standing; to be at peace there, to be fed and nurtured by His presence, to feel protected knowing it's the safest place on earth you'll ever be. Abiding is all about the most important relationship in your life. In abiding you seek, long for, thirst for, wait for, see, know, love, hear and respond to Him. Abiding means more of Him in your activities, thoughts and desires. Too often in our rush to perform for God we simply fail to enjoy His company. Yet we were created to be incomplete with anything less. That's why David wrote, 'As the deer pants for the water brooks, so my soul pants for You, O God.' (Psalm 42:1 NAS)

<br />


<br />
Dr word4U2day is guessing you wimped out on taking yesterday's advice in trying to kick the 'worry bug'. As your unofficial, unqualified GP, Dr word4U2day would like to warn you once again that 'worry' can seriously damage your health. It's medically proven that worry suppresses your immune system; worry elevates blood pressure which in turn creates cholesterol that blocks your arteries. So, if you weren't worried before, you are now! John writes: '...I pray that... you may prosper and be in good health, just as your soul prospers.' (3 John 1:2 NAS) Why would he say that unless there's a connection between your body and your spirituality? Before you think 'this is getting a little too hug-a-tree-hippy for my liking', stop and think about it. When you worry, your mind is far too loud and busy to hear the still voice of God, so you're robbed of peace. When you worry your physical body is more prone to illness, so you're not fighting fit when it comes to spiritual opposition. Can you see where this is heading? Worry is a spiritual matter. Anxiety is a weapon the enemy is firing at you to stop you receiving all that God has for you. '...listen closely to My words. Do not let them out of your sight, keep them within your heart; for they are life to those who find them and health to a man's whole body.' (Proverbs 4:20-22 NIV)

<br />


<br />
It's so easy to get a dose of the 'worry' bug. Maybe, you've got it now; the symptoms are easy enough to spot: (a) your bowels seem to be employing more workers on the dayshift (b) your head seems to be inviting as many irrational thoughts as possible to the big crisis meeting it's holding (c) your self esteem seems to have plummeted to an all-time low. So what's the cure? Digging a hole in the patio and burying your head in the cement? This avoids the issue rather than tackles it. No, it's time to be brave and face up to your worries. Come on, you can do it; splash your face with some cold water, slap yourself and say, 'I can do it!' twenty times in the bathroom mirror (probably best wait 'til everyone is out of the house first). The Bible says: '...the righteous are bold as a lion.' (Proverbs 28:1 NIV) Each time you start to confront your worries, you take a step forward. Each time you choose not to stress over your 'worry bug' but look to what needs to change in order to overcome it, you take a step forward. Nobody enjoys confrontation but without confronting your worries you won't be able to move on. So be brave, kick the worry bug.

<br />


<br />
Are you obsessed with trying to figure out things that should be left in God's hands? When you've been working through some questions but have come to the point of deciding what you are going to do, stop fretting and just trust God. And don't get stressed again a week later because you don't like the way He's handling it! Are you expecting God to just wave a magic wand over your life so that everything suddenly becomes all neat and tidy? Maybe as He takes you through the process of sorting out the mess you'll discover valuable things hidden and forgotten. Paul says, 'Do not be anxious about anything...' (Philippians 4:6 NIV) That's hard to swallow if you're a bit insecure or you like to organise things; to find a place to put them so they make sense and feel 'taken care of'. But how do you file unanswered questions? They annoy you like a crackly earpiece in your headphones or a scratch on your favourite CD! But when you have a crackle or a scratch in your faith, you can't just go down the shops and get a replacement. Instead you have to talk to God about it and ask Him what He's gonna do about it. You might find out that the things you think are high priority may not be anywhere near the top of God's list for your life. So learn to live with loose ends and trust God! If you want growth, you've got to be at peace with the messiness and mistakes that accompany it. If you're one of those people who needs to put everything into a neat little box, this Scripture is especially for you: 'Trust in the Lord with all your heart; do not depend on your own understanding.' (Proverbs 3:5 NLT)

'Get rid of the old yeast...' 1 Corinthians 5:7 NIV




<br />
Paul gives us four thoughts to keep in mind when it comes to temptation: 
<br />
(1) Where we consider ourselves strongest, is where we're least likely to prepare for attack. One man tells of getting involved in an affair. He recalls a conversation he had with a friend before it happened. Friend: 'If Satan were to blow you out of the water, how do you think he'd do it?' Man: 'In all sorts of ways...but there's one way he wouldn't get me.' Friend: 'What's that?' Man: 'My personal relationships. That's one area where I'm as strong as I can get.' A few years later in the very area where he predicted he was safe, this man's life and marriage fell apart. Paul warns: '...Let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall...' (1 Corinthians 10:12 NKJV) (2) What seems innocent, can be destructive. Addressing the temptations of the flesh, Paul writes: 'Everything is permissible for me-but not everything is beneficial. Everything is permissible for me-but I will not be mastered by anything.' (1 Corinthians 6:12 NIV) Stop and ask yourself, 'Will this benefit or hurt me? Does it have the power to control me?' (3) Flirting with temptation guarantees that at some point you'll give in to it. Again Paul weighs in: '...Don't you know that a little yeast works through the whole batch of dough?' (1 Corinthians 5:6 NIV) Paul isn't talking about cooking, but about carnality, and his advice is: 'Recognise it, avoid it, eliminate it from your life!' (4) Failure won't cut you off from God's grace, but it can destroy your potential. With that in mind, Paul says: '...I discipline my body...lest, when I have preached to others, I myself should become disqualified...' (1 Corinthians 9:27 NKJV) 
<br />

‘Give me this [mountain] that the Lord promised me.’ Joshua 14:12 NIV
<br />


<br />
Admiral Joe Fowler served in both World Wars. As a naval architect he designed two of America’s largest aircraft carriers, the USS Lexington and the USS Saratoga. He retired from the Navy in 1948. Shortly after, Walt Disney asked him to head up the design and construction of his first theme park in California. Nothing like it had ever been done before. Not only did Fowler complete the project in 1955, but he also managed its operation for many years. Later, when Disney wanted to build another theme park in Florida, he called Fowler to do it. When Fowler completed the project in 1971, he was 71. End of story? No, when Fowler was 87 Disney called on him again to build a futuristic theme park called Epcot Center. When asked why he would take on such a project aged 87, Fowler replied, ‘You don’t have to die until you want to.’ In 1993 he completed the job, and laid down his drawing board at the age of 99. Mission accomplished!
<br />
At 85 years of age, Caleb said to Joshua, ‘Give me this [mountain] that the Lord promised me [45 years ago].’ (Joshua 14:12) Did he get it? Yes. So keep climbing. Will you make mistakes along the way? Sure! Henry Ford forgot to put a reverse gear in his first car. He also went bankrupt five times before becoming the father of the automobile industry. You’ll stumble on your way to the top, but if you seek God’s help and stay with it, you’ll get there. The truth is, you’re not defeated until your doubts and regrets take the place of your dreams.

?...but the word of the Lord stands forever...? 1 Peter 1:25 NIV




<br />
Jana Jones says, ?During the day I take a few moments to unwind by reading the Bible. After seeing me do this for several years, my four?year?old daughter became concerned: ?Aren?t you ever going to finish reading that book??? You could read the Bible for a lifetime and not ?scratch the surface?. There?s no other book like it. For example: (1) No human being would have written to such a high standard. Stop and think of the best person you know. You must admit, even they would have left certain things out, wouldn?t they? (2) There?s an aura the Bible generates that no other book does. Martin Luther said, ?The Bible is alive, it speaks to me; it has feet, it runs after me; it has hands, it lays hold of me.? Try laying a newspaper on your table at a restaurant and no one will give you a second look. But lay your Bible on it and they?ll stare at you, watch you chew your food, and maybe even take a note of your licence plate when you get into your car. That?s because the Bible creates a sense of God?s presence that forces a reaction in the hearts of men and women. (3) We are changed as we read it. Our core values are altered, peace enters our spirit, joy wells up within our heart. ?The Word of God is full of living power. It is sharper than the sharpest knife, cutting deep into our innermost thoughts and desires. It exposes us to what we really are.? (Hebrews 4:12 NLT) The answers you need are in your Bible, so make it part of your everyday life.

'Of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks...' Luke 6:45 NKJV




<br />
Let's answer some communication questions: (1) What is good communication? It's honest, positively intended, two-way sharing. It isn't 'dumping' or giving someone a piece of your mind! The first law of verbal ecology is: garbage is not biodegradable! It recycles, festering with time. 'The words of a talebearer are as wounds...they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.' (Proverbs 18:8 NKJV) Many a word accompanies the hearer to their grave. (2) What should we communicate? The truth. 'Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord, but those who deal truthfully are His delight.' (Proverbs 12:22 NKJV) But truth can be given like the blow of a sledgehammer or like a soothing hand of friendship. It should be communicated after advance thought for its impact. 'The heart of the righteous ponders how to answer, but the mouth of the wicked pours out evil things.' (Proverbs 15:28 NAS) (3) How much should we communicate? As much as God's Word, love and wisdom dictate. Children and distressed people frequently need only limited information. 'A fool vents all his feelings, but a wise man holds them back.' (Proverbs 29:11) (4) How should we communicate? 'How' can be as important as 'what,' so speak with consideration for the hearer's feelings. 'A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.' (Proverbs 15:1 NAS) The hearer's response is conditioned by your words. (5) Check your timing; it's vital! '...It is wonderful to say the right thing at the right time.' (Proverbs 15:23 NLT) If you're not certain about your timing, wait and pray for wisdom!

'Of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks...' Luke 6:45 NKJV




<br />
'Oh, it was just a bunch of meaningless words. No big deal!' Wrong! Our words are a big deal and they do mean a lot! 'A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth evil. For out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.' (Luke 6:45 NKJV) Your words have either negative or positive impact. (1) Consider some negatives. They can wound people to the core. 'There is one who speaks rashly like the thrusts of a sword...' (Proverbs12:18 NAS) They can break down a person's spirit, stripping them of the courage for living. '...Perverseness in it [the tongue] breaks the spirit...' (Proverbs 15:4 NKJV) Carelessly spoken words between people can destroy relationships. 'The hypocrite with his mouth destroys his neighbour...' (Proverbs 11:9 NKJV) Emotional, and possibly even physical death, can result from words. 'Death and life are in the power of the tongue...' (Proverbs 18:21 NKJV) (2) Consider some positives. Your words can spark life into a relationship. 'A soothing tongue is a tree of life...' (Proverbs 15:4 NAS) The right words can help heal wounded relationships. 'Pleasant words are...sweet to the soul and healing to the bones.' (Proverbs 16:24 NIV) Well-chosen words can help us to understand each other. '...Sweetness of the lips increases learning...' (Proverbs 16:21 NKJV) Words spoken at the right times can bring us closer together. 'The right word spoken at the right time is as beautiful as gold apples in a silver bowl.' (Proverbs 25:11 NCV) What you say matters, so mind your mouth!

'...I pour out my complaint before Him...' Psalm 142:2 NIV




<br />
Learn to pray the Psalms. They run the gamut of human emotion from thanksgiving, to anger, to fear, to loneliness, to grief. The Psalmist doesn't miss a beat when it comes to life. Not life as we wish it was, but life as it is: 'I pour out my complaint before Him; before Him I tell my trouble.' He vents his pain to God, he allows himself to 'feel it'. That takes courage, especially when you just want to put on a brave face. John Ortberg wrote: 'I regret feeling the pain of failure so keenly that I backed away from owning it and learning from it. I could not heal and move on. I wanted to bury it so deeply that no one would ever guess it was there-not even me.' Sound familiar? The Bible doesn't discourage the grieving process, it just warns us not to get stuck in it. '...Weeping may remain for a night, but rejoicing comes in the morning...' (Psalm 30:5 NIV) To reach your morning of rejoicing you must go through your night of weeping. FB Meyer wrote: 'There are some who chide tears as unmanly, unsubmissive, unchristian. They comfort us with a chill, bidding us to put on a rigid and tearless countenance... We may well ask if a man who cannot weep can really love? Sorrow is just love bereaved; its most natural expression is tears... Jesus wept. ...The Ephesian converts wept on the neck of the Apostle Paul whose face they were never to see again.' So go ahead and pour out your heart to God. It's a vital step to becoming whole.

'You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living...' Psalm 142:5 NKJV




<br />
Hard times energise some people, yet paralyse others. Look at David. Everything he touched turned to gold: Samuel anointed him to be king; he defeated Goliath; Saul chose him as a musician and warrior; the army loved him and wrote songs about him. Then his life fell apart. He lost his job and his marriage failed; Samuel his old mentor died; his best friend Jonathan couldn't help him and Saul's soldiers hounded him until he had to hide in a cave. At some point we all do time in the cave! It's where you end up when all your earthy supports are gone. It's where you learn important things about yourself that you can't learn anywhere else. It's where God does some of His best work in moulding you into the likeness of Christ. It's where your worst inadequacies confirm that you're out of your depth and where God sends His power to flow through your weakness. When David prayed, 'You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living,' he'd no way of knowing there was a crown in his future, or that he wasn't going to die in hiding. For all he knew, this cave he was in right now might be as good as it gets. When you're in a situation you can't fix, can't change and can't escape, trust God! Trust God! Trust God! As long as your sense of security is tied solely to your success, it'll always be fragile. But when you know that God is with you even at your lowest point, you can handle the cave and come out stronger!
<br />

'...Please...settle your disagreement...' Philippians 4:2 NLT




<br />
Euodia and Syntyche were two women who worked hand in hand with Paul in building the church. Yet sadly, the only mention of them in Scripture is that they couldn't get along with one another. That's not good because God's blessing is predicated upon our willingness to forgive and to love one another. Jesus said: 'Therefore I say to you, whatever things you ask when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you will have them. And whenever you stand praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive him, that your Father in heaven may also forgive you your trespasses.' (Mark 11:24-25 NKJV) You can't pray effectively when you have 'anything against anyone'. Even if the other person is wrong, let God use you as a paramedic of His mercy. Tell them you want to see the relationship healed, apologise and be reconciled. It may take more than a U-turn to make up the distance between you, but each step you take will make the road shorter, and if you stay on course you'll get to where you ought to be on time. Don't argue over 'who did what to whom'. Be bigger than that! Show grace! You've been asking God to restore things; well, this is part of it. Yes, your ego will rebel. And if you let it, fear of rejection will stop you dead in your tracks. But do it anyway and see what happens. Remember, when you forgive someone, you position yourself beyond condemnation; at that point God can bless you. Can you afford to live without His blessing?

'...He was...a mighty man...but a leper...' 2 Kings 5:1 NKJV




<br />
Before leaving the story of Naaman, let's observe two more things: (1) Everybody needs help. Not just the down-'n'-outers, but the up-'n'-outers. Being a five-star general doesn't mean a thing when someone's dying of leprosy. 'But they wouldn't listen to someone like me,' you say. Maybe not today, but when things get bad enough you'd be surprised how they listen. Just serve with excellence and be ready with an answer when the time comes. (2) God's hand is on you to minister where He's placed you. It was the encouragement of someone who got close enough to see Naaman's real problem, then introduced him to God, that brought about his healing. When God puts you close to someone and makes you privy to certain information, He does it so that you can give them '...a word in season...' (Isaiah 50:4 NKJV) God used a cleaning lady who worked in his own house to reach Naaman. What if she'd rebelled against making beds and washing dishes? Or decided to go out and gossip about the problem instead? Today you have a role to play in God's plan. The servant who challenged Naaman to humble himself and dip seven times in the Jordan River is not named in Scripture, but he was indispensible to the process. So are you. Few athletes have more fans than basketball star Michael Jordan. Yet when a reporter asked him why he liked his dad to attend his games, he replied, 'When he's there, I know I have at least one fan!' Everybody needs encouragement. You can speak a word that changes someone's life!

'...He was...a mighty man...but a leper...' 2 Kings 5:1 NKJV




<br />
When God gives you an answer, don't argue and don't rationalise. Just do what He tells you-and you'll come up clean. Naaman's pride almost cost him his life. When he left Elisha's house he was angry because Elisha hadn't come out to speak with him personally. Instead he sent 'a messenger' out to tell him to go dip seven times in the muddy Jordan River. 'Aren't there cleaner rivers?' Naaman asked, feeling insulted. At this point Naaman's servants said, 'If the prophet had told you to do something great, would you not have done it? How much more then, when he says to you, &quot;Wash, and be clean&quot;?' (2 Kings 5:13 NKJV) Today God is asking you the same question. Wouldn't it be worth humbling yourself to come up clean? To confess your sin, share your story and ask for help? Wouldn't it be worth risking the disapproval of those who don't matter because they're not part of God's plan for your life anyway? Don't let your reputation get in the way of your solution. Don't let the devil entice you to other rivers which have no power to save. All you need is the kind of faith that involves looking foolish for a while: the kind that keeps you dependent on God when it looks like everybody else is doing better than you. Go ahead, dip in the river of God's grace and keep dipping! Though you've been insulted, though your feelings are hurt, though the process doesn't seem to make sense, though you've reached the end of your rope and you want to quit, keep dipping. Act on the Word God has given you! Miracles are for the obedient, not the wishful.

'...He was...a mighty man...but a leper...' 2 Kings 5:1 NKJV




<br />
Naaman had a problem; a unique one. In recalling this story Jesus said, '...Many lepers were in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet, and none of them was cleansed except Naaman...' (Luke 4:27 NKJV). It's easier to believe God for something you've seen Him do before. But Naaman not only had leprosy, nobody he knew had ever been healed of it. Are you being tested today because of a unique situation in your life, your marriage or your career? Are you afraid to talk about it because you don't know anybody who's ever beaten your particular problem? If so, stop focusing on the problem and start focusing on God! He doesn't need anything to begin with in order to solve your problem. Remember, in Genesis He hung the earth on nothing, and it's still turning every day! The Bible says that Naaman was a 'great...man', but God was about to make him a greater one. Whenever He does that He permits us to get into predicaments without human solutions. When He wants us to have great influence He often permits us to face great challenges. It's how He moves us from being impressive to being truly exceptional. But when He does, be careful. One of the first questions people will ask is, 'How did you do it?' They'll start admiring your status and your armour, when all the time it was your affliction that drove you to your knees and allowed God to make you the person you've become. Before you can be exceptional you must work to develop a faith that believes God for the impossible, and trusts what He says regardless of the odds.

<introtext><![CDATA['...He was...a mighty man...but a leper...' 2 Kings 5:1 NKJV     <br /> In examining the story of Naaman the leper, we begin by looking at his condition. 'Naaman, commander of the army of...Syria, was a great...man...but a leper.' (2 Kings 5:1 NKJV ) In spite of his past victories and present honours, he had a hidden problem that wouldn't stay hidden long. Left un-dealt with, it would eventually destroy him. Can you relate? Today the odds may be in your favour. You've graduated from the best university, you've a good family and you've built a church or a business, or climbed to the top in your career. Yet before you can qualify for greater blessing God will force you to deal with a condition that's hidden beneath your armour. Outstanding people in every occupation, particularly spiritual ones, go through it. It's what sets them apart. It's what ushers them across the bridge from mediocre to exceptional. Without obstacles we'll always be ordinary! We're not talking about petty little problems. We're talking about issues so overwhelming you can't sleep; gut-wrenching things that cause your heart to skip a beat and make you fear 'this is the one that's going to take me out!' It's the thing you pray about in secret. It's what you don't want people to see. So, like Naaman, you wear your 'brass' then go home and agonise over your condition. Understand this: God teaches some of His greatest lessons in the valleys of life. That's where you learn to lie prostrate before Him, weeping and broken. It's where you pray: 'God, don't let this thing destroy me. Deal with it through the power of Your Spirit.' And here's the good news: that kind of prayer brings deliverance. <br /> <br /> SoulFood: Acts 24-26, Luke 9:18-27, Ps 1, Pr 16:10-15]]></introtext>

'Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me...' Matthew 11:29 NKJV




<br />
Some of us find it easy to trust God for health, yet we stay awake all night worrying about finances. Or we trust Him for finances, but not to direct our steps. Jesus says, 'Take my yoke upon you and learn from Me.' You say, 'Learn what?' Learn that if you want to lighten your load, don't take on more-take on a partner. Get in harness with the Lord and take your lead from Him. Working with God will restore your strength, not deplete it!
<br />
Richard Mylander writes: 'On my way to a conference in Colorado I was driving uphill along a major interstate, when I overtook a freight train going the same direction at a slower speed. The train was being pushed uphill by two locomotives that sounded as if they were straining at full power. I'm a flatlander from the mid west. 'Is this how trains move in mountainous terrain?' I wondered. I gradually came alongside the front of the over 1 kilometre-long string of cars. There I found five more locomotives pulling the train. Seven engines in all! Where I come from, I rarely see more than two or three. That train was a lesson for me. I had been under serious strain for some time. I was feeling tired and was wondering whether I could persevere under the pressure. How like God, I thought. When I am pushing a load uphill with all the strength I have and feel like my energy level is depleted, He wants me to know that He is in the lead, pulling with power far greater than mine.'

'...The people stood afar off, but Moses drew near...where God was.' Exodus 20:21 NKJV




<br />
Moses alone knew what God's presence felt like, what His voice sounded like and what His radiant glory looked like. And apparently the people of Israel were happy to leave it that way. They said to Moses, 'You speak with us...but let not God speak with us...' (Exodus 20:19 NKJV) What were they afraid of, that God might tell them something they didn't want to hear? Hello? When you haven't carried out God's last set of instructions, it's hard to get excited about His next set. John writes: '...We can be sure that we know Him if we obey His commandments. If someone claims, &quot;I know God,&quot; but doesn't obey God's commandments, that person is a liar and is not living in the truth. But those who obey God's word truly...love Him. That is how we know we are living in Him. Those who say they live in God should live their lives as Jesus did.' (1 John 2:3-6 NLT) So, are you content to be an onlooker, watching God move in the lives of others instead of accepting the discipline required to have a personal relationship with Him yourself? Do you want His gifts and His favour, but not the commitment that goes with them? God doesn't want you to be infatuated with the Bible or the church or His blessings. No, He wants you to fall in love with Him. He's not looking for a date; He's looking for a bride! He wants someone who'll stick with Him when the going gets tough. Are you ready to put on the ring of commitment today?

'...Our sufficiency is from God.' 2 Corinthians 3:5 NKJV




<br />
God will never give you an assignment that does not require His involvement. He calls us: '...Not according to our works [ability], but according to His own purpose and grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus...' (2 Timothy 1:9 NKJV) When God gives you a job to do, He gives you the grace to do it. But don't expect it to be easy. God called Moses to instruct Pharaoh to let His work force leave, to go worship a God Pharaoh didn't even believe in. He told Jonah to go to Nineveh, the most corrupt city in the world, and say to its population, 'Repent or die!' When He called Jeremiah to preach to a hard-edged, self-centred people who refused to listen, he cried so hard that he became known as 'the weeping prophet'. So if you're feeling inadequate today, without God-you are! The heroes in the Bible didn't jump up and say, 'No problem, I can handle that!' But here's the good news: God doesn't call us to work for Him but with Him, and that guarantees your success. 
<br />
You say, 'But I don't have the ability.' No problem: 'Not that we are sufficient of ourselves...our sufficiency is from God, who also made us sufficient...' (2 Corinthians 3:5-6 NKJV) You say, 'But I don't have the finances.' No problem: '...God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that in all things at all times, having all you need, you will abound in every good work.' (2 Corinthians 9:8 NIV) You say, 'But I don't have the strength.' No problem: 'I can do everything through Him who gives me strength.' (Philippians 4:13 NIV)
<br />

<br />
'Two men looked through prison bars; one saw mud, the other stars.' So which are you? A star-gazer or a mud-minder? Do you see life as a glass half empty or half full? Well, whatever you see, make sure you've got your God-goggles on. No, you won't find them at Specsavers; God-goggles are given through prayer-life, reading the Word and being in partnership with God's people. God-goggles give you a vision for your life, through them you begin to see things as God sees them. Moses had a pair when he 'saw' the Promised Land while trudging through the desert. The Israelites had 'me-goggles' on and so only saw a hot, deserted hell. Moses saw that every journey begins with a single step, and that every other step is a significant step to the Promised Land. The Israelites saw an impossible journey, a task too big for their tired and blistered feet. Moses and the Israelites were on the same journey; the difference was perspective; the difference was vision. One saw stars, the others mud. 

<br />
What about you? Have you been given a promise by God but you can't work out what to do with it? Does the task seem too big for you? What a great opportunity to put on your God-goggles. Take your eyes up from the floor and set them to the stars. Remember every journey begins with that first step.

<br />
Right, so this is a bit of a morbid thought, but imagine Martians from the inter-planetary highways agency land on earth to announce our lovely planet is to be destroyed to make room for a new inter-galactic motorway. You've got one month to live before life as we know it ends. What do you do with your remaining 30 days here on this little spherical world? Do you put in a few extra hours in on cracking level 17 of Grand Theft Auto 12? Do you put in the extra shifts at work so you'll finally be able to afford those to-die-for boots or the deposit on the car of your dreams? Hopefully none of these things would be high on your to-do list in the face of immediate disaster. 

<br />
So, here's the scary news. That day will one day arrive. Ok, it won't involve Martians with clipboards and hard hats, but one day your time on this little ball of land and sea will be up. Will you have spent your time wisely? Will you have made a difference to the world? Will people miss you? Will a part of this universe be a little less lovely because you are gone? Will people notice or will it be business as usual? You only get one life. Live it. Live a life of love.

<br />
Whether it's an overweight, out-of-touch grandad with a beard to rival Father Christmas' or a super-tolerant hippy waving peace signs with his fingers from the sky, chances are your picture of God is wrong. 

<br />
The Bible isn't one of those kiss-'n-tell biographies where the middle of the book is peppered with glossy pics of God. No, better than that, it draws for us outlines of who God is. Genesis tells us God is an artist. He draws up a vast universe from His imagination. Exodus shows us God the deliverer. A people crushed by slavery are brought to freedom by following God. The point is: if you want a portrait of God, the brushstrokes are found throughout the Bible. Jesus is the perfect snapshot of God, He even says so Himself: 'Anyone who has seen Me has seen the Father.' (John 14:9 NIV) So what? God wears sandals and could do with a haircut, is that the point? Not exactly: Jesus was making the face of God known through what He did. He loved. So God has a face of love. He healed. So God has hands of healing. He died for us to show God's all-out, nothing-held-back-from-us love.

<br />
What does God look like? See for yourself. Check in with Him today.

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[<br />


<br />

Monday morning, you're about to leave for work/school/uni. Checklist: Bus fare; Check. Lunch money; Check. Four-metre bloodied, splintered cross; Check.... 'er, say what?' Yeah, what did You mean, Lord, when You said we're to take up our cross daily? There's no room in my bag for a 2000 year old form of the death penalty. So, what will my cross look like?

<br />
Well, your cross is made to measure. It's custom built to your size. David was custom built to lead a nation, because he'd had years of practice leading sheep. What are you well practiced in? Your cross will fit your shoulders. What weight bears down on your shoulders? Do you feel the weight of someone's hurt? Perhaps, you're called to pray for that person. Do images of starving children bear down on your compassion? Perhaps, your cross is all about raising money for a related charity.

<br />
Your cross will look like you. The Bible says God '...has given each one of us a special gift...' (Ephesians 4:7 NLT) So, you thought you were just a blabbermouth, God sees you with the 'gift of the gab'. God will use your big mouth for big stuff. Or if you're the opposite, you think you're cursed with shyness. God sees you with the 'present of peace'. God uses your calming effect on His world to bring about His peace.

<br />
So, do you still think that cross is too heavy to carry?

<br />
'Let him...take up his cross daily...' (Luke 9:23 NKJ) 'The load I give you to carry is light'. (Matthew 11:30 NCV) Both sentences passed through the mouth of Jesus. But isn't He contradicting Himself? I mean, 'cross-carrying' is back-breaking work, isn't it? Unless You're about to give us a polystyrene cross, surely the load You give us is one famed for dislocating your shoulder, right, Lord? 

<br />
Well, no. It's a perspective thing. If you think of God as dishing out crosses like a needle-happy nurse dishes out pain so no-one wants their jab but everyone gets one, then you're in trouble. If we see 'difficult maths homework' or 'the mate who's always draining me' as 'the cross we have to bear', is it any wonder our load feels far from light? What if you saw that 'difficult maths homework', not as a headache, but an opportunity to develop your problem solving skills? What if that 'moaning mate' wasn't the person you hid from at break, but someone who you can see the face of Jesus in?

<br />
Taking up your cross doesn't mean taking the weight of the world on your shoulders. It simply means taking on Jesus' attitude to everything. So, rather than beg God to send a bolt of lightning up that 'pain in the neck' of a pal, ask God for a new perspective. Stop asking for a lighter cross and start praying for a stronger back.

<br />
Being a Christian is about having a living relationship with Jesus that affects the way we live life every day. As we listen to Him and follow in His footsteps our lives start to look radically different from the people around us. Mother Teresa's life is an example of that. This was written on a sign on the wall of her children's home in Calcutta:

<br />
'People are often unreasonable, illogical, and self-centred; forgive them anyway. If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfish, ulterior motives; be kind anyway. If you are successful, you will win some false friends and some true enemies; succeed anyway. If you are honest and frank, people may cheat you; be honest and frank anyway. What you spend years building, someone could destroy overnight; build anyway. If you find happiness, they may be jealous; be happy anyway. The good you do today, people will often forget tomorrow; do good anyway. Give the world the best you have, and it may never be enough; give the world the best you've got anyway. You see, in the final analysis, it is between you and God; it was never between you and them anyway.'

<br />
'God made you to do good works, which God planned in advance for you' to live your life doing. Don't worry about what everyone else is doing or not doing; you just go ahead and do the good works He's planned you to do.

<br />
Revision! Uggh! Exams! Aargh! Trying to recall, names, dates, places, symbols, formulas, equations! Remembering things can be so difficult! But when life gets really difficult, it's important to remember good things. Paul was a prisoner in Rome when he wrote to the Church at Philippi. But he didn't write to have a moan or to ask for a cake with a file in! 'I thank my God every time I remember you.' Paul's letter was really cheerful! 'Be full of joy in the Lord always. I will say again, be full of joy.' (Philippians 4:4 NCV) How encouraging it must have been for the Philippians to receive a letter like that! Hearing how he was praying for them!

<br />
Paul got it right. When life's full of more downs than ups, it's good to stop and think about all the good people God has brought into your life, who have encouraged you and supported you and then, take some time to let them know you're thanking God for them! But don't just wait 'til life gets tough! Let those who have encouraged you always be a part of your life. P-ray for them and let them know you're thinking of them, A-ct on the good stuff they've taught you, R-emember them often, T-hank God for bringing them into your life and ask Him to help you become a great encouragement to someone too!

<br />
There's nothing like the feeling of just lying back on an inflatable lilo as it bobs up and down on the gentle waves. Mmmm, the sun shining down, just close your eyes for a minute and reeeelax. Then AAAAH! You open your eyes and you've drifted out to sea on the tide! One minute you're catching the rays, bobbing around the waves, and now you're way out at sea fighting for your life! Maybe you think you'd never be stupid enough to do that but you could still be a drifter. If you've ever day-dreamed, drifted away in your thoughts when you should have been paying attention in class or in a meeting, or during the pastor's talk on a 
Sunday, then listen up today. 

<br />
Drifting can be a dangerous habit, because it makes you think everything is ok until it's too late! Drift off in class and it's no problem until you're sitting with that exam paper in front of you and you don't know the answers! Hebrews 2:1 says, 'We must pay more careful attention, therefore, to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away.' God's telling us that it's important we pay attention to the truth about Him, otherwise we'll drift away and believe lies. Paying careful attention is hard work! Every day pray: 'Today God, help me live so close to You, that whoever comes into contact with me, comes into contact with You!'

<br />
Is God really telling us to fight? And not just fight, but fight hard? Well, before you go punching someone's lights out, listen up! God isn't telling you to 'kick off' every time someone disagrees with what you believe. Nor is He telling you to 'beat the living daylights' out of any of your mates who try and talk you out of going to Church! And He's definitely not asking you to have a slanging match with the next person who calls you a 'Bible Basher'! 

<br />
If someone is overweight, then they might be encouraged to 'fight the flab'. This doesn't mean they are being asked to beat themselves up literally, does it? What they're saying is use all your inner strength and willpower to keep those kilos from piling on. Eat all the right foods and take the right exercise to make this possible.

<br />
In a similar way, when God tells us, 'Fight hard for the faith,' He is asking us to do everything we can to keep our focus and attention on Jesus. Don't compromise what the Bible tells you. Believe it and live by it! Fighting involves: (1) Training: Don't get discouraged and give up. (2)Readiness: There's no time off being a Christian! (3) Action: Fight to win! 'I do not mean that I am already as God wants me to be... but I continue trying to reach it and make it mine...' (Philippians 3:12 NCV)

<br />
Ever had one of those stuffed toys where you squeeze the paw and it barks, moos or whatever - depends on the animal I guess :) Anyway, one that says &quot;Jesus says no!&quot; might be a real asset with our daily decision making. The only way we are going to 'Put all evil things out of our lives' is by saying, 'Jesus says no!' and making good choices that let nothing evil into our lives. And if anything is in there already or sneaks in through a window, 'put these things out of your life.' (Colossians 3:8 NCV) 

<br />
The best way to keep bad things out of your life is by filling your life up with good things. Here are four good things the Bible teaches us to do to start us off: (1) stop craving things you don't need. Instead enjoy what you've got (2) if you're not giving generously to God's work, start now! Make a habit of giving away a percentage of whatever comes your way. 'Give freely and become more wealthy; be stingy and lose everything.' (Proverbs 11:24-25 NLT) Yes, even give a bit of your pocket money-even 50c of that five bucks from your Nana! (3) trust God completely, with everything. God guarantees to 'supply all your needs.' (Philippians 4:19 NLT) 

<br />
Go ahead, do it! Obey God, be patient, and watch what happens.

<br />
'How much are the puppies?' the boy asked the pet shop owner. 'Anything from $75 to $125,' he replied. 'Can I have a look at them?' One puppy was lagging behind the rest and straight away the boy asked, 'What's wrong with that one?' The pup didn't have a hip socket. It would always limp. 

<br />
'That's the one I want to buy,' said the boy. 'You don't want to buy that little dog', said the shopkeeper. 'If you really want him, I'll just give him to you.' The boy looked sad. 'I don't want you to give him to me. That little dog is worth every bit as much as all the other dogs and I'll pay full price'. The shopkeeper insisted, 'You really don't want to buy this one. He's never going to be able to play like the other puppies.' The boy stood back from the counter and revealed his own badly twisted leg, supported by a metal brace, 'Well I don't run so well myself, and this little puppy will need someone who understands!'

<br />
We can sometimes think we are useless, not worth as much as everyone else. But Jesus knows differently: 'But God shows His great love for us in this way: Christ died for us while were still sinners.' (Romans 5:8 NCV) Psalm 139:2-3 NCV says 'You know my thoughts... You know where I go... You know everything I do...' We can sometimes think that no-one understands us, but God does!

<br />
Paul says, 'I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received.' What would that life look like? 

<br />
Well, that life isn't about keeping score. It's not about how many friends you have on Facebook, and it's not about who you've dated, are dating or haven't dated but would like to! It isn't about what sport you play or how well you did or didn't play last week. It's not about your shoes or your hair or the colour of your skin, or where you live or go to school. In fact, it's not about grades, money, clothes or even about whether that university accepts you or not. Life isn't about if you have lots of friends, or if you are alone, and it's not about how accepted or unaccepted you are. Life just isn't about that.

<br />
But life is about choosing to love, not hate. It's about trust, contentment and compassion. It's about sticking up for your friends and praying for your enemies. Life is about avoiding jealousy, overcoming ignorance and encouraging others. It's about what you say and what you mean. It's about seeing people for who they are and not what they have. Most of all, it's about choosing to use your life to touch someone else's in a way that could never have been achieved otherwise. These choices are what life's about.

<br />
Ah, remember the good old days when if you wanted something from the supermarket all you had to do was scream annoyingly and painfully loudly until your Mum gave in. Or if that didn't work, you still had the old 'lying on the shop floor punching and kicking the air' trick up your sleeve. Or failing that, a simple 'I hate you!' bawled from the top of your lungs practiced as a regular routine. Yeah, funny how those little temper tantrum tactics don't go down so well when you're out of the pram for good. The point is: you're supposed to be growing up by now. Well, guess what?! It's the same with our faith!

<br />
It's no use throwing a hissy fit when your plans and God's plans don't match. It's time to grow up! It does us no good going all goggle-eyed over the latest shiny toys when we know those toys will pull us away from God. No, it's time to grow up! Screaming about this, whinging about that, kicking and punching our way through situations is not a sign of a mature Christian. It's a sign we're still in spiritual nappies. When Hebrews goes on about 'Let us...go on to maturity', it's telling us to put down the dummy, get out of the pram and start living with a mature faith. In other words, stop being a baby and start being a grown up.

<br />
Some things are harder to forgive than others. Some people are harder to forgive than others. Sometimes the things we go through are not what God wants for us. God knows the pain you feel and has seen the tears you've cried for yourself. God is for you, not against you. So does God want us to forgive the people who have caused us all the pain? When you're sore from your wounds, this is a tricky idea to get your head round. It may feel like to forgive them is almost like excusing what they've done to you. But that's not how forgiveness works at all. History's biggest statement of forgiveness was said by an innocent man hanging from a torture instrument: 'Father, forgive them...they do not know what they are doing.' (Luke 23:34 NIV) Jesus wasn't excusing what they'd done to Him but He was praying forgiveness over their actions. Pretty heavenly stuff, I'm sure you agree. Forgiveness doesn't require you to take the abuse. Forgiveness doesn't ask you to remain in a dangerous situation. Forgiveness doesn't mean pretending the stuff never happened. Forgiveness is about freeing yourself from the hurt. This isn't easy medicine to swallow. Perhaps, you feel you could never forgive this particular offence. Well don't be too hard on yourself, perhaps your first step isn't to forgive, perhaps your first move is all about crying on God's shoulder.

<br />
Yesterday, we looked at the most incredible words of forgiveness: 'Forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.' But what if they did know what they were doing to you? What if they weren't even sorry? Are you still supposed to forgive even then? And if you do, does that mean you're a doormat? 

<br />
True forgiveness isn't easy. It takes a lot of courage and a lot of time. In a way it's not about them, it's more about you. Forgiveness is about you freeing yourself from what has been done to you. Forgiveness is part of your healing. Forgiveness is your pathway to a future free of self-destruction. 

<br />
Remember: by forgiving you're not excusing, you're releasing your pain. But where do you start? How can you forgive when all you feel is hatred? Firstly, acknowledge that 'hatred' is a feeling; you're entitled to your feelings. Forgiveness is a choice not a feeling. Secondly, seek God on what to do with these feelings. God's shoulder is infinitely big enough for you to cry on. Thirdly, ask God to help you with the impossible. Yes, by human standards forgiveness may be out of the question, but seek God on it and ask Him to bring you to a place where you can forgive. Finally, receive the goodness of God: 'Heal me, Lord, for my bones are in agony.' (Psalm 6:2 NLT)

Hey, here's an idea... why not take your television out for a romantic walk down to the park. Yeah, then you could stroll down to the mall, just you and your 102cm widescreen walking hand in hand. You could treat her to some new batteries for her remote. Take her HD tuner out for something nice to eat. Cuddle up in the back row of the flicks, just you and your high definition, surround sound technological beauty. No, seriously, why not? Don't you have to make time for the people you love? Er... one problem, a television isn't a person. So why do you spend four hours a day staring lovingly into its eyes, and on the other hand, spend 15 minutes with your Mum? Why do you say you value your mates but then place more value on your iPod? Why do you say you love Jesus but never find time to talk to Him because you're too busy spending time, money and energy on other things? 

<br />
This might seem harsh but maybe this is 'wake up' time for you. Are you wasting too much time on gadgets and gizmos at the expense of people? Here's an idea... unplug the Xbox, sign off Facebook, put down the ear phones and open your mouth. Go and see your Gran and have a good chat with her. Treat your mate to something unexpected. Go for a walk with a neighbour. Stop lazing and start loving.

<br />
It's easy to get too familiar with Jesus' words and therefore lose the sheer impact of what He's saying. Take this one for starters: 'Pray for those who spitefully use you. To him who strikes you on the one cheek, offer the other also. And from him who takes away your cloak, do not withhold your tunic either... just as you want men to do to you, you also do to them likewise.' (Luke 6:28-31 NKJ) Whoaa! Let's backtrack a minute. What kind of planet is Jesus living on when He says this? Offer your other cheek to be punched! Yeah and why not draw a target on your pants so they won't miss when they kick you there? Giving away your cloak: what, are we supposed to mug ourselves as well? What is Jesus going on about?

<br />
It's not about mugging yourself or allowing yourself to be treated like dirt, Jesus is talking about setting yourself a standard here. And, oh boy, is it a high standard! If someone strikes you, you want to hurt them back, but the new standard won't allow it. In fact, the new standard isn't even saying you should walk away and forget it. We're now required to pray good things and give good things to our enemy. How radical is that!

'A woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume...She broke the jar and poured the perfume on His head. Some of those present were saying indignantly to one another, &quot;Why this waste of perfume? It could have been sold...and the money given to the poor.&quot; And they rebuked her harshly. &quot;Leave her alone,&quot; said Jesus... &quot;She has done a beautiful thing...The poor you will always have with you... But you will not always have Me. She did what she could. She poured perfume on My body beforehand to prepare for My burial. I tell you... wherever the gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her.&quot;' (Mark 14:3-9 NIV)

<br />
She could've given the money to the poor. It would've been a 'Christian' thing to do, wouldn't it? I mean, a jar of perfume 'wasted' on a man. What did Jesus want to smell like an aromatherapy shop for, anyway? The party-poopers so miss the point in this. The woman gives the best she has to offer for Jesus. This is real sacrificial worship; giving your best to Jesus. What about you? What's your best? What can you sacrificially give to worship Jesus? The woman gave what she could, when she could. What love have you got to pour out of your jar today?

<br />
As if! Come on, here's little old you. You're a spotty teenager, in need of a growth spurt, your only work experience is sheep-minding and you're expected to fight a mammoth of a man. A trained blood-thirsty military monster. Goliath: a man who'd turn superman's red knickers a darker shade of brown. He's armed head to toe in the best custom-built armour the military can buy, you're wearing the leftover nightie from last year's school nativity play. He's got a blade of steel larger than your entire body; you have a stone and a playground catapult. Just to add final insult to injury, the only small chink in his armour is the face of his helmet; hardly any kind of target. I mean, come on...as if!

<br />
Well, when it comes to giant-problems, take a stone out of David's bag. David knew Goliath was big, but as big as God?! You see, like everyone else David heard Goliath's fighting talk. 'When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were...greatly afraid.' (1 Samuel 17:11 NKJ) But, unlike the rest, he cottoned on they were just hot air... Everyone else's knees may have been knocking but he was standing firm in God. Yes, the odds were stacked; there was only a small space between the chin and the eyebrows to aim at, but God made sure David hit the target!

You'd be a bit 'wisdom-challenged' to un-strap yourself from the safety rails of a rollercoaster whilst it was still 50m in the air. Sure, your digestive system may be telling you to get off the ride, but you can't bail out mid-ride, can you? Well, ditto to your faith life. Just because you're feeling a bit sick to the stomach of Church, or other Christians make you want to throw up, you'd be a little bit dumb to bail out on God now. You might want to give up God, but God won't give up on you. He promises, He'll '...never leave you nor forsake you [so]...do not be discouraged.' (Deuteronomy 31:8 NIV) You might not have faith in God, but God is still faithful to you. His Word says, 'If we are faithless, He will remain faithful, for He cannot disown Himself.' (2 Timothy 2:13 NIV) God will get you through it and out of it. He promises us an exit. '...when you are tempted, He will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it.' (1 Corinthians 10:13 NIV) You see bad; God makes good. He's producing good in all your circumstances. 'And we know that all things work together for good to them...who are the called...' (Romans 8:28 KJV) God puts pits and peaks together, and out comes your good. 

<br />
So stay strapped in for the ride!

<br />
Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. It sounds like a pretty expensive law firm at the top of a shiny office building, doesn't it? Well, these three weren't lawyers, but they were firm on God's law. You see, a foreign king had ideas above his station; he wanted people to bow down to him as if he were some sort of living God. This was clearly against God's law. So when our Jewish trio refuse to bend a knee in the king's direction, they had a problem. A problem punishable by death, and not just any death. Death in an oversize pizza oven! So, what should our guys do: (a) apologise quick-smart and get on with the business of grovelling? (b) make a run for it; go find a place to live where the ruler hasn't got such an inflated ego? or (c) stick to their principles and burn for the sake of it?

<br />
Our heroes chose the third option. Doh! Come on, what good are principles when your body's about to go up in flames. So what was going through their minds? Well... in Daniel 3:17 NKJ the guys say 'Our God...is able to deliver us'. They never doubted God's ability. '...And He will deliver us.' They never doubted God's intention. 'But if not...we will not...worship the golden image.' (Daniel 3:18 NKJ) They never considered an alternative to God. They had to go through to get through. And so do you.

CS Lewis (the author of The Chronicles of Narnia) also wrote a book imagining what it's like to be a devil who wants to stop a Christian loving God. In The Screwtape Letters, he writes this: 'Do not be deceived, Wormwood. Our cause is never in greater danger than when a human, no longer desiring, but still intending to do our Enemy's will, looks around upon a universe from which every trace of Him seems to have vanished, asks why he has been forsaken, and still obeys!' The point CS Lewis is making is that the devil loses it when we choose to follow God no matter what. When nothing seems to make sense, when it feels like God hasn't said 'hello' in a while, when everything else screams at us to throw off this whole silly God-nonsense, but still we choose to go on trusting... that's the kind of faith, the devil can't chip away. That's the kind of faith proven gold in the eyes of God. 

<br />
So, you mean, when it feels like everything has gone dark, I'm actually proving my faith is gold? EXACTLY. Textbook example: Jesus. Where does Jesus' ministry begin: in front of a huge cheering crowd? Far from it. It begins in the dark, dry place of the desert. Do you feel a bit stuck out in the desert? Perhaps, that's where you're supposed to be.

<br />
Life often seems to be up one minute, down the next. The Bible gives us some brilliant examples. Elijah rode life's rollercoaster: one minute he was scaling the heights of God's almighty victories, the next he was hurtling to an all time emotional low where he wanted his life to be over. Jesus felt the extremes of life's highs and lows too. At the start of one week the crowds were singing his praises, a few days later they were yelling for him to hang him from a cross. Paul had a similar rollercoaster experience. One minute people were hailing him as some kind of god come down from the heavens, the next they were picking up sharp, dangerous objects to throw in his direction. Every major figure in the Bible had their 'wind in the hair' high moment of victory, but also their moment of gut wrenching nose-dive towards the abyss. 

<br />
Life isn't one endless upward climb or a dark pit that keeps on spiralling downwards: it's a rollercoaster!

<br />
So, if you were God, what would you do? Snap your fingers and wham! Those pimples would be gone forever. Clap your hands, and hey presto! A six-pack stomach in place of that flabby mid-riff. Blink your eyes, and that miserable drizzly weather changes to perfect sunshine. Well, guess what? Check your birth certificate or passport; you're not God! And if you're not the perfect author of the universe, chances are that you're prone to the odd zit or two; you're likely to sweat in the summer and freeze in the winter. That's life. It's just the way it is. 

<br />
On a more serious note, there might be some pretty nasty stuff you're going through at the moment and you just wish that God would snap His fingers and it would all vanish into thin air. But hey, you know life doesn't work like that. Thing is, God isn't a vending machine. You don't place your prayer into the slot and instantly get your wish out the bottom. Being a Christian doesn't exempt us from life's hassles. Actually, Jesus sort of promised the opposite: '...on earth you will have many trials...' (John 16:33 NLT) But here's the good news. If you're experiencing a bit of a cold season in your life at the moment, it won't always be so chilly. The sunny times are always just around the corner. Why? Because there's a season for everything.

<br />
Stuff. It comes in all shapes and sizes. Some stuff is nice and shiny and costs a bit of that papery stuff. Some stuff is small and compact and makes clever bleeping noises. Some stuff is old, very old, and that's what makes it collectable. Some stuff we might love. Some stuff other people might love, so they steal it. Some countries have better stuff. Some countries fight other countries for this better stuff. Some stuff lands people behind bars. Some stuff costs people their lives. But it's all just 'stuff'. Do you get it? Jesus said some pretty famous stuff on the subject of 'stuff', only He substituted the word 'treasure'. Listen: 'Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.' (Matthew 6:19-21 NIV) Thing is, whatever 'stuff' you're stacking your chips on, it had better be worth it. You're not so thick as to believe all the answers are found in bright, shiny, bleeping, collectable stuff, are you? You know the only stuff that really matters is the God stuff, the people stuff, the love stuff. Choose the right stuff!

'...Abide in My love...' John 15:9 NKJV




<br />
To make yourself at home in God's love you must: (1) Give Him the first part of your day. The Psalmist wrote, '...Early will I seek You...' (Psalm 63:1 NKJV) If you don't learn to give God the first part of your day you're unlikely to break through to a deeper relationship with Him. You must set aside a specific time and place each morning where you can read and write comfortably, think, study, talk to God out loud, and yes, weep if you need to. (2) Relish His every Word to you. Receive what He says like food, like treasure, like a love letter. Remember, you're reading in order to meet someone. Your goal is not information, it's intimacy. Stop and ponder what you've read. Let it go down into the core of your being and expect Him to interact with you. He will! (3) Talk and listen to a person-not an invisible force. We treat God as if He were some mystical force 'out there'. No, He wants you to talk to Him like you would a friend; to hear your requests, your worries, and your thanks. Go ahead, risk being honest and expect His insight in return. Take time to be still before Him. Stay there until you 'connect' with Him. (4) Write down your thoughts and impressions; not a diary of your day or an attempt at literature, but a record of your personal walk with God. Share with Him your disappointments. Ask for His wisdom. Leave your request on the page until you receive guidance. Keep track of His answers. These simple practices are called 'disciplines' because they take effort-but the reward is worth it. 
<br />
