<introtext><![CDATA['...We take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.' 2 Corinthians 10:5 NIV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150729.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>You will never be any better, wiser or happier than the thoughts that influence you. You say, ‘I can’t help it; these thoughts just come into my mind.’ Yes, you can! ‘The weapons we fight with…have divine power to demolish strongholds…we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.’ (2 Corinthians 10:4–5 NIV) A ‘stronghold’ is a thought–pattern that controls you. It could be fear, greed, inferiority, lust, etc. It’s a ‘stronghold’ because it holds you strongly in its grip. How do you break that grip? With God’s Word. For example, when fear and inadequacy tell you you’re not good enough to succeed, become proactive and say, ‘I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.’ (Philippians 4:13 NKJV) If your immediate goal is to ‘feel good’, you’ll never develop self–control. ‘For the time being no discipline brings joy, but seems grievous and painful; but afterwards it yields a peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it…’ (Hebrews 12:11 AMP) Discipline doesn’t bring immediate joy, but it brings lasting joy later on. Note the words ‘trained by it’. You must train your mind to go the right way; otherwise it’ll take you the wrong way. God says, ‘…I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life…’ (Deuteronomy 30:19 NKJV) God gives you choices. But He won’t make your choices for you; you must do that. In order to walk in God’s blessing each day, you must choose the right thoughts each day, and the longer you keep doing it the easier it will become. You’ve just got to get through the ‘training’ period.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezra 3-5, Mark 1:21-34, Ps 78:9-16, Prov 19:24-26<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67172&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He shall direct your paths.' Proverbs 3:6 NKJV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150730.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Without self–control we end up hurting ourselves, but when we become overly controlling of ourselves or others, it’s an indication that we’re not trusting God enough. In the final analysis God alone determines our outcomes. So: ‘Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths.’ (Proverbs 3:5–6 NKJV) If you find yourself trying to control every detail and aspect of your life, try using these strategies for developing the right mindset: (1) Understand that you are not an independent, self–sufficient being. ‘…We are His people, and the sheep of His pasture.’ (Psalm 100:3 NKJV) Sheep cannot take care of themselves; they need the shepherd to feed them, lead and protect them. Getting the idea? (2) When the unexpected happens, practise responding calmly. God is never taken by surprise. What seems like a crisis is often an opportunity for Him to demonstrate His love and care for you. (3) Focus on the internal and leave the external to God. Once you settle within yourself that you cannot control most external happenings, but only your internal response to them, you’ll be able to stop stressing out over the uncontrollable and the inevitable. Take a deep breath to slow the flow of adrenaline, send up a silent prayer, then turn the problem over to God. Realise that His plans for your life have not been derailed. ‘You saw me before I was born. Every day of my life was recorded in your book. Every moment was laid out before a single day had passed.’ (Psalm 139:16 NLT) Stop trying to control everything. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezra 6-8, Mark 1:35-45, Ps 78:17-31, Prov 19:27-29 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67173&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

It positions you to experience God’s power. ‘My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.’ (2 Corinthians 12:9 NKJV) Let go, and let God! (2) Be quick to express your helplessness to God. King Jehoshaphat realised that his forces were no match for three invading armies. So he prayed: ‘Oh, our God …we have no power against this great multitude that is coming against us; nor do we know what to do, but our eyes are upon You.’ (2 Chronicles 20:12 NKJV) How does his story end? Miraculously! The invading armies destroyed each other and Jehoshaphat’s army didn’t have to fight at all. Your biggest miracles will happen when you feel the least able, and trust God to intervene. (3) Meditate on Scriptures that speak about the sovereignty of God and the futility of trying to control life. ‘People throw lots to make a decision, but the answer comes from the Lord.’ (Proverbs 16:33 NCV) ‘We may make a lot of plans, but the Lord will do what He has decided.’ (Proverbs 19:21 CEV) ‘He does as He pleases among… the angels of Heaven and among… the people of the earth. No one can stop Him or say to Him, “What do you mean by doing these things?”’ (Daniel 4:35 NLT) ‘…For He chose us in advance, and He makes everything work out according to His plan.’ (Ephesians 1:11 NLT) Relax and start trusting God—He knows what He’s doing and He has your best interests at heart.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezra 9-10, Mark 2:1-12, Ps 78:32-39, Prov 20:1-3 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67175&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['He got into one of the boats...belonging to Simon...' Luke 5:3 NIV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150801.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>One day Jesus ‘…<em>saw at the water’s edge two boats, left there by the fishermen, who were washing their nets. He got into one of the boats…belonging to Simon, and asked him to put out a little from shore. Then He sat down and taught the people from the boat. When He had finished speaking, He said to Simon, “Put out into deep water, and let down the nets for a catch.” Simon answered, “Master, we’ve worked hard all night and haven’t caught anything. But because You say so, I will let down the nets.” When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break</em>.’ (Luke 5:2–6 NIV) Are you sitting today where Peter sat? Your outlook is bleak, your nets are empty, you’ve tried everything you know and you’re ready to give up? It happens; you get to the place where you simply stop expecting anything good. You’ve experienced too many disappointments and you’re afraid to dream, reach, stretch or broaden your horizons. Jesus knows how hard you’ve tried and today He’s inviting you to try again—this time with Him. Even though you’re wrestling with depression and tormenting memories, unemployment, addiction, financial failure or sickness, the Lord of new beginnings wants to come on board. If you listen to Him, He will show you what to do. Now, what He says may not initially make sense to you. But if you’re willing to respond like Peter—‘<em>Because You say so, I will</em>’—you’re on the threshold of a miracle. Today, listen and obey the words of Jesus and watch how your situation changes. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Jn 1:1-3:10, Mark 2:13-22, Ps 78:40-55, Prov 20:4-6 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67617&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...you will be able to discern what is best...' Philippians 1:10 NIV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150802.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>God gave you feelings, and you should never be ashamed of them. They can alert you to danger and give you insight into various situations. God actually uses our feelings to draw us closer to Him and highlight areas in our lives that need to be submitted to His Holy Spirit. But feelings are subjective; you can’t always trust them. Jon Walker says: ‘When old feelings creep back in we feel fearful, ashamed, hopeless, not good enough, unlovable, victimised, helpless and resentful… An event can trigger these reactions…ending a relationship, stress, problems at work and at home, times of change or illness…and sometimes these feelings return for no reason.’ So you must test your feelings, otherwise you’ll end up allowing ‘…<em>your feelings [to] get out of control</em>.’ (Colossians 3:5 NIV) It can be disastrous to act on what you see, hear and feel. Instead of reacting to feelings, you must learn to act on what God’s Word says. That’s the gold standard, and it never changes! For instance, even if you feel like you can walk on water, you can only do it if God has called you to step out of the boat. Paul says, ‘…<em>my prayer [is] that [you]…abound…in knowledge and…insight…that you may be able to discern what is best</em>…’ (Philippians 1:9–10 NIV) Bottom line: don’t rely on your feelings, rely on the knowledge and truth of God’s Word. You may feel worthless, but God says, ‘…<em>You are precious to Me …I love you</em>.’ (Isaiah 43:4 NLT) You may feel like a failure, but God says, ‘<em>There is…no condemnation for those…in Christ</em>.’ (Romans 8:1 NIV) </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezek 37:1-14, Matt 27:50-53, 1 Thess 4:13-18 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67618&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['These all wait for You, that You may give them their food in due season.' Psalm 104:27 NKJV <br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150803.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>We fear losing our job, our health insurance and our retirement benefits, so we amass possessions, thinking the more we have, the safer we are. Jesus told a parable of one such person: ‘...<em>“The land of a rich man produced plentifully, and he thought to himself, ‘What shall I do, for I have nowhere to store my crops?’ And he said, ‘I will do this: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods</em>.' (Luke 12:16-18 ESV) Can’t you hear the presumption in those words? Just like us stockpiling pensions, possessions and property, he accumulated and stacked until his barns of belongings were overflowing. Then he said, “<em>...Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years; relax, eat, drink, be merry.</em>” (Luke 12:19 ESV) The Bible says, ‘<em>Command those who are rich…not to…trust in uncertain riches but in the living God</em>…’ (1 Timothy 6:17 NKJV) Riches don’t bring security. The more you have, the more you have to lose! It’s ironic; the more you accumulate the more protective you become, and the greater your concern that it could all be swept away by events you can’t control. That’s not how God intended you to live. He wants you to save and He wants you to sow. And when you’ve done all that wisdom demands, to trust in nothing but Him. The Psalmist said, ‘…<em>Living things…small and great…all wait for You, that You may give them their food in due season</em>.’ (Psalm 104:25–27 NKJV) And He does. God’s the great giver, absolutely generous and utterly dependable. The resounding message of Scripture is clear: God owns it all. God shares it all. So place your trust in Him—not in belongings. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Jn 3:11-5:21, Mark 2:23-3:6, Ps 78:56-64, Prov 20:7-10 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67619&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['When I fed them, they were satisfied; when they were satisfied, they became proud; then they forgot Me.' Hosea 13:6 NIV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150804.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Paul writes: ‘<em>Command those who are rich in this present age not to be haughty, nor to trust in uncertain riches but in the living God, Who gives us richly all things to enjoy. Let them do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to give, willing to share</em>.’ (1 Timothy 6:17–18 NKJV) Are you ‘rich in this present age’? Almost half the world—more than three billion people—lives on less than $4 a day. So if your income is more than that, you’re rich by comparison. But prosperity comes with a warning: don’t be arrogant. ‘<em>Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall</em>.’ (Proverbs 16:18 NIV) The Scottish historian Thomas Carlyle wrote, ‘Adversity is sometimes hard upon a man. But for one man who can stand prosperity, there are a hundred that will stand adversity.’ God wants you to enjoy things without becoming obsessed with them. Accumulating possessions has a way of eclipsing God, no matter how meagre they may be. There’s a predictable progression from poverty to pride. The poor man prays and works; God hears and blesses. The humble man becomes rich and forgets God. The faithful poor man becomes the proud rich man. As God said through Hosea, ‘<em>When I fed them, they were satisfied; when they were satisfied, they became proud; then they forgot Me.</em>’ How can you avoid this trap? Remember that everything you own comes from God, and He’s the source of everything you’ll need in the future. So live with a grateful heart, and in total dependence on Him. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Chr 1-2, Mark 3:7-19, Ps 78:65-72, Prov 20:11-14 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67620&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['&quot;The silver is Mine and the gold&quot;...declares the Lord...' Haggai 2:8 NIV <br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150805.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>How would you describe someone who built a house without giving any forethought to the foundation? Foolish! Likewise, God says, don’t put your trust in ‘<em>uncertain riches</em>’ (1 Timothy 6:17 NKJV). Between 1948 and 2001 the U.S. economy endured ten recessions, each averaging one year, and resulting in the loss of billions of dollars. That means every five years or so, the economy dumps its suitors and starts all over again. What word would you use to describe a husband who philandered his way through nine different wives over fifty years? Fickle? And how would you describe wife number ten? Foolish? Abraham was one of the richest men of his generation, and so was Job. The New Testament church had some rich people in it. The Bible says, ‘…<em>all who were possessors of lands or houses sold them …brought the proceeds…and laid them at the apostles’ feet</em>…’ (Acts 4:34–35 NKJV) God wants you to be blessed financially so you can bless His work. But the reason He doesn’t give some of us more money is because He knows we don’t have the maturity to handle it. It would be our undoing. And to those He does entrust with money, He says, ‘<em>Let them do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to give, willing to share.</em>’ (1 Timothy 6:18 NKJV) You don’t really own anything; you’re just a steward. ‘<em>“The silver is Mine and the gold is Mine,” declares the Lord.</em>’ The truth is, you’ll never be financially secure until you’re willing to say, ‘Yes!’ to God in whatever He asks you to do, knowing that He will always take care of you. Always! </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Chr 3:1-4:23, Mark 3:20-35, Ps 119:1-8, Prov 20:15-18 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67621&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['To the Lord your God belong the heavens...the earth and everything in it.' Deuteronomy 10:14 NIV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150806.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>When it comes to our money, we like to think, ‘I earned it, so it’s mine.’ But that’s where you’re dead wrong! The Bible says: ‘<em>To the Lord your God belong the heavens…the earth and everything in it.</em>’ (Deuteronomy 10:14 NIV) ‘<em>Yours, O Lord, is the greatness…the power… the glory…the majesty and the splendour, for everything in Heaven and earth is Yours</em>.’ (1 Chronicles 29:11 NIV) ‘<em>“The silver…and the gold is Mine,” declares the Lord Almighty.</em>’ (Haggai 2:8 NIV) Riches are like Monopoly money; if you’re better than your competition, you end up with the deeds to the most expensive properties. But guess what? At the end of the day when the game is over, the participants leave the table and all the stuff goes back in the box. And if you were overly aggressive, the other players may end up not liking you. Here’s a humbling Scripture: ‘<em>Do not be overawed when others grow rich... for they will take nothing with them when they die... Though while they live they count themselves blessed—they will join those... who will never again see the light of life. People who have wealth but lack understanding are like the beasts that perish</em>.’ (Psalm 49:16–20 NIV) The God who owns it all gives it to us for two reasons: (1) To enjoy. (2) To invest into fulfilling His purposes on earth. When we live with that attitude, we replace fear with faith in God.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Chr 4:24-5:26, Mark 4:1-12, Ps 119:9-16, Prov 20:19-21 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67623&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

Acts 17:28 NKJV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150807.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>George Washington Carver, an agricultural chemist who discovered three hundred uses for peanuts, shared these observations about God: ‘As a very small boy exploring the almost virgin woods of the old Carver place, I had the impression someone had just been there ahead of me. Things were so orderly, so clean, so harmoniously beautiful. A few years later in these same woods…I was practically overwhelmed with the sense of some great pres-ence. Not only had someone been there, someone was there…Years later when I read in the Scriptures, “…<em>in Him we live, and move, and have our being</em>,” I knew what the writer meant. Never since have I been without this consciousness of the Creator speaking to me… the out–doors has been to me more and more a great cathedral in which God could be continuously spoken to and heard from… Man, who needed a purpose, a mission to keep him alive, had one. He could be…God’s co–worker… My purpose alone must be God’s purpose—to increase the welfare and happiness of His people… Why, then, should we, who believe in Christ, be so surprised at what God can do with a willing man in a laboratory?’ In 1921 Carver spoke before the United States House of Representatives. The chairman asked, ‘Dr. Carver, how did you learn all these things?’ He answered, ‘From an old book.’ The chairman asked, ‘What book?’ Carver replied, ‘The Bible.’ The chairman enquired, ‘Does the Bible talk about peanuts?’ Carver replied, ‘No sir, but it tells about the God who made the peanut. I asked Him to show me what to do with the peanut, and He did.’ Do you need a creative idea or solution today? Ask God! </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Chr 6:1-7:19, Mark 4:13-25, Ps 119:17-24, Prov 20:22-24 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67624&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...think about the things that are good...' Philippians 4:8 NCV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150808.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Be honest: Have you ever met a perfectionist who was truly happy? No, because when things must always ‘be a certain way’, life becomes miserable because it’s constantly changing. As soon as you solve one problem, another comes along. Instead of dwelling on their blessings and being grateful, perfectionists focus on what’s wrong and why they need to fix it. It may be a job they did that was less than perfect, a few kilos they need to lose, or even a disorganised wardrobe. Or it could be someone else’s imperfections: the way they live their life, how they behave, or the way they look. Constantly dwelling on flaws—your own or someone else’s—makes it impossible to be grateful. And gratitude is at the core of happiness. Now, let’s be clear; we’re not talking about striving to do better. That’s a good thing. We’re talking about obsessing over what’s wrong. There’ll always be a better way to do something, but that doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy life the way it is right now. So what’s the cure? Catch yourself before you fall into the trap of insisting that things should be different from how they are. Stop and remind yourself that, in the absence of your judgment, everything will work out just fine. Paul says, ‘…<em>in all things God works for the good of those who love Him</em>…’ (Romans 8:28 NIV) Are you getting it? God’s in control; it’s ok for you to let go. Instead of focusing on the negative, ‘<em>think about the things that are good and worthy of praise</em>.’ (Philippians 4:8 NCV) When you do, you’ll begin to discover how wonderful life is. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Chr 7:20-9:44, Mark 4:26-41, Ps 119:25-32, Prov 20:25-27 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67625&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...men shall dream dreams [and]...see visions.' Joel 2:28 NKJV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150809.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>A boy supposedly once asked Michelangelo why he was working so hard chipping away on the block of marble that would become his greatest masterpiece: David. The artist replied, ‘There’s an angel inside this rock and I’m setting him free.’ The power of vision enables you to see a potential masterpiece in what others overlook or consider worthless. It also helps you discover things within yourself you never knew were there. It brings out the best in you. Many of the people God used in Scripture looked like losers before they looked like winners. After the disciples fished all night and caught nothing, Jesus told them, ‘…<em>Do not be afraid. From now on you will catch men</em>.’ (Luke 5:10 NKJV) They did, and they ended up: (1) building a church that’s still thriving two thousand years later; (2) writing history’s greatest books; (3) having our sons named after them. Does that mean you can just dream a dream and God will fulfil it? No. Paul says, ‘…<em>You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honour God</em>…’ (1 Corinthians 6:19–20 NIV) Belonging to Christ means you lost the right to take your talents, opportunities and experiences and run off in any direction you please. But why would you even want to? What could possibly be more fulfilling than God’s purpose for your life? And what could be more tragic than missing it? You can’t wring enough meaning out of secular accomplishments to satisfy your soul. The hole you’re trying to fill has an eternal dimension only Christ can fill. That’s why you must pray, ‘Lord, show me Your vision for my life.’ </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Eccl 11:7-12:1, Ps 39:4-13, 2 Tim 4:6-8<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67626&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

Proverbs 3:6 NKJV <br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150810.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Having God’s vision for your life gives you four things: (1) <em>Passion</em>. It makes you wake up in the morning and bound out of bed because there’s something out there you love to do; something you believe in and are good at; something bigger than you; something you can hardly wait to get at. (2) <em>Motivation</em>. Author Richard B. Edler said: ‘Safe living generally makes for regrets later on. We are all given talents and dreams. Sometimes the two don’t match. But more often than not we compromise both before ever finding out. Later on, we find ourselves looking back longingly to that time when we should’ve chased our true dreams and talents for all they’re worth. Don’t be pressured into thinking your dreams or talents aren’t prudent. They were never meant to be… They were meant to bring joy and fulfilment to your life.’ (3) <em>Direction</em>. Vision simplifies decision–making. Anything that moves you closer to your vision gets a green light; everything else should be approached with caution. Vision brings what’s important to the surface, and weeds out anything that stands in your way. Without vision, good things will keep you from achieving great things. People without a clear vision are easily distracted. They’ve a tendency to drift aimlessly from one thing to another. They’ve no spiritual, relational, financial or moral compass. Consequently, they make decisions that rob them of their dreams. (4) <em>Purpose</em>. Having vision is like getting a sneak preview of things to come. It says, ‘If you don’t show up, something important won’t happen. Your life matters. Without you, what could be—won’t be.’ </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Chr 10:1-12:22, Mark 5:1-10, Ps 119:33-40, Prov 20:28-30 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67627&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I will instruct you...in the way you should go.' Psalm 32:8 NKJV <br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150811.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Mother Teresa didn’t set out searching for fame; it found her. She simply went to India, found a need no one else was meeting, heard the call of God, allowed her heart to be consumed by it, and ministered to multitudes of the world’s most neglected and forgotten people in the slums of Calcutta. One of her most famous slogans was, ‘A life not lived for others is not a life at all.’ Let’s face it; much of what we do each day doesn’t seem to matter until it’s evaluated as part of a larger picture. When you take the minutiae of any given day, drop it into the cauldron of a God–ordained vision and stir it around, suddenly there’s purpose, worth, adrenaline and the joy that comes from knowing you’re fulfilling your destiny. It’s like the difference between filling bags with dirt and building a levee to save a town. There’s nothing glamorous about filling sandbags, but saving a town from the ravages of a flood is another matter entirely. Building a levee gives meaning to the drudgery of shovelling dirt into sandbags. And it’s like that with your vision. Many times the everyday routine of life can feel like shovelling dirt. But take those same routines and view them through the lens of a God–given purpose, and suddenly everything looks very different. Vision brings your world into focus. It brings order and purpose out of chaos. It enables you to see everything in a fresh light. And the good news is that God is the giver of visions—so ask Him for one! </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Chr 12:23-15:29, Mark 5:11-20, Ps 119:41-48, Prov 21:1-3 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67628&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...so the power of God could be seen in him.' John 9:3 NLT<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150812.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>When Jesus encountered a blind man, His disciples immediately began to discuss the man’s condition. They asked, ‘<em>Was this man’s blindness the result of his own sins, or the sins of his parents?</em>’ Jesus answered, ‘<em>This happened so the power of God could be seen in him</em>.’ Notice four things: (1) <em>The disciples were eager to attribute the man’s problem to sin</em>. Satan will try to convince you that, because of your sin, you’re disqualified from God’s grace. You’re not! ‘<em>For He says to Moses: “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion</em>.”’ (Romans 9:15 ESV) (2) <em>When Jesus healed him, the neighbours wanted to debate, not celebrate.</em> They started asking, ‘“<em>…Isn’t this the man who used to sit and beg?” Some said he was… others said, “No…</em>”’ (John 9:8–9 NLT) (3) <em>His healing failed the ‘religiosity test’</em> because the Pharisees said, “…<em>This man Jesus is not from God for He is working on the Sabbath…</em>”’ (John 9:16 NLT) (4) <em>Even the man’s parents weren’t free to praise God</em>, because ‘…<em>anyone saying Jesus was the Messiah would be expelled from the synagogue</em>.’ (John 9:22 NLT) To the neighbours he was a misfit, to church leaders a topic of debate, to his parents a social stigma, so they ‘…<em>threw him out</em>.’ (John 9:34 NIV) End of story? Thank God—no! ‘<em>Jesus...found him... and said, “...I have come into this world, so that the blind will see...</em>”’ (John 9:35, 39 NIV) So instead of rehashing your problem and listening to other people’s opinions, take it to the Lord in prayer. When you share it with others, the best you’ll get is sympathy, but when you share it with Jesus you’ll get a solution. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Chr 16-18, Mark 5:21-30, Ps 119:49-56, Prov 21:4-6 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67629&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...do not complain...' James 5:9 NCV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150813.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Whatever you keep doing becomes a habit. That’s why James says, ‘…<em>do not complain</em>…’ Author Jon Gordon says, ‘A complaining fast won’t just make everyone around you happier…you’ll experience more joy, peace, success and positive relationships.’ So instead of complaining when things go wrong: (1) <em>Practise gratitude</em>. Giving thanks for three blessings every day energises you and makes you feel happier. It’s impossible to be grateful and negative at the same time. (2) <em>Encourage others</em>. Instead of complaining about what people do wrong, focus on what they’re doing right. ‘…<em>encourage…people who are afraid. Help those who are weak. Be patient with everyone.</em>’ (1 Thessalonians 5:14 NCV) It’s ok to criticise people’s weaknesses as long as you balance it with three times more praise. (3) <em>Focus on your success</em>. Start a success journal. Every night before you go to bed, write down something great about your day. It could be an uplifting conversation…or an accomplishment you’re proud of. There’s truth to the old saying, ‘Nothing succeeds like success.’ When you focus on success you set the stage for more to follow. (4) <em>Learn to let go</em>. Instead of obsessing about what you can’t change, focus on what you can influence. When you stop trying to control everything and place your life in God’s hands, things have a way of working out. (5) <em>Use the power of prayer</em>. Paul says, ‘…<em>pray…on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests…</em>’ (Ephesians 6:18 NIV) Prayer reduces stress, boosts positive energy and promotes health. When you’re under pressure, instead of complaining, plug in to God’s power and recharge your batteries. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Chr 19:1-23:20, Mark 5:31-43, Ps 119:57-64, Prov 21:7-9 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67630&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Wait patiently for the Lord. Be brave and courageous...' Psalm 27:14 NLT<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150814.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>It’s in looking back that we realise: (1) <em>God had something better in mind for us</em>. (2) <em>We weren’t mature enough at that point to handle what we were asking Him for</em>. We think we’re ready, but God knows when we are. Scripture often commands us to ‘<em>wait on the Lord</em>’. Learning to wait is a test of maturity. John MacArthur writes: ‘People find it difficult with life if they can’t instantly gratify every desire. They want to eliminate every discomfort, difficulty, injustice or deprivation instantly. Scripture responds with two revolutionary concepts: heavenly mindedness and delayed gratification.’ Waiting forces us to accept that we’re not in control. It humbles us in ways we need to be humbled. Consider the trapeze artist: for a split second, which must feel like an eternity, he or she is suspended in nothingness. They can’t go back, and it’s too soon to feel the grasp of the one who’ll catch them. They must wait in absolute trust. You may be at that same point in your life right now. You’ve let go of what God called you to let go of, but you can’t feel His hand catching you yet. Moses waited eighty years for a ministry that lasted forty years: two–thirds of his life was spent getting ready! Jesus spent thirty years preparing for a ministry that would last three–and–a–half years. From God’s perspective, your life isn’t measured by its length, but by its effectiveness and its impact for His Kingdom. So wait, and keep a good attitude while you’re doing it. God won’t disappoint you. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Chr 23:21-26:19, Mark 6:1-13, Ps 119:65-72, Prov 21:10-13 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67631&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...You will be missed, because your seat will be empty.' 1 Samuel 20:18 NIV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150724.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Who’s the one person whose death you dread most? Is it causing you anxiety? If so, begin to put these things into practice: (1) Ask God for the grace to accept death as an inevitable part of life. Both you and your loved one will eventually die, and no one but God knows who’s going to do so first. Therefore, worrying about something outside your control only robs you of your peace and joy. (2) Maximise each moment. If you knew the exact date of your loved one’s departure, what would you wish you’d done? Or not done? Would you take that trip you’ve always talked about? Would you be less critical and more complimentary? Would you spend more time with them, and tell them more often that you love them? (3) Don’t give another moment of your time to silly arguments and little irritations. (4) Make every effort to be sure your loved one is in right standing with God. Then you can be assured they’re at peace, and that you’ll spend eternity together. (5) Remember, your loved one is God’s loved one, too. And He loves them even more than you do. When the time comes, God will be right there with you. ‘Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for You are with me…’ (Psalm 23:4 NKJV) (6) Try to picture your loved one in Heaven. Jesus said, ‘…I go to prepare a place for you…that where I am, there you may be also.’ (John 14:2–3 NKJV) The parting will only be momentary, but the reunion will be forever. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Tim 1-3, Matt 28:1-10, Ps 42:1-5, Prov 19:12-14<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67167&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let Christ's word...live in you.' Colossians 3:16 GWT <br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150520.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Making the right decisions and choosing the right actions are the crux of living successfully. If you are the source of your own wisdom, or you're looking to others, your odds are not good. Paul writes, 'Let Christ's word with all its wisdom and richness live in you.' If you do, you'll have the winning strategy for your life.</p>
<p>But you must: (1) <em>Read it</em>. You don't have to understand it all; it's not an intellectual exercise. Reading it prayerfully brings power and wisdom because '...<em>the Word that God speaks is alive and active... [penetrating] to the place where soul and spirit meet</em>.' (Hebrews 4:12 PHPS) (2) <em>Meditate on it</em>. That means 'chew on' it. Let your spiritual digestive juices process God's Word until its nutrients become part of you: strengthening, energising and directing you. (3) <em>Believe it</em>. '<em>My Word...always produces... It will accomplish all I want it to</em>.' (Isaiah 55:11 NLT) There's only one thing that can short-circuit God's Word - unbelief. '<em>The message...did them no good, because they only heard and did not believe as well</em>.' (Hebrews 4:2 PHPS). 'Hearing' opens the door; 'believing' walks through it and activates the promise. (4) <em>Receive it</em>. No matter how strongly you believe in God's promises and His intention to give them to you, they're not yours until you receive them by faith. '<em>Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours</em>.' (Mark 11:24 NIV) So believe your answer is on the way, and keep your faith strong until it arrives.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Judg 4-6, Matt 12:1-14, Ps 93, Prov 13:7-8<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66565&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...We can certainly do it.' Numbers 13:30 NIV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150408.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Here’s the rest of Evelyn Brand’s story. At age seventy she received word from her home mission office that they weren’t going to give her another five–year term. But she had Caleb’s ‘we can certainly do it’ attitude. A party was held to celebrate her time in India, and everyone there cheered her on. ‘Have a good trip back home,’ they all said. ‘I’ll tell you a little secret,’ she announced, ‘I’m not going back home. I’m staying in India.’ Evelyn had a little shack built with some resources that she had smuggled in. Then she bought a pony to get around the mountains, and this septuagenarian would ride from village to village on horseback to tell people about Jesus. She did that for five years on her own. One day, at 75 years old, she fell and broke her hip. Her son, Paul Brand, the eminent doctor, said to her, ‘Mum, you’ve had a great run. God’s used you. It’s time to give it up now. You can go back home.’ She replied, ‘I am not going back home.’ She spent another eighteen years travelling from one village to another on horseback. Falls, concussions, sicknesses and ageing could not stop her. Finally, when she hit 93 years old, she could not ride a horse any more. So the men in these villages—because they loved Granny Brand so much—put her on a stretcher and carried her from one village to another. She lived two more years and gave those years as a gift, carried on a stretcher, to help the poorest of the poor. She died, but she never retired. She just graduated.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 36:27-40:16, Luke 24:25-35, Ps 25:8-15, Prov 10:1-3<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65459&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let your light so shine before men...' Matthew 5:16 NKJV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150409.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>A reporter once said to Joe DiMaggio, the famous baseball player, ‘You always seem to play with the same intensity. You run out every grounder and race after every fly ball, even when the Yankees have a big lead in the pennant race and there’s nothing on the line. How come?’ DiMaggio replied, ‘I always remind myself that there might be someone in the stands who never saw me play before.’ That’s the kind of unselfish mindset you must maintain in order to influence others for good and for God. It takes energy and intentionality, whether one–on–one or in a group, but it pays dividends. Nicodemus, a Jewish leader, was drawn to Christ because he’d listened to His teachings and observed His works from afar. He may have come to Jesus at night to avoid ridicule, but the fact is, he came because he couldn’t stay away! (John 3:1–21). The Bible says you’re a ‘…<em>letter…known and read by everybody</em>.’ (2 Corinthians 3:2 NIV) Today someone is watching how you handle problems; how you treat your family and your employees; how you act when the boss isn’t around; how you respond to criticism or temptation. Don’t disappoint them. Jesus said: ‘<em>You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in Heaven</em>.’ (Matthew 5:14–16 NKJV)</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 41-44, Luke 24:36-44, Ps 25:16-22, Prov 10:4-7<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65460&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...It is [God] who has made us, and not we ourselves...' Psalm 100:3 NAS <br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150410.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Do you need motivation today? Take a look at the palm tree. (1) <em>You can cut it, but you can’t kill it!</em> The minerals and nutrients most trees need to survive are found on the surface, just below the bark, so, when you cut them, they die. But not the palm tree. Its life comes from within, so it flourishes, even under attack. Listen: ‘...<em>we have this treasure in earthen vessels</em>...’ (2 Corinthians 4:7 NAS) How wonderful; even though the earthen vessel without may be cut and wounded, the treasure within is secure, beyond the enemy’s reach! (2) <em>It will bend, but it won’t break.</em> Tropical winds can blow most trees away, but not the palm tree. The stronger the wind, the further it bends—sometimes all the way to the ground. Yet when the storm ceases, it straightens up again and is actually stronger in the place where it bent. What a picture! We were made to bend, but not break, because God strengthens us ‘...<em>with His glorious power so [we] will have all the patience and endurance [we] need</em>.’ (Colossians 1:11 NLT) (3) Its depth always exceeds its height! While the roots of the average plant go only a few feet under the ground, the palm tree’s roots can go down hundreds of metres in search of water. David said, ‘<em>As the deer pants for streams of water, so my soul pants for you..</em>.’ (Psalm 42:1 NIV) Go deep, work on your own connection to God and you’ll never be uprooted or barren or blown away!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 45-48, Luke 24:45-53, Ps 50:1-15, Prov 10:8-10 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65461&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...They will flourish in the courts of our God.' Psalm 92:13 NIV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150411.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Inside you there’s a battle between your flourishing self—the person you were created to be—and your languishing self. ‘What’s that?’ you ask. Your languishing self feels uneasy and discontent. You’re drawn to bad habits like mindlessly watching TV, drinking too much, misusing sex, excessive spending—things designed to temporarily anaesthetise pain. Your thoughts automatically drift in the direction of fear and anger. Learning doesn’t feel worthwhile. You think about yourself most of the time. Whereas flourishing [thriving, blossoming, and prospering] takes place: (1) <em>In your spirit</em>. You sense you’re beginning to receive ideas and energy from an outside source. And you are. You’re being empowered by God’s Spirit. We talk about being inspired, which literally means ‘God–breathed’. God breathes into you; you come alive and feel like you’ve a purpose for living. (2) <em>In your mind</em>. Your thoughts are marked by joy and peace. You have a desire to love and to learn. You’re literally being transformed by ‘…<em>the renewing of your mind</em>…’ (Romans 12:2 NIV) (3) <em>In your time</em>. You wake each day with a sense of excitement, and you realise you’re never too young to flourish. Mozart was composing brilliant music when he was five. Paul told Timothy, ‘<em>Don’t let anyone look down on you because you are young</em>…’ (1 Timothy 4:12 NIV) You also realise you’re never too old to flourish. Grandma Moses was 69 when she took up painting, and artist Marc Chagall did some of his best work in his nineties. It’s humbling to acknowledge you can’t be anything you want. But once you accept that and seek to maximise what God created you to be, you start flourishing.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 49-50, Matt 1:1-6, Ps 50:16-23, Prov 10:11-13<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65462&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...a grain of wheat remains no more than a single grain unless it... dies...then it produces many grains.' John 12:24 GNT<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150412.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Here are two more areas in which God created you to flourish: (1) <em>Your relationships</em>. Relationally, your languishing self is often troubled. You’re undisciplined in what you say, sometimes reverting to sarcasm, gossip and flattery. You isolate. You dominate. You attack. You withdraw. Whereas your flourishing self seeks to bless others. They energise you. You’re able to disclose your thoughts and feelings in a way that invites openness in them. You’re quick to admit your own mistakes and to freely forgive others. (2) <em>Your experiences</em>. God grows you because He wants to use you in His plans to redeem His world: that’s why you find Him changing your experiences. Your flourishing self has a desire to contribute. You live with a sense of calling. Indeed, your inner longing to become all you were meant to be is a tiny echo of God’s longing to begin the new creation. The rabbis spoke of this as <em>tikkun olam</em>—‘to repair the world’. Focused on yourself, your life is as small as a grain of wheat. Given to God, however, it’s as if that grain is planted in rich soil, growing into part of a much bigger project. Jesus said: ‘…<em>unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds. The man who loves his life will lose it, while the man who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life</em>.’ (John 12:24–25 NIV)</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Sam 17:4-51, Eph 6:10-18 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65463&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

Psalm 19:7 NLT<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150413.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Worldly success can leave you empty, but here’s something that won’t: ‘<em>The instructions of the Lord are perfect, reviving the soul</em>...’ Have your plans fallen apart? Have you made a mess of your life? Do you need direction? Read this: ‘<em>The decrees of the Lord are trustworthy, making wise the simple.</em>’ (Psalm 19:7 NLT) Have the things you thought would bring you happiness, ended up bringing you misery? Read this: ‘<em>The commandments of the Lord are right, bringing joy to the heart</em>…’ (Psalm 19:8 NLT) Are you directionless, wondering where to go and what to do with your life? Read this: ‘<em>The commands of the Lord are clear, giving insight for living</em>.’ (Psalm 19:8 NLT) The answers you’re seeking are in your Bible. David was a brilliant soldier, a popular king, and a man with access to all the riches anyone could desire. But he discovered these things don’t bring lasting joy. What he found instead is that: ‘…<em>The laws of the Lord are true…They are more desirable than gold, even the finest gold. They are sweeter than honey, even honey dripping from the comb. They are a warning to your servant, a great reward to those who obey them</em>.’ (Psalm 19:9–11 NLT) What was David’s problem? ‘<em>How can I know all the sins lurking in my heart? Cleanse me from these hidden faults. Keep your servant from deliberate sins! Don’t let them control me. Then I will be free of guilt…</em>’ (Psalm 19:12–13 NLT) What was David’s solution? Reading God’s Word daily, feeding his soul on it, and walking according to its precepts.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 51-52, Matt 1:7-17, Ps 56, Prov 10:14-16<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65464&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...We are...created...to do good works, which God prepared in advance...' Ephesians 2:10 NIV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150414.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>God created you, and He knows what you were intended to be. He has ‘good works’ for you to do, but they’re not necessarily the kind of ‘to–do’ things we put on a list for our spouses or employees. They’re signposts to your true self. Your spiritual life isn’t limited to certain devotional activities. It is about being empowered by God to become the person He envisioned when He created you. But just as nobody becomes happy because their goal is to be happy, becoming the person God intended you to be won’t happen if your focus is always on yourself. Flourishing is tied to a nobler vision; it doesn’t happen by ‘looking out for number one’. People who flourish bring blessing to others, and they do it in unexpected and humble circumstances. Every once in a while you catch a glimpse of the person you were made to be. You say something inspirational. You express compassion. You forgive an old hurt. You give sacrificially. You refrain from saying something you’d normally blurt out. And as you do, you glimpse for a moment the reason God made you. Only He knows your full potential, and He’s always guiding you toward the best version of yourself. He uses many tools, He’s never in a hurry—and that can be frustrating. But even in our frustration He’s at work producing patience. He never gets discouraged by how long it takes, and He delights every time you grow. Only God knows what his intended transformation of you is, and He’s more committed to it than you are.

<introtext><![CDATA['...You, O Lord, have helped me and comforted me.' Psalm 86:17 NIV <br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150415.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Have you been hurt by a Christian who chose to condemn you instead of showing compassion and helping you? Or by someone who neglected you when they should have sought you out, restored you spiritually and returned you to your rightful place in the family of God? Most people who’ve been hurt by other Christians could easily convince a jury that it should never have happened. And the truth is, it shouldn’t. But it did—and reliving it won’t change things. But it will change you—and not for the better. Stop and think: if you were mugged and taken to the hospital, you wouldn’t spend all your time obsessing about the person who beat you up. No, your main objective would be to recover as quickly as possible and move on. Ironically, with physical wounds we seek help immediately, but with emotional ones we’re inclined to focus on the problem instead of the solution. So what are you going to do? Here are your options: (1) <em>Rehearse it</em>. By constantly talking to others about what happened, you empower your pain and keep it alive. (2) <em>Repress it</em>. David did that: ‘<em>When I kept silent…my strength was sapped as in the heat of summer</em>.’ (Psalm 32:3–4 NIV) (3) <em>Process it</em>. That means being willing to uncover the areas where you were wounded and opening yourself to receive God’s grace. That’s when you discover: ‘<em>He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds</em>.’ (Psalm 147:3 NKJV) (4) <em>Share it</em>. The Bible says, ‘<em>Confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed</em>…’ (James 5:16 NIV) If you’re wise you’ll choose options three and four.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 1:1-3:10, Matt 2:1-12, Ps 127, Prov 10:19-21<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65466&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Do you want to get well?' John 5:6 NIV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150416.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Getting hurt in life is inevitable; staying hurt is a choice. You can decide to remain a victim by dwelling on how things should have been, or use the experience to grow stronger and wiser. At the Pool of Bethesda Jesus met a man who’d been lying paralysed on a mat for 38 years. When Jesus discovered how long he’d been there, He asked, ‘Do you want to get well?’ After 38 years, the chances are this man saw his handicap as part of his identity. He’d been incapacitated for so long he thought like a victim: ‘<em>I have no one to help me into the pool…</em>’ (John 5:7 NIV) Translation: ‘Nobody cares.’ But Jesus did, and He commanded him to get up and walk. Now this man simply obeyed Jesus’ instructions, he didn’t argue the point or fall back on traditions or superstitions, he just obeyed and was healed on the spot. The church is made up of flawed human beings who sometimes speak without thinking and hurt others. But that’s no reason for leaving the church because we’re all at different points along the journey of faith, so we need to be gracious toward each other. ‘…<em>You’re part of the body of Christ</em>…’ (Colossians 3:15 CEV) Apart from it you’ve no function, no food supply, and no fulfilment, so you begin to wither spiritually. Walk through the process of asking God for healing, trust in His Word and be patient with those walking the journey with you.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 3:11-5:42, Matt 2:13-18, Ps 75, Prov 10:22-23<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65467&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The measure you use...will be measured to you.' Luke 6:38 NIV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150417.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Dr William DeVries, the surgeon who pioneered the artificial heart, is the kind of doctor who shows up at the hospital on Sunday, just to cheer up discouraged patients. He even changes dressings and, if a patient wants him to stick around and talk, he always does. His friends say he’s ‘an old shoe’ who fits in wherever he goes. He wears cowboy boots with his surgical garb, and repairs hearts to the music of Vivaldi. ‘He’s always got a smile lurking,’ says friend Dr Robert Goodin, ‘And he’s always looking for a way to let it out.’ DeVries believes that ‘arriving’ is not a place where others serve you, but where you get to serve them. Chuck Swindoll writes, ‘We occupy common space, but we no longer have common interests. It’s as if we’re on an elevator with rules like “No talking or smiling or eye–contact allowed without written consent of the management.” We’re losing touch with one another! The motivation to help, to encourage, yes, to serve our fellow man is waning. Yet it’s these things that form the essentials of a happy, fulfilled life. That’s what Jesus meant when He said, “<em>The greatest among you will be your servant</em>.” (Matthew 23:11 NIV) Everything God gives you is first a gift to enjoy, then a seed to sow. Got a good education? Leadership ability? More money than you need? You’ve got seeds—sow them!’ Read God’s promises regarding generosity, then start giving to others what He’s given to you. That’s the way to find happiness!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 6-7, Matt 2:19-23, Ps 130, Prov 10:24-26<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65468&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['You must have the same attitude that Christ Jesus had.' Philippians 2:5 NLT<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150418.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>‘<em>Don’t look out only for your own interests, but take an interest in others, too.</em>’ (Philippians 2:4 NLT) Spiritual maturity is the ability to see and act in the best interests of others. Immature people have difficulty seeing things from someone else’s point of view. They rarely concern themselves with what’s best for the other person. In many ways they’re like children. In <em>Property Law as Viewed by a Toddler</em>, Michael V. Hernandez describes the world from a typical child’s viewpoint: (1) If I like it, it’s mine. (2) If it’s in my hand, it’s mine. (3) If I can take it from you, it’s mine. (4) If I had it a little while ago, it’s mine. (5) If it’s mine, it must never appear to be yours in any way. (6) If I’m doing or building something, all the pieces are mine. (7) If it looks like mine, it’s mine. (8) If I saw it first, it’s mine. (9) If I can see it, it’s mine. (10) If I think it’s mine, it’s mine.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, maturity doesn’t always come with age; sometimes age comes alone. You must fight your inherent selfish attitude, and that can be a lifelong battle. But it’s an important one, because if you don’t win you’ll end up focused on your own agenda and overlook other people. Unless somebody’s important to your cause or your interests, they won’t get your time or attention. The Bible says, ‘<em>You must have the same attitude that Christ Jesus had</em>,’ and everything He did, He did for others. It comes down to this: if you’re serious about following in His footsteps, practise being unselfish.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 8-9, Matt 3:1-10, Ps 103:1-12, Prov 10:27-29<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65469&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

In <em>The Empowered Communicator</em>, Calvin Miller uses the form of a letter to describe this problem and the negative impact it has: ‘Dear speaker, your ego has become a wall between yourself and me. You’re not really concerned about me, are you? You’re mostly concerned about whether or not this speech is really working…about whether or not you’re doing a good job. You’re really afraid that I will not applaud, aren’t you? You’re afraid that I won’t laugh at your jokes or cry over your emotional anecdotes. You’re so caught up in the issue of how I’m going to receive your speech, you haven’t thought much about me at all. I might have loved you, but you’re so caught up in self–love that mine is really unnecessary. If I don’t give you my attention it’s because I feel so unnecessary here. When I see you at the microphone, I see Narcissus at his mirror…Is your tie straight? Is your hair straight? Is your deportment impeccable? Is your phraseology perfect? You seem in control of everything, but your audience. You see everything so well, but us. But this blindness to us, I’m afraid, has made us deaf to you. We must go now. Sorry. Call us sometime later. We’ll come back to you when you’re real enough to see us…after your dreams have been shattered…after your heart has been broken…after your arrogance has been wrecked with despair. Then there will be room for all of us in your world. Then you won’t care if we applaud your brilliance. You’ll be one of us.’</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Josh 2:1-24, Acts 9:20-30 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65470&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

Philippians 2:4 NLT<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150420.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>John Craig says, ‘No matter how much work a man can do, no matter how engaging his personality may be, he will not advance far if he cannot work through others.’ That requires you to see value in other people. This truth is understood worldwide by successful people from every walk of life. At an international meeting of company executives, an American business person asked an executive from Japan what he regarded as the most important language for world trade. The American thought the answer would be English. But the Japanese executive, who had a more holistic understanding of business, replied, ‘My customers’ language.’ Having a good product or service isn’t enough. Becoming an expert isn’t enough. Knowing your product but not your customers just means you’ll have something to sell and no one to buy. Furthermore, the value you place on people must be genuine. Leadership coach Bridget Haymond writes, ‘You can talk until you’re blue in the face, but people know in their gut if you really care about them.’ If you want to connect with others you have to get over yourself, change your focus from inward to outward, away from yourself and onto them. And the great thing is, you can do it. Anyone can. All it takes is the will to change, the determination to follow through and a handful of skills anybody can learn. The motivation to learn can be found in these words from the apostle, Paul: ‘<em>Don’t look out only for your own interests, but take an interest in others, too.</em>’ (Philippians 2:4 NLT) When you look for opportunities to invest in others, you’ll find them.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 10-11, Matt 3:11-17, Ps 103:13-22, Prov 10:30-32<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65471&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...no one cares for my soul.' Psalm 142:4 NKJV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150421.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>People you seek to influence in life always ask themselves: Do you care about me? Think about the best experiences you’ve had with people in your own life. What do they all have in common? They genuinely cared about you, right? And what’s wonderful is, you can broaden your ability to care about others outside your social circle. Regardless of your profession, when you help people, you make your life and theirs better. Let’s listen to some observations by successful people from various backgrounds. Business: ‘You can’t make the other fellow feel important in your presence if you secretly feel…he’s a nobody.’ (Les Giblin, former national salesman of the year and popular speaker) Politics: ‘If you would win a man to your cause, you must first convince him…you are his sincere friend.’ (President Abraham Lincoln) Entertainment: ‘Some singers want the audience to love them. I love the audience.’ (Luciano Pavarotti, legendary Italian tenor) Ministry: ‘The “show business,”…so incorporated into…Christian work today, has caused us…to think that we have to do exceptional things for God; we have not. We have to be exceptional in ordinary things. ’ (Oswald Chambers, evangelist) The Psalmist wrote, ‘<em>No one cares for my soul.</em>’ And deep down some of the people you deal with every day feel that way, too. Whether you’re trying to share your faith, do business with them, make friends, or help them in a particular area, you must prove to them that you truly care. It takes time, effort, and even sacrifice, but if you’re serious about connecting with others, you’ll do it. The chances are somebody did it for you, and it helped determine the person you are today. So do it for others!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 12-13, Matt 4:1-7, Ps 16, Prov 11:1-2 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65472&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I am not seeking my own good but the good of many...' 1 Corinthians 10:33 NIV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150422.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Here are three questions people often ask themselves when you’re talking to them: (1) <em>Do you really care about me?</em> Dr. Calvin Miller put it like this: ‘When people listen to others speak, sometimes they’re silently thinking, “I am loneliness waiting for a friend. I am weeping in want of laughter. I am a sigh in search of consolation. I am a wound in search of healing. If you want to unlock my attention, you have but to convince me you want to be my friend.”’ (2) <em>Can you really help me?</em> Successful people bear in mind that others are continually asking themselves that question. And one way you can answer it is by focusing on the benefits you have to offer. Let’s face it, people are bombarded every day with the information on the features of this product and that gadget. So eventually they tune out. (3) <em>Can I really trust you?</em> William Arthur Ward wrote, ‘Blessed is he who has learned to admire but not envy, to follow but not imitate, to praise but not flatter, and to lead but not manipulate.’ Your charisma and ability may get you to the top, but only your character and commitment will keep you there. Trust is built on telling the truth and following through on your commitments. People take action for their own reasons, not yours. And what we learn about them always results in a greater reward than what we tell them about ourselves. Whether they’re buying a car, choosing a mate, or listening to a sermon, deep down they want to know, ‘Can I trust this person?’ Well…can they?</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 14-15, Matt 4:8-17, Ps 7:1-9, Prov 11:3-6<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65473&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...we can certainly do it.' Numbers 13:30 NIV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150423.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>After seeing the giants in the Promised Land, ten of Israel’s twelve spies came back and said, ‘It can’t be done.’ But the other two, Joshua and Caleb, said, ‘It can.’ But because of Israel’s unbelief, Caleb had been forced to spend forty more years wandering through the wilderness. And by the time the Israelites crossed the Jordan River he was almost eighty years old. Then another seven years passed before the various tribes of Israel were assigned land to occupy. Here’s how Caleb described it all, years later: ‘<em>I was forty years old when Moses…sent me…to explore the land. And I brought him back a report according to my convictions, but my fellow Israelites who went up with me made the hearts of the people melt in fear. I, however, followed the Lord my God wholeheartedly</em>.’ (Joshua 14:7–8 NIV) If you’ve a negative attitude when you’re 40, there’s a good chance you’ll have one when you’re 85. Actually, there’s a good chance you won’t even make it to 85! Psychologist Martin Seligman studied several hundred people in a religious community; he divided them into quartiles, ranging from the most to the least optimistic. 90% of the optimists were alive at 85, while just 34% of the naysayers made it to the same age. Twelve spies went out, but only Joshua and Caleb had the faith to say, ‘We can do it.’ And over 45 years later Caleb was as feisty as ever! Want to guess what happened to the other ten spies? They died. None of them made it to Caleb’s age. It’s as simple as this: faith and optimism can add years to your life.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 16-17, Matt 4:18-25, Ps 7:10-17, Prov 11:7-9<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65475&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['He comforts us every time we have trouble...' 2 Corinthians 1:4 NCV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150424.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Of all the names given to God in Scripture, none is more consoling than ‘…<em>the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our troubles</em>…’ (2 Corinthians 1:3–4 NIV) Notice the words ‘all comfort’. That means there are no exceptions and no limitations to God’s comfort, no matter how dreadful your circumstances. Comfort is God’s name and nature; it’s who He is and what He naturally wants to do! You can’t get close to Him and not be comforted. Lack of comfort results from disconnecting from God—usually the result of a lack of faith. Comfort comes by faith. You can know intellectually that He’s the ‘God of all comfort’, but not feel comforted because of your doubts. Jesus instructed the blind man who came for healing, ‘…<em>According to your faith will it be done to you</em>.’ (Matthew 9:29 NIV) ‘Knowing’ needs the addition of ‘believing’ before you’ll experience comfort. Feeling follows faith, not vice versa! Suppose you’re taking your first ocean cruise and have some concern about safety. The captain assures you he’s a qualified veteran and the ship’s the latest version available, equipped with modern communications and safety equipment. If, like too many Christians, you refuse to believe him until you first feel the comfort, you’ll probably disembark or spend the entire voyage unnecessarily sick with worry. But if you make up your mind to believe the captain’s word, you’ll soon feel the lessening of anxiety and the presence of comfort! Today, decide to trust the ‘Captain of our salvation’ who promises to ‘comfort us in all our troubles’, and you’ll experience the comfort He provides.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 18-19, Matt 5:1-5, Ps 144:1-8, Prov 11:10-11<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65476&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['As one whom his mother comforts, so I will comfort you...' Isaiah 66:13 NKJV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150425.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>When you’re troubled, remember: (1) <em>God’s comfort is real</em>. Do you recall being sad or afraid as a child? And do you remember feeling the comfort of your mother’s presence? God’s comfort is even more real than your mother’s was then. ‘<em>As one whom his mother comforts, so I will comfort you.</em>’ God’s more concerned about you now than your mother was in your childhood. ‘<em>Can a mother forget the baby at her breast…? Though she may forget, I will not forget you! See, I have engraved you on the palms of My hands</em>…’ (Isaiah 49:15–16 NIV) You can always count on God when you need comfort! (2) <em>The Comforter lives in you</em>. When we’re suffering, God seems distant and inaccessible. But He’s not. Jesus resolved that concern for His anxious disciples—then and now. ‘…<em>I will pray [to] the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter, that He may abide with you forever</em>.’ (John 14:16 KJV) The Holy Spirit, who forever abides in you, is closer to you than the air you breathe. He’s equipped, willing, and able to comfort you. He will sometimes do it by reminding you of the verse from a hymn, a line from a poem, a sermon you heard, etc. When He does, believe it. Say to yourself repeatedly: ‘The God of all comfort lives permanently in me!’ (3) <em>Scripture brings comfort</em>. The apostle Paul reminds us ‘…<em>that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope</em>.’ (Romans 15:4 KJV) When you’re down, you may not feel like reading the Bible. Do it anyway. It’ll bring you the comfort you long for.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 20-21, Matt 5:6-12, Ps 144:9-15, Prov 11:12-13<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65477&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['They shall still bear fruit in old age...' Psalm 92:14 NKJV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150426.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Age is just a date on a calendar; attitude is what counts. You can be old at 29 and young at 92. Larry King once interviewed Ty Cobb, one of the all–time great baseball players. He asked Cobb, then 70 years old, ‘What do you think you’d hit if you were playing these days?’ Cobb, a lifetime .366 hitter (still the record) replied, ‘About .290, maybe .300.’ King asked, ‘Is that because of travel, the night games, the artificial turf and all the new pitches like the slider?’ Cobb responded, ‘No. It’s because I’m 70!’ Here are three great benefits to having lived longer: (1) <em>You should be more tolerant</em>. Having fallen into many of life’s potholes yourself, you should be quicker to extend a helping hand when others fall into them. Having survived defeats and lived to fight another day, you’re qualified to offer strength and hope to those who struggle. (2) <em>You should be more humble</em>. A man who’d just celebrated his 50th wedding anniversary said, ‘A man is always as young as he feels, but seldom as important.’ Realising that the world doesn’t stop at your command or cater to your whims, you become more realistic. And in the process you find peace. (3) <em>You should value time more</em>. Margaret Deland said, ‘As soon as you feel too old to do a thing, do it.’ Start by asking yourself, ‘If not me, who? If not now, when?’ Here’s a promise from Scripture you can stand on: ‘<em>They shall still bear fruit in old age; they shall be fresh and flourishing</em>.’ (Psalm 92:14 NKJV) Now get up off the couch and get going.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Gen 6:9-8:4, Matt 24:37-51 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65478&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['A great storm arose...' Matthew 8:24 NCV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150427.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Matthew records, ‘<em>Jesus got into a boat, and His [disciples] went with Him. A great storm arose…</em>’ (Matthew 8:23–24 NCV) In the Greek language the words ‘a great storm’ are one word—<em>seismos</em>. A seismologist studies earthquakes and a seismograph measures them. So the storm the disciples were in must have shaken them to the core. There’s an important lesson here. Getting on board with Jesus doesn’t mean you will never go through a storm. Jesus said, ‘…<em>In the world you will have tribulation</em>…’ (John 16:33 NKJV) In spite of God’s promise to protect and prosper us, you’ll still have to deal with things like disease, lack, and fear. The difference is: the unbeliever faces the storm without Christ, but as a believer you go through the storm confident that all will be well because Jesus is on board. Does that mean you will never experience panic? If only it were so! But it isn’t. Looking at the swelling waves and the sleeping Saviour, the disciples asked, ‘…<em>do You not care that we are perishing?</em>’ (Mark 4:38 NKJV) This is why fear is so deadly. It corrodes your confidence in God’s goodness. It unleashes a swarm of doubts. It deadens your recall. By this time the disciples had witnessed Jesus ‘…<em>healing all kinds of sickness and all kinds of disease among the people</em>.’ (Matthew 4:23 NKJV) Fear creates a form of spiritual amnesia. It dulls your miracle memory. It makes you forget what Jesus has done and how good God is. That’s why you must starve your doubts and feed your faith on God’s Word, for faith is what will take you through the storm.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 22-23, Matt 5:13-20, Ps 94:1-11, Prov 11:14-15<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65479&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Who can this be...?' Matthew 8:27 NKJV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150428.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Matthew records: ‘<em>Then His disciples came to Him and awoke Him, saying, “Lord, save us! We are perishing!” But He said to them, “Why are you fearful, O you of little faith”? Then He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm. So the men marvelled, saying, “Who can this be, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?”</em>’ (Matthew 8:25–27 NKJV) You’ll never really know Jesus, or what He can do for you, until you go through a storm with Him. That’s why He plans your storms as part of the journey. Jesus asked, ‘Why are you fearful?’ He was teaching us that fear will suck the life out of you and drain you dry of joy. When fear rules your life, safety becomes your God. And when safety becomes your God, you seek a risk–free life. But those who are fear–filled cannot love deeply, because love is risky. They cannot give to the poor, because humanly speaking, benevolence is no guarantee of return. And the fear–filled cannot dream. What if their dreams shatter and fall from the sky? No wonder Jesus wages such a war against fear. The Gospels list some 125 Christ–issued imperatives. Of these, 21 are to ‘<em>not be afraid</em>’. The second most common command, to love God and your neighbour, appears only eight times. If quantity is any indicator, Jesus sees fear as one of our biggest issues. That’s why the one statement He makes more than any other, and the one He is making to you today, is: ‘<em>Don’t be afraid</em>.’</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 24-26, Matt 5:21-26, Ps 94:12-23, Prov 11:16-18<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65480&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

John 6:15 NKJV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150429.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>The secret to success lies in knowing what God has assigned and gifted you to do. Once you discover those two things, delegate the rest or let it go. This isn’t easy, because others will place demands on your time and energy that aren’t in line with your calling. Work out what activities drain you, and unless they’re essential—avoid them. Then, work out the things that energise you and fill your tank, and make them an essential part of your life. ‘<em>But there are so many demands on my time,’ you say. Nobody was busier than Jesus. John speaks about His workload: ‘…There are…things that Jesus did, which if they were written…the world itself could not contain the books that would be written</em>…’ (John 21:25 NKJV) Question: How did Jesus stay on track and keep from burning out? Answer: He knew the secret to spiritual rest and renewal. The Bible says, ‘<em>When Jesus perceived…they were about to come and take Him by force to make Him king, He departed again to the mountain by Himself alone.</em>’ (John 6:15 NKJV) The word ‘<em>again</em>’ tells us that Jesus made a regular daily practice of withdrawing from the crowd in order to pray, consider His plans and priorities, and recharge His batteries. Understand this: to be effective with others, you must learn to be comfortable alone with yourself. Novelist Louis Auchincloss said, ‘The only thing that keeps a man going is energy, and what is energy but liking life?’ If you can carve out moments to do what energises you, you’ll have reserves you can draw on when it’s time to give to others.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 27-28, Matt 5:27-37, Ps 35, Prov 11:19-21<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65481&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart....' 2 Corinthians 9:7 NIV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150430.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>The Bible says: ‘…<em>Whoever sows … generously will also reap generously. Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. And God is able to bless you abundantly, so that in all things, at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work.</em>’ (2 Corinthians 9:6–8 NIV) When you give what God tells you to, He’ll give you back more. When you know that, it’ll revolutionise your approach to giving. Paul isn’t talking about people who’re trying to get rich; he’s talking about ‘cheerful givers’ who want to finance God’s purposes. He’s saying not only is it safe to give, it’s the way to greater blessing. That’s especially good news for reluctant givers, because when you give something away it can feel like a loss. But contributing to God’s work isn’t giving something away; it’s investing—with a guaranteed return. A farmer who sows doesn’t lose his seed, he gains a harvest. Can you imagine a farmer praying this prayer? ‘God, give me a crop. I’m trusting You to get involved, but I’m holding on to my seed just in case.’ Is that what you’re doing? If so, here’s some good news. When you sow generously, God gets involved in your finances. Can you imagine a more secure position to be in? The Bible says, ‘<em>The generous will prosper</em>…’ (Proverbs 11:25 NLT) When you give, it enables God to return to you even more, which in turn enables you to give even more—and round and round it goes!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Deut 1-2, Matt 5:38-48, Ps 2, Prov 11:22-23 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65482&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['We should make plans - counting on God to direct us.' Proverbs 16:9 TLB <br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150501.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>There must be a balance between faith and careful planning. Yet, talk to some professing Christians and you might think otherwise. For example, talk with some who are unemployed and they'll tell you, 'I'm just waiting for the Lord to provide a job.' That's fine, but have you sharpened your job skills? And where have you placed your résumé? You say, 'I'm not going that route, I'm just waiting on God.' Oh, really? Then you won't mind trimming your budget for a while. The old motto of soldiers during the Revolutionary War applies here: 'Trust God, but keep your powder dry!' Place your life in God's hands, but stay at the ready. You must do all you can to prepare yourself, understanding that the favour you need comes from the Lord. To walk by faith does not mean you stop thinking, planning, taking advice and self-correcting. And it definitely doesn't imply becoming lazy or apathetic. What a distortion of Biblical faith! Trust God for your finances, but don't 'blow your budget'. Trust God for safety in the car, but don't pass on a blind curve. Trust God for your health, but don't chain-smoke, stay up half the night and subsist on potato chips and fizzy drink.</p>
<p>Acting foolishly, expecting God to bail you out when things go amiss, isn't faith, it's presumption. Wisdom says do all you can, then trust God to do what you cannot do. Faith and careful planning go hand-in-hand. They always have and they always will!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Deut 3-4, Matt 6:1-18, Ps 37:1-7, Prov 11:24-26<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66546&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Even to your old age... I am He who will sustain you.' Isaiah 46:4 NIV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150502.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Doctor Marian Diamond, a researcher in ageing, found that deliberately induced challenges are required to keep our brains healthy and functioning. In one experiment a group of lab rats was given food, while another group had obstacles placed in front of their dishes. The rats that had to overcome challenges learned to solve problems more proficiently than the comfortable rats. The fewer problems a rat experienced, the faster its brain went downhill. They also discovered that if you put twelve rats together in a cage and gave them challenges, their brains developed better than when they had to face the same obstacles in isolation. And when researchers ran the same experiment with rats that were 600 days or older (the equivalent of 60 human years), the results were the same. The rats actually lived to be 800 days old. Then researchers decided to show them love. The rodents had the same challenges as before, but afterwards researchers would pick them up, hold them against their lab coats, pet them, and speak kindly. They'd say, 'You're one sweet rat,' or whatever it is you say to a rat! And when they did, those creatures did more than break the 800-day barrier. At 904 days, not only were they alive - they were continuing to develop. The fact is they developed more mental resilience under challenging conditions because they were part of a community, whereas isolation caused their brain power to diminish.</p>
<p>The basic fact is: to age well you need a God-given challenge, love and good relationships.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Deut 5-7, Matt 6:19-34, Ps 37:8-15, Prov 11:27-29<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66547&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...gossips alienate close friends.' Proverbs 16:28 CEB<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150503.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Tabloids, talk shows and tell-tales thrive on a diet of gossip. Indeed, we're each likely to spread our share of it and receive our share of it. And whether it's based on truth, fiction or bits of both, doesn't make it any less hurtful. Though society considers it as relatively innocent, God puts gossip in the same company as '<em>...backstabbing...conceit, and disorderly conduct</em>.' (2 Corinthians 12:20 CEB)</p>
<p>So, when you're the target of gossip, what can you do? (1) <em>When possible, ignore it</em>. People who gossip get satisfaction out of upsetting you. So the more you get upset, the more they gossip. Don't react in anger; that just fuels the fire. '<em>Without wood a fire goes out; without gossips, conflict calms down.</em>' (Proverbs 26:20 CEB)</p>
<p>(2) <em>When appropriate, correct it</em>. Gossip can wreak havoc and break hearts. So if you can set the record straight you may be able to contain the damage. But forget about attempting to 'tell everybody you know the real story'; you'll only spread the flames, widen the exposure, and feed unhealthy appetites. Solomon said, '<em>The words of a gossip are like tasty bits of food; people like to gobble them up</em>.' (Proverbs 26:22 NCV) Step back and ask yourself who's really important in your life, then try to correct the record with them. In time, they'll vindicate you with others. In many cases their words will come across as being more objective than yours. If the gossip is based on truth or partial truth, don't deny or excuse yourself. True friends always forgive and defend their friends and gossips generally find juicier rumours, move on, and leave you alone.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Kings 4:42-44, Mark 6:30-44<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66548&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...without gossips, conflict calms down.' Proverbs 26:20 CEB<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150504.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Do these three things:</p>
<p>(1) <em>When necessary, confront the gossiper</em>. If the offender is a Christian, stand on this Scripture: '<em>If your fellow believer sins against you, go and tell him in private what he did wrong. If he listens to you, you have helped that person to be your brother or sister again</em>.' (Matthew 18:15 NCV) Now your goal in confronting them isn't to prove them wrong and you right, it's to bring reconciliation and preserve unity in God's family. Watch your tone. '...<em>Don't sin by letting anger control you</em>...' (Ephesians 4:26 NLT) Stick to the facts. Without putting them on the defensive, seek to find a resolution that stops the gossip and repairs the damage. If they're willing to acknowledge their part, be ready to forgive. If they're not, forgive them anyway - for your own sake and God's sake. And remember, they may continue to be your brother or sister without being your trusted friend!</p>
<p>(2)<em> Don't let gossip diminish your self-worth</em>. If your self-worth depends on what others say, you'll always feel down when you're put down. Let your self-worth rest on what God's Word says about you. Regardless of your imperfections, the Bible says you are '..<em>.the redeemed of the Lord</em>' (Psalm 107:2 NKJV), '...<em>accepted in the Beloved</em>' (Ephesians 1:6 NKJV), '...<em>the righteousness of God in [Christ]</em>.' (2 Corinthians 5:21 NKJV) Focus on God's estimation of you and '...<em>build [yourself] up in your most holy faith</em>...' (Jude 1:20 NIV) in spite of others' opinions.</p>
<p>(3) Don't judge others by rumour-mill reports. Whether gossip is truth-based or false, its intent is always to '<em>destroy</em>'. (John 10:10 NIV) Don't do Satan's work for him!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Deut 8-10, Matt 7:1-14, Ps 37:16-24, Prov 11:30-31<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66549&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...to the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord...' 1 Corinthians 7:10 NKJV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150505.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Engaged couples have expectations about marriage that are never verbalised. As a result, conflict becomes inevitable when those differing assumptions collide. So if you're wise, you'll talk about these understandings in the less antagonistic light of courtship.</p>
<p>Psychologist Dr. Archibald Hart asks the following questions of couples who consult with him: (1) <em>If I had never met the person you're planning to marry and I had to rely on you to give me a description of who that individual is, what would you tell me?</em> (2) <em>If you could think of one thing that you would like to see your fiancé change, what would it be?</em> (3) <em>What are the five or six major goals you have established for your first few years together?</em> (4) <em>What does your budget look like?</em> (5) <em>Have you planned how you're going to pay for the things you're going to buy beyond your honeymoon?</em> These are tough questions but if you can't agree on them before you're married, you're certain to argue over them afterwards. Since half of all marriages today end in divorce, you'd better be sure you know the answers.</p>
<p>The biggest mistake you can make is assuming that your future husband or wife will automatically change for the better as a result of being married to you. '...<em>Be good wives...yield to your husbands, responsive to their needs...do what is right... Be good husbands...live with your wives in an understanding way to your wives. Honour them, delight in them</em>...'

<introtext><![CDATA['...I am as strong this day as on the day that Moses sent me...' Joshua 14:11 NKJV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150514.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>God has a mountain with your name on it. Do you know why? Because you only flourish as you face challenges! Joshua and Caleb both brought back a good report, yet only Joshua was promoted to leadership when Moses departed. Caleb could have withdrawn and sulked, but instead he invested himself in the lives of the people around him. As an older man whose generation was dying off, he had to develop a whole new circle of friends and he did it. He became a mentor, guide and cheerleader for an entirely new generation. At 85-years-old, he did it with such gusto that he was able to lead the charge in conquering the hill country and defeating the giants who'd terrified an earlier generation.</p>
<p>Challenges undertaken for the greater good bind us to people, whereas the pursuit of comfort leads to isolation, and isolation is terminal. You say, 'I'm too old to make a difference.' God doesn't think so. '<em>Even to your old age...I will carry you; I will sustain you.</em>..' (Isaiah 46:4 NIV) So start making plans. Dare to dream! Life isn't about comfort, it's about saying, 'God, give me another mountain.' Somebody said that when everything's coming your way - you're on the wrong side of the road.</p>
<p>Living the adventure God planned for you isn't just another pursuit; it's the reason you were born! How will you recognise your mountain? There's no precise formula and like every other area of growth in your life, your mountain won't look exactly like anyone else's. But you'll recognise it, because it lies at the intersection of your greatest strengths and your greatest passions.</p><br /><br />SoulFood (Ascension): Lk 24:50-53, Acts 1:1-11, Eph 4:7-10 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66559&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Joshua blessed him, and gave [the mountain in] Hebron to Caleb...' Joshua 14:13 NKJV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150515.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>When Rich Stearns became engaged, his fiancé wanted to order some china. But he said to her, 'As long as there are children starving in the world, we will not own china, crystal or silver.' Rich had remarkable gifts of leadership. He loved strategic thinking, team-building and mission achievement. Twenty years later he became the CEO of <em>Lenox</em>, the top producer of fine china in the country. One day he received a phone call from <em>World Vision</em>, asking if he would consider getting involved with them. So Rich went to Rakia, Uganda, the area considered ground zero for the AIDS pandemic. In that village he sat in a thatched hut with a 13-year-old boy called Richard. A pile of stones outside the door marked the place where they had buried the boy's father, who had died of AIDS. Another pile marked the place where they had buried his mother, who had also died of AIDS. Rich talked for a while with the boy - now the head of the household, trying to raise two younger brothers - and asked him at one point, 'Do you have a Bible?' The boy said, 'Yes,' went into another room and brought back the one book in their house. 'Are you able to read it?' Rich asked, and at that the boy's face lit up. 'I love to read the Gospel of John because it says Jesus loves children,' the boy said. Deeply moved, Rich Stearns left his job, his house and his title and asked God for one more mountain. If you haven't done it yet, ask God for one.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Pet 1-5, Matt 10:21-31, Ps 18:1-29, Prov 12:23-2<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66560&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be kind...forgiving each other...' Ephesians 4:32 NIV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150506.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Here are four things you need to know about forgiveness: (1) <em>Forgiveness doesn't make what happened to you right</em>; it means you've made a decision not to let it control your life. By forgiving and attempting to restore the relationship, you reclaim your peace of mind. If the other person refuses to acknowledge what happened was wrong, the offence can and should still be forgiven. Forgiveness doesn't depend on the other person; it depends on you. (2) <em>Forgiveness matters, even when the offending party refuses to admit guilt</em>. When you wait for someone to admit he or she was wrong, you're placing your future in that person's hands. Forgiveness is first and foremost for your own benefit, not the benefit of others. By forgiving, you're letting the pain and hurt go and moving forward. (3) <em>Your willingness to forgive can move the other person to seek forgiveness</em>. Perhaps the person who hurt you doesn't feel they deserve to be forgiven. Or they may know what they did was wrong, but lack the courage to step forward and ask for forgiveness. When you make the first move, it opens the door and allows them to reach out and find mercy and understanding. (4) <em>Forgiveness is easier when you accept that we all need it</em>. When you refuse to forgive because you think someone's offences are greater than your own, that's pride. And '...<em>God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble</em>.' (1 Peter 5:5 NLT) The Bible says, 'B<em>e kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you</em>.' Once you realise the depth of God's grace toward you, it's easier to extend grace to others.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Deut 14-17, Matt 8:1-17, Ps 37:32-40, Prov 12:4-6<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66551&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['They...limited the Holy One of Israel.' Psalm 78:41 NKJV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150507.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Researchers conducted an experiment in which frogs were placed in separate glass jars covered with lids to prevent them from escaping. At first the frogs kept jumping, trying to escape, but each time they hit their heads on the lid. After thirty days of doing this, something amazing happened. When the lids were removed from the jars, the frogs never jumped out even though they could easily have done so. Why? Because they had formed a belief system that the top of the jar was as high as they could go - their limiting belief system kept them trapped in the jar! The Israelites did that too: '<em>Again and again they... limited the Holy One of Israel. They did not remember His power</em>...' (Psalm 78:41-42 NKJV)</p>
<p>Are you holding on to limiting belief systems, even though they are no longer true and are sabotaging your future? 'I'm too young, too old, I'm a woman, I'm the wrong nationality, I don't have the education, I don't have the talent, I don't have the connections, I failed too badly, etc.'</p>
<p>Fear of success stems from: (1) <em>Fear of not being worthy of success</em>. (2) <em>Fear of being unable to meet the expectations and fulfil the responsibilities that accompany success</em>. (3) <em>Fear of being rejected by those unhappy about your success</em>. (4) <em>Fear of losing control of normal, private life</em>. (5) <em>Fear of saying no to friends and family who feel entitled to control you</em>.</p>
<p>Get rid of your limiting belief systems! Not only will God give you success, He will give you the skill and strength to handle it.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Deut 18-21, Matt 8:18-34, Ps 44:1-8, Prov 12:7-9<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66552&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Let the Lord be magnified, who has pleasure in the prosperity of His servant.' Psalm 35:27 NKJV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150508.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Fear of success is characterised by these six behaviours; see if you have any of them: (1) <em>Procrastinating</em>. (2) <em>Underperforming</em>. (3) <em>Focusing on those who reject you rather than those who accept you</em>. (4) <em>Allowing yourself to be side-tracked by so many insignificant things that you never get focused on the main thing</em>. (5) <em>Talking about what you plan to do 'someday'</em>. (6) <em>Feeling others are worthy of success but not you</em>.</p>
<p>Question: Are you serving the Lord? Then you qualify for success! '...<em>Let the Lord be magnified, who has pleasure in the prosperity of His servant</em>.' Yes, God will help you when you are in need. But He also wants you to succeed so that you can begin to meet the needs of others. God told Abraham two things. First, He promised to bless him greatly. Second, He promised to make him a great blessing to others (Genesis 12:2). And it happened! Solomon writes, '...<em>money answers everything</em>.' (Ecclesiastes 10:19 NKJV) What did he mean? Money builds schools, churches and hospitals. It eradicates poverty and illiteracy. It finances research that cures life-threatening illnesses. But some of us are so focused on Heaven's streets of gold that we no longer see earth's streets filled with suffering and unmet needs. Understand this: God will reward you based on your service to others. '...<em>the King will answer and say to them, &quot;Assuredly, I say to you, in as much as you did it to one of the least of these...you did it to Me</em>.&quot;' (Matthew 25:40 NKJV) That should be your greatest motivation for wanting to succeed.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Deut 22-24, Matt 9:1-13, Ps 44:9-16, Prov 12:10-11<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66553&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['That I may cause those who love Me to inherit wealth, that I may fill their treasuries.' Proverbs 8:21 NKJV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150509.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>If you want to overcome the fear of success and position yourself to be a blessing to others:</p>
<p>(1) <em>Confront your fear head-on</em>. God's Word says that He wants you to succeed (Joshua 1:9). The question is, are you ready to act on His Word? Do you believe others are entitled to success but not you? Do you feel like it's ok for you to succeed to a certain extent, but anything beyond that would be displeasing to God? You must confront these unscriptural beliefs! (2) <em>Determine the source of any erroneous beliefs you may harbour regarding your worthiness</em>. Here are some areas you should focus on: rejection by your loved ones; comparisons to others; stereotypes and media images; words of inferiority and rejection that play in your mind like a broken record. Your perception of your worthiness will play a major role in how much you allow yourself to achieve in life, so change your opinion of yourself! Line up what you believe and say about yourself with what God says about you: '...<em>Do not be afraid, for I have ransomed you. I have called you by name; you are Mine...you are precious to Me. You are honoured, and I love you. Do not be afraid, for I am with you</em>...' (Isaiah 43:1-5 NLT). Recognise your self-sabotaging behaviours and commit to putting a stop to them. And stop waiting for 'a better opportunity', or until 'the time is right'. God says, 'I am with you.' So trust Him with the timing and circumstances and move forward with confidence.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Deut 25-27, Matt 9:14-26, Ps 44:17-26, Prov 12:12-14<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66554&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...the Lord gave him success in everything he did.' Genesis 39:3 NIV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150510.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>In order to overcome your fear of success you must do these six things:</p>
<p>(1) <em>Give yourself ample time to complete critical tasks on which your success hinges</em>.</p>
<p>(2) <em>Guard your 'success-already-in-progress', and don't engage in actions that thwart it</em>. For example, accumulating cash reserves for your small business and then spending them on clothes instead of marketing and publicity.</p>
<p>(3) <em>Follow up with key individuals who can influence outcomes significant to your success</em>. Get rid of the idea that you are unworthy of their attention, or that they wouldn't have time for someone like you. '<em>Do you see a man who excels in his work? He will stand before kings; he will not stand before unknown men</em>.' (Proverbs 22:29 NKJV) Boaz not only owned the field that Ruth was gleaning wheat in, he fell in love with her and married her. Today there are people observing you who are capable of blessing you.</p>
<p>(4) <em>Associate with goal-oriented finishers who get things done, and who demonstrate the right priorities in doing so</em>. Watch how they operate and emulate the God-honouring aspects of their behaviour.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...his face was radiant because he had spoken with the Lord.' Exodus 34:29 NIV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150511.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>The Bible says: '<em>Moses was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights...When Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the covenant law in his hands, he was not aware that his face was radiant because he had spoken with the Lord. When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses...they were afraid to come near him. But Moses called to them; so Aaron and all the leaders of the community came back to him, and he spoke to them...and he gave them all the commands the Lord had given him</em>...' (Exodus 34:28-32 NIV) When the Israelites were in Moses' company, there was a look on his face that told them he'd been in the presence of the Lord. They could see it and sense it. Sometimes the Bible refers to this as being '<em>anointed</em>'. (1 John 2:27 NIV) Simply put, the anointing is God equipping and empowering you to succeed in what He's called you to do.</p>
<p>Anointed leadership is always characterised by these four benchmarks: (1) <em>Calling</em>. When people are around an anointed leader, they sense that God has truly gifted and assigned that person to fulfil a certain purpose. (2) <em>Character</em>. People see God's nature in an anointed leader, and as a result they trust them. (3) <em>Competence</em>. An anointed leader has the ability to get the job done right. The results validate his or her calling. (4) <em>Conviction</em>. Anointed leaders aren't wishy-washy; they have moral and spiritual backbone and they stand up for what's right.</p>
<p>These four qualities are benchmarks of God-called leadership, and when people see them at work in your life, they will follow you.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Deut 28-29, Matt 9:27-38, Ps 57, Prov 12:15-17<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66556&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...every good tree bears good fruit...' Matthew 7:17 NIV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150512.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Take a moment to consider these two questions. Question one: <em>How do you respond when you're treated badly?</em> A man stopped by a news-stand every morning to pick up a paper. The man behind the counter was always nasty, yet the customer was always nice to him. When a friend asked him why he remained so kind in the face of such rudeness, he replied, 'Why would I let his attitude dictate my attitude?' Question two: <em>How do you respond when you're tempted?</em> You say, 'I'm in love with him. He's married and I know it's wrong, but I can't help it.' Actually, you can. You can spend an hour listening to stories from women who lost their husbands because of infidelity. Look into the eyes of their children. Hear the betrayal, and see the broken promises in their eyes. When you do, you'll think new thoughts!</p>
<p>The Bible says, '...<em>Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh</em>.' (Galatians 5:16 NKJV) At any moment you can turn your mind to God and your thoughts will change. Feelings are like spoiled children; they can take a little longer to come round, but if you keep your mind 'fixed' on God, your feelings will eventually line up with your thoughts. Looking back, you'll be glad you were guided by God instead of your impulses. It's as if there's a little network called HSN (Holy Spirit Network) where you can tune in at any time. When you ask God to guide your thoughts, then pause and listen to what He says - He will guide you.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Deut 30:1-32:28, Matt 10:1-10, Ps 62, Prov 12:18-19<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66557&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...give me this mountain...' Joshua 14:12 NJKV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150513.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Why would someone ask God for a mountain? Because when you tackle something bigger than yourself: (1) <em>you grow</em>; (2) <em>you learn to depend on God</em>; (3) <em>you get to celebrate big victories</em>. Caleb said: '...<em>here I am today, 85 years old! I am still as strong today as the day Moses sent me out; I'm just as vigorous to go out to battle now as I was then. Now give me this hill country that the Lord promised me that day. You yourself heard then that the Anakites were there and their cities were large and fortified, but, with the Lord helping me, I will drive them out just as He said</em>.' (Joshua 14:10-12 NIV) Anybody can occupy the flat ground, but it takes faith in God to tackle a mountain. What's more, that's where the sons of Anak - the giants - lived. These guys were so big they caused ten of Moses' spies to say, '...<em>next to them we felt like grasshoppers</em>...' (Numbers 13:33 NLT)</p>
<p>You'd think at 85 Caleb would have asked for a nice cottage in Shalom Acres! But no, he wanted another battle and another victory before he checked out. Stop asking God for a problem-free life, otherwise you might die of boredom. It's in working to solve problems and overcome challenges that you become the person God wants you to be. So ask Him for a task that will keep you learning, growing, uncomfortable, and hungry for significance. When you pray, 'God, use me,' be prepared to encounter four things: adventure, danger, risk, and reward. How about it - are you up for a little excitement?</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Deut 32:29-34:12, Matt 10:11-20, Ps 49, Prov 12:20-22<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66558&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Husbands, love your wives...' Ephesians 5:25 NKJV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150516.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>'<em>Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself for her</em>.' Many men wrestle with the fear of intimacy. Masculine emotions have become the 21st century version of 'Pandora's box'. We don't know all that's in it, but we have a feeling that we'd better not open it. But if we hide our true selves from our wives, they will only love what we do - not what we are!</p>
<p>As a husband, you don't have to be a '10'. You just have to be a man of God. He wants strong men who lead, instead of weak men who follow. No woman wants to be in submission to a man who isn't in submission to God and led by His Spirit. '..<em>.the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control.</em>..' (Galatians 5:22-23 NKJV) A woman feels secure with a man who has these qualities, and will gladly say to him, 'Lead the way.' Men are masters at giving 'things'. Where they have big problems is when they are asked to give themselves! Jesus Christ, the greatest lover the world has ever known, gives Himself openly and unashamedly. His love is exemplified in His coming, but consummated in His dying. The truth is, your wife doesn't need more things - she just needs you to give your love to her completely. Jesus is described in the book of Revelation as a Lion and a Lamb (Revelation 5:5-6). That's a picture of strength and tenderness, and that's what your wife needs from you.</p>
<p>You say, 'How long will it take me to accomplish this?' A lifetime, so get started!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Obad, Mal 1-4, Matt 10:32-42, Ps 18:30-50, Prov 12:25-28<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66561&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Wives, submit to your own husbands...' Ephesians 5:22 NKJV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150517.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Some people use this Scripture to treat women like a doormat, and rob them of their voice and right to any leadership role. Read the Bible! Deborah led the nation of Israel. Huldah the prophetess spoke the Word of God to kings. Let's read the Scripture again: '<em>Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord</em>.' As a wife you are called to submit to 'your own husband', not to all men.</p>
<p>In God's eyes men and women are equal (Galatians 3:28). Paul is not speaking about your 'person'; he's speaking about your 'role' in the home. As a human being, a general is not more important than a sergeant. But for an army to function successfully there must be a respected chain of command where one leads and the other follows. God doesn't want you to squirm under your husband's leadership, but snuggle up into the security that it should afford you. You can excel in your career yet still allow yourself to enjoy being nurtured, loved, and protected by your husband. Properly understood, your husband's love and leadership do not rob you of your strength, they simply keep you in balance by allowing you to reconnect with your softness and femininity. But a word of caution: if you're looking for a man to be 'your everything', forget it! God's the only one who can be everything. By expecting perfection from your husband, you're asking more from someone else than you can provide yourself.</p>
<p>Here's God's plan: '...<em>she is your equal partner in God's gift of new life. Treat her as you should, so your prayers will not be hindered</em>.' (1 Peter 3:7 NLT)</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Gen 2:7-25, 1 Cor 15:39-55<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66562&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...happy is the man who delights in doing His commands.' Psalm 112:1 TLB<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150518.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Lasting happiness isn't found in money or career success. Does that mean these things are wrong? No. When you put God first He will actually give you these things! (Matthew 6:33) But you must never let anything God gives you rob Him of first place in your life.</p>
<p>The Psalmist said: '<em>Happy is the man who delights in doing His commands. His children shall be honoured everywhere, for good men's sons have a special heritage. He himself shall be wealthy, and his good deeds will never be forgotten. When darkness overtakes him, light will come bursting in. He is kind and merciful - and all goes well for the generous man who conducts his business fairly. Such a man will not be overthrown by evil circumstances. God's constant care of him will make a deep impression on all who see it. He does not fear bad news, nor live in dread of what may happen. For he is settled in his mind that Jehovah will take care of him. That is why he is not afraid, but can calmly face his foes. He gives generously to those in need. His deeds will never be forgotten. He shall have influence and honour</em>.' (Psalm 112:1-9 TLB)</p>
<p>Somebody said that the best things in life aren't things. Happiness isn't determined by what you own; it lies in relationships, and the first relationship you need is with God because every blessing in life flows from Him. In a world of urgency and confusion, God will give you values and priorities to live by. '<em>Happy is the man who delights in doing His commands</em>.'</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ruth 1-4, Matt 11:1-19, Ps 88:1-9a, Prov 13:1-3<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66563&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

So if you find reading the Bible unrewarding, try this: before you open your Bible, open your heart and pray, 'Holy Spirit, show me what I don't see and teach me what I don't know.'</p>
<p>Paul writes: '...<em>it was to us that God revealed these things by His Spirit. For His Spirit searches out everything and shows us God's deep secrets. No one can know a person's thoughts except that person's own spirit, and no one can know God's thoughts except God's own Spirit. And we have received God's Spirit (not the world's spirit), so we can know the wonderful things God has freely given us. When we tell you these things, we do not use words that come from human wisdom...we speak words given to us by the Spirit, using the Spirit's words to explain spiritual truths. But people who aren't spiritual can't receive these truths... It all sounds foolish to them and they can't understand it, for only those who are spiritual can understand what the Spirit means. Those who are spiritual can evaluate all things, but they themselves cannot be evaluated by others. For, Who can know the Lord's thoughts? Who knows enough to teach Him? But we understand these things, for we have the mind of Christ</em>.' (1 Corinthians 2:10-16 NLT)</p>
<p>The Bible isn't like any other book. Its words are God-breathed; therefore when you approach the Bible, you must ask the Holy Spirit to open your eyes and give you understanding. He will!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Judg 1-3, Matt 11:20-30, Ps 88: 9b-18, Prov 13:4-6<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66564&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us.' 1 John 5:14 NIV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150521.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>While you are waiting for God's Word to be fulfilled in your life, do these three things:</p>
<p>(1) <em>Verbalise it</em>. The most effective way to pray is to speak God's Word. The patriarchs, prophets and psalmists regularly reminded God of His promises in prayer, confident He would keep them. The surest indicator of God's will is His Word. '<em>This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. And if we know that He hears us...we know that we have what we asked of Him.</em>' (1 John 5:14-15 NIV) God always responds to His Word, always!</p>
<p>(2) <em>Obey it</em>. God's plan for us is not just to speak His Word, vital as this is, but that we obey it (James 1:22). The hymn-writer said: 'When we walk with the Lord in the light of His Word, what a glory He sheds on our way; while we do His good will, He abides with us still, and with all who will trust and obey.' Obedience - faith in action - aligns us with God and He responds by fulfilling His promise to us.</p>
<p>(3) <em>Share it</em>. Parents and grandparents, '<em>Take to heart these words that I give you today. Repeat them to your children. Talk about them when you're at home or away, when you lie down or get up</em>.' (Deuteronomy 6:6-7 GWT) You needn't be a qualified teacher, just a sincere teller. Sharing God's Word will produce fruit in the lives of your family, friends, relatives, business associates and neighbours, and also increase your own grasp and understanding of it.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Judg 7:1-9:33, Matt 12:15-21, Ps 129, Prov 13:9-10<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66566&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...as the clay is in the potter's hand, so are you in My hand...' Jeremiah 18:6 NKJV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150522.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>In the good times it's easy to see that we're making progress, but in the tough times we are prone to feel like we're not making any progress at all. We react to pain, loss and adversity by consulting our feelings instead of God's faithfulness. Please understand this: at all times you are securely in God's hands! '...<em>as the clay is in the potter's hand, so are you in My hand</em>...' (Jeremiah 18:6 NKJV) You're a work in progress and the crucial thing isn't your circumstances or feelings, but the Potter's commitment to finish what He began. '...<em>He who has begun a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ</em>.' (Philippians 1:6 NKJV)</p>
<p>Here are two things you must remember while you're spinning on the Potter's wheel: (1) <em>The Potter has the right to mould you as He sees fit</em>. Nothing can prevent Him from making you into what He wants you to become. He is an expert at turning lumps of clay into objects of value and usefulness. '<em>Does not the potter have power over the clay, from the ...lump to make one vessel for honour...</em>?' (Romans 9:21 NKJV) Your job is to stay on the wheel and let God make you into what He desires you to be. (2) <em>The Potter has an individual plan for each lump of clay</em>. The Potter, not the clay, determines the end-product in the same way that the Holy Spirit determines your place and role in the Body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:18).</p>
<p>So discover the Potter's plan and submit to Him!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Judg 9:34-11:40, Matt 12:22-37, Ps 97, Prov 20:25, Ecc 5:4-6<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66567&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He made it again into another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter...' Jeremiah 18:4 NKJV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150523.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>While you are on the Potter's wheel, consider these two things: (1) <em>The Potter's plan and pleasure are what matter</em>. He has the right to make you into anything He chooses. What matters most is that His plan for your life be fulfilled and His pleasure in you be realised. Can you imagine a potter discussing with the clay what it would prefer to become? No. Only he has the wisdom to make that decision. So instead of struggling with the will of God, rejoice that '...<em>God is working in you, giving you the desire and the power to do what pleases Him</em>.' (Philippians 2:13 NLT)</p>
<p>(2) The Potter will not stop until the job is done. God's job would be simple if we were just inanimate lumps of clay. But we're clay animated by self-will and 'we want what we want, when we want it.' However, rather than giving in to us, or giving up on us, the Potter keeps working and reworking the clay, day after day, until we gradually begin to take on a shape He can use for His glory. This sometimes calls for radical action on His part: '<em>But the jar he was making did not turn out as he had hoped, so he crushed it into a lump of clay again and started over again</em>.' (Jeremiah 18:4 NLT) God is so committed to His objective in your life that He won't quit - even though it means allowing you to be crushed and starting the process over again.</p>
<p>So be patient and stay on the wheel; what God has in mind for you is worth it.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Judg 12-15, Matt 12:38-50, Ps 47, Prov 13:11-12<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66568&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<alias><![CDATA[the-benefits-of-self-discipline]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['God's Spirit makes us...self-controlled...' Galatians 5:22-23 CEV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150524.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;BasicParagraph&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>Is self–discipline difficult and demanding? Yes. However, instead of focusing on its demands, think about its benefits. When you begin to understand the power, liberty, joy and victory that self–discipline brings, you’ll want to have it. A disciplined mind makes the difference between a happy life and a miserable one; between a life of self–defeating habits and a life of freedom in God. Discipline is your friend, something to be embraced daily. It’s a tool given by God to help you reach your goals. </span></p>
<p class=&quot;BasicParagraph&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>One reason why disciplining your mind is so important is that the condition of your mind can change so quickly. One day you can be calm, peaceful, sure of yourself and confident in God. Yet the next day you can hardly recognise yourself; you’re anxious, angry, negative, and full of doubt. Why? Because your thinking affects your emotions. Here’s something else you need to know: just as the airwaves around you are filled with signals that can be picked up by any radio or TV, there are spiritual forces around you that seek to mould your mind and influence your thinking. So ask God to help you, and refuse to allow your mind to think about whatever it pleases. </span></p>
<p class=&quot;BasicParagraph&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>Begin to control your thoughts and keep your mind on the right things. Breaking old habits and forming new ones takes time, so keep practising. Developing self–discipline isn’t easy, but it’s worth it in the end. When you win the battle for your mind you’ll be much more decisive, confident and focused. You’ll also be a more effective and successful person.</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood (Pentecost): Lev 23:15-22, Acts 2:1-18 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66569&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...do not reject the Lord's discipline...' Proverbs 3:11 NCV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150525.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;BasicParagraph&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>The Bible says, ‘<em>Do not reject the Lord’s discipline, and don’t get angry when He corrects you. The Lord corrects those He loves, just as parents correct the child they delight in.</em>’ (Proverbs 3:11–12 NCV) Because God loves you, when He sees things in your life that could potentially damage you and other people, He deals with them. Paul writes, ‘<em>Therefore consider the goodness and severity of God</em>…’ (Romans 11:22 NKJV) God will deal with you gently, but if you don’t listen He may have to deal with you severely. That’s because He has too much invested in you to let you fail. </span></p>
<p class=&quot;BasicParagraph&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>Not only does God confront us, He expects us to confront one another when we’re in the wrong. Paul stood up to Peter, his fellow leader, in front of Jewish and Gentile believers because the issue was important to their mission’s success (Galatians 2:14). </span></p>
<p class=&quot;BasicParagraph&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>Healthy confrontation results in six things: (1) <em>Clarification</em>. You get a better understanding of the person and what happened. (2) <em>Change</em>. Hopefully improvement will come from it—and the improvement may be in you! (3) <em>An improved relationship</em>. Handled correctly, confrontation will deepen your relationship with the other person. (4) <em>Purity</em>. As word gets out, the organisation will be purified and sobered. (5) <em>Respect</em>. People will appreciate and respect your leadership even more. (6) <em>Security</em>. They’ll feel safe knowing that you’re strong enough to take a stand when it counts. People want a leader who says, ‘When there’s a problem I’ll deal with it directly, promptly, and respectfully. I’ll help correct the situation and get us back on track.’ </span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Judg 16:1-19:15, Matt 13:1-9, Ps 45, Prov 13:13-16<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66571&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...say the right thing at the right time!' Proverbs 15:23 NLT<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150526.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;BasicParagraph&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>According to ground–breaking neurological research, you can ‘train’ yourself to speak and listen in a way that stimulates sympathy and trust in the brain of the person you’re talking to. Think how valuable that is in communication! </span></p>
<p class=&quot;BasicParagraph&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>Here are some proven principles to help you do it: (1) <em>Breathe deeply and stretch before speaking</em>. When you’re handling a stressful situation, remaining calm is essential. Stress generates uptightness, uptightness leads to anger, and anger shuts down your ability to get your point across. So take a few moments to breathe deeply, while counting slowly to five. It’s also been established that things like stretching your neck muscles and yawning change your brain in ways that measurably improve your communication skills. We are ‘<em>wonderfully made</em>’. (Psalm 139:14 KJV) (2) <em>Think encouraging thoughts</em>. ‘…<em>As he thinks in his heart, so is he</em>…’ (Proverbs 23:7 NKJV) Any negative thought you harbour can interfere with the parts of your brain used in language processing, listening, and speech, which can lead to defensiveness and distrust. Neurological studies found that thinking positive thoughts about the other person, or yourself, or the topic at hand, can help you to achieve success in your personal and business relationships. (3) <em>Seal it with a smile</em>. Your face reveals your feelings. ‘…<em>Jacob noticed that Laban’s attitude toward him was not what it had been.</em>’ (Genesis 31:2 NIV) Research shows that pleasing memories and thoughts of people you love create facial expressions that convey kindness, compassion and interest, stimulating trust and openness in others.</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Judg 19:16-21:25, Matt 13:10-23, Ps 128, Prov 13:17-19<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66572&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Pleasant words are...healing...' Proverbs 16:24 NAS<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150527.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;BasicParagraph&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>For effective communication: (1) <em>Make use of the ‘eye–gate’</em>. Eye contact stimulates the brain’s social–network circuits, decreasing the stress hormone and increasing the sympathy hormone. Intentionally looking at the other person enables you to quickly respond to the seven basic facial expressions—anger, fear, sadness, disgust, surprise, contempt and happiness. These are keys; use them. (2) <em>Express appreciation</em>. The first words you speak set the tone for the entire interaction. A single compliment can create trust. Loyola University researchers found that when people in conversation are in basic agreement, interactions between them are experienced as mutually satisfying. Alternatively, disagreement immediately creates defensiveness in the listener. So begin each conversation with a compliment, and end it with a phrase that conveys genuine appreciation. Research demonstrates that remarks made at the end of an interaction are especially effective because they linger in the hearer’s mind. ‘Pleasant words are a honeycomb, sweet to the soul (emotions) and healing to the bones.’ (Proverbs 16:24 NAS) (3)<em> Keep it brief</em>. Our conscious minds retain only a tiny bit of information, which is ‘booted out’ of our memory as new information is uploaded. So it’s better to speak a sentence or two at a time, then take a breath. ‘…<em>let your words be few</em>.’ (Ecclesiastes 5:2 NAS) If you think a lengthy conversation is needed, let your listener know in advance. This prepares them to focus, and ignore the intrusiveness of their own inner self–talk.</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Gal 1-3, Matt 13:24-35, Ps 101, Prov 13:20-23<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66573&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let your conversation be gracious and attractive so that you will have the right response for everyone.' Colossians 4:6 NLT<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150528.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;BasicParagraph&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>Building trust and intimacy in communication requires: (1) <em>Working to build trust</em>. Trust is not a ‘right’: it’s a privilege you earn by proving you’re trustworthy. We pay little attention to politicians who say, ‘You can count on me,’ unless their track record supports it. Christ’s standard for trust was ‘…<em>believe because of the work you have seen Me do</em>.’ (John 14:11 NLT) We know from social psychology research that speaking gently and slowly can deepen the listener’s openness and respect for you. The tone of your voice matters a lot. The University of Houston did a conclusive study that found if you lower your voice and speak slowly, your listener will respond with greater openness and trust. This research has helped oncologists present bad news to patients in a more supportive way. When doctors reduced their speaking rate and pitch, patients perceived them as more caring and sympathetic. The Bible calls this ‘<em>a soft answer</em>’ (Proverbs 15:1 NKJV), and it will work for you too. </span></p>
<p class=&quot;BasicParagraph&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>(2) <em>Training your brain to really listen</em>. Listening is hard work because we habitually focus on ourselves and our interests through constant self–talk. Studies show that the average person cuts in before the speaker finishes. Even doctors who are trained to listen for important medical information tend to cut patients off within 23 seconds—long before they have been fully heard. </span></p>
<p class=&quot;BasicParagraph&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>Train yourself to stay focused on the other person, their words, facial expressions and body language. Within just a few weeks you can train yourself to become the kind of communicator people will trust.</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Gal 4-6, Matt 13:36-46, Ps 108, Prov 13:24-25<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66574&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus...' Romans 10:9 NKJV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150529.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;BasicParagraph&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>There are two parts to being a Christian. First, you must accept Jesus as your Saviour. Second, and much more difficult, you must make Jesus your Lord—‘the undisputed boss’! There is just enough ego in each of us to want to be in control, and that part of us must be crucified daily. Crucifixion is one of the most painful deaths you can experience because you die slowly and excruciatingly. As long as your ego has breath left in it, it will rise up and fight for control. </span></p>
<p class=&quot;BasicParagraph&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>When you make Jesus Lord of your life, you give up control in three areas: (1) <em>Jesus, not you, decides where you will go</em>. (2) <em>Jesus, not you, decides the price you’ll have to pay</em>. (3) <em>Jesus, not you, decides the person you’ll become</em>. ‘<em>Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a merchant seeking beautiful pearls, who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had and bought it</em>.’ (Matthew 13:45–46 NKJV) Note the words ‘<em>all that he had</em>’. If you want to know the cost of making Jesus Lord of your life, it will cost you all you have. This man valued the pearl so highly that he considered it worth any price he had to pay. </span></p>
<p class=&quot;BasicParagraph&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>So here’s the question: What value do you place on your relationship with Christ? This man believed that the return would be greater than the investment. Do you believe that? Salvation is free, but making Jesus Lord of your life demands that you surrender your all to Him. Are you ready for that? Are you willing?</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Lam 1:1-3:39, Matt 13:47-58, Ps 113, Prov 14:1-4<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66575&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<p class=&quot;BasicParagraph&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>The Taj Mahal is one of the most beautiful and costly tombs ever built and there’s a legend that surrounds it. When the favourite wife of Indian ruler Shah Jahan died, he ordered it to be built as a memorial to her. He placed her coffin in the middle of a parcel of land, and construction literally began around it. But several years into the venture, his grief for his wife gave way to his passion for the project. One day, while surveying the site, he reportedly stumbled over an old wooden box and had it thrown out. It was months before he realised it was his wife’s coffin. The original purpose for the memorial got lost in the details of construction! </span></p>
<p class=&quot;BasicParagraph&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>There’s a lesson here: it’s called ‘misplaced values’. If you’re a husband and a father, your wife and children probably appreciate the things you work to provide. But do you know what they really want? You! Your time. Your attention. Your affection! </span></p>
<p class=&quot;BasicParagraph&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>J. Paul Getty was one of the world’s richest men, yet he failed miserably with his own family. He wrote: ‘I’ve never been given to envy, save for the envy I feel toward those people who have the ability to make a marriage work and endure happily. It’s an art I’ve never been able to master.’ </span></p>
<p class=&quot;BasicParagraph&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>So, in your quest to build your Taj Mahal, try to remember the purpose for which you are building it. ‘<em>Let the husband render to his wife the affection due her, and likewise also the wife to her husband</em>.’</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Lam 3:40-5:22, Matt 14:1-12, Ps 82, Prov 14:5-8<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66576&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<p class=&quot;BasicParagraph&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>James Dobson writes: ‘It’s not the arguments that should worry married couples; it’s what happens when the battles are over. Almost all husbands and wives experience conflict from time to time, which is not necessarily unhealthy for the relationship. A verbal spat that stays within reasonable limits can open the windows and give a couple a chance to vent their frustrations and release some steam. The important question, however, is what happens after an argument is over? In healthy relationships, confrontation ends in forgiveness, in drawing closer together, in deeper respect and understanding, and sometimes in greater physical intimacy. But in unstable marriages, conflict is never entirely resolved. This is a very dangerous situation where the consequences of one battle begin to overlap with a prelude to the next. It’s a good idea for couples to take a closer look at what happens in the aftermath of confrontation. Are there things that you’ve said or done that have grieved your spouse? Do you need to ask forgiveness for attacking the self–worth of your spouse instead of focusing on the issues that divided you? Are there substantive matters that haven’t yet been resolved? If so, deal with them quickly before they can fester and erode the relationship from within.’ </span></p>
<p class=&quot;BasicParagraph&quot;><span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>The apostle Paul understood this principle clearly. ‘…<em>don’t sin by letting anger control you. Don’t let the sun go down while you are still angry, for anger gives a foothold to the devil</em>.’ (Ephesians 4:26–27 NLT) He wrote these words two millennia ago, but they’re still great advice for married couples today. </span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...when he was still a great way off, his father...had compassion, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him.' Luke 15:20 NKJV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150601.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Here’s an interesting and largely unknown thing about the story of the Prodigal Son, as pointed out by Ken Bailey. Jewish families living in small villages were tightly knit communities where people knew one another well. So when something like this happened, word travelled fast. When the younger son demanded his inheritance it was like saying to his father, ‘I can’t wait until you die. I want what’s mine, now!’ Such a thing was unheard of. Then he went away, forgot the values he’d been taught, and squandered his inheritance on parties and prostitutes. As a result he ended up destitute, working in a pig–sty. For a Jew, you can imagine the stigma. After breaking his father’s heart and the rules of the community, he decided to come back home. And that’s when his father ‘ran’ to meet him. Here’s why. Had he reached home after failing so badly, the village elders would have held a ‘ceremony of shame’ known in Hebrew as kezazah. They’d have taken a clay pitcher and smashed it on the ground in front of him, meaning his ties with the community were broken and he was no longer welcome. That’s why his father ran to meet him. He was saying, ‘I have to get to my son with grace before they get to him with the law. I have to give him hope before they take it away. I have a different ceremony in mind: a homecoming party to celebrate his restoration.’ What the father did for his prodigal son that day, God will do for you today, if you’ll only turn to Him. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Amos 1:1-5:17, Matt 14:13-21, Ps 117, Prov 14:9-12 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66652&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

(1) ‘…the father said to his servants, “Bring out the best robe and put it on him…”’ (Luke 15:22 NKJV) Can you imagine what this boy smelled like and looked like, after wallowing in the muck of a pig– sty? Can you identify with him? Good news: God covers our sinfulness in the robe of Christ’s right-eousness. And from that point on He sees us ‘in Christ’. Therefore we are always acceptable in His eyes. (2) ‘…put a ring on his hand…’ (Luke 15:22 NKJV) This was the family signet ring used in transacting business. When placed on wax, it was equal to a signature. More good news: God doesn’t partially restore you, He recommissions you and gives you back full authority to do business in His name. (3) ‘…put…sandals on his feet.’ (Luke 15:22 NKJV) The prodigal son was getting ready to say to his father, ‘…I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired servants.’ (Luke 15:19 NKJV) In those days hired servants didn’t wear shoes in public; only sons did. How wonderful—his father gave him the full rights of sonship. (4) ‘…bring the fatted calf here and kill it, and let us eat and be merry.’ (Luke 15:23 NKJV) You don’t fatten a calf overnight! The father had been planning this celebration for a long time. He never gave up on his son and the word for you today is: God hasn’t given up on you either! Come back to Him and let Him restore you. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Amos 5:18-9:15, Matt 14:22-36, Ps 121, Prov 14:13-16<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66653&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['To answer before listening--that is folly...' Proverbs 18:13 NIV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150603.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>To serve others effectively, you must be attuned to what they need. What keeps us from doing that? First: assumption. A lady in an airport lounge bought a packet of biscuits and sat down to read the newspaper. She heard a rustling noise and looked up to see the man beside her helping himself to the biscuits. Not wanting to make a scene, she leaned over and took one herself, hoping he’d get the message. Then she heard more rustling. She couldn’t believe it. The man was helping himself to another biscuit! There was only one left! She watched in disbelief as he broke the remaining biscuit in two, pushed half across to her, popped the other half in his mouth, and left. She was still furious when her flight was announced. Imagine how she felt when she opened her handbag to get her ticket out—and found her unopened packet of biscuits! Now be honest, didn’t you assume the stranger was helping himself to her biscuits? Most people do and that tells us a lot about ourselves! Too often we’re guilty of making assumptions about people and once you put someone in a box, it’s hard to think of them any other way. Do you agree? Every time a good tailor sees a client, he takes new measurements. He never assumes they’re the same size as they were the last time. That’s a good policy. Never make assumptions about someone’s background, profession, race, gender, age, nationality, politics, faith, or other factors. Once you do, you stop paying attention and miss clues that can help you to know what they really need. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezek 1-4, Matt 15:1-14, Ps 4, Prov 14:17-20 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66654&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought...' Romans 12:3 NIV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150604.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Another thing that’ll keep you from serving others is arrogance. What others think and feel isn’t important to you. Arrogant people seldom meet people on common ground. They don’t believe they should have to because by their own estimation they live on higher ground and shouldn’t have to descend to anyone else’s level. They expect others to come to them. Justice Louis D. Brandeis observed: ‘Nine–tenths of the serious controversies that arise in life result from misunderstanding, from one man not knowing the facts which to the other man seem important, or otherwise failing to appreciate his point of view.’ It’s ridiculous for anyone to think they have all the answers. Such people can become opinionated, narrow–minded and arrogant, listening only to their own thoughts and ignoring advice and suggestions from others. When your overriding goal is to build a case for your own viewpoint, people get turned off if you have a ‘my way or no way’ attitude. To win them you must be willing to build a relationship. The letters in the word ‘silent’ also form the word ‘listen’. Relationships are built by listening to people, loving them, learning from them, and leaving them better off than you found them. ‘A wise man will hear and increase learning, and a man of understanding will attain wise counsel.’ (Proverbs 1:5 NKJV) </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezek 5-9, Matt 15:15-28, Ps 124, Prov 14:21-24 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66655&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ 'But they paid no attention...' Matthew 22:5 NIV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150605.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Indifference is the third thing that keeps us from serving others. A well–known comedian quipped, ‘Scientists announced today that they’d found a cure for apathy. However, they claim no one has shown the slightest bit of interest in it.’ When it comes to communicating, that could be said of many of us; we’re indifferent to how we come across. We may not necessarily feel superior to others, but we don’t go out of our way to get to know them either. Why? Because it’s hard work! In reality, indifference is another form of selfishness that keeps us from connecting with people. Novelist George Eliot put it like this: ‘Try to care about something in this vast world besides the gratification of small selfish desires. Try to care for what is best in thought and action—something that is good apart from the accidents of your own lot. Look on other lives... See what their troubles are, and how they are borne.’ People truly appreciate it when you make the effort, no matter how small, to try to see things from their point of view. Paul writes, ‘Be kindly, affectionate to one another with brotherly love, in honour giving preference to one another.’ (Romans 12:10 NKJV) Everybody you meet is wrestling with a fear or fighting a battle and, if you’re caring and sensitive, God will give you a word to lift them. Isaiah said, ‘The Lord God has given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him who is weary…’ (Isaiah 50:4 NKJV) What a gift—to be able to lift someone who is struggling. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezek 10-13, Matt 15:29-39, Ps 129, Prov 14:25-28 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66656&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...through love serve one another.' Galatians 5:13 NKJV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150606.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Control is the fourth thing that deters us from serving. While it’s important to focus on understanding others, we must also be authentic and open so they can understand us. Because it can make us feel vulnerable, many of us are unwilling to be transparent. Former U.S. Navy Captain Mike Abrashoff observes: ‘Some leaders feel that by keeping people in the dark, they maintain a measure of control. But that is a leader’s folly and an organisation’s failure. Secrecy spawns isolation, not success. Knowledge is power, yes, but what leaders need is collective power, and that requires collective knowledge. I found that the more people knew what the goals were, the better buy–in I got—and the better the results we achieved together.’ Any time people sense information is being withheld from them, it creates distance. They feel like outsiders, and, as a result, morale drops along with their performance. In Lead, Follow, or Get Out of the Way, Jim Lundy writes about what he calls the ‘Subordinates’ Lament’: ‘We, the uninformed, working for the inaccessible, are doing the impossible for the ungrateful!’ Ever feel like that? Then there’s the ‘Mushroom Farm Lament’ which goes like this: ‘We feel we’re being kept in the dark. Every once in a while someone comes around and spreads manure on us. But when our heads pop up, they’re chopped off and then we’re canned.’ Good leaders don’t isolate themselves, and they don’t deliberately keep people in the dark. They inform them, and include them in the decision–making process whenever possible. If you’re serious about serving others, open up. Let people know who you are and what you believe. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezek 14:1-16:52, Matt 16:1-12, Ps 1, Prov 14:29-32 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66657&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...don't let us yield to temptation...' Matthew 6:13 NLT<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150607.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Many of us suffer unnecessarily because of our misconceptions about temptation. The first one is: expecting your temptations to cease—or at least de-crease. When the Israelites entered the Promised Land they had the same expectation. They were surprised that the Canaanites were still in the land. So they got discouraged, thinking they must have gone the wrong way. ‘Surely this couldn’t be the land of promise.’ God’s Word makes it clear that the Christian life, from start to finish, is warfare. Paul says we are called to ‘…wrestle…against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places’ (Ephesians 6:12 KJV), and your level of temptation increases as you draw closer to God. Notice: when Israel first left Egypt, God didn’t lead them through Philistine territory ‘though that was shorter. For God said, “…If they face war, they might change their minds and return to Egypt.”’ (Exodus 13:17 NIV) God understood their fledgling faith and protected them from their enemies. But later, when their faith had grown, He permitted them to face seven powerful nations. Just like the Promised Land, the promised life of victory requires you to deal with temptation and wrestle your way through to victory, believing that ‘…greater is He that is in you, than he that is in the world.’ (1 John 4:4 KJV) Indeed, their enemy’s attack proved that Israel was in the Promised Land. So experiencing temptations is proof you are truly abiding in Christ.</p><br /><br /> SoulFood: Gen 1:1-2:3, John 1:1-18 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66658&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ 'Blessed is the man who endures temptation...' James 1:12 NKJV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150608.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>The second misconception is: temptation is sin. The devil wants you to blame yourself for the temptations you experience. Why? Because when you believe that you are the source of it, you feel condemned and discouraged. As you indulge in feelings of discouragement, you become an easy prey and Satan convinces you to go ahead and yield to the temptation. Ironically, you yield to sin through the fear of having already fallen. No, the temptation itself isn’t sin; the sin only occurs when you yield to it! Many of us feel like we’re spiritually deficient, distant from God, even phonies because we think we initiated the temptation ourselves. Imagine a burglar in your house, and when you detect him he accuses you of being the burglar! Would you believe him? Of course not! Yet that’s Satan’s approach with us. After he tempts us, he accuses with thoughts like, ‘A real Christian would never have such thoughts!’ Knowing our own weakness, his accusations sound plausible and we believe him. Then we feel condemned, spiral into discouragement, and yield to the temptation. Understand this: condemnation comes from Satan (1 Timothy 3:6). The Bible says, ‘Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.’ (Romans 8:1 NIV) When Satan sends temptation, the Holy Spirit goes to work in us, helping us to reject his suggestions and reminding us of Jesus’ availability to help us triumph. ‘Because He Himself suffered when He was tempted, He is able to help those who are being tempted.’ (Hebrews 2:18 NIV) So when you’re tempted, reject Satan’s condemnation and reach for Christ’s overcoming assistance. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezek 16:53-19:14, Matt 16:13-28, Ps 48, Prov 14:33-35 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66659&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...count it all joy when you fall into various trials.' James 1:2 NKJV <br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150609.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Satan knows that when you recognise him as the source of your temptation, he loses his advantage. He knows that when you understand he initiated the temptation, you’ll recoil from it faster than if you think you yourself are the source of it. If Satan approached you and said, ‘I’ve come to make you sin and feel condemned,’ your vulnerability to his temptations would evaporate! He won’t tell you that—but if you remember it you’ll have the advantage over him. As Paul puts it, ‘…we are not ignorant about Satan’s scheming.’ (2 Corinthians 2:11 GWT) Another misconception is that temptation is time lost and effort wasted. In long periods of temptation we feel like we’ve lost ground rather than gained it. No! Withstanding temptation is ‘[fighting] the good fight of faith…’ (1 Timothy 6:12 NKJV), and that’s when God develops your character. ‘When all kinds of…temptations crowd into your lives…Realise that they come to…produce in you the quality of endurance…’ and when that happens, ‘…you will find you have become men [and women] of mature character…’ (James 1:2–4 PHPS) Indeed, your compensation goes far beyond your present development to the reaping of eternal rewards. ‘…be exceedingly glad on this account, though now for a little while you may be distressed by trials and suffer temptations, so that [the genuineness] of your faith may be tested, [your faith] which is infinitely more precious than the perishable gold which is tested and purified by fire.’ (1 Peter 1:6–7 AMP) Add to this God’s glorious guarantee: ‘Blessed is the man who endures temptation... he will receive the crown of life...’ (James 1:12 NKJV) </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezek 20-21, Matt 17:1-13, Ps 132:1-10, Prov 15:1-4 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66660&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...O Lord of hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your servant... [and] give to your servant a son, then I will give him to the Lord...' 1 Samuel 1:11 NKJV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150610.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>After arriving in the New World, the Spanish explorer, Cortez, took his crew off their ships, then set the ships on fire as the sailors watched in confusion and horror. By that one act, Cortez sealed their commitment to explore new territory and ensured they’d never give in or go back. Guess what? Having no alternative clears your perception, does away with procrastination, and helps you make up your mind. When you’re in a corner, you learn to reach deeper inside yourself, and in so doing you discover God–given strengths you never knew existed. When you’re up against a deadline, it releases a creative flow within you. For example, nothing increases your commitment like the threat of failure or the risk of embarrassment. In The Tyranny of E–mail, John Freeman says, ‘Attention is one of the most valuable modern resources. If we waste it on frivolous communication, we will have nothing left when we really need it.’ Distractions drain your energy, blur your focus, and disrupt your momentum. Projects fail, companies collapse, and marriages are damaged because of the way distractions deplete our resources and destroy our relationships. Don’t get to the end of your life only to look back and discover you forfeited things which were truly significant, to make way for things that added nothing of value. Hannah made a vow to God that resulted in the birth of her son Samuel, who became one of Israel’s greatest Judges. Be a person who honours your commitments. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezek 22-23, Matt 17:14-27, Ps 132:11-18, Prov 15:5-7 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66661&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Owe nothing to anyone--except for your obligation to love one another...' Romans 13:8 NLT<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150611.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>If you think winning the lottery would solve all your problems, you couldn’t be more wrong! Almost half of those who become overnight millionaires end up bankrupt within a few years. Why? For a variety of reasons: bad business deals, extravagant living, crazy schemes, and fast–talking relatives. And here’s another one—a big one! Believing that they now have the Midas touch and that Lady Luck is on their side, they continue to gamble at an even higher level—and end up losing it all. Try to understand this: unless you spend less than you earn, no amount of income will ever be enough! So if you’re wise, when you get a salary in-crease or an unexpected windfall you won’t adopt a more extravagant lifestyle. You’ll reduce your debt before it becomes an albatross around your neck that drowns you. No amount of income will be sufficient if your spending is not brought under control. The only way to get ahead financially is to deny yourself some of the things you want and save for the future. If you don’t have the discipline to do that, you’ll always be in debt. Now, when the government gets into debt, they simply tax you. But when you get into debt—you’re on your own. That’s not how God wants you to live. True contentment doesn’t come from getting all you want, but by discovering the blessings you have been given and learning to enjoy them. This should be your goal: ‘Owe no one anything—except for your obligation to love one another.’ </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezek 24:1-27:24, Matt 18:1-9, Ps 143, Prov 15:8-10 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66662&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['This is My commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you.' John 15:12 NKJV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150612.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Take a deep breath, and hold it for a moment. Now exhale it. Where did it go? The air that you just exhaled will circle the globe in the next twelve months, during which time each of the molecules you exhaled will be breathed in by someone else only to be exhaled again. In this way we are all linked to each other, we are all connected by our breath to each other and to the One who first breathed life into us. Just as we all share our chemistry with other members of the human family, so we are all interdependent. We’re affected positively or negatively by the actions of each other. During the self–centred days of what used to be called the ‘Me Generation’, it was common to hear people say, ‘As long as I’m not hurting anyone, it’s nobody’s business what I do.’ Unfortunately, everything we do affects other people, and there’s no such thing as a completely independent act. The poet John Donne wrote, ‘No man is an island, entire of itself, every man is a piece of a continent, a piece of the main.’ With that in mind, read these two Scriptures: (1) ‘A new commandment I give you, that you love one another; as I have loved you.’ (John 15:12 NKJV) (2) ‘Owe nothing to anyone—except for your obligation to love one another…’ (Romans 13:8 NLT) That means you have an obligation today to show your care for others in some practical way.</p><br /><br /> SoulFood: Ezek 27:25-30:26, Matt 18:10-20, Ps 80:1-11, Prov 15:11-14 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66663&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...Make every effort to add to your faith...' 2 Peter 1:5 NIV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150613.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>As a leader you should stand on this Scripture: ‘[God’s] divine power has given us everything we need for a godly life …He has given us His very great and precious promises, so that through them you may participate in the divine nature…For this… reason, make every effort to add to your faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge; and to knowledge, self–control; and to self–control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness; and to godliness, brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness, love. For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive.’ (2 Peter 1:3–8 NIV) Note the word ‘add’. Whether you’re a leader at home, the workplace, or the church, you must keep learning and growing. When you continually invest in yourself, over time the inevitable result is growth. Although it’s true that some people are born with greater natural gifts than others, the ability to lead is really a collection of skills, nearly all of which can be learned and improved. But the process doesn’t happen overnight. Leadership is complicated. It has many different facets such as: respect, experience, emotional strength, people skills, discipline, vision, momentum, and timing—the list goes on and on. That’s why leaders require so much seasoning to be effective. The truth is, in order to keep leading, you must keep learning and the learning process is ongoing, resulting from self–discipline and perseverance. Your goal must be to get a little better each day, to build on the previous day’s success, and to learn from its failure. Solomon put it this way: ‘A wise man will hear and increase learning.’ (Proverbs 1:5 NKJV) </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezek 31-33, Matt 18:21-35, Ps 80:12-19, Prov 15:15-17 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66664&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Who sinned, this man or his parents...?' John 9:2 NKJV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150614.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>‘His disciples asked Him, saying, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?” Jesus answered, “Neither this man nor his par-ents sinned, but that the works of God should be revealed in him.”’ (John 9:2–3 NKJV). When someone is trapped in a self–destructive habit, we sometimes say it’s genetic: ‘It runs in the family.’ Yet psychiatrists tell us 90% of those who abuse others were first abused themselves; they are simply ‘acting out’ what was done to them. Some say if alcoholism and addiction run in your family, you’ve got an ‘addictive gene’, meaning you’re at much greater risk if you pick up a drink or a drug. But you’ll notice Jesus didn’t get into the whole ‘nurture vs nature’ debate. In essence, He said, ‘This is just an opportunity for God to demonstrate His love and grace by setting this man free.’ So your problem may be too big for you, but it’s not too big for God. It’s actually a platform for Him to demonstrate His grace in your life. ‘Therefore if any person is [ingrafted] in Christ (the Messiah) he is a new creation (a new creature altogether); the old [previous moral and spiritual condition] has passed away. Behold, the fresh and new has come!’ (2 Corinthians 5:17 AMP) God doesn’t consult your past in order to determine your future. Before you met Jesus, you were spiritually dead. That’s why He said, ‘…you must be born from above…’ (John 3:3 CEV) From that point forward, the past no longer has any power over you (except the power you give it). So you can break the cycle. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Josh 1, Ps 27:11-14, 2 Tim 2:1-13<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66665&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He spat on the ground and made clay with the saliva; and He anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay.' John 9:6 NKJV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150615.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Dr. Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, points out that your DNA is in your saliva and that when Jesus spat, this blind man received a divine DNA transfer. The fact of the matter is that sin is in our DNA and that’s why Jesus goes back to the root of our problem! Understand this: God doesn’t merely treat your symptoms; He goes back to the source of your problem in order to set you free from it. To change the fruit, He changes the root. This man never had the ability to see; he was born blind and needed a creative miracle—and that’s exactly what he got. Physical miracle and spiritual miracle—a total transformation. Our God is awesome, isn’t He? Do you know why Jesus came? ‘…To bind up the bro-kenhearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners, to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favour…to comfort all who mourn…to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of joy instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of de-spair…’ (Isaiah 61:1–3 NIV) It doesn’t matter whether your parents contributed to your problem or you simply made bad choices in life, Jesus can set you free, make you whole, and give you a new life. Jesus didn’t blame this man or his parents. That’s because God has no desire for your condemna-tion; His desire is for your transformation. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezek 34-36, Matt 19:1-14, Ps 73:1-16, Prov 15:18-21<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66666&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...One thing I know: that though I was blind, now I see.' John 9:25 NKJV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150616.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>When Jesus restored this blind man’s sight, the Pharisees tried to engage him in a theological debate about who Jesus was and where His power came from, but he refused to argue with them. He simply said, ‘…One thing I know: that though I was blind, now I see,’ and the same arguments still continue today. Some people say, ‘The day of miracles is past.’ The truth is that there is no day of miracles; there’s only a God of miracles Who says, ‘…I am the Lord, I do not change.’ (Malachi 3:6 NKJV) The Bible says, ‘Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and today, and forever.’ (Hebrews 13:8 KJV) That means what He was, He still is. What He did, He still does. What He said, He still says. Whatever your problem may be, you have two choices: live with it and try to adjust to it, or believe God to set you free from it. Certain things like alco-holism, addiction, and abuse may run in your family, but by the grace of God you can break the cycle! Please hear this: God’s power is greater than your habit! Not only can He set you free from the thing that holds you captive, He can deliver you from its lingering effects. His Word to you is: ‘Forget the former things; do not dwell on the past. See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it? I am making a way…’ (Isaiah 43:18–19 NIV) So turn to God today. Give Him a chance. You’ve tried other things, now try Him. He will not fail you! </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezek 37:1-40:9, Matt 19:15-30, Ps 73:17-28, Prov 15:22-24 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66667&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...he went and washed, and came back seeing.' John 9:7 NKJV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150617.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Sometimes Jesus healed sick people by speaking to them, other times He laid His hands on them. But this blind man’s healing was not the work of a moment; it was the result of a process. ‘…He said to him, “Go, wash in the pool of Siloam”…So he went and washed, and came back seeing.’ (John 9:7 NKJV) Question: How far away was the pool of Siloam? For a blind man, any journey is a long one. Picture this man with mud in his eyes, trying to navigate his way to the pool of Siloam. There’s an important lesson here. Even when God touches us, sometimes we’ve got to walk with our mess until we get to the place of healing, freedom and deliverance. Here’s another thought. Whoever told this man about Jesus, and brought him to Jesus, had to keep walking with him until he got his sight back and could walk on his own. You can’t say to someone who’s struggling with a problem, ‘I told you about Jesus, and I even brought you to church but you’re still stumbling around in darkness bound by the same problems, so I give up.’ God never gives up on people, and we must not give up on them either. When someone continues to struggle with an old habit, some Christians say they mustn’t really be saved. Question: How often do you give in to resentment, pride, lust, greed, gossip, etc.? The list is endless, yet God doesn’t give up on you. Sometimes people have to ‘walk out’ their deliverance and healing until it fully comes to pass. That’s how long you need to love them, believe in them, pray for them, and keep working with them. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezek 40:10-42:20, Matt 20:1-16, Ps 139:1-6, Prov 15:25-27<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66668&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...Go to the pool...and wash...' John 9:11 NKJV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150618.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Jesus told this blind man to go to the pool of Siloam and wash the dirt from his eyes. So here’s the question: What do you need to remove from your life today in order to see what God wants you to see and do what He wants you to do? Whether it’s a destructive habit, a toxic relationship, or a bad atti-tude, you must get rid of it. James writes: ‘Therefore submit to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you. Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double–minded.’ (James 4:7–8 NKJV) God will do His part, but you must do yours. God will extend grace to you, but you must act on it. It’s said that the water which flowed into the pool of Siloam came from under the temple and was used to wash the utensils which were part of worship and sacrifice. In other words, this water didn’t come from a man–made source, but from the presence of God. Don’t miss the point here! Jesus said, ‘You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you.’ (John 15:3 NKJV) Paul speaks of ‘…the washing of water by the word’ (Ephesians 5:26 KJV). David writes, ‘How can a young man [or an older one] cleanse his way? By taking heed according to Your Word.’ (Psalm 119:9 NKJV) The secret of victorious Christian living is bathing your mind each day in the Scriptures. Picture yourself taking a bath in God’s Word and the dirt and grime coming off you. That’s what meditating on the Scriptures does for you. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezek 43-45, Matt 20:17-28, Ps 139:7-12, Prov 15:28-30 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66669&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ 'I will set nothing wicked before my eyes...' Psalm 101:3 NKJV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150619.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p> Today our children have more access to the internet than ever before. Over half of all children between the ages of nine and seventeen have internet cable or satellite television access in their bedrooms. The old image of the family gathered around a single TV set in the living room is almost non–existent. Instead, often children are off by themselves where they can choose anything they want to see. They don’t even have to be in their bed-room because now they can access it all on a hand–held device like a tablet or an iPhone! One prominent social researcher put it this way: ‘Almost everything children are seeing is essentially going into their minds in some sort of uncensored or unfiltered way.’ Under the ‘freedom of expression’ rule, the government and courts permit internet sites to peddle explicit sex, violence, nudity and profanity to your children and your grandchildren. Are you concerned? You should be! Why do sheep need a shepherd? For the same reason children need loving and observant parents—wolves! And your ignorance of technology is no defence! Because you weren’t exposed to these evils growing up doesn’t guarantee that your children won’t get hooked on them. Many parents don’t even take the time to know what their children are watching! Don’t be one of them. After his disastrous affair with Bathsheba and the heartache and havoc it brought to his family, David said, ‘…I will walk within my house with a perfect heart. I will set nothing wicked before my eyes…’ (Psalm 101:2–3 NKJV) Parents, what are your children watching? </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezek 46-48, Matt 20:29-34, Ps 139:13-24, Prov 15:31-33 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66670&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...If you have faith and do not doubt...' Matthew 21:21 NIV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150620.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Doubt is a doorway through which Satan enters your life. It causes the ‘fight of faith’ to become the ‘flight of faith’. When fear, confusion, discouragement and despair take up residence within you, they rob you of confidence, joy and peace. But isn’t doubting just human? Of course it is and it’s also Satan’s ploy! ‘…whoever does not believe God has made Him out to be a liar, because they have not believed the testimony God has given…’ (1 John 5:10 NIV) Your doubts reveal a lack of confidence in what God says. So how can you stop doubting? The same way you deal with other sin—by acknowledging you have a problem and doing something about it. Doubt cannot be conquered by reason or even resistance; it will only submit to complete relinquishment. Trying to overcome your doubts one by one is like an alcoholic trying to reduce his or her alcohol intake one drink at a time. It doesn’t work. The solution is two–fold. (1) It begins with a once–for–all decision. It calls for a total relinquishing of your right to doubt anything God promised. It’s saying, ‘From now on, I will not doubt God!’ It’s believing that when you surrender a thing to Him, He takes it and deals with it. (2) By faith declare, ‘Lord, I absolutely trust Your every Word!’ Will doubt come knocking again at your door? Yes, but instead of letting it in, ‘...take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.’ (Ephesians 6:16 NIV) Don’t fret, wrestle, or reason with your doubts. Instead, repeat your Scriptural declaration of faith, disregard your feelings, and trust God to do what He says. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Cor 1-4, Matt 21:1-17, Ps 144:1-8, Prov 16:1-3 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66671&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ 'I appeal to you, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree with one another...' 1 Corinthians 1:10 NIV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150621.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>To lead your family effectively, you need to learn how to huddle regularly. The ‘huddle’ is where a team: (1) sets its goals; (2) discusses the division of responsibilities; (3) tackles the issues that determine whether it wins or loses. Parent, even though you call the plays from overhead, your family must be taught how to accomplish them on the field. That means working through things, talking through the disagreements, motivating and appreciating each member. Try to listen with an open heart. Don’t just hear what your children say, try to understand how they feel. Yes, you’re the boss, and yes, you can try to enforce your will if you want to. But sooner or later you’ll have trouble, for resentment grows when people feel left out. Every member of your team has got to be part of the decision–making process. Involve them! Ask God to help you look beyond what you want to what’s best for all of you. And don’t fall under the spell of instant gratification. What looks good to you today could be taking you off the path to a better tomorrow. And don’t let ‘outsiders’ into your huddle. Tell them to stay in their own. Too often their opinions are based on hearsay, self–interest or jealousy. Respect the privacy of your team. Build loyalty. Huddle regularly in prayer. When you do that, everybody wins! </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Esther 4:9-5:3, Heb 4:7-16 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66672&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...the hearts of the people melted, and became like water.' Joshua 7:5 NKJV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150622.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Even the most seasoned believers experience failure and the big question at such times isn’t, ‘How could I have let that happen?’ but, ‘What’s the right way to deal with it?’ Indulging in self–condemning thoughts comes naturally to us, but it does no good. It just produces discouragement, and adds failure upon failure. As a result of Achan’s sin, Israel was defeated at Ai and fled before their enemies. Like us, in response to their defeat, ‘…the hearts of the people melted, and became like water.’ Their faith forsook them, and they ‘lost their courage.’ (Joshua 7:5 GNT) Even their leader Joshua ‘…fell facedown to the ground…’ (Joshua 7:6 NIV), despairing that things could only get worse! Have you been there? Do you recognise the pattern? Defeat, discouragement, despair, and more defeat. What was God’s response? ‘Get up! Why do you lie thus…? Israel has sinned… Get up, sanctify the people…’ (Joshua 7:10–13 NKJV) He’s a God of repentance—not wallowing in remorse; a God of getting up—not lying down in failure! Holiness is a path, not a place. When you’re off the path, God’s plan is simple—get back on it immediately. Confess your sin (1 John 1:9). By faith ac-cept God’s mercy and forgiveness. And refuse Satan’s condemnation (Romans 8:1). ‘…Forgetting those things which are behind…press toward the goal…’ (Philippians 3:13–14 NKJV) Like a child learning to walk, when you fall don’t lie down and give up. Minimise your down–time—get back up and walk again. Remember this: the moment that brings the awareness of sin should also bring the confession of sin and the assurance of forgiveness! </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Cor 5-8, Matt 21:18-32, Ps 144:9-15, Prov 16:4-7 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66673&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Return... I will heal your backslidings...' Jeremiah 3:22 NKJV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150623.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>What’s the root of our failures? Failure doesn’t lie in the strength of the enemy, or our own weakness, or God’s reluctance to help us overcome. Israel was defeated by a small town after having conquered mighty Jericho. Their failure, like ours, was the result of unconfessed sin (Joshua 7). But once their sin was brought to light and dealt with, God spoke encouragement to them. ‘…Do not be afraid…Take all the people of war with you… I have given into your hand the king of Ai, his people, his city, and his land.’ (Joshua 8:1 NKJV) Sin unacknowledged will keep you defeated, but sin confessed will bring you forgiveness and restoration that leads to victory. Author Hannah Whitall Smith tells of moving into a new home. She noticed in the cellar a very clean–looking cider cask sealed at both ends. She de-bated whether to open it and see what was inside, but decided to leave it undisturbed. Each spring and autumn when the cleaning was being done, she’d remember the cask but put off opening it. Unaccountably, moths began to fill the house. She used every means she knew to get rid of them, without success. At last, remembering the cask, she opened it and thousands of moths poured out! The lesson here is simple: anything we cling to that’s contrary to God’s Word will cause us to fall before our enemies. Always keep before you David’s prayer: ‘Search me, O God, and know my heart…see if there be any wicked way in me…’ (Psalm 139:23–24 NKJV) Whatever God shows you, confess it immediately and by faith receive His forgiveness and cleansing. Then you’ll be able to stand victorious before your enemies. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Cor 9:1-11:15, Matt 21:33-46, Ps 8, Prov 16:8-11 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66674&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I will raise up a faithful priest who will serve me and do what I desire...' 1 Samuel 2:35 NLT <br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150624.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Being the high priest in Israel was a prestigious job, and Eli seemed suited to it. Yet he failed badly on the home front. ‘…His sons did not follow his ways. They turned aside after dishonest gain and accepted bribes and perverted justice.’ (1 Samuel 8:3 NIV) As a result, God told Eli He ‘…would judge his family forever because of the sin he knew about; his sons blasphemed against God, and he failed to restrain them.’ (1 Samuel 3:13 NIV) As a parent and leader you need to answer this question: If God applied the same standard to you as He did to Eli, how well would you do? Eli ended up losing his credibility, his children, his career, and eventually his life. He missed the mark because he made some critical errors. Let’s look at them and see what we can learn: (1) He had the wrong emphasis. He emphasised the Word of God to the people in his congregation, but not to his own children. (2) He had the wrong expectations. He thought his children would ‘get it’ because they lived under his roof and worked in the church. But it doesn’t work that way. (3) He set the wrong example. Eli failed to live at home what he taught at work. He had 20/20 vision when it came to his profession, but where his family was concerned he was blind to his own weakness. Leadership on the home front isn’t about power and control; it’s about ‘giving yourself’ to the people who should matter most (Ephesians 5:25). So, how are you doing on the home front? </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Cor 11:16-13:14, Matt 22:1-14, Ps 17, Prov 16:12-15<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66675&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...humans must not pull apart what God has put together.' Mark 10:9 CEB <br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150625.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Not every relationship can be saved. When physical, mental or emotional abuse threatens your child’s safety, or your own, you may be forced to leave. Failing to do so could lead to tragedy, but where a workable resolution can be found, a troubled relationship can become a source of shared joy and fulfilment. Here are some keys to make staying worthwhile: Adopt God’s perspective on sin—yours and your spouse’s. One of the major problems is the way we classify sin—especially our spouse’s. You’re understandably overwrought and anxious because they’re incorrigible and selfish. They’re the wilful sinner—you’re the offended saint. They need a major overhaul, and you’re responsible to see they get it. Things like being critical, nagging and controlling seem like small things compared to a spouse who swears, drinks and visits porn sites. From God’s perspective, sin is sin—yours and theirs! It’s all harmful to relationships. Stop ‘classifying’ sin and try to discover the relationship–transforming power of handling the situation the way Jesus taught. ‘How can you say to your brother, “Let me take the speck out of your eye,” when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.’ (Matthew 7:4–5 NIV) You’ll be amazed at how God will cause your spouse to acknowledge and deal with ‘their’ problem when you get honest and deal with ‘yours’! </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Song 1-4, Matt 22:15-22, Ps 21, Prov 16:16-19 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66676&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['In order that Satan might not outwit us...' 2 Corinthians 2:11 NIV <br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150626.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Recognise who the real enemy of your marriage is. On those days when you think, ‘I can’t spend another moment in this relationship,’ it’s easy to lose perspective and focus on the wrong things. Marriage was God’s idea. He planned it as the foundation of His earthly Kingdom. That makes marriage one of Satan’s prime targets. It’s why he poisoned the perspective and confused the thinking of the first couple. He deceived Adam into believing that Eve was his problem, blaming the fiasco on her (Genesis 3:12). But both of them were deceived by ‘…the father of lies.’ (John 8:44 NLT) Satan knew he could undermine God’s plan by driving a wedge between the first couple, creating antagonism, blame and self–interest, and his methods haven’t changed. It’s why we ‘keep tabs’ on each other’s shortcomings, identifying our mate as the problem and refusing to show grace. Paul helps us understand how to overcome Satan’s strategy. ‘…I have forgiven in the sight of Christ…in order that Satan might not outwit us…we are not unaware of his schemes.’ (2 Corinthians 2:10–11 NIV) Then he counsels us further by saying that ‘…love… keeps no record of wrongs…’ (1 Corinthians 13:4–5 NIV) That doesn’t mean love lives in denial, but that it chooses to practise self–denial! So rather than keeping score of your spouse’s worst qualities, choose to look for their best ones and show your appreciation. Nothing melts resentment and hardness like expressing appreciation for each other. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Song 5-8, Matt 22:23-33, Ps 59:1-8, Prov 16:20-22 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66677&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Pray then like this...Your will be done...' Matthew 6:9-10 ESV <br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150627.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Here are another two helpful keys to resolving marriage conflict: (1) Let God direct your prayers. Prayer can be closed–ended or open–ended. When we think that our perspective is the only accurate one, we pray closed–ended prayers calling on God to solve the problem our way, believing it’s the only correct way. However, closed–ended praying produces two problems. First, it locks us into rigid thinking and blinds us to other perspectives. Secondly, it keeps us from seeing God’s perspective, the one that can heal and restore the relationship. Open–ended praying asks God to solve the problem His way. ‘Pray then like this…Your will be done…’ Ask God to reveal His will to you both, wait until He does, then pray accordingly. The Bible says: ‘This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. And if we know that He hears us…we know that we have what we asked of Him.’ (1 John 5:14–15 NIV) (2) Remove the conditions from your love. Does this sound difficult? Love is a biblical command, not an arbitrary emotion. God’s not asking you to feel warm and fuzzy; He’s asking you to act in a loving way. Wouldn’t that be hypocritical? No, it’s rising above resentment, hurt, and fear, and practising real faith. It means asking yourself: ‘If I were loving unconditionally right now, what would I be doing? How would I be responding to my spouse?’ Then do it. The Bible says, ‘Love never fails…’ (1 Corinthians 13:8 NIV) You can lovingly act your way into a new way of feeling for both you and your spouse. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Sam 1-3, Matt 22:34-46, Ps 59:9-17, Prov 16:23-26 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66678&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ 'Leave your troubles with the Lord...' Psalm 55:22 GNT<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150628.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p> Give your marriage to God. The last word on the matter must be God’s Word! Seeking professional help is a good thing, but until you’ve transferred ownership of your marriage into God’s hands, you haven’t exercised your best option. You say, ‘What does handing my marriage over to God mean in practical terms?’ It means two things: (1) You stop calling the shots—that’s God’s job and you must get out of His way so that He can do His work unhindered. Your self–interest and need to control must bow to His will. As long as you insist on ‘being right’ and ‘straightening out’ your spouse, you will remain part of the problem. On the other hand, when you give the problem to God, He—not you—has a problem to work on! (2) You learn how to ‘walk by faith, not by sight.’ (2 Corinthians 5:7 NKJV) When things feel out of control, you will want to resume ownership of the problem. Don’t do it, or the result will be more of what doesn’t work. Renew your decision to allow God to have control and work in both of your hearts. ‘Walk by faith’, not by feelings. The psalmist puts it this way: ‘Leave your troubles with the Lord, and He will defend you…’ (Psalm 55:22 GNT) When you trust God to handle it, three things happen: (a) you experience peace; (b) your spouse’s resistance is likely to diminish because you’re no longer stirring the pot; (c) God goes to work: ‘…He who began a good work in you [both] will bring it to completion…’ (Philippians 1:6 ESV) </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Exod 34:29-35, Mk 9:2-27, 2 Cor 3:7-18 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66679&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The God of Heaven will give us success...' Nehemiah 2:20 NIV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150629.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p> To turn your failures into successes you need to do two things: (1) Realise that God wants you to succeed because you’re His child. When you think about it, what good and loving parent wouldn’t? In the face of overwhelming obstacles and enemy threats, Nehemiah announced, ‘…The God of Heaven will give us success…’ and God did! (2) Realise that failure is a teaching tool. The greater the failure, the greater the opportunity to learn from it. But first you must acknowledge the teaching potential in your mistakes and commit to learning, growing and changing as a result. Thomas Edison said, ‘I’m not discouraged, because every wrong attempt discarded is another step forward.’ At 21 years old he set up his laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey, and became a full–time inventor. At any given time, he and his team were working on as many as 40 different projects and they applied for more than 400 patents a year. Edison’s feverish work schedule and productivity caused the local citizens to dub him ‘The Wizard of Menlo Park’. But he wasn’t always successful. The fact is, he struggled with many of his inventions but, despite embarrassing failure after embarrassing failure, he refused to give up. Often ridiculed for his perseverance, he engaged in some 10,000 experiments before finally inventing the incandescent light bulb in 1879. Concerning his chequered work history, he said, ‘I haven’t failed. I’ve found 10,000 ways that don’t work.’ Stop labelling your failures as negative. There are very few real failures in life—only options. Some options work, others don’t. The truth is, with God on your side you’ll win if you persist!</p><br /><br /> SoulFood: 1 Sam 4-7, Matt 23:1-12, Ps 64, Prov 16:27-30 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66680&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...Don't let the world around you squeeze you into its own mould...' Romans 12:2 PHPS<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150630.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>You determine the outcomes in your life, because God has given no one but you power over your options. When things aren’t working out for us, we often look elsewhere for the reason. Like Eve, we can say, ‘The devil made me do it.’ No, Jesus said, ‘…I give unto you power…over all the power of the enemy…’ (Luke 10:19 KJV) Like Adam, we say, ‘Eve made me do it.’ But the psalmist says, ‘…I trust God, so I am not afraid. What can human beings do to me?’ (Psalm 56:4 NCV) Sometimes we believe circumstances beyond our control are responsible, but with God ‘…all things [including people and circumstances] work together for [our] good…’ (Romans 8:28 NKJV)—not for our defeat! Your mistaken beliefs victimise you and predispose you to a lifestyle of trying to change people and circumstances. That’s like attempting to unscramble an egg. You become a blame–fixer instead of a problem–solver. Accept the truth that no matter what Satan, others or circumstances do, God gives you the right to the last word in your life. ‘…greater is He that is in you, than he that is in the world.’ (1 John 4:4 KJV) The outcome is not determined by what goes on around you, but by what goes on within you. ‘…as he thinks in his heart, so is he…’ (Proverbs 23:7 NKJV) The devil can only determine the outcome with your permission and co–operation—and you don’t have to give them! So believe in God’s ability to bring you triumphantly through this difficulty. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Sam 8-10, Matt 23:13-22, Ps 95, Prov 16:31-33 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=66681&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Cleanse me from these hidden faults.' Psalm 19:12 NLT <br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150701.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>There are parts of yourself you’ll never see without God’s help. In one sense, you know yourself better than anyone else does. You alone have access to your inner thoughts, feelings and judgments. In another sense, you know yourself worse than anyone else does. Why? Because we rationalise, justify, minimise, forget, and embellish—and we don’t even know we’re doing it. We all fall for the self–serving bias. We claim too much credit and accept too little blame. We pay attention to experts who agree with our opinions, while ignoring or discounting all evidence to the contrary. Our memories are not simply faulty, they’re faulty in favour of our ego. The book <em>Egonomics</em> cites a survey in which 83 per cent of people were confident in their ability to make good decisions, but only 27 per cent were confident in the ability of the people they worked closely with to make good decisions. We’re stunned when someone sees past our defences into our souls. It’s not that they’re geniuses, it’s just that we’re sitting in our own blind spot and without the work of the Holy Spirit within us, much of the time we can’t even see our sin. The psalmist wrote: ‘How can I know all the sins lurking in my heart? Cleanse me from these hidden faults. Keep Your servant from deliberate sins! Don’t let them control me. Then I will be free of guilt and innocent of great sin. May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing to You, O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer.’ (Psalm 19:12–14 NLT) That’s a prayer you should pray—every day. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Sam 11-13, Matt 23:23-39, Ps 98, Prov 17:1-3 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67144&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Who can discern their own errors...?' Psalm 19:12 NIV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150702.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Sometimes trying to see the truth about yourself is like trying to see inside your own eyeballs. ‘…Who can discern their own errors…?’ the psalmist asked. Fortunately, you’re not left on your own. The Spirit is already at work in you. Your job is simply to listen and respond. Guilt isn’t your enemy, sin is. God’s Spirit will often bring a sense of conviction, and, when it does, the proper response isn’t to try and suppress the guilt but to deal with the issue. When you don’t, those issues can build up like cholesterol in your arteries. At a moment of great crisis, Samson arose to exert his strength, ‘…but he did not know that the Lord had left him.’ (Judges 16:20 NIV) He’d become callous and lost his sensitivity to God. Our bodies have an amazing capacity to warn us about what ails them, if we learn to read the signs. Chest pains may indicate heart trouble and there are more subtle clues. Many of us will have seen the TV ads or read about detecting when someone is having a stroke: (FAST) Face, Arms, Speech, Time. God will enable you to find the truth about your soul if you’re open and willing. Left to yourself, you will usually rationalise or defend yourself. You’ll ‘…call evil good and good evil…’ (Isaiah 5:20 NIV) At the other extreme, you can become a neurotic over–analyser. Madame Guyon warned against ‘depending on the diligence of your own scrutiny rather than on God for the knowledge and discovery of our sin.’ What’s the answer? Allow your thoughts and responses to be guided by the Holy Spirit. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Sam 14-15, Matt 24:1-14, Ps 102:1-11, Prov 17:4-6 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67145&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Put off the old man...' Colossians 3:9 NKJV <br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150703.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>The Bible speaks about ‘putting off’ certain sins. Then it speaks about ‘putting on’ certain Christ–like characteristics. Using this metaphor of clothing, let’s think about the acronym RAGS: (1) Resentment. How’s your irritability level these days? Are you more, or less, easily irritated? How about bitter-ness and unforgiveness? When someone hurts you, do you attack or withdraw? Is your handling of resentment getting better, worse, or in neutral? (2) Anxiety. On a scale of one to ten, what’s your discouragement level these days? Do you have more or fewer fears about money, your health, your job, or what other people think of you? Do you allow those fears to keep you from doing what God wants? Do you find your concerns motivate you to pray more frequently? (3) Greed. Greed is just mis–managed desire. So is your self–control going up, down, or is it in neutral? Are you living with more openness and less hiddenness than you used to—living more of your life in the light? Do you find that what you desire and enjoy is increasingly in line with what God wants for you? (4) Superiority. Are you becoming less preoccupied with self? Do you find yourself thinking more about other people and God, as well as the work He has for you to do? How often in conversation do you remark on the positive characteristics of others instead of their negative qualities? Do you come across as hard, jaded and cynical? Are you spending more or less time serving others? Today, ask God to help you look into your own heart and give you the grace to deal with what you find there. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Sam 16-17, Matt 24:15-25, Ps 102:12-17, Prov 17:7-10 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67146&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

Psalm 19:14 NLT<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150704.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Jesus said when the Holy Spirit came He would convict us of sin, but conviction is not the same as ‘getting caught’. When we get caught doing wrong we feel pain, but it’s not necessarily conviction over sin. Often it’s just embarrassment over how others are thinking about us. If we thought no one would ever know, we wouldn’t be in pain. And conviction isn’t the same thing as fear of punishment. Conviction is when you get a glimpse of what you’re capable of: ‘How did I become the kind of person who can lie, cheat on a test, have an affair, claim credit for what I didn’t do, act in a cowardly way instead of courageously, or use people for my own ends?’ These aren’t questions you’d normally ask yourself. The Bible says, ‘This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light…’ (John 3:19 NIV) When God is at work in your life, the pain isn’t about other people knowing, or even about the consequences. That’s all external. The pain of conviction is internal—it’s over who you are. Unless your car windscreen is clean, you run the risk of ending up in a ditch and you can’t clean it yourself while you’re driving—that’s why you have windscreen wipers. Similarly, the Holy Spirit’s job is to reveal sin, let you repent of it, and cleanse you so that you can go where God wants to take you in life. Each day you need to pray, ‘Lord, send as much light as I can stand. Clean off my windscreen so I can see more clearly. Cleanse me.’ </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Sam 18:1-20:29, Matt 24:26-35, Ps 102:18-28, Prov 17:11-14 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67147&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

Proverbs 25:6 CEV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150705.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Aspiring to leadership is commendable. Paul said, ‘…If someone aspires to be an elder, he desires an honourable position.’ (1 Timothy 3:1 NLT) But there’s a difference between stepping forward to take on the responsibility of leadership, and stepping forward to project yourself into the limelight. Harry Truman said, ‘If you can’t stand the heat, stay out of the kitchen.’ The question isn’t whether you enjoy being the focus of attention, but whether you can take the heat that goes along with it. For every person who acknowledges your skills and appreciates your accomplishments, there’ll be ten who make demands on your time, talent and treasure. Consider Barnabas. When the Gospel was first preached to the Gentiles, church leaders in Jerusalem sent Barnabas to check it out. ‘When he came and had seen the grace of God, he was glad, and encouraged them all that with purpose of heart they should continue with the Lord. For he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and…faith. And a great many people were added to the Lord.’ (Acts 11:23–24 NKJV) Barnabas had three sterling qualities: (1) He’d nothing to prove. He never sought the limelight. When he mentored Paul, he happily let the emerging apostle rise above him, supporting him every step of the way. (2) He’d nothing to lose. He didn’t seek to guard his reputation or fear losing his popular-ity. He wanted to serve, not be served. (3) He’d nothing to hide. He didn’t try to maintain a façade or image. He remained authentic, vulnerable and transparent and, best of all, he rejoiced in the success of others. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Exodus 20:1-17, Matt 5:1-12 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67148&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The right words bring satisfaction.' Proverbs 18:20 NLT <br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150706.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>What you say in the first five minutes can set the tone for the hours that follow. Good speakers understand they must grab the audience’s attention in the first five minutes, otherwise the opportunity to have an impact on them or move them to action can be lost. The same principle applies to your family. The first five minutes of a morning can determine how a mother will interact with her children that day. A snarl or a complaint as the children gather for breakfast can sour their relationship for hours. When a man arrives home from work at the end of the day, the way he greets his wife can influence their interaction throughout the evening. If he mutters, ‘Not tuna casserole again!’ the relationship can be put on edge until bedtime. But it doesn’t have to be that way in your house! When you’ve been apart from those you love, you can do an attitude check and reset your mood before you walk through the door. It’s ok to share your concerns but, generally speaking, you should leave work–related problems at work. Question: Does your family look forward to you coming home each night? If not, why not? A little sensitivity on your part can go a long way, and bring you wonderful benefits. The Bible says: ‘An offended friend is harder to win back than a fortified city. Arguments separate friends like a gate locked with bars. Wise words satisfy like a good meal; the right words bring satisfaction. The tongue can bring death or life…’ (Proverbs 18: 19–21 NLT) Remember: it depends on the first five minutes. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Sam 20:30-23:29, Matt 24:36-51, Ps 110, Prov 17:15-17 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67149&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...We walk by faith, not by sight.' 2 Corinthians 5:7 NKJV <br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150707.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>A blind man with a guide dog ‘walks by faith’ in his dog. He believes that what the dog sees will be translated into a signal that tells him when it’s time to go, stop, turn right or left. And he picks up on those signals by holding the harness that connects him with the dog. Why does he trust the dog? Because it has something he doesn’t have: sight. And it’s the same with you and God. Today it might be unclear where God is taking you. That’s why the blind man must hold the harness and stay con-nected to the dog. He may wonder, ‘Why am I stopping at this corner so long?’ Because there’s traffic coming and he’s being protected from unseen danger. God says, ‘I will bring the blind by a way they did not know…I will make darkness light before them, and crooked places straight. These things I will do for them, and not forsake them.’ (Isaiah 42:16 NKJV) God has your tomorrow already planned out, even though you haven’t been there yet. He works outside of time, so He’s not held back by the limitations we labour with. Paul writes, ‘I pray that your hearts will be flooded with light so that you can see something of the future He has called you to share…I pray that you will begin to understand how incredibly great His power is to help those who believe Him. It is the same mighty power that raised Christ from the dead and seated Him in the place of honour at God’s right hand…’ (Ephesians 1:18–20 TLB) </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Sam 24-26, Matt 25:1-13, Ps 122, Prov 17:18-21 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67150&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...We walk by faith, not by sight.' 2 Corinthians 5:7 NKJV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150708.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>When you decide to fly to a certain destination, these things all have to work together: (1) You must identify the right airline and flight schedule that will get you to your intended destination. (2) The plane must operate on a timetable that tells you when it’s leaving and when it’s arriving, and that the pilot has the route worked out in advance. (3) The airline has to set a price you can afford to pay. Then they put your name in a computer, and everything is ready to go. However, here’s what’s not going to happen when you arrive at the airport. You’re not going to ask them to explain how the plane works; what buttons the pilot plans to push and what the equipment will do when he or she pushes them. You’re not going to check on the route they plan to take, or ask how fast they plan to fly, or how high, or whether the pilot plans to fly by manual control or autopilot. You’re not going to argue about the price after you’ve already made your reservation and paid your fare. Why? Because you’re confident that the equipment is sound and the pilot is experienced; you know you’ll safely reach your destination. You say, ‘What if the plane goes down?’ If you’re a redeemed child of God, you go up! ‘…to depart, and to be with Christ …is far better.’ (Philippians 1:23 NKJV) Either way, you win. Basically, you put your trust in the plane, the pilot, and the airline. Today God is asking you to do the same with Him—no more and no less!</p><br /><br /> SoulFood: 1 Sam 27-31, Matt 25:14-30, Ps 137, Prov 17:22-23 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67151&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Glorify God in your body...' 1 Corinthians 6:20 NKJV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150709.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Here are seven principles for dealing with a weight problem: (1) Realise that your body is not your own. ‘…your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you…therefore glorify God in your body.’ (1 Corinthians 6:19–20 NKJV) Remind yourself that you’re the manager of a body God has entrusted you with, to do His will each day. (2) Keep a food journal to determine how much you’re eating, or not eating. Focus on eating foods that help your body, and avoid or minimise foods that hurt it. (3) Listen to the concerns of your loved ones. (4) Check your weight against the standard weight charts to see if you’re at a significant variation. It’s easier to lose five kilograms than twenty. (5) Instead of going on repeated diets, write down the kinds of food you will and won’t eat, and the portions. Yes, it will take time for your new discipline to take root and your will to strengthen. However, each day you do it, your self–control will increase until you start feeling so good about yourself that your old appetite begins to lose its grip on you. (6) Avoid fat–phobic people with a judgmental attitude toward those who are overweight. Often they’re just masking their own insecurities and reinforcing your distorted self–image. (7) Stay the course. You may have several ups and downs, but with determination and God’s help you’ll get on the road to freedom. ‘You need to persevere so that when you have done the will of God, you will receive what He has promised.’ (Hebrews 10:36 NIV) </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Eph 1:1-4:16, Matt 25:31-46, Ps 79, Prov 17:24-26 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67152&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Love covers a multitude of sins.' 1 Peter 4:8 NLT<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150710.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>A person’s sense of self–worth is often based on the reactions, positive or negative, of those around them. So your words and attitudes can literally build them up or tear them down. Dr Paul Brand was a flight surgeon during World War II. He tells in one of his books of a man named Peter Foster, a Royal Air Force pilot. Foster flew a Hurricane, a fighter plane with a design flaw: the single–propeller engine was mounted in the front, and the fuel lines ran past the cockpit. In a direct hit, the pilot would instantly be engulfed in flames before he could eject. The consequences were often tragic. Some RAF pilots caught in that inferno would undergo ten or twenty surgeries to reconstruct their faces. Peter Foster was one of those downed pilots whose face was burned beyond recognition. But Foster had the support of his family and the love of his fiancée. She assured him that nothing had changed except a few millimetres of skin. Two years later they were married. Foster said of his wife, ‘She became my mirror. She gave me a new image of myself. When I look at her, she gives me a warm, loving smile that tells me I’m ok.’ Your marriage, and other valued relationships in your life, ought to work that same way too—even when disfigurement has not occurred. It should be like a mutual admiration society that builds each other’s self–esteem, and overlooks flaws that could otherwise be destructive. There’s a Biblical word for this kind of commitment: it’s called love. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Eph 4:17-6:24, Matt 26:1-13, Ps 109:1-15, Prov 17:27-28 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67153&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.' 2 Timothy 1:7 NKJV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150711.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>No matter what others say about you, God says you have ‘a sound mind’! Many people live their lives believing that they’re intellectually inferior—born that way, and will always be that way. The problem with believing this is that you begin to live accordingly. Not because it’s true—but because you be-lieve it’s true! God created us so that whatever we really believe, we act on. So our self–concept becomes a self–fulfilling prophecy. For example, we may act stupidly because we believe we’re stupid, or we may act wisely because we believe we’re wise. So we must choose to believe God’s opinion of what we are, and by faith adapt our actions accordingly, until His opinion becomes our opinion! The Bible calls this ‘…the renewing of your mind…’ (Romans 12:2 NKJV) This calls for an attitude transformation, and it can begin with a few small steps. Step 1: Choose to believe what God says about you. Every outcome begins with a choice—an act of your will. No matter what your emotions say, choose to ‘…let God be true, but every man [and every contrary emotion] a liar…’ (Romans 3:4 NKJV) Whatever you’ve said about yourself previously, or whatever others have said, God says He has not given you an attitude of fear, ‘…but of power and of love and of a sound mind.’ He has ‘given’ it to you, but you must choose to believe and receive His gift of ‘…power, love and a sound mind.’ Memorise it, and meditate on it until it takes root in you. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Sam 1:1-3:21, Matt 26:14-25, Ps 109:16-31, Prov 18:1-3 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67154&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.' 2 Timothy 1:7 NKJV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150712.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Step 2: Start saying what God says about you in His Word. Words matter, especially when they’re God’s words! Look around you; everything in creation was first a word that was thought and spoken by God. ‘Then God said, “Let there be…And it was so.”’ (Genesis 1:14–15 NIV) His words contain the power of who He is. So when you believe and speak God’s Word, you’re connecting with His mighty creative ‘Logos’. Why is it necessary to speak God’s Word and not just think it? First, because hearing yourself speaking God’s Word is a powerful reinforcer. Second, because you remember what you recite. Third, because the enemy hears you. When Jesus spoke God’s Word to Satan in the wilderness temptation, he fled (Matthew 4:11). Step 3: Act on what God says about you. God has given you ‘a sound mind’—that means you’re a good thinker. Now, if you really believed that, what would you do that you’re not doing now? How big a step of faith would you be willing to take? God has given you the ability to ‘love’. If you really be-lieved that, how would you demonstrate your love for God and others? Would you begin or resume giving to your church? Would you forgive someone who has hurt you? Would you serve others instead of being self–absorbed? Nothing builds your faith like acting on God’s Word. Take these steps and it will change the way you believe about yourself and God’s Word. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Gen 14:18-20, Ps 110, Heb 5:5-11 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67155&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.' 2 Timothy 1:7 NKJV <br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150713.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>You say, ‘What is this “sound mind” that God says He has given us?’ The original Greek word means ‘sane, rational, logical, realistic, and reasonable’. It includes qualities such as: (1) Being self–controlled. It’s not con-trolled by anyone or anything outside itself—including people, circumstances, impulses, emotions, intellect, and especially not fear. It stays in control at all times. Even when faced by problems with no easy solutions, it remains anchored to the truth, as defined by God and His Word. (2) Being discerning. It distinguishes wisely between alternatives. It discerns between reality and fantasy, good and evil, effective and ineffective, worthwhile and worthless. It’s the faculty that enables us to make good decisions in difficult situations. (3) Being focused. Like a laser beam, it has the capacity to lock in on a desired target. Like a finely tuned receiver, it can minimise distortion and resist competing sound waves. It limits interference, uncertainty and confusion. Once it’s ‘set on task’, a sound mind will help you concentrate your energies on fulfilling the important priorities in your life. (4) Being orderly. It is a process–oriented mind, operating with cause/effect logic. It’s concerned with getting you from A to B—goal to realisation—by a series of orderly steps that contribute to the fulfilment of your purpose. You are ‘…fearfully and wonderfully made…’ (Psalm 139:14 NIV) The God whose mind created you is reflected in the mind He gave you to use. Knowing who you are, now go forward and experience ‘…life…more abundantly.’ (John 10:10 NKJV) </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Sam 3:22-7:17, Matt 26:26-35, Ps 118:1-9, Prov 18:4-6 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67156&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...They prosper in all they do.' Psalm 1:3 NLT<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150714.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>The first Psalm in the Bible talks about the dangers of getting the wrong counsel, listening to the wrong voices, and mixing with the wrong people. ‘Oh, the joys of those who do not follow the advice of the wicked, or stand around with sinners, or join in with mockers. But they delight in the law of the Lord, meditating on it day and night. They are like trees planted along the riverbank, bearing fruit each season. Their leaves never wither, and they prosper in all they do.’ (Psalm 1:1–3 NLT) Implicit in the word ‘prosper’ is stability, nourishment, productivity, strength, durability and success. So pick your friends carefully and prayerfully, because those closest to you can have the ability to make you or break you. Check out any advisor before he or she speaks into your life. Make sure they are: (1) people of integrity; (2) people of faith; (3) people with influence; (4) people with complementary gifts; (5) people who share your vision; (6) people who are loyal; (7) people who are creative. If you look for these seven qualities in those who advise you, there’s every chance you’ll succeed in what you’ve been called to do. Also be sure to get God’s input. ‘Whether you turn to the right or to the left, your ears will hear a voice behind you, saying, “This is the way; walk in it.”’ (Isaiah 30:21 NIV) Make sure the goals and plans you’ve set are in harmony with God’s will for you. Because if they’re not, having the best counsellors in the world won’t help you one bit.</p><br /><br /> SoulFood: 2 Sam 7:18-11:27, Matt 26:36-46, Ps 118:10-18, Prov 18:7-9 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67157&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Speak the truth in love...' Ephesians 4:15 NLT<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150715.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Even in a great relationship, you will have disagreements. That’s why you need to learn to fight fair. Paul addresses it this way: ‘…speak the truth in love, growing in every way more and more like Christ…’ If you grew up in a home filled with tension and angry words, you may find yourself trying to avoid arguments at any cost. But silence doesn’t solve problems; it just allows them to become unspoken wedges between you. What should you do? First, try to understand the difference between healthy and unhealthy conflict. In an unstable marriage, hostility is aimed at your spouse’s soft underbelly with comments like, ‘You never do anything right!’ and ‘Why did I marry you in the first place?’ and ‘You’re getting more like your mother every day!’ Such remarks strike at the very heart of your mate’s self–worth. Healthy conflict, by contrast, remains focused on the issues that cause disagreement. For example: ‘It upsets me when you don’t tell me you’re going to be late for dinner,’ or ‘I was embarrassed when you made me look foolish at the party last night.’ Can you hear the difference? Even though the two approaches may be equally contentious, the first assaults the dignity of your spouse while the second addresses the source of conflict. When you learn to make this important distinction, you can work through your disagreements without wounding and insulting each other. Plus, when gaining the upper hand leaves your spouse feeling wounded and upset, you both lose. Remember: when someone feels loved and valued, they’re generally more open and receptive to what you have to say.</p><br /><br /> SoulFood: 2 Sam 12:1-14:20, Matt 26:47-56, Ps 118:19-29, Prov 18:10-12 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67158&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['And being let go, they went to their own company...' Acts 4:23 KJV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150716.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>  We all have our ‘own company’. It’s where we feel most at home, where we naturally gravitate to when we have the choice. The great Bible teacher AW Tozer once said, ‘The important thing about a man is not where he goes when he is compelled to go, but where he goes when he is free to go where he will.’ The apostles went to jail under compulsion, but when they were given their liberty they chose to return to ‘…their own company…’ of praying believers. How revealing! The clear choices of life—not the compulsions—reveal our true character. Let’s consider a real–life illustration. You’re absent from church on Sunday. Where are you? If you’re having surgery, your absence reveals that you’re compelled to miss church due to hospitalisation. However, if you’re on the golf course, that tells us a different story. Assuming that you’re not on a well–deserved vacation, we know that you chose to skip church in favour of your ‘own company’—your fellow golfers. Has your choice to play instead of to pray become a habit? If so, you might be on the threshold of letting slip ‘…meeting together with other believers, which some people have got into the habit of doing…’ (Hebrews 10:25 CEB) Habits are not the product of one decision—they’re the result of repeated choices that eventually become automatic responses. How can you know your true spiritual condition? By the company you keep and the choices you make. When you’re free to go, where do you choose to go? Whose company do you prefer? </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Sam 14:21-17:13, Matt 26:57-75, Ps 123, Prov 18:13-16 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67159&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Enlarge my territory...' 1 Chronicles 4:10 NKJV <br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150717.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Think how foolish it is to pray for success, and resist the changes needed to bring it about. However, we do that, don’t we? Let’s face it; it’s easier to settle for the status quo than to face the ‘what ifs’ that accompany progress. Some of us even think it’s selfish and unspiritual to pray for success. Not Jabez! Listen to his prayer: ‘…Oh, that You would bless me indeed, and enlarge my territory, that Your hand would be with me, and that You would keep me from evil, that I may not cause pain!’ (1 Chronicles 4:10 NKJV) So God granted him what he requested. Consider this list of ‘changes’ you may be resisting: leaving an unfulfilling job, starting a business, or letting go of an unprofitable one, learning to use a computer, abandoning a toxic relationship, letting go of an unaffordable home, car or lifestyle, establishing a responsible spending plan. All these changes are normal; they’re part of daily life. However, panic sets in when the change is unexpected. That’s when we discover the difference between what we say and what we truly believe. ‘And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.’ (Romans 8:28 NKJV) The key words in this Scripture are ‘all things’ and ‘good’ and ‘purpose’. Since you are ‘in Christ’, nothing can get to you without first coming through Him. In ‘all things’, including things you don’t like, God has a ‘purpose’, and He’s working for your ‘good’. You’ll look back and say, ‘If I hadn’t gone through that, I wouldn’t be experiencing the blessing of God I enjoy today.’ </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Sam 17:14-19:43, Matt 27:1-10, Ps 133, Prov 18:17-20 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67160&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Go to the land that I will show you.' Genesis 12:1 NLT<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150718.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>  How would you feel if God told you to leave your job, sell your house and go to a city you didn’t know? That’s what happened to 75–year–old Abram and his 65–year–old wife, Sarai. ‘…Leave your native country…and go to the land that I will show you.’ Why would God do that? Because He has a special destiny in mind for each of us! He told Abram, ‘I will make you into a great nation. I will bless you…and you will be a blessing to others.’ (Genesis 12:2 NLT) With no hint of resistance, Abram embraced change, trusted God, and reaped the incredible rewards. It’s no wonder the Bible calls him the father of faith. To walk with God and fulfil His will you must have a mindset that adapts to change—sometimes costly and uncomfortable change. How do you do it? ‘By faith’! (Hebrews 11:8) Faith in whom? Yourself? Others? No. Faith in the goodness of God! Did you know that those who flow with change rather than resist it are less stressed, healthier, and generally happier? So start developing a ‘change mindset’. Break out of your rut and develop a new routine and if you’re serious about it, ask your friends and family to point out areas where you constantly demonstrate inflexibility. Where should you start? With this Scripture: ‘Casting the whole of your care [all your anxieties, all your worries, all your concerns, once and for all] on Him, for He cares for you affectionately and cares about you watchfully.’ (1 Peter 5:7 AMP) Live by the principle: ‘Where God guides, He provides.’ </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Sam 20:1-22:30, Matt 27:11-26, Ps 140, Prov 18:21-22 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67161&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Tell the children of Israel to go forward.' Exodus 14:15 NKJV <br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150719.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>With the Red Sea in front of them and Pharaoh’s chariots behind them, Moses told the Israelites: ‘Do not be afraid. Stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord, which He will accomplish for you today. For the Egyptians, whom you see today, you shall see again no more, forever. The Lord will fight for you, and you shall hold your peace. And the Lord said to Moses…“Tell the children of Israel to go forward.”’ (Exodus 14:13–15 NKJV) Notice, God told the people of Israel two things. First, that He would fight for them. Second, that they must go forward in spite of their fear. When you face the unknown it’s normal to feel fear, but that’s when you need to put your trust and confidence in God! In order for Him to fulfil His promise to you, you must obey what He has told you to do. How should you deal with change? In three ways: (1) Focus on its long–term benefits instead of its short–term inconvenience. (2) Be honest with yourself about what you really feel and fear about the change, and take it to God in prayer. (3) Keep an open attitude toward new ideas, and refuse to be influenced by rigid thinkers. Stand on this Scripture: ‘Enlarge the place of your tent, and let them stretch out the curtains of your dwellings; do not spare; lengthen your cords, and strengthen your stakes. For you shall expand to the right and to the left…’ (Isaiah 54:2–3 NKJV) God doesn’t change, but He moves! In order to succeed, you must move with Him.</p><br /><br /> SoulFood: Gen 5:22-24, Heb 11:5, 2 Kings 2:1-12 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67162&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I am the Lord your God, who teaches you to profit...' Isaiah 48:17 NKJV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150720.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>In case you’re wondering whether or not God wants you to succeed, the answer is a resounding ‘Yes!’ He told the Israelites, ‘I am the Lord your God, who teaches you to profit, who leads you by the way you should go.’ (Isaiah 48:17 NKJV) But you’ll only succeed if you know and do the right things. Only as the leader grows, will the company or ministry grow. It’s amazing how much time, money and energy we spend on things that can’t produce growth. Logos, websites, brochures and slogans are all important, but they’ll never make up for incompetent leadership. So what should you do? Once you know you’re walking in God’s will and your private life is in order, the keys to success are priorities and concentration. John Maxwell offers the following guidelines: (1) Focus 70% of your energy on developing your strengths. Effective leaders who reach their potential spend more time on what they do well than on what they do badly. (2) Focus 25% on new things. If you want to get better you have to keep changing and improving. That means stepping out into new areas. If you dedicate time to new things related to your strong areas, you’ll grow as a leader. (3) Focus 5% on areas of weakness. Nobody can entirely avoid working in their areas of weakness. (Note: we’re not talking here about sin or character weaknesses that must be dealt with.) The key is to delegate to gifted people the things that you’re not particularly good at. That way you’re free to concentrate in the areas of your God–given strengths. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Sam 22:31-24:25, Matt 27:27-32, Ps 146, Prov 18:23-24 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67163&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Be careful not to fall.' 1 Corinthians 10:12 CEV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150721.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Most people don’t plan on getting into an affair. They just happened to be with the wrong person, at the wrong time, in the wrong frame of mind. The Bible plainly warns, ‘Even if you think you can stand up to temptation, be careful not to fall.’ When you think, ‘It couldn’t happen to me,’ you’re a target for Satan! So how can you affair–proof your marriage? By consistent communication. (1) Communicate regularly with God. Jesus said, ‘…when you pray, [say]…Give us this day our daily bread’ (Matthew 6:7–11 NKJV). Daily communication with God arms you against marital mischief. He also knew you’d need to pray together. ‘Our Father…give us…forgive us our sins’ (Matthew 6:9–12 NLT) assumes we’re needy people praying together. Couples pray-ing together are harder to pry apart. (2) Communicate faithfully with God’s Word. Books about marriage can inform you, but only the Bible, God’s mar-riage manual, has the power to transform your life together. Shared Bible reading illuminates your understanding; it exposes, sensitises, and purifies your hearts’ intentions; it safeguards your relationship. (3) Communicate openly with each other. Build ‘relationship hedges’ so that temptation doesn’t get a foothold. Establish sensible guidelines for interacting with the opposite sex. Be open and honest with each other about your social, workplace and church relationships. Anything that makes your spouse uncomfortable should be noted, and, where possible changed. Next to God, you are each other’s best protection against failure. So, listen, learn, and love!</p><br /><br /> SoulFood: 2 Pet 1-3, Matt 27:33-44, Ps 14, Prov 19:1-4 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67164&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The law of the Lord is perfect...' Psalm 19:7 NKJV <br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150722.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Of all the words ever spoken, only ‘…the Word of God is alive and powerful.’ (Hebrews 4:12 NLT) So when you read your Bible, you tap into a life–changing force. Let’s look at some of the wonderful characteristics and effects attributed to God’s Word in Psalm 19. (1) ‘The law of the Lord is perfect…’ To understand the word ‘law’, think of governing forces by which things like gravity, aerodynamics and physics work. When you deny or defy these laws you suffer; when you operate according to them you succeed, but either way they are always in force! So is God’s Word. It cannot be improved upon, added to, or taken from. It is adequate and able to accomplish His purposes in your life. Additionally, it ‘refreshes the soul’! Why wouldn’t you embrace it? (2) ‘The statutes of the Lord are trustworthy…’ (Psalm 19:7 NIV) You can count on the reliability and accuracy of God’s Word in every circumstance of life. In a world of changing values, conditions and relationships, you can place your full weight on the Scriptures, confident they will hold up—and hold you up, too! Furthermore, it will ‘make wise the simple’—the ignorant and immature. It will produce in you wisdom far beyond what’s available through study and education. (3) ‘The precepts of the Lord are right…’ (Psalm 19:8 NIV) God’s precepts are accurate, correct and virtuous, and we are called to ‘…add to [our] faith virtue…’ (2 Peter 1:5 NKJV) or moral excellence. This cannot be accomplished through will–power, but through God’s supernatural Word–power. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Nah 1-3, Matt 27:45-56, Ps 65, Prov 19:5-8 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67165&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The commandments of the Lord are right....' Psalm 19:8 NIV <br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150723.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Observe: (1) ‘The commandments of the Lord are right…’ When people like Plato and Shakespeare speak, the effect of their words on us depends on what we bring to the process. Some of us may be informed and entertained, while others may be indifferent or bored. Their words could be described as intrinsically neutral but this is not so with God’s words: they radiate! Like heat and light, they are sources of spiritual energy. They possess a dynamic power that produces change wherever it goes. Likewise, God’s Word is dynamic. It radiates transforming power that changes anyone who lives in its ‘environment’! (2) ‘…The judgments given by the Lord are trustworthy…’ (Psalm 19:9 NET) The Hebrew word for ‘trustworthy’ comes from ‘certainty, honesty and faithfulness’. With absolute confidence, you can stake your all on the reliability of God’s Word. It guarantees you that God says what He means, and means what He says. You can stand secure on every syllable of it. In other words, you can ‘…live…by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.’ (Matthew 4:4 NKJV) (3) ‘By your teachings, Lord, I am warned; by obeying them, I am greatly rewarded.’ (Psalm 19:11 CEV) God’s Word is more than just a list of ‘dos and don’ts. It’s like radar that signals to you when you’re in danger of straying off course and getting into trouble. Your conscience alone is inadequate. ‘How can I know all the sins lurking in my heart? Cleanse me from these hidden faults…Don’t let them control me.’ (Psalm 19:12–13 NLT) By obeying God’s Word, you will be ‘greatly rewarded’! </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Hab 1-3, Matt 27:57-66, Ps 1, Prov 19: 9-11 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67166&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<p>The hardest offences to forgive are committed by the people who are closest to us. Why? Because we have to live with them every day! When we’re young, our emotions are so intense that wounds and injuries may stay with us for a lifetime. The pain is worse when the one who wronged us was a parent. Perhaps a mother rejected us instead of providing the love we needed, or a father was similarly absent when he was needed most. Victims of such horror may still be consumed with resentment and anger many decades later. This can cause you to ‘act out’, and hurt the people you now love and need most. What’s the answer? Forgiveness. Dr. Archibald Hart defines forgiveness as ‘giving up my right to hurt you for hurting me.’ Only when you find the emotional maturity to release those who’ve wronged you, whether they have repented or not, will your wounds begin to heal. Jesus put it this way: ‘When you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive them, so that your Father in Heaven may forgive you your sins.’ (Mark 11:25 NIV) Here’s something you may not have considered: God’s willingness to forgive you depends on your willingness to forgive others. You say, ‘But if I forgive them, I’m letting them off the hook.’ No, you’re letting yourself off the hook! You’re setting yourself free of pain and resentment, and positioning yourself to walk in God’s blessing. Leave the offence and the offender with God; He’s the only one who understands what they did and why they did it. As far as you are concerned—forgiveness begins the healing process.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Children are a gift from the Lord...' Psalm 127:3 CEB<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150726.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Here are two myths of parenting: (1) Good parents always keep tidy homes. We think our house should look picture–perfect, so we get upset when our children turn it upside down. However, an obsession with neatness can result in missing precious moments that never come again. Unintentionally, we teach our children that things—not people—are important. We instil the idea that keeping up appearances matters more than enjoying life together. The truth is, the house will be orderly sooner than you think, and quiet, and empty! So enjoy the disarray, the laughter, the spills and scrapes. Let the nicks and scratches on the furniture become memories of precious moments with little people who’ll grow up feeling loved and important to you. (2) Good parents must always be ‘right’. Writer and mother Ann Peterson shares an insight that struck while she was engaged in a run–in with her son. ‘Finally, through clenched teeth I managed to ask him, “Why must you always be right?” He responded through clenched teeth (must have learned that from his father), “Because you always have to be right.” I sensed God watching that moment. Words were unnecessary. I got the message loud and clear. From that moment on, being “right” lacked the lustre it once held for me.’ The relationship with her son became less resistant, ‘Something I’d have missed, had I not conceded the need to be always right.’ So choose your battles carefully! Good parenting isn’t about racking up ‘victories’ and dishing out ‘defeats’; it’s about enjoying your family. </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Num 9:15-23, Exodus 24:15, Matt 17:1-8 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67169&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them...' Psalms 127:5 NIV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150727.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Here are another two parenting myths. (1) Good parents always produce good children. If only that were so, but it’s not! Even when you do all the right things, your children get to make their own choices in life. Cain and Abel were raised in the same home by the same parents, but Abel’s choice pleased God while Cain’s led him to commit the first recorded murder. Even model parents have no control over the choices their children ultimately make. This doesn’t mean your attempts to be a godly influence on them are wasted; not at all! It just means that when you’ve done your best you should: (a) recognise and accept your limits; (b) teach your children wisdom, allowing them to be responsible for the consequences of their decisions; (c) trust God to do what you cannot do. Some kids get the message quickly, others like the Prodigal Son take detours—but God never gives up on them—and neither should you. (2) Good parents treat all their children the same way. The Bible says, ‘Teach your children to choose the right path…’ (Proverbs 22:6 NLT) Every child is wired with a unique set of needs and abilities, and wise parents recognise and work with these characteristics. Your responsibility isn’t to try to make them the ‘perfect kid’. It’s to try to discover the distinctive pattern God built into each child, and work to develop that pattern in them. The reward God promises such parents is ‘…when they are older [detours notwithstanding!] they will remain upon it.’ (Proverbs 22:6 NLT) </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Zeph 1-3, Mark 1:1-8, Ps 46, Prov 19:18-20 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67170&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go...' Psalm 32:8 NIV <br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150728.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>You can know God’s will for your life. He promises, ‘I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go.’ (Psalm 32:8 NIV) His Word says, ‘In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths.’ (Proverbs 3:6 NKJV) God wants you to move from guesswork to guidance, but getting there requires four things: (1) Knowing that God’s will begins with surrendering your will. Jesus said, ‘I do not seek My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.’ (John 5:30 NAS) You only recognise God’s will as you learn to lay aside your own will, and that gets easier with practice. (2) Keeping a spiritual mindset. It’s not possible to sense God’s will while you’re controlled by self–interest. ‘The mind governed by the flesh is hostile to God. It does not submit to God’s law, nor can it do so.’ (Romans 8:7 NIV) (3) Praying for God’s guidance. David prayed, ‘Teach me to do Your will, for You are my God; may Your good Spirit lead me…’ (Psalm 143:10 NIV) James also en-courages us: ‘If you need wisdom, ask our generous God, and He will give it to you. He will not rebuke you for asking.’ (James 1:5 NLT) (4) Reading God’s Word with a heart that’s open to hear from Him. ‘Your word is a lamp that gives light wherever I walk.’ (Psalm 119:105 CEV) Daily exposure to the Word of God will help you recognise His voice when He speaks to you. ‘…the sheep follow Him: for they know His voice.’ (John 10:4 NKJV) </p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezra 1-2, Mark 1:9-20, Ps 78:1-8, Prov 19:21-23 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=67171&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...God, who began the good work within you, will continue...until it is finally finished...' Philippians 1:6 NLT<br /><br /><p>When Paul wrote to the Philippian believers, he told them God was at work in each of them. What an awesome truth! He wrote: ‘<em>I pray that your love will overflow more and more, and that you will keep on growing in knowledge and understanding. For I want you to understand what really matters, so that you may live pure and blameless lives until the day of Christ’s return. May you always be filled with the fruit of your salvation—the righteous character produced in your life by Jesus Christ—for this will bring much glory and praise to God</em>.’ (Philippians 1:9–11 NLT) You say, ‘That’s a tall order!’ Yes, and you’ll never accomplish it through willpower, good intentions or self–effort. You must seek God for direction, submit to Him in all things, and draw strength from Him. Trying to do for yourself what only God can do is like trying to pick yourself up by your own bootstraps; it doesn’t work. You must entrust to God the job of equipping you for the work He’s called you to do. Yes, you need to do your part, but don’t try to do God’s part! ‘…<em>We all…beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory [degree by degree]…by the Spirit of the Lord</em>.’ (2 Corinthians 3:18 NKJV) What is it that changes us? ‘<em>The Spirit of the Lord</em>.’ He takes the pressure off, and relieves us of the stress and anxiety we so often feel when we try to ‘change’ ourselves.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Ki 12-13, Luke 12:1-12, Ps 58, Prov 6:12-15<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65417&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I can do all things through Him [Christ] who strengthens me.' Philippians 4:13 ESV<br /><br /><p>There’s a spiritual disease you need to be inoculated against—hardening of the attitudes. It’s a disease that makes you think your opinion is the only right one. And as long as life cooperates with you, you’re fine, but when it doesn’t, you charge ahead from one brick wall into another, bruised and bloodied, until you quit in frustration. Then you start blaming others, life, the devil, or God. Your faith may be well–intentioned, but faith without flexibility is just setting yourself up for failure! Experienced kayakers know how to perform the ‘Eskimo roll’. It’s a technique that enables you to roll 360 degrees under the water and up again without drowning. It’s the strategy Paul used to overcome the challenges he faced in life. ‘…<em>I have learned the secret of living in every situation…</em>’ (Philippians 4:12 NLT) He didn’t acquire it naturally, or learn it at a ‘flexibility seminar’ or get it from a guru. He learned it in the rough–and–tumble school of patience, persistence, humility, self–denial, dedication and confidence in God. As a result he rolled with the punches of persecution, hunger, poverty and prison, never abdicating, while demonstrating how to ‘<em>rejoice in the Lord always</em>…’ (Philippians 4:4 NIV) When faith collides with reality, it flexes and holds on until victory emerges. It’s like a tree that bends in the storm, then bounces back. ‘<em>I have learned…I am ready for anything through…the One who lives within me!</em>’ (Philippians 4:12–14 PHPS) So learn to roll with the punches!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Ki 10-11, Luke 11:45-54, Ps 53, Prov 6:9-11<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65416&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...God is working in you, giving you the desire and the power to do what pleases Him.' Philippians 2:13 NLT<br /><br /><p>The Bible says: ‘…<em>It is God Who is all the while effectually at work in you [energising and creating in you the power and desire], both to will and to work for His good pleasure…satisfaction and delight.</em>’ (Philippians 2:13 AMP) We have a tendency to allow 101 different things to crowd God out of our lives, so He creates within us the desire to do His will. When you desire to read your Bible, it’s God urging you to do it. When you desire to pray, it’s God moving you to do it. When you desire to give, it’s God motivating you to do it. Jesus said: ‘…<em>I am the Vine; you are the branches. Those who remain in Me, and I in them, will produce much fruit. For apart from Me you can do nothing…If you remain in Me and My words remain in you, you may ask for anything you want, and it will be granted!</em>’ (John 15:5–7 NLT) Note the word ‘dwell’; it means to live in and take up residence. So as you live in close relationship with Christ, the desires conceived within you are desires He can fulfil. When you sense that God has put certain desires in your heart, it’s important to pray and ask for those things. If you’re not sure whether or not they’re from Him, pray: ‘Lord, I have desires in my heart that may be from you. If they are, please fulfill them, but if not I can be happy without them, because I am happy with You. Lord, I trust you.’ Always measure your desires by God’s Word so you continue abiding in the Vine. Have you reached that place in your relationship with God yet?</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Ki 14-15, Luke 12:13-21, Ps 61, Prov 6:16-19<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65418&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I press on...to win the prize...' Philippians 3:14 NIV<br /><br /><p>The poorest person in the world isn’t the one without money, but the one without a God–given vision. Vision requires faith—and focus. Unless you understand what’s worth fighting for, you risk: (1) <em>Fighting the wrong battles</em>. (2) <em>Fighting at the wrong time</em>. (3) <em>Fighting when you shouldn’t be involved</em>. (4) <em>Fighting because you need to win in order to feel good about yourself</em>. (5) <em>Fighting even though the battle is already lost but your pride won’t let you accept it</em>. The most important thing is: stay focused on the goal God has given you. If Satan can’t defeat you outright, he’ll try to distract you with unimportant things, or disqualify you by getting you to make bad decisions. Either way, he wins and you lose. Just because something is good doesn’t mean it’s right for you. When your plate is full doing what God’s already given you to do, learn to say ‘no’ to everything else. Once you can do that, you free yourself from other people’s expectations and the need for their approval. Bear in mind also that ‘no’ doesn’t mean ‘never’; often it means ‘not now’. When you’re spread too thinly, you become mediocre at everything and effective at nothing. When you try to fight on every front, you wear yourself out and fail to win where it counts. Fighting a battle without gaining ground is like pouring buckets of water on a burning shack—unless somebody’s life is in danger it’s probably not worth it. So conserve your energy for when you have something really important at stake.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Ki 16:1-18:15, Luke 12:22-34, Ps 66:1-12, Prov 6:20-22<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65419&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...It was my closest friend, the one I trusted most.' Psalm 55:13 CEV <br /><br /><p>No dagger strikes as deeply as the thrust of betrayal. Maybe you identify with David’s story of treachery. It’s the cry of a wounded heart, a desperate prayer for relief. He’s overwhelmed and shaken to the core. If it had been an enemy ‘…<em>then I could bear it</em>…’ (Psalm 55:12 NKJV) But it was <em>‘my closest friend, the one I trusted most. We enjoyed being together, and we went…to your house, our God.</em>’ (Psalm 55:13–14 CEV) It was a bitter pill to swallow—his best mate, the last one he’d ever suspect, the person he trusted with his deepest secrets, a brother in the faith and fellow worshipper! No wonder his heart was broken. He was in a life–threatening position because of a covenant–breaking friend. ‘<em>As for my companion, he betrayed his friends; he broke his promises. His words are as smooth as butter, but in his heart is war. His words are as soothing as lotion, but underneath are daggers!</em>’ (Psalm 55:20–21 NLT) How does David get beyond his grief? By doing these three things: (1) <em>He acknowledges it.</em> He verbalises the emotions he’s experiencing. (2) <em>He talks to God about it</em>. Instead of faking pseudo–courage, he shares his anguish with God. ‘<em>Morning, noon, and night my complaints and groans go up to Him, and He will hear my voice</em>.’ (Psalm 55:17 GNT) (3) <em>He turns his situation over to God</em>. ‘<em>Leave your troubles with the Lord, and He will defend you</em>…’ (Psalm 55:22 NLT) Today, do those three things and you’ll get back on track again.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ruth 1:3-18, John 6:41-69 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65421&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['God...will hear me and humble them.' Psalm 55:19 NLT<br /><br /><p>David took the high road. Rather than talking to others about his wounded heart, he aired his grief and disappointment to God by scheduling three times of prayer each day (Psalm 55:17). During these conversations with his heavenly Father, David made the choice to transfer the responsibility of healing his heart to the Lord. Surrounded by enemies and in mortal danger, he knew God would humble his enemies and guarantee his safety. When you take the low road—following raw emotion instead of renewing your mind with God’s Word (Romans 12:2)—your path will be filled with wreckage and regrets. Here’s what will happen: (1) <em>You’ll inhibit your capacity for faith</em>. The more you rehearse your hurts, the more your faith is depleted. (2) <em>You’ll destroy your ability to work with others</em>. Suspicion and distrust will rob you of a healthy rapport with others. (3) <em>You’ll be unable to receive help from others</em>. Trusting nobody but yourself makes you sceptical, even paranoid, when others attempt to assist you. (4) <em>You’ll be set up for loneliness</em>. Others who want to befriend you will pick up on your defensiveness and avoid you. And worst of all, your loneliness will be self–inflicted. (5) <em>You’ll hinder your own healing</em>. A life devoid of genuine relationships will prevent your wounded heart from healing. (6) <em>You’ll remain trapped in the past</em>. Unless you’re moving forward, the past will pull you under and hold you captive. Handling betrayal God’s way is the only path to relief and restoration.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Ki 18:16-20:43, Luke 12:35-48, Ps 66:13-20, Prov 6:23-25<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65422&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...[Abram] believed in (trusted in, relied on, remained steadfast to) the Lord...' Genesis 15:6 AMP<br /><br /><p>Abraham came from a land of idol worshippers. He was the first in his family to serve the true God. To do it he had to overcome his background, his training and the opinions of those around him. In obedience to a God he didn’t fully know, he had to leave the security of home and head for a destination he couldn’t describe to anyone. Did he have flaws and weaknesses? Certainly—find someone who hasn’t. Did he make mistakes? Yes, big ones! But it’s mind–blowing what God will do for and through a man or woman who’ll ‘<em>trust in, rely on and remain steadfast [to Him].</em>’ One word sums up how Abraham served God: ‘wholeheartedly’. God made a covenant with Abraham promising him personal blessings, ancestral inheritance and that through him all the nations of the earth would be blessed; the number 1 blessing to the nations is Jesus the Messiah (Genesis 22:18). And Abraham’s blessings are promised to you when you accept Jesus as your Lord and Saviour (Galatians 3:14). Tracking Abraham would have been easy because everywhere he went, he built an altar to God. There are several recorded in Scripture, the most famous being the one on which he laid his son Isaac (Genesis 22). There was nothing and no one Abraham loved more than God. And what God did for Abraham, He will do for you if you’ll serve Him wholeheartedly. He will cause people to look at you and say, ‘<em>That man, that woman, serves a God who really cares about them; nobody else could make those things happen in their life.</em>’ The blessing of God is what you get in exchange for wholehearted devotion. When you think about it, it’s a small price to pay.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Ki 21-22, Luke 12:49-59, Ps 70, Prov 6:26-28<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65423&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...It is more blessed to give than to receive.' Acts 20:35 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Are you a taker or a giver? If you’re not sure how to answer that question, think about certain TV personalities. Even though they have genuine talent, their main motivations are ratings, image, approval and profits. Check their background. Chances are that the little girl who dressed up like Cinderella and insisted, ‘Look at me,’ now lives and performs for the approval of the crowd. Or the little boy who beat his chest to attract attention and shouted, ‘I’m Tarzan,’ now goes around with a sense of entitlement. John writes about a man, Diotrephes, ‘<em>who loves to have the pre–eminence…</em>’ (3 John 1:9 NKJV) Leadership coach Dan Reiland observes: ‘If communicators teach out of need, insecurity, ego, or even responsibility, they’re not giving. The needy person wants praise, something the audience must give. The insecure person wants approval and acceptance, something the audience must give. The egotistical person wants to be lifted up, to be superior and just a little bit better than everyone else, something the audience must give. Even the person motivated by responsibility wants to be recognised as the faithful worker, to be seen as responsible—something the audience must bestow upon them. Many communicators teach in one of these modes all the time and aren’t aware of it. Then there’s the giver. This person teaches out of love, grace, gratitude, compassion, passion, and the overflow. These are all giving modes. In each of these modes of the heart the audience doesn’t have to give anything—only receive. The teaching then becomes a gift. It fills and renews.’ Today, ask God to help you become a giver and not a taker.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Rev 1-4, Luke 13:1-17, Ps 77, Prov 6: 29<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65424&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...It is more blessed to give than to receive.' Acts 20:35 NKJV<br /><br /><p>When the Good Samaritan saw the wounded man the priest and the Levite had already ‘<em>passed by</em>’, he took the initiative and went out of his way to help him. Jesus ended His parable by saying, ‘…<em>Go and do likewise</em>.’ (Luke 10:37 NKJV) Sam Walton, the founder of Wal–Mart, taught all his employees ‘The 10–Foot Rule’. It says, ‘I promise that whenever I come within 10 feet of a customer I will look them in the eye, greet them and ask if I can help them.’ As a result, stores worldwide implement Sam’s rule every day. Most of us recognise the value of taking the initiative. We acknowledge its importance in relationships, yet we still don’t do it. We wait for the other person to make the first move. But all that does is lead to missed opportunities. Pastor Malcolm Bane observed, ‘If you wait until you can do everything for everybody, instead of something for somebody, you’ll end up not doing anything for anybody.’ If you’re serious about helping others, and you want to walk in God’s blessing, don’t wait—initiate! The ‘perfect moment’ seldom arrives. An old Jewish proverb says, ‘The wise do at once what the fool does at last.’ Initiating a conversation often feels awkward. Offering help means risking rejection. Giving to others can lead to misunderstanding. You won’t feel ready or comfortable in such moments; you just have to learn to get past those feelings of awkwardness and insecurity. To help people, you must go ahead and do what others never quite get around to. So right now take the initiative. Go out on a limb—that’s where the fruit is.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Rev 5-9, Luke 13:18-35, Ps 136:1-12, Prov 6:30-31<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65425&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He...often withdrew...and prayed.' Luke 5:16 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Prayer is foundational to your individual Christian life, and also to the life and ministry of your church. Like a foundation that secures a building, prayer gives you something trustworthy on which to rest. No wonder Satan works overtime to keep you busy and distracted so that you lose regular in–depth communication with your heavenly Father. But there’s one person against whom Satan couldn’t make headway, when it came to trying to disrupt His prayer life: Jesus. And He’s the great example of what your prayer life should be. He began and ended His public ministry in prayer. In Mark chapter one, on one of the busiest days of His life, we see Jesus getting up before daylight to pray. Luke writes, ‘<em>He…often withdrew…and prayed</em>.’ It was His regular daily habit! In the Garden of Gethsemane He prayed with an intensity none of us will ever know. No wonder the disciples asked Him to teach them how to pray. Just how important is prayer? Ask Peter. It was the prayers of Christ that kept him from being destroyed completely when he denied his Lord; they salvaged him, and eventually promoted him to leadership in the church. And the only reason you don’t fail more often is because Jesus is praying for you, too (John 17:20; Hebrews 7:25). The application is pretty obvious: if Jesus needed to pray—so do you. Furthermore, if you’re waiting until you feel like it, or for the Spirit to move you to pray, you’re missing something. The Holy Spirit has already moved you to pray—through the instruction and example Christ left you.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Rev 10-14, Luke 14:1-14, Ps 136:13-26, Prov 6:32-35<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65426&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I want men everywhere to lift up holy hands in prayer.' 1 Timothy 2:8 NIV <br /><br /><p>In training Timothy for the ministry, Paul wanted him to understand how the church works. So he began with the important stuff like prayer. In essence, Paul was saying, ‘Before you do anything else, pray. Before you teach anything else, teach your people to pray.’ Why? Because if you’re not aligned with the things of God, you won’t succeed! Most of us understand this intellectually. We say a quick prayer as we’re running out of the door. We say grace before a meal. We open our church services with prayer. But few of us grasp the real importance of prayer, and Paul didn’t want Timothy to be misled or misinformed about the place of prayer in the church. We dare not fool ourselves into thinking we can ‘make things happen’ without prayer. If a church isn’t a praying church, it doesn’t matter how well the pastor preaches or the choir sings, or how nice the building is. For it to succeed, Jesus said, ‘…<em>My house shall be a house of prayer…</em>’ (Luke 19:46 NAS) Oswald Chambers said, ‘We look upon prayer as a means of getting things for ourselves: the Bible’s idea of prayer is that we may get to know God Himself.’ You aren’t coming to church just to hear a lively sermon or a good song, you’re coming to meet with God. The pastor and the choir are vehicles through which He can speak, but there’s no substitute for prayer. It’s not merely a nice sentiment; your spiritual growth and survival depend on it. So if you’ve got out of the habit of praying—right now get back into it!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Rev 15-18, Luke 14:15-24, Ps 106:1-23, Prov 7:1-2<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65427&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Men always ought to pray and not lose heart.' Luke 18:1 NKJV<br /><br /><p>If someone threatened your home or community, wouldn’t you defend them? They are under attack, but the enemy’s invisible. And Paul says the lion’s share of responsibility for stopping these attacks belongs to Christian men. ‘<em>I want men everywhere to…[pray]</em>.’ (1 Timothy 2:8 NIV) Here the word ‘men’ isn’t the generic term for the human race or mankind; it’s specific to ‘males’. Now, we’re not saying only men are supposed to pray. Every Christian must. Nor are we saying prayer is the only thing to do. But it’s the first thing to do! John Bunyan said, ‘You can do more than pray after you’ve prayed, but you can’t do more than pray until you’ve prayed.’ James said, ‘…<em>The effective prayer of a righteous man can accomplish much</em>.’ (James 5:16 NAS) Note the word ‘righteous’. Every believer is clothed with the righteousness of Christ, which means you’re in right standing before God. There are two kinds of righteousness: positional and practical. There’s righteousness you need to practise daily as you allow the Holy Spirit to cleanse, fill and use you. Just like you don’t want to drink from a dirty cup, God doesn’t want to hear the prayers of a Christian whose life is fouled up with junk. The prayer God answers: (1) <em>is offered by a clean heart</em>; (2) <em>has a seriousness and intensity that shows you’re not just throwing out a few wishes to see which ones God might pick up on</em>; (3) <em>lines up with God’s Word and purposes</em>; (4) <em>comes from an undivided heart</em>, because a double–minded man receives nothing from the Lord. (James 1:6–8).</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Sam 21:1-6, Hosea 6:4-6, Matt 12:1-14<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65428&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Word became flesh and dwelt among us...' John 1:14 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Throughout the Old Testament God routinely spoke to people. In these 39 books He gave them instructions and promises with conditions. Some people understood what He was saying, others didn’t. Some tried to live by it with varying degrees of success, while others rejected it and decided to do their own thing. Then God did something truly incredible: ‘<em>And the Word became flesh and lived among us, and we have seen His glory, the glory as of the Father’s only son, full of grace and truth</em>.’ (John 1:14 NRS) Jesus was a living Bible! John tells us, ‘…<em>The Word was God</em>’ (John 1:1 NKJV), so the more you get into the Word and get it into you, the more of God you’re depositing within you. You say, ‘But sometimes I don’t get much out of reading the Bible.’ A word to the wise: when you start studying the Bible, don’t do it to find some new truth nobody else has ever seen. Do it with the attitude, ‘Lord, what are You saying to me?’ The problem most of us have isn’t interpreting the difficult passages; it’s obeying the ones we already understand! The Word of God provides you with two things: (1) <em>Protection</em>. The Psalmist said, ‘<em>Unless Your law had been my delight, I would then have perished in my affliction. I will never forget Your precepts, for by them You have given me life</em>.’ (Psalm 119:92–93 NKJV). (2) <em>Direction</em>. ‘<em>Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path</em>.’ (Psalm 119:105 NKJV) Do you need direction? Do you need protection? Get into God’s Word.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Rev 19-22, Luke 14:25-35, Ps 106:24-48, Prov 7:3-5<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65429&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I will lead them...' Isaiah 42:16 NKJV <br /><br /><p>Another goal of your daily devotions should be: guidance. Without God’s input you’re at the mercy of your own best thinking—and that should concern you greatly! The Psalmist wrote, <em>‘Show me Your ways…teach me Your paths; guide me in Your truth and teach me, for You are God my Saviour, and my hope is in You all day long</em>.’ (Psalm 25:4–5 NIV) God said through the prophet Isaiah: ‘<em>I will bring the blind by a way they did not know; I will lead them in paths they have not known. I will make darkness light before them, and crooked places straight. These things I will do for them, and not forsake them</em>.’ (Isaiah 42:16 NKJV) The path you take determines your destination, so before you decide to go in a given direction, talk to God. And don’t be surprised when He takes you down a road ‘you have not known’. You must trust that God knows what He’s doing. Blaise Pascal said, ‘All of man’s troubles stem from his inability to sit quietly in a room alone.’ In this fast–paced age you must take time to slow down, collect your thoughts, evaluate what’s happening around you, and get direction from the One who knows the end from the beginning (Isaiah 46:10). Jesus told His disciples to ‘come apart’ in order to be rejuvenated physically and spiritually (Mark 6:31). The Bible says, ‘…<em>When they were alone, He explained all things to His disciples</em>.’ (Mark 4:34 NKJV) There are certain things God will explain to you only when you take the time to be alone with Him.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Ki 4:18-6:33, Luke 15:11-32, Ps 27, Prov 7:10-20<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65451&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Your servant, who is devoted...to...You.' Psalm 119:38 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The word ‘devotion’ implies total commitment to someone—giving them your time and attention, enjoying their company, seeking to please them, and making them a priority in your life. And that should be the goal of your daily devotions. But here are two pitfalls to look out for and avoid: (1) ‘<em>Me–itis</em>’. God has promised to bless you, but when you seek His blessing instead of pursuing a relationship with Him, you become me–centred rather than Christ–centred. The truth is you can pray until you’re blue in the face but God won’t give you certain things, if you’re not mature enough to handle them. More than anything in life, Abraham wanted a son. And God gave him one. Yet when God asked him to offer his son as a sacrifice, he didn’t hesitate. Abraham proved there was nothing he loved more than God, therefore God promised to bless him and multiply all that he possessed (Genesis 22:17). Abraham became one of the most successful men of his generation, but his real claim to fame was that God referred to him as a ‘friend’ (Isaiah 41:8). (2) <em>Being too busy</em>. One of the dangers in working for God is that you can fail to spend time worshipping Him. The Psalmist said, ‘<em>Ascribe to the Lord the glory due His name…</em>’ (Psalm 29:2 NIV) The word ‘due’ means ‘deserving of’. When John saw the multitudes in Heaven praising God, they were singing, ‘<em>You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honour and power</em>…’ (Revelation 4:11 NIV) So start your daily devotions in praise by saying: ‘Lord, I’m here because You deserve to be worshipped and adored.’</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Ki 1:1-4:17, Luke 15:1-10, Ps 112, Prov 7:6-9<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65430&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Search me, O God, and know my heart...' Psalm 139:23 NIV<br /><br /><p>Here are two more reasons why spending time alone with God each day is important: (1) <em>To take spiritual inventory of your life</em>. David prayed, ‘<em>Search me, O God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts. See if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting</em>.’ (Psalm 139:23–24 NIV) Note the words ‘anxious thoughts’ and ‘offensive way’. These are things you start to take stock of when you are in God’s presence. For example, are you growing daily in your spiritual walk? Are you allowing unconfessed sins to pile up in your life? How about your attitudes? In order to see yourself from God’s point of view, you have to face these questions in His presence and answer them honestly. (2) <em>To commit each day to the Lord</em>. The writer of Proverbs said, ‘<em>Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight</em>.’ (Proverbs 3:5–6 ESV) Share your schedule with God, ask Him to guide you in your daily activities and alter them as needed. Ask Him to help you manage your time better so you can get more done (Psalm 90:12). Ask Him to help you distinguish between what’s truly important and what isn’t (1 Corinthians 10:23). Every day of your life you’ll have to deal with two things: problems and opportunities. And God will give you the right perspective and approach to handle both. You’ll be amazed how much more effective and efficient you are when you’ve spent time with Him.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Ki 7-9, Luke 16:1-18, Ps 135, Prov 7:21-23<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65431&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...You will fill me with joy in Your presence...' Psalm 16:11 NIV <br /><br /><p>To build and maintain intimacy in a relationship you must schedule time with the other person, otherwise it won’t happen. There’s a reason the Bible likens your relationship with Christ to that of a bride and groom. For a marriage to be strong, two people must pay attention to one another. And that happens only when they’re willing to set aside things like work, financial concerns, and even children. Likewise, your devotional life should involve simply enjoying the presence of the Lord. The Psalmist puts it this way: ‘<em>You will fill me with joy in Your presence</em>.’ And: ‘<em>Delight yourself…in the Lord, and He shall give you the desires of your heart</em>.’ (Psalm 37:4 NKJV) ‘<em>As the deer pants for the water brooks, so pants my soul for You, O God</em>.’ (Psalm 42:1 NKJV) ‘…<em>You are my God; early will I seek You; my soul thirsts for You; my flesh longs for You in a dry and thirsty land where there is no water</em>.’ (Psalms 63:1 NKJV) Many of us lead unhappy lives because we never spend time in God’s presence. Do you know the Lord, or do you merely know about Him? ‘Knowing Christ’ was Paul’s number–one priority: ‘<em>But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ... For His sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ and be found in Him…having a righteousness of my own that comes from…faith in Christ</em>.’ (Philippians 3:7–9 ESV) Have you reached the place where you can say that too?</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Ki 10-12, Luke 16:19-31, Ps 24, Prov 7:24-25<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65432&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Four men arrived carrying a paralysed man on a mat.' Mark 2:3 NLT<br /><br /><p>One day when Jesus was preaching at a house in Capernaum, ‘<em>four men arrived carrying a paralysed man on a mat</em>.’ This man wanted to move but he couldn’t. And spiritual paralysis works that way too. Inside, you know you have what it takes to succeed, but your spirit isn’t responding. What’s going on? Unremitting stress creates pressure that eventually turns to frustration, and constant frustration produces weariness. You feel bland. Nothing excites you. One day feels like the next, until you start believing that nothing will ever go right for you. It doesn’t matter whether you live in a mansion or a mud hut; unless you’re free in your spirit, it’s like living in a prison. There are different kinds of spiritual paralysis. There’s the kind that leaves you with out–of–control emotions. You can’t hold on to what you need, like a job or a relationship. You know something’s wrong but you can’t seem to make it right. Another type of spiritual paralysis stems from mental, emotional, and physical exhaustion. When people are continually drawing from you, eventually you run dry. It’s impossible to be an encouragement to others without refilling your own well at the Source. Refuse to spend another day in a paralysed, out–of–control, exhausted state. Like the man in today’s story, you’ll find your answer in Jesus. He gives joy, freedom and purpose to life; He says He will ‘<em>refresh the weary and satisfy the faint.</em>’ (Jeremiah 31:25 NIV) But you have a part to play as well: to ‘…<em>build [yourself] up in your most holy faith, and pray in the Holy Spirit. Keep [yourself] in God’s love</em>.’ (Jude 1: 20–21 NIV)</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Ki 13-15, Luke 17:1-19, Ps 26, Prov 7:26-27<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65433&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...A man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife...' Matthew 19:5 NIV<br /><br /><p>Don’t make your children feel guilty about growing up! They were born to fly. If they can’t, what does that say about you as a parent? It was God who first came up with the idea of children leaving home. So when your role changes, don’t lose your perspective and give in to resentment and self–pity. Learn to move gracefully from owner to coach. That’s how God intends life to work. Your children are supposed to have what it takes to succeed on their own. The question is, do you? Don’t attack the people who are now part of your grown child’s life. It’s easy to become judgmental when you’re no longer in control. Don’t do it! Nobody is attracted to a critic; you’ll just push your kids away. Don’t lose your head; you’ve too much invested in the relationship. Whether you’re upset because you’ve given so much and seem to be getting so little in return, or you genuinely don’t approve of their choices, prayer is a better option than bickering. Talk to God about it. He can change what you can’t! Your children would be ill–equipped for life if they’d grown up physically without developing their own opinions and uniqueness. As a parent you’re entitled to your thoughts and feelings, but once you’ve expressed them, respect their choices and support them the best you can. Don’t let the devil rob you of your most precious investments. The best thing you can do is love your child, pray for them, and ‘be there’ when they need you.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Sam 5:1-6:16, Rev 11:15-19<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65434&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Teach me to do Your will...' Psalm 143:10 NKJV<br /><br /><p>In considering God’s will for your life, let’s begin with: what you pretend to be. When you know you’re doing His will, you can drop the mask. You don’t have to convince people you’re important while secretly fearing you’re not. Nothing is more boring or disconcerting than someone who ‘name–drops’ in order to make an impression. A newly–promoted lieutenant was eager to impress his underlings, so when a young private walked into his office the lieutenant pretended to be on the phone with the general. ‘Yes, General, you can count on me, Sir,’ he said, as he banged the receiver down. Turning to the private he asked what he wanted. ‘I’m just here to connect your phone, sir.’ Pretending to be what you’re not is hard work. That’s why you feel so tired after a first date, or a job interview, or when you’re around people who expect you to project a certain image. Inside you is an unpretentious person. And it’s such a relief not having to act humbler than you are, or feign that you pray more, or know more about the Bible than you do. The good news is that you never have to pretend with God; genuine brokenness pleases Him more than spiritual pretentiousness. To fulfil His will and become the person He wants you to be, you need to be honest about who you really are. The Psalmist prayed, ‘<em>Teach me to do Your will, for You are my God; Your Spirit is good. Lead me in the land of uprightness</em>.’ So be who you are. When you do that—God will do the rest.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Ki 16:1-18:16, Luke 17:20-37, Ps 115, Prov 8:1-3<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65435&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I delight to do Your will, O my God...' Psalm 40:8 NKJV<br /><br /><p>In discovering and doing God’s will for your life, you must come to terms with what you think you should be. Comparison kills spiritual growth. For example, the mother of three young children hears her pastor preach about Christians who rise at dawn every day to spend an hour of quiet time with God. The fact is, she’d love an hour of quiet time—anytime! But her kids won’t cooperate! So what she takes away from the sermon is that she doesn’t measure up as a Christian. In essence, she’s practising ‘spirituality by comparison’ and living under a cloud of guilt. It doesn’t occur to her that the love she expresses to her children counts as a spiritual activity. Or that she may be serving God more faithfully than somebody who gets up at daybreak in order to have that hour of quiet every morning. Another example: a gregarious, spontaneous husband is married to a woman who enjoys solitude. It comes easily to her. Nevertheless, he feels like he’s a failure when it comes to prayer because he doesn’t enjoy being alone the way his wife does. He doesn’t consider that his joy and willingness in serving others counts, or that the degree to which he loves them is shaping his soul and delighting God. ‘Should’ is an important word, but when it comes to spiritual growth, God doesn’t want you to obey Him just because you ‘should’. He designed you to want His plan for your life—to get to the place where you can say, ‘<em>I delight to do Your will, O my God</em>.’</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Ki 18:17-20:21, Luke 18:1-17, Ps 11, Prov 8:4-5<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65436&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.' Romans 12:2 NKJV<br /><br /><p>In order to fulfil God’s will for your life, you’ll have to deal with what other people want you to be. Your boss wants you to be more productive. Your health club wants you to be fitter. Your credit card company wants you to be deeper in debt. It seems like everybody has an agenda for you and, if you spend your life trying to meet their expectations, you’ll never be free. Sometimes loving people means having to disappoint them. Seeking to become the person others want you to be is a shallow way to live. Nobody can tell you exactly how to change, because only God knows. Even you can’t tell yourself how to change, because you didn’t create yourself. To love someone is to desire and work toward their becoming the best possible version of themselves. And the one person in the entire universe who’s qualified to do this is God. Unlike people, God has no hidden agenda or unmet needs that He’s hoping you can help Him with. He knows what the best version of you looks like. He delights in the very idea of it, and is already working to bring it to fruition in your life. The Bible says, ‘…<em>In all things God works for the good of those who love Him</em>…’ (Romans 8:28 NIV) That means God is at work every moment to help you become His best version of you. And you’ll only be truly free when you make up your mind to be happy about being the person God meant you to be—the one He’s working on every day.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Ki 21-23, Luke 18:18-43, Ps 19, Prov 8:6-7<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65437&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...How different from this way of faith is the way of law...' Galatians 3:12 NLT<br /><br /><p>To fulfil God’s will for your life and become the person He wants you to be, you must deal with the ‘me’ you’re afraid God wants you to be. Most people equate spiritual maturity with trying hard to follow the rules of the Bible. But as long as you think God’s aim is to produce rule–followers, spiritual growth will feel like an obligation rather than a desire of your heart. Paul writes, ‘<em>How different from this way of faith is the way of law, which says, “If you wish to find life by obeying the law, you must obey all of its commands.”</em>’ (Galatians 3:12 NLT) Rigid adherence to rules and regulations produces a desire–smothering, emotion–controlling, self–righteous person. The Bible says, ‘…<em>The written law brings death, but the Spirit gives life</em>.’ (2 Corinthians 3:6 NCV) There’s a big difference between following rules and following Jesus, because you can’t follow Jesus without cultivating the right heart. Jesus didn’t say, ‘<em>I have come that you might follow the rules.’ He said, ‘…I have come that [you] may have life, and…have it more abundantly</em>.’ (John 10:10 NKJV) Until you understand that spiritual growth is about God conforming you into the image of His Son Jesus, the question, ‘How’s your spiritual life going?’ will intimidate you. A nagging sense of guilt and deceit will prompt you to say, ‘Not too well. Not as good as it should be.’ People are apt to use external behaviours and devotional practices to gauge their spiritual health. For example, they measure by how early they get up to read and pray, how long their quiet times are, or how often they attend church. That’s not what spiritual formation is about. It’s about your relationship with Christ, not rule–keeping!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Ki 24-25, Luke 19:1-21, Ps 116:1-11, Prov 8:8-9<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65438&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['My purpose is to give life in all its fullness.' John 10:10 TLB<br /><br /><p>Living your fullest life requires three things: (1) <em>A good mentor</em>. Paul writes: ‘Dear brothers and sisters, pattern your lives after mine.’ (Philippians 3:17 NLT) Good mentors lead by example; they know that in order to be followed they must first be respected. They carefully tailor their instructions by understanding your strengths and weaknesses—knowing whether you are right–brained creative/intuitive or left–brained analytical. They know whether you learn visually or verbally. They know when you need a pat on the back or a kick in the seat of the pants. If you have such a mentor you’re blessed. If you don’t, ask God for one. (2) <em>Your best effort</em>. Andrew Carnegie said, ‘There’s no use whatsoever trying to help people who don’t help themselves. You cannot push anyone up a ladder unless he is willing to climb himself.’ (3) <em>A little extra</em>. This is the ‘extra mile’ principle Jesus taught (See Matthew 5:41). It involves: (a) Extra effort. (b) Extra time. ‘<em>Though it linger, wait for it; it will certainly come</em>.’ (Habakkuk 2:3 NIV) Gutzon Borglum, the sculptor who created the memorial to the American Presidents at Mount Rushmore, was asked if he considered his work to be perfect. He supposedly replied, ‘Not today. The nose of President Washington is an inch too long. It’s better that way, though. It will erode and be exactly right in 10,000 years.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Hos 1-5, Luke 19:22-40, Ps 116:12-19, Prov 8:10-13<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65439&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Love...does not demand its own way...' 1 Corinthians 13:4-5 NLT<br /><br /><p>Some kids at a summer camp were discussing creation, and one asked, ‘If everything has a purpose, how come God made poison ivy?’ Another replied, ‘Because He knows there are some things we should keep our hands off!’ But keeping your hands off things isn’t easy when you’re insecure and controlling by nature. The Bible says, ‘<em>For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they will become one flesh</em>.’ (Genesis 2:24 NAS) Notice the word ‘become’. Leaving is the easy part; becoming is the hard part. It takes love, patience, kindness, and hard work. Jesus said, ‘…<em>Stop allowing yourselves to be…unsettled</em>.’ (John 14:27 AMP) If you’re ‘allowing’, you’re doing it to yourself! Learn to ‘let go’ and work on developing the fruits of the Spirit in your own life. Letting go doesn’t mean you don’t care; it just means allowing others to learn in their own way and through their own experiences. It calls for focusing on Jesus rather than obsessing on the other person’s behaviour. ‘<em>You will keep in perfect peace…all whose thoughts are fixed on You!</em>’ (Isaiah 26:3 NLT) Fix your thoughts on God, not on others. Letting go means caring about, instead of care–taking. It means stepping out of the middle and not trying to influence the outcome by fixing, judging, nagging, scolding, arguing, criticising and regulating. It’s about facing each day with God’s help and cherishing each moment. It’s about realising the only person you can ‘change’ is yourself. It’s about fearing less and trusting more. And it’s the only way to be happy.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Hos 6-10, Luke 19:41-20:8, Ps 13, Prov 8:14-16<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65440&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Spur one another on toward love and good deeds.' Hebrews 10:24 NIV<br /><br /><p>Here’s some advice for making your dating experiences something you can feel good about afterwards: (1) <em>Be spiritually prepared</em>. Talk to God while you’re getting ready. Time spent before the mirror is important, but time spent with God is all–important. This is never more so than when you’re looking for someone to spend the rest of your life with. (2) <em>Talk openly about sex before it becomes an issue</em>. Physical intimacy is a wonderful thing, but the Bible confines it to marriage where two people are committed to one another. So think protectively—and proactively. Genuine love doesn’t say, ‘If you loved me, you would…’ It says, ‘I love you too much to take advantage of you, or cause you pain, or ask you to do something you feel is wrong and that you’ll feel bad about tomorrow.’ (3) <em>Limit the time you are alone</em>; it can easily lead to things you’ll regret later. When your friends start saying they never see you anymore, chances are you’re becoming too exclusive, and setting yourself up to fail. Don’t always date as a couple; spend time in the company of others too. (4) <em>Do it right this time</em>. If you’ve been permissive in past relationships, don’t be discouraged. ‘<em>If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins</em>…’ (1 John 1:9 NIV) That means you can start again with a clean slate. The strongest relationships always put God at the centre. They strive to demonstrate the kind of love Paul describes in First Corinthians chapter thirteen. Make a point of reading it today!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Lev 24:17-22, Deut 15:7-11, Matt 5:38-48<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65441&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Arise, take up your bed...' Mark 2:9 NKJV<br /><br /><p>They came to Him, bringing a paralytic, who was carried by four men. And when they could not come near Him because of the crowd, they uncovered the roof where He was. So when they had broken through, they let down the bed on which the paralytic was lying. When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic: ‘<em>Arise, take up your bed</em>…’ (Mark 2:9 NKJV) We learn from this man’s story that some people are incapable of getting to Jesus on their own; their condition makes it impossible. Notice two important things here: (1) <em>When you’re weak or low in faith</em>, <em>gather others around you to encourage you in the Word and to lend a helping hand because fellowsip is important for us.</em> ‘<em>And they devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers. And awe came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were being done through the apostles</em>.’ (Acts 2:42-43 ESV) (2) <em>They didn’t let the crowd stop them from reaching Jesus, it took some effort, a degree of difficulty and a measure of ‘chutzpah’ (boldness), but they didn’t quit.</em> Jesus didn’t disappoint them, and He won’t disappoint you either. Don’t give in to weariness or discouragement, don’t stop until you get them to Jesus.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Hos 11-14, Luke 20:9-26, Ps 55:1-11, Prov 8:17-18<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65442&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

Even youths grow tired and weary…but those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar…like eagles; they will run and not grow weary</em>…’ (Isaiah 40:29–31 NIV) When an eagle is on the ground it’s vulnerable to attack by predators like snakes and wolves. On terra firma its surroundings are a fixed reality the eagle can’t change. So what does it do? It rises above them! From the air, everything looks different. The eagle’s altitude transforms its attitude—and that can happen for you too. ‘…<em>those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength</em>...’ Here are two illustrations of what it means to wait upon God: (1)<em> Like a wide–winged eagle waiting for a thermal current to carry it heavenward, you must stay in God’s presence with your heart attuned to Him</em>. Do you have duties and demands? Yes, but none as important as this. Why? Because you understand that if you don’t get into God’s presence and stay there until He refreshes and restores you, you won’t make it. (2) <em>Like an attentive waiter at a fine restaurant, whose only aim is to please, you wait on God, sensitive to His voice and surrendered to His will.</em> Have the pressures of life left you drained? Watching television may entertain you for a while, but it won’t restore what life takes out of you. Only God can do that, so learn to ‘wait’ on God.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 1-3, Luke 20:27-47, Ps 55:12-23, Prov 8:19-21<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65443&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I am leaving you with a gift--peace of mind...' John 14:27 NLT<br /><br /><p>Life comes with surprises. Some of them you welcome, and some of them you don’t. One summer you take a trip to the beach, next summer the beach is covered with oil. One month your stocks are soaring and your investments are growing, then suddenly it all comes crashing down. And the ‘brains’ you thought were running the system sit at session of parliament and say, ‘We just never anticipated this.’ And in those rare seasons when you think the world has settled down, watch out! A malignant cell shows up in a colon, or a cyclone rips through a neighbourhood flattening a house. So what are you going to do? When Jesus told His disciples He was leaving them, they were in panic mode, so He said to them, ‘…<em>When the Father sends the Advocate as my representative—that is, the Holy Spirit—He will teach you everything and will remind you of everything I have told you. I’m leaving you with a gift—peace of mind and heart. And the peace I give is a gift the world cannot give. So don’t be troubled or afraid</em>.’ (John 14:26–27 NLT) You need to recognise the presence of the Holy Spirit who lives within you, and build a relationship with Him. He’s not an ‘it’ or a ‘thing’ or an ethereal spirit that’s beyond your reach. He is Christ’s ‘representative’. He’s willing to teach you what you don’t know, and to remind you of the things you so easily forget. And best of all, He will give you ‘peace of mind and heart’, regardless of what life throws at you.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 4-6, Luke 21:1-24, Ps 38:1-12, Prov 8:22-23<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65444&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He will give you another...Counsellor.' John 14:16 AMP<br /><br /><p>In the Bible, Solomon lists 28 different seasons in life. Here they are: ‘<em>A time to be born and a time to die. A time to plant and a time to harvest. A time to kill and a time to heal. A time to tear down and a time to build up. A time to cry and a time to laugh. A time to grieve and a time to dance. A time to scatter stones and a time to gather stones. A time to embrace and a time to turn away. A time to search and a time to stop searching. A time to keep and a time to throw away. A time to tear and a time to mend. A time to be quiet and a time to speak. A time to love and a time to hate. A time for war and a time for peace</em>.’ (Ecclesiastes 3:2–8 NLT) God determines each of your life’s seasons. The Psalmist said, ‘<em>My times are in Your hands</em>…’ (Psalm 31:15 AMP) So what should you do when you enter a new season of life? Reach for the Holy Spirit’s help because He’s a ‘Counsellor’. Jesus told His disciples, ‘<em>I will ask the Father, and He will give you another…Counsellor…to be with you forever</em>.’ (John 14:16 AMP) When you need an advisor because you’re not sure what to do or which way to go, the Holy Spirit is available to guide you. That means you must be sensitive when He highlights a particular Scripture you’re reading, or plants a persistent thought or idea in your mind that won’t go away, or speaks to you through a friend. You’re not alone, unless you want to be. Just consult the ‘Counsellor’ within you.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 7-9, Luke 21:25-38, Ps 38:13-22, Prov 8:24-26<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65445&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The Holy Spirit--He will teach you everything...' John 14:26 NLT <br /><br /><p>As a departing teacher might introduce the pupils to his or her replacement, so Jesus introduces us to the Holy Spirit. And what a ringing endorsement He gives Him! He calls the Holy Spirit His ‘representative’. The Holy Spirit within you comes in the name of Christ, with equal authority and identical power. How comforting it is to know that, when you’re entering a new season of life in which so many things will be different. This verse is translated in different ways. In the New International Reader’s Version, the word ‘counsellor’ is rendered ‘friend’. In the New King James Bible, He’s called ‘Helper’. In the Amplified Bible, He’s referred to as ‘Intercessor, Advocate, Strengthener’. In the original Greek, the Holy Spirit is referred to as ‘parakletos’, a compound of two words: <em>para</em>, which means ‘alongside of’, and <em>kletos</em>, which means ‘one who’s designated to you’. The Holy Spirit has been assigned to come alongside you. He is the presence of Jesus with and in you. Can you see how the disciples needed this encouragement? It’s the evening before the crucifixion. By sunrise they will all have abandoned Him. Within 24 hours He will be hanging on the cross and their world will seem like it’s been turned upside down. But Jesus wants them to know: ‘You’ll never face the future without My help.’ And neither will you. Wherever the journey leads, He will be there by your side. The songwriter said, ‘And He walks with me, and He talks with me. And He tells me I am His own. And the joy we share as we tarry there, none other has ever known.’</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 10-13, Luke 22:1-23, Ps 69:1-18, Prov 8:27-29<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65446&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['These little troubles are getting us ready...' 2 Corinthians 4:17 CEV <br /><br /><p>Everything Jesus did for His followers, the Holy Spirit does for you. Jesus taught; the Holy Spirit teaches us. Jesus healed; the Holy Spirit heals us. Jesus comforted; the Holy Spirit comforts us. Jesus sends us into new seasons, and He sends His Counsellor with us. Your journey in the company of the Holy Spirit is a promise from Christ, in fact the very last promise He made to His disciples just before His ascension was, ‘<em>I am with you always, to the end of the age.</em>’ (Matthew 28:29 ESV) When change comes, embrace it, don’t resist it. Change is not only a part of life, it’s a necessary part of God’s strategy for your life. To use us to change the world, He alters our assignments. Gideon, the farmer, became a general. Mary, the peasant girl, became the mother of Christ. Paul, the rabbi, became a world evangelist. God changed Joseph from a baby brother into an Egyptian prince. He changed David from a shepherd to a king. Peter wanted to fish the Sea of Galilee; Christ called him to lead the first church. God gives us our assignments. But what about painful changes that are hard to understand? It’s like your time in the womb: you are being developed for a greater time outside the womb. Inside the womb you had the ultimate comfort and security. But only outside the womb could you fulfil God’s purpose for your life. Your life in this world is simply to prepare you for your life in the next one. That’s why Paul wrote, ‘<em>These little troubles are getting us ready for an eternal glory that will make all our troubles seem like nothing.</em>’ (2 Corinthians 4:17 CEV) Eternal glory—you can hardly imagine it!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 14-17, Luke 22:24-53, Ps 69:19-36, Prov 8:30-31<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65447&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...God intended it...to accomplish...the saving of many lives.' Genesis 50:20 NIV<br /><br /><p>Here’s Joseph’s story in a nutshell: his brothers put him in a pit, his boss put him in a prison, but God put him on a throne. And here’s what we learn: (1) <em>Your dream may work out differently from what you thought</em>. As a boy Joseph dreamed of being in a position of power. But God had something better in mind: namely, the saving of a nation. What God has in mind for you will often exceed all your expectations, bless others, and promote His kingdom on the earth. (2) <em>When it feels like you’re losing, you’re learning. When you experience unfair treatment and hardship, complaining doesn’t do any good</em>. Plus, you’re not growing while you are grumbling! In every experience there’s a lesson, so glean it and move forward. When life knocks you down—just make sure it knocks you to your knees. (3) <em>Seek divine promotion instead of self–promotion</em>. Every time Joseph tried to promote himself it worked against him. Look what happened when he asked the royal cupbearer, who was his prison–mate, to recommend him to Pharaoh: ‘<em>The chief cupbearer…did not remember Joseph</em>…’ (Genesis 40:23 NIV) Joseph learned the hard way that success comes from God, and that we must give Him the credit for it. Indeed, the only advancement that counts is the kind that comes from Him. So pray: ‘Lord, help me to see these difficulties as stepping stones to maturity. Give me patience to wait for the kind of promotion that comes from You. Help me to remember that I’m blessed for a reason—to bless others.’</p><br /><br />SoulFood (Palm Sunday): Mt 21:1-16, Ps 118:19-29<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65448&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<alias><![CDATA[be-open-to-correction]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...They did not respond to correction...' Jeremiah 2:30 NIV<br /><br /><p>How do you respond to correction? By taking offence? By interpreting it as rejection? By getting defensive? By shooting the bearer of bad news and making sure they never get to you again? By keeping score and saying, ‘In comparison to what I’ve accomplished in life, you’ve done nothing’? By giving in to self–pity and thinking how hard your life is because people don’t understand or appreciate you? We need people who’ll be honest with us. Why? Because we’re too easily blinded by our egos! When God sends somebody to correct you, it’s because He wants what’s best for you. His willingness to correct you actually demonstrates how much He cares for you. ‘<em>If you are not disciplined…you are illegitimate children and not true sons</em>…’ (Hebrews 12:8 NIV) So check your spiritual birth certificate! People who are open to correction generally exhibit these four qualities: (1) <em>Vulnerability</em>. When they’re wrong they’re capable of admitting it—even before they’re confronted. (2) <em>Teachability</em>. They’re willing to hear, quick to learn, and always open to counsel. (3) <em>Availability</em>. They don’t try to avoid you. (4) <em>Honesty</em>. They are committed to the truth, regardless of how much it hurts. You say, ‘That’s a high standard.’ You’re right! It’s a standard pride resists and fragile egos run from. There’s something in each of us that would rather look good than be good. So when God sends people into your life who love you enough to be straight with you—be open to them. Your personal growth and success depend on it.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 18-21, Luke 22:54-62, Ps 6, Prov 8:32-33<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65449&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...We are...the aroma of Christ...' 2 Corinthians 2:15 NIV<br /><br /><p>‘<em>We are…the aroma of Christ among those who are being saved, and those who are perishing. To one, we are an aroma that brings death; to the other, an aroma that brings life</em>…’ (2 Corinthians 2:15–16 NIV) When the Roman army won in battle, they paraded their defeated foes through the streets in chains. And as part of the celebration they burned incense on a series of altars throughout the city. That way those who couldn’t see the procession knew the army had triumphed because they could smell the incense. The aroma was symbolic of their victory—and there’s a lesson here for you. As followers of Christ we’ve been called to carry with us ‘…<em>the fragrance of the knowledge of Him</em>…’ (2 Corinthians 2:14 NIV) Forget Estée Lauder and Chanel No. 5; your life should be so permeated with God’s presence that people around you sense it. After all, you are the most compelling evidence that Jesus is alive and well in His children. In the great cathedrals of Europe you’ll see beautiful stained glass windows portraying important events in the life of Christ. And while it’s good to appreciate such craftsmanship, God doesn’t need church windows to tell His story. He uses born–again, tuned–in, turned–on believers to do that. Have you ever noticed that the longer some husbands and wives live together, the more they begin to talk and act alike? It’s the same with us: the more time we spend with Jesus, talking to Him, meditating on His Word and basking in His presence, the more people are going to ask, ‘What’s so different about you?’</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 22-24, Luke 22:63-71, Ps 31, Prov 8:34-36<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65450&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Open my eyes, that I may see wondrous things from Your law.' Psalm 119:18 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Let’s consider some practical suggestions for getting more out of your Bible study: <em>Schedule it</em>. If you don’t, it won’t happen. Learn to say no to unimportant things. For many of us the biggest obstacle to studying the Bible is television; the average person watches over four hours every day. Do the maths: that’s sixty–one days a year—two months! By the age of eighteen, the average person has seen 200,000 acts of violence, including 16,000 murders. And by the age of sixty–five they’ve spent about nine–and–a–half years watching TV. By contrast, if you went to Sunday school regularly from birth until the age of sixty–five, you’d only have had a total of four months of Bible teaching. No wonder we struggle spiritually. Discipline yourself by setting aside a specific time each day to study your Bible—and let nothing get in the way. And do it when you’re at your best physically, emotionally, and intellectually, not when you’re distracted and hurried. You know if you’re ‘a day person’ or a ‘night person’, so pick the time when you’re most alert. The spirit may be willing but the flesh is weak, so if you don’t want your study time to turn into ‘snore time’, don’t try to study when you’re tired, or right after a big meal. Keep a notebook to jot down your observations and keep track of what God is saying to you. Writing does three things: it clarifies, reinforces and personalises. Also, ask yourself, ‘What can I take away from this passage?’ It will help to fix God’s Word firmly in your mind and jog your memory regarding what you’re supposed to do about it.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 25-27, Luke 23:1-12, Ps 72:1-11, Prov 9:1-6<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65483&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I have rejoiced in your decrees as much as in riches.' Psalm 119:14 NLT<br /><br /><p>Spend time in prayer before you study the Bible. Ask the Lord to cleanse you from all known sin and fill you with the Holy Spirit so that you’ll be in fellowship with Him during your study time. Again, the purpose of Bible study isn’t to get new revelations and new rules; it’s to build a relationship with the Author of the Bible. The Psalmist said, ‘<em>How can a young man cleanse his way? By taking heed [of] Your Word.</em>’ (Psalm 119:9 NKJV) Sin doesn’t cancel your relationship with Christ, but it hinders your fellowship with Him. You have to be in fellowship with Him to understand and apply His Word. So before you search the Scriptures, ask God to search your heart. Paul says, ‘<em>A person who isn’t spiritual doesn’t accept the teachings of God’s Spirit… He can’t understand them because a person must be spiritual to evaluate them. “Who has known the mind of the Lord so that he can teach Him?” However, we have the mind of Christ.</em>’ (1 Corinthians 2:14–16 GWT) It’s possible to read the same portion of Scripture many times, yet fail to see what God wants you to see until He ‘opens’ your eyes. Once that happens, your attitude toward Bible study will be transformed. Like a hungry person at a table overflowing with good food, you’ll relish God’s Word and your faith will grow. As Paul said: ‘…<em>“No one has ever imagined what God has prepared for those who love him.” But God has shown us these things through the Spirit.</em>’ (1 Corinthians 2:9–10 NCV)</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 28-30, Luke 23:13-25, Ps 72:12-20, Prov 9:7-9<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65453&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...O dwellers in the dust, awake and sing for joy...!' Isaiah 26:19 NRS<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150403.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Aristotle called death the thing to be feared most because ‘it appears to be the end of everything.’ Jean–Paul Sartre said that death ‘removes all meaning from life.’ Robert Green Ingersoll, one of America’s most outspoken agnostics, unable to offer any words of hope at his brother’s funeral, said, ‘Life is a narrow vale between the cold and barren peaks of two eternities. We strive in vain to look beyond the heights.’ The last words of French humanist François Rabelais were: ‘I go to seek “a Great Perhaps”.’ In Hamlet, Shakespeare describes the afterlife as: ‘The dread of something after death, the undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveller returns.’ Clearly, unbelief isn’t just a miserable way to live; it’s a tragic way to die. A comedian once quipped, ‘I intend to live forever…so far, so good.’ But what if death is different from how the philosophers thought of it? Not just a curse, but a passageway? Instead of a crisis to be avoided, a corner to be turned? What if the cemetery isn’t the domain of the Grim Reaper, but the dominion of the Soul–Keeper who’ll someday soon announce, ‘<em>O dwellers in the dust, awake and sing for joy</em>’? Paul writes: ‘<em>If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most pitiable. But now Christ is risen from the dead, and has become the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. For since by man came death, by Man also came the resurrection of the dead</em>.’ (1 Corinthians 15:19–21 NKJV) Death isn’t the ‘great perhaps’. No, your last day on earth will herald the best of all your days!</p><br /><br />SoulFood (Good Friday): Luke 23:26-49, Ps 22, Is 53<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65454&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Thanks be to God, who gives us the victory [over death] through our Lord Jesus.' 1 Corinthians 15:57 NKJV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150404.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Jesus promised what no other religious leader could: that He’d return from the dead, and also resurrect His followers from the grave. And He has already made a good–faith deposit on that promise. When He died, ‘…<em>Graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised… they went into the holy city and appeared to many</em>.’ (Matthew 27:52–53 NKJV) And the day is fast approaching when Jesus will fulfil His promise completely. ‘…<em>In Christ all shall be made alive…each one in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, afterwards those who are Christ’s at His coming.</em>’ (1 Corinthians 15:22–23 NKJV) Note the word ‘<em>afterwards</em>.’ The date of Jesus’ return is classified information, but His resurrection guarantees ours. Traditional Judaism was divided on this topic. The Sadducees said, ‘<em>There is no resurrection</em>.’ (Acts 23:8 NKJV) They saw the grave as a one–way trip to Sheol (hell) with no escape and no hope, while the Pharisees envisioned a resurrection that was spiritual, not physical. The Greeks believed the soul of the deceased was ferried across the River Styx and released into a sunless afterlife of spirits, shades and shadows. Then Jesus, ‘…<em>the firstfruits of them that slept</em>’ (1 Corinthians 15:20 KJV), entered this world of superstition and darkness and turned on the light. The word ‘<em>firstfruits</em>’ can literally be translated ‘<em>prototype</em>’. Jesus was the first of the resurrected ones, and the rest of us who follow will look just like Him. It’s a message that dries our tears, calms our fears and assures us that our best days are yet to come.</p><br /><br />SoulFood (Passover): Ex 12:1-14, Luke 23:50-56, Ps 69:7-21, Deut 21:22-23<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65455&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I will come and get you...' John 14:3 NLT<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150405.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>Jesus said, ‘…<em>I am going to prepare a place for you…When everything is ready, I will come and get you, so that you will always be with Me where I am</em>.’ (John 14:2–3 NLT) This was a groom–to–bride promise. In Christ’s day, when a couple received permission from both their families to marry, the groom would return to his father’s home and build a house for his bride. And by promising to do the same for us, Jesus elevated funerals to the same level of hope as weddings. From His perspective, the trip to the cemetery and the walk down the aisle warrant identical excitement. Both celebrate a new era, a new name and a new home. Rejoice, your heavenly Bridegroom is coming to take you away on His arm! Does that sound too good to be true? Check the record. If you can find one time in all the 66 books in the Bible where God made a promise He didn’t keep, you’ll have reason to doubt this one. Your final glimpse of life will trigger your first glimpse of Jesus. Because Christ’s tomb is empty—His promise isn’t. He made it 2000 years ago, and He’s been working on your new home ever since. Can you imagine what it’ll be like? Living on a tiny, barren island called Patmos, John the Revelator wrote, ‘…<em>There was no more sea</em>.’ (Revelation 21:1 NKJV) Every morning when John arose the sea was all around him; it was the barrier that separated him from his loved ones on the mainland. Think about it: once in your heavenly home the separation will be over.</p><br /><br />SoulFood (Easter Sunday): 1 Cor 15, Luke 24:1-12 <br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65456&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

Titus 2:13 NKJV<br /><br /><hr id=&quot;system-readmore&quot; /><br /><br /><br />http://www.thewordfortoday.com.au/media/twftaudio/20150406.mp3<br /><br /><br /><p>The blessed hope of the resurrection isn’t like a lottery where only one person out of millions hits the jackpot. And it’s not a wishful sentiment offered at gravesides to comfort the grieving. It’s a hope built on certainty. Jesus said, ‘…<em>Because I live, you will live also</em>.’ (John 14:19 NKJV) Paul explained: ‘…<em>There is an order to this resurrection: Christ was raised as the first of the harvest; then all who belong to Christ will be raised when He comes back.</em>’ (1 Corinthians 15:23 NLT) Paul was writing to Corinthian Christians who’d been schooled in the Greek philosophy of a shadowy afterlife. Someone was trying to convince them that corpses couldn’t be raised—neither theirs, nor Christ’s. And the apostle couldn’t bear such a thought. So with the brilliance of a great attorney in his closing argument, he reviews the facts: ‘…<em>[Jesus] was raised from the dead on the third day… He was seen by Peter… the Twelve… more than 500 of His followers… Last of all… I also saw Him</em>.’ (1 Corinthians 15:4–8 NLT) How many witnesses were there? A handful? No, hundreds! And they didn’t see a phantom or experience a sentiment. Graveside eulogies often include phrases like: ‘She’ll live on forever in our hearts.’ This isn’t what Jesus’ followers meant. They saw Him ‘in the flesh’. And if you’ve trusted Christ as your Saviour, one day you, too, will see Him in the flesh. At death, your spirit will go to be with Him, and at His return, your resurrected body will rise to meet Him in the air. ‘<em>So shall we ever be with the Lord</em>.’ (1 Thessalonians 4:17 KJV) Awesome, absolutely awesome!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Jer 31-32, Luke 24:13-18, Ps 32, Prov 9:10-16<br /><br /><small><em>The Word for Today</em> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright © 2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65457&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<p>Evelyn Brand felt called by God to go to India. For a single woman in 1909, a calling like that required a lorry–load of faith. She married a young man named Jesse and together they began a ministry to the people in rural India, bringing education and medical supplies and building roads to reduce the isolation of the poor. For seven years they went without making a single convert to Christianity. But then a priest in a local tribal region developed a fever and grew deathly ill. No one else would go near him, but Evelyn and Jesse nursed him as he was dying. He said, ‘This God, Jesus, must be the true God because only Jesse and Evelyn will care for me in my dying.’ The priest gave his children to them to care for after he died—and that became a spiritual turning point in that part of the world. People began to examine the life and teachings of Jesus, and in increasing numbers began to follow Him. Evelyn and Jesse had thirteen years of productive service, then Jesse died. By this time, Evelyn was fifty years old, and everyone expected her to return to her home in England. But she wouldn’t do it. She was known and loved all around as ‘Granny Brand’, and she stayed another twenty years under the mission board she had served so faithfully. Her son, Paul, came over to see her when she was seventy years old, and this is what he said about his mum: ‘This is how to grow old. Allow everything else to fall away, until those around you see only love.’ (1 Corinthians 13)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...Don't say, &quot;Come back tomorrow, and then I'll help you.&quot;' Proverbs 3:28 NLT<br /><br />The Bible says: '<em>Do not withhold good from those who deserve it when it's in your power to help them. If you can help your neighbour now, don't say, &quot;Come back tomorrow, and then I'll help you.&quot;</em>' (Proverbs 3:27–28 NLT) Procrastination is deceptive. You don't think of it as disobedience because you intend to obey God. It's just that you're going to do it...when you have more money, when you're not so busy, when the holidays are over, when the kids go back to school etc. Before God gives you an increase, He observes you with what you've already got. For example, there's no point asking Him to give you more money so you can bless others, if you're not blessing people with what He's already given you. You say, 'But I don't have much at the moment.' It's not just about money. Are you capable of speaking a word of encouragement, or giving an hour of time, or helping someone in need? When God tells you to do something, He wants you to do it on His schedule, not yours. '<em>He told another man, &quot;Follow me!&quot; But the man said, &quot;Sir, first let me go to bury my father.&quot; But Jesus told him, &quot;Let the dead bury their own dead. You must go everywhere and tell about the Kingdom of God.&quot; Another said, &quot;I'll follow you, sir, but first let me tell my family goodbye.&quot; Jesus said... &quot;Whoever starts...and looks back is not fit for the Kingdom of God.&quot;</em>' (Luke 9:59–62 GWT) The result of delayed obedience is lost opportunity. So do it now!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'By faith Noah...built an ark to save his family...' Hebrews 11:7 NIV</p>
<p>The story of Noah teaches us: (1) <em>You can make a difference in your family</em>. '<em>By faith Noah...built an ark to save his family</em>.' Noah's decision didn't just benefit him personally, it saved his entire household. It took many years, but he did it. And by God's grace you can win your family to Christ too. (2) <em>You can make a difference for future generations</em>. Noah not only survived the flood, but God used him to start the world all over again. What a calling! What an impact! What a legacy! '<em>The eyes of the Lord search the whole earth in order to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to Him...</em>' (2 Chronicles 16:9 NLT) God is looking for people who will partner with Him in fulfilling His purposes on earth. But to qualify: (a) <em>You must be willing to stand out from the crowd</em>. Noah believed God's Word when nobody else did. Difference–makers are different. Don't let that bother you. (b) <em>You must not be afraid to do something for the first time</em>. Don't let the words, 'It's never been done before' keep you from obeying God. People probably told Noah, 'It's not raining. Who needs a boat?' But they were wrong and Noah was right. (c) <em>You must endure the rain in order to see the rainbow</em>. So take your stand and believe God, for what He's promised He will perform (Jeremiah 1:12). (3) You can make a difference at any age. Stop putting yourself down because of your age. Noah was five hundred years old when he started preaching and building the ark. It's not over 'til God says it's over!</p>

<title><![CDATA[It's All About Attitude]]></title>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Amaziah did what was pleasing in the Lord's sight, but not wholeheartedly.' 2 Chronicles 25:2 NLT<br /><br /><p>King Amaziah did all the right things, but he wasn’t ‘wholehearted’ about it. You can do the right thing and still not be blessed. Why? Because you did it with the wrong attitude. Take, for example, the subject of giving. The apostle Paul writes: <em>‘Let everyone give as his heart tells him, neither grudgingly nor under compulsion, for God loves the man who gives cheerfully. After all, God can give you everything that you need, so that you may always have sufficient both for yourselves and for giving away to other people... The more you are enriched by God the more scope there will be for generous giving, and your gifts, administered through us, will mean... an overflowing tide of thanksgiving to God. Moreover, your very giving proves the reality of your faith, and that means that men thank God that you practise the Gospel that you profess to believe in, as well as for the actual gifts you make to them and to others. And yet further, men will pray for you and feel drawn to you because you have obviously received a generous measure of the grace of God</em>.’ (2 Corinthians 9:6–11 PHPS) Note two things: (1)<em> Your level of giving determines the level at which you receive</em>. (2) <em>Your attitude in giving determines your abundance in receiving</em>. So when you ‘make up your…mind what you will give’, consider God’s goodness to you, decide what you should give, and do it with a heart of joy. It’s all about attitude!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Heb 9:1-11:16, Luke 10:13-24, Ps 28, Prov 5:3-6<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65408&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Friend, do what you came to do.' Matthew 26:50 NCV <br /><br /><p class=&quot;3title&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 15px;&quot;>Jesus looked at Judas in Gethsemane and said, ‘Friend, do what you came to do.’ It’s hard to imagine the Lord calling Judas His ‘friend’. Judas was indeed a disciple and therefore a friend, which made his betrayal all the more sinister. But Jesus knew that God brings good from bad situations (Romans 8:28), even the betrayal of a friend.  How? He saw another force at work: ‘This is…the time when darkness rules.’ (Luke 22:53 NCV) Judas wasn’t acting alone—and neither are our attackers. Paul says, ‘Our fight is not against people on earth but against the rulers and authorities and the powers of this world’s darkness, against the spiritual powers of evil in the heavenly world.’ (Ephesians 6:12 NCV) Those who attack and betray us are influenced by a fallen world and a sinful nature. While they’re accountable for what they do, they’re also living under deception. (2 Corinthians 4:3-4) Jesus knew His Father’s purposes would be achieved through Judas, and realising this helps us deal with those who hurt us. Even though Judas didn't understand the bigger picture, God used his actions to fulfil Christ’s destiny. Of the 98 words Christ spoke at His arrest, 30 were about the purpose of God. ‘It must happen this way to bring about what the Scriptures say…“All these things have happened so that it will come about as the prophets wrote.”’ (Matthew 26:54–56 NCV) Jesus understood that His immediate struggle was part of a greater plan and saw the hand of God at work in it. If you pay attention, you’ll see His hand at work in your struggle too.</span></span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Gen 17-19, Jn 13:31-38, Ps 118:1-9, Prov 31:6-9<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=64489&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

When you’re with somebody, ask yourself, ‘Do I like who I am when I’m around this person? Am I more open, loving and honest? Or do I not like what I see in myself?’ Choose people who make you a better person. </span></p>

Say ‘hello’ and get the other person’s name. If you’re naturally shy, it can be hard taking the first step. But the chances are that the other person feels the same, and when you start talking you’ll find things in common. </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Take a risk. </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>If you like somebody, go a little deeper and mention a small struggle, fear or disappointment you’ve experienced. It’s called ‘manageable risk’ and it lets you gauge how the other person responds. If they’re caring and identify with what you’re saying, that’s a good sign. If they shut down, try to fix you or respond critically, it may be time to move on.</span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;> But</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;> if everything else works out, exchange phone numbers and invite the other person for coffee or lunch. Then go for a second meeting and give it a little time; that way you’ll know if it’s a friendship worth developing. </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Find out where people go to spend time.</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;> There are lots of places to get to know new people—like church, the gym, school, a play group or volunteer service.

Advertisers spend billions getting us to decorate a shell that’s in a losing battle with Mother Nature and Father Time—all in an effort to create what we think will attract others. And when it doesn’t work, we get depressed and wonder what went wrong. Of course, it’s important to look your best but, when you’re obsessed with your appearance, you become superficial. And others lose respect for you because they discover that although the box is beautifully wrapped, it’s empty. If you want to know what ultimately wins hearts and attracts the right people, read these words: ‘I pray that from His glorious, unlimited resources He will empower you with inner strength through His Spirit. Then Christ will make His home in your hearts as you trust in Him. Your roots will grow down into God’s love…And may you have the power to understand…how long, how high, and how deep His love [for you] is…Then you will be made complete.’ (Ephesians 3:16–19 NLT) </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>That’s</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;> the secret to inner beauty! </span></p>

And to reach it you’ll have to undergo some of the same experiences that Jesus went through—like being misunderstood by your family, ridiculed by church members, rejected by the world, and disappointed by the people who say they love you. The Bible says we’ve been called to ‘share in His sufferings…that we may also share in His glory.’ So how do we do this? In three ways: </span></p>

<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span class=&quot;2dropcap&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>D</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>oes God feel distant? Floyd McClung writes: ‘You wake up one morning and all your “spiritual feelings” are gone. You pray, but nothing happens. You resist the devil, but it doesn’t change anything. You go through spiritual exercises, have your friends pray for you, confess every sin you can imagine, then go around asking forgiveness of everyone you know. You fast; still nothing. You begin to wonder how long this spiritual gloom will last. It feels like your prayers bounce off the ceiling. In utter frustration you cry out: <span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes;&quot;> </span>“What’s the matter with me?” </span></p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>This is a normal part of the testing and maturing of your friendship with God. We all go through it. It’s painful, but it’s absolutely vital to developing your faith. You see, God is always present, even when you are unaware of Him. His presence is too profound to be measured by intellect or emotion. He’s more concerned that you </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>trust</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;> Him than that you </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>feel</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;> Him. <span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes;&quot;> </span>Faith, not feelings, is what pleases God (Hebrews 11:6). You ask, “So what can I do?” Isaiah answers, “The Lord has hidden Himself…but I trust Him.” Focus on God’s unchanging love and faithfulness. Cling to His promises. During times of spiritual dryness, rest on His Word, not your feelings. Realise that He’s taking you to a deeper level of maturity. Any friendship based strictly on emotion is shallow indeed. So don’t be troubled by trouble—God’s grace is still in full force! He’s with you even when you don’t feel Him.’ His word to you today is, ‘Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.’ (Hebrews 13:5 NIV) </span></p>

God created Eve because unlike the rest of His creation Adam had no mate; he was incomplete. So if one of the purposes of marriage is closeness, the enemy of marriage is distance. But problems arise when you expect your spouse to meet </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>every </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>need you’ve got.

When we got to “Thou shalt not commit adultery,” I wondered if I’d have to explain it. Sure enough, a seven–year–old girl raised her hand and asked, “What does ‘</span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>commit’ </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>mean?”’ Seriously, if you live by impulse instead of commitment, your marriage will suffer. The word ‘commitment’ is best described in your wedding vows. Remember those? ‘Will you have this woman (or man) to be your lawful wedded wife (or husband)…to live together in God’s holy ordinance of marriage…to be faithful…in good times and bad, in sickness and health, and forsaking all others, remain faithful to her (or him)?’ That’s what you said before God! </span></p>

A prominent psychiatrist said, ‘I’ve counselled thousands of couples, and I’ve yet to meet my first happy adulterer.’ The results are always the same: shame, fear, loss, loneliness and depression. When you violate your own integrity, it’s hard to live in your own skin. Don’t be deceived by celebrities who hop from bed to bed. The secret to happiness in marriage isn’t </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>finding</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;> the right person, it’s </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>becoming </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>the right person. The Bible says you’re supposed to care about the spiritual, emotional, material and sexual needs of your spouse. So start discussing these things. And if you find it difficult to talk about them, get help—your marriage is worth fighting for!</span></p>

When one of the guests objected, he said, ‘I understand how you feel, but the father of the bride needs the money.’ Seriously, the number–one reason for divorce these days is money. That’s interesting, because we have more money today than at any time in the past. So what’s the problem?</span></p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;> In a nutshell, it’s our lifestyle. The more we have, the more we want, and the more we’re willing to go into debt to get it. When times are good that philosophy works, but in the last fifty years we’ve lived through ten recessions. For example, people who bought a home for $400,000, planning to sell it for $700,000 within a year or two, ended up losing everything because the housing market crashed. Imagine the stress that puts on a marriage! The strong endure; the weak don’t. We recently became reacquainted with a mostly forgotten word—</span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>frugality</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>. It means buying only what you can afford. The Bible says, ‘In the house of the wise are stores…but a foolish man devours all he has.’ (Proverbs 21:20 NIV) Financial experts now recommend keeping a minimum of six months’ living expenses in a ‘rainy day’ account. In the last decade we’ve gone through a major and painful correction. It taught us that the secret of happiness in marriage isn’t spending all you’ve </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>got</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>, but saving, and taking time to enjoy what you </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>have</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>.</span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA['They will be won over by observing your...lives.' 1 Peter 3:1-2 NLT <br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span class=&quot;2dropcap&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>S</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>hared faith is glue that will hold your marriage together in times of trouble. But when one spouse is an unbeliever, it can be difficult for the other. Concerning marriage, Jesus said, ‘What God has joined together, let not man separate.’ (Matthew 19:6 NKJV) Notice the words, ‘What God has joined together.’ Any relationship God puts together can go the distance. Speaking about a wife whose husband has died, Paul writes, ‘She is free to marry anyone she wishes, but only if he loves the Lord.’ (1 Corinthians 7:39 NLT) When your spouse doesn’t share your faith, you can find yourselves tugging on opposite ends of the rope. Paul asks, ‘How can a believer be a partner with an unbeliever?’ (2 Corinthians 6:15 NLT) The old country preacher put it bluntly: ‘Any time a child of God marries a child of the devil, they’re going to have trouble with their father–in–law!’ That doesn’t mean you should love your unbelieving partner less. Actually, it means you should love them more! </span></p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>Speaking of unbelieving spouses, Peter writes, ‘Even if some refuse to obey the Good News, your godly lives will speak to them without any words. They will be won over by observing your…lives.’ There’s preventative medicine and corrective medicine. When Paul says not to marry an unbeliever, he’s using </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>preventative </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>medicine. When Peter speaks of living with an unbeliever and winning them to Christ through your love and lifestyle, he’s using </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>corrective </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>medicine. At the end of the day, only one thing is guaranteed to work: ‘Love never fails.’ (1 Corinthians 13:8 NKJV) So fight for your marriage!</span></p>

A mother was trying to explain to her little son the benefits of unselfishness. She concluded her talk by saying, ‘We’re in this world to help others.’ After due consideration the boy asked, ‘Well then, what are others here for?’ When two people put their own individual needs and wants first, they’re on a collision course. Let’s look at some examples of selfishness in marriage: </span></p>

It’s unfair to your spouse and it’ll hurt your relationship. </span></p>

God has a different perspective—a better one. It’s ok to question Him, but not to doubt and second–guess Him. In His Word He says, ‘My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways My ways.’ When God told Moses he was going to deliver the Israelites from Egypt, Moses was all for it. But things didn’t go the way he anticipated because Pharaoh made their lives harder for a while. So instead of becoming a hero, Moses lived through a season of being criticised and misunderstood. Later, when some other things didn’t turn out as Moses expected, he got discouraged and complained along these lines: ‘Lord, I did what You told me to do. How come I’m not getting the results I prayed for?’ (Exodus 5:22) Moses didn’t understand the results of his obedience, because God didn’t tell him exactly how things would turn out. </span></p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>Usually our frustrations have little to do with what God does or doesn’t do, and everything to do with our mistaken ideas about what we </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>think </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>He should do. When you assume, or try to analyse God, you always end up frustrated. Jesus told His disciples, ‘You don’t really know what I am doing, but later you will understand.’ (John 13:7 CEV) It’s only in looking back that you see how the Lord has led you. He is the </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>best</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;> at what He does and His track record proves it.

He spent His life as ‘one who serves.’ (Luke 22:27 NIV) He ministered to society’s outcasts. He sought out the one sheep that was lost while the other ninety–nine waited (Luke 15:4–6). Even on the cross Jesus wasn’t just thinking about the impact of His earthly ministry, or tying up loose ends. He was busy forgiving the thief on an adjacent cross, asking His Father to forgive the men who crucified Him, and making sure His mother was taken care of after He went back to Heaven. So, was Jesus’ schedule less pressing than ours? Or did He know something we don’t? </span></p>

Think what could happen if, like Jesus, we made a conscious decision to invest our time and talent into the lives of twelve people. The possibilities are mind–boggling! Perhaps you feel intimidated by the concept of making a difference in the world. Don’t let your vision of what’s possible be limited by what you perceive as your own strengths and weaknesses. ‘With God’s power working in us, God can do much, much more than anything we can ask or imagine.’ (Ephesians 3:20 NCV) Only one opinion matters—God’s. And He told Gideon, ‘Go in the strength you have and save Israel…Am I not sending you?’ The strength of the </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Sender</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>, not the weaknesses of the one being </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>sent</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>, is what changes the odds and wins the day. </span></p>

It’s a decision people make every day, and it’s never easy. There’ll always be things we grieve about giving up because of their intrinsic value in our lives. If you want to know what </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>yours</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;> are, look at how you spend your time and money. It’s a dead giveaway. Jesus said, ‘Where your treasure is…there your heart will be also.’ Your ‘treasure’ can be </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>relationships </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>you’d do anything to keep, a </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>career </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>that’s central to your identity, or your </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>investments</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;> for the future. These things are ok. Indeed, the Bible says that wise people look ahead and plan (Proverbs 21:20). But it’s where you’re investing for </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>eternity</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;> that really matters. ‘The rich young ruler asked Jesus: “What shall I do to inherit eternal life?”…Jesus said…“Sell all…you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in Heaven; and come, follow Me.” But when he heard this, he became very sorrowful, for he was very rich.’ (Luke 18:18–23 NKJV) In essence, Jesus was asking this man who was rich and successful, ‘Would you give it all up to follow Me? Would you forfeit it for a few years in order to have much more for eternity? Instead of building a career, would you spend your life building My kingdom?’ Jesus wants to be ‘front and centre’ in your life. And when you put Him there, He promises, ‘All your other needs will be met as well.’ (Matthew 6:33 NCV) Are you willing to put Him to the test?</span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA['I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ.' Philippians 3:8 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span class=&quot;2dropcap&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>N</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>o matter how hard you try, you can’t ‘have it all’. Life’s too short! There are trade–offs you must be willing to make. In Matthew chapter 19 we read the story of the man who wanted to follow Christ, but he didn’t want to give up his lifestyle. Paul, on the other hand, said, ‘I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ.’ Let’s look at some trade–offs in life that are worth making:</span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>(1) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Approval for accomplishment.</em></span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;> For people–pleasers and approval–junkies this means realising that accolades are like smoke; they evaporate quickly. Awards turn to rust. Financial gain is quickly spent or lost. You must come to the place where ‘doing good’ means more to you than ‘looking good’. (</span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>2) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Security for significance. </em></span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>Greatness doesn’t lie in what you earn or own; it lies in what you give your life to accomplish. Instead of merely focusing on making a living, ask God to help you make a difference! (</span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>3) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Exploration for expertise.</em></span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;> Too many of us like to dabble, but the problem with dabbling is that you never really become great at anything. True, when you’re young you should try new things and see where your strengths and interests lie. But as you get older you must become more focused. You will go far in life if you ‘specialise’ in something. If you study the lives of great men and women, you’ll find that they were single–minded and tenacious. So once you have found what God created and called you to do, stick with it and let the rest go. </span></p>

That’s why so many of us climb part–way up the mountain of our potential, and stop. We’re unwilling to give up what we have, in order to obtain the next thing. And as a result we stall—sometimes permanently! You must be willing to make concessions, like trading: (</span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>1) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>What’s acceptable for what’s excellent. </em></span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>People don’t pay for average. They’re not impressed by anything that’s merely acceptable. If it’s worth doing, give it your best or don’t do it at all. Solomon writes, ‘Hard work brings a profit, but mere talk leads only to poverty.’ If you want to shine, you’ve got to ‘burn the midnight oil’.

And that’s a mistake. If you’re in the second half, you’ve probably spent much of your time paying the price for success. Don’t waste it. Move from success to significance. Do things that will live on after you are gone. Don’t just leave a will, leave a legacy.

<introtext><![CDATA['I have finished the work You gave Me.' John 17:4 GNT<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span class=&quot;2dropcap&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>U</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>nfinished business drains your energy without you even realising it. William James said, ‘There is nothing so fatiguing as an uncompleted task.’ And the internet has made the problem worse, because now you get more ‘messages’ in one day than you used to get in a month. When you don’t focus on something, you don’t finish it. So you end up frustrated, feeling like ‘nothing is getting done’. If you don’t take control of your time, the most </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>forceful people </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>and most </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>urgent situations</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;> in your life will. Before Christ picked His twelve disciples or calmed the storm on Galilee, He spent all night in prayer. ‘He departed again to the mountain by Himself alone.’<br /> (John 6:15 NKJV) Note the word ‘again’. Jesus regularly retreated from the pressures of the crowd in order to determine His priorities. Mac Anderson says: ‘Something magical happens when we accept personal responsibility for our behaviour and results. But it’s not easy…it’s human nature to “pass the buck”. As I’ve become older (and wiser), when things go wrong…I can always find the culprit…in the mirror. In every instance it comes back to choices I’ve made that put me exactly where I am today. Adopting an attitude of personal accountability means you’ve more control over your destiny…you become a contributor instead of a passive observer…others look to you for leadership…you gain a reputation as a problem solver…You experience the satisfaction that comes from getting things done…there’s less anger, frustration and helplessness, which in turn leads to better physical health…There’s a positive spillover into your personal and spiritual life. Sometimes winning isn’t about finishing </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>first</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>, it’s about </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>finishing</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>—full stop!’ </span></p>

Finishing means staying on the job until it’s done. It’s about accountability and action, because even when you’re on the right track you’ll get run over if you just sit there. High achievers will tell you that life takes on meaning when you take responsibility for your actions and pursue your goals with purpose and passion. Nothing compares to ‘the rush’ of crossing the finish line. The fact is, nobody remembers who finished second, except the guy who finished second! Co–authors B.J. Gallagher and Steve Ventura said the ten most important words in finishing strong are: ‘I won’t wait for others to take the first step.’ The nine most important: ‘If it is to be, it’s up to me.’ Eight: ‘If not me, who? If not now, when?’ Seven: ‘Let me have a go at it.’ Six: ‘I will not pass the buck.’ Five: ‘You can count on me.’ Four: ‘It </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>IS </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>my job.’ Three: ‘Just do it!’ Two: ‘I will.’ And </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>the </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>most important word: ‘Me.’ Jesus was the greatest finisher of all time. At age twelve, He told His parents, ‘I must be about My Father’s business.’ Later He told His disciples, ‘I must work the works of Him who sent Me.’ (John 9:4 NKJV) Facing the cross, He said, ‘For this cause I was born.’ (John 18:37 NKJV) And just before He died, He said, ‘It is finished!’ (John 19:30 NIV) Then, having earned the right to become our advocate with God, He went back to Heaven and ‘sat down’ (Hebrews 10:12). Mission accomplished! So focus on finishing strong! </span></p>

It’s not a competition. In Bible days Roman soldiers’ shields were designed so they could literally be hooked together. Each man fought for his entire line. Paul lists the people he was hooked to; he called them his ‘fellow workers.’ (Romans 16:3 NKJV) Speaking to the church, he wrote, ‘All of you together are the temple of God…Everything belongs to you, and you belong to Christ.’ (1 Corinthians 3:16–23 NLT) Notice: (1) Only </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>together </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>do we have everything we need. (2) It’s about </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>whom </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>we belong to, not what belongs to us. Experts say we need to hear something at least seven times before it registers. And this is particularly true when it comes to acknowledging our character defects or flaws in our plans. Dr John Maxwell writes: ‘After a period of frustration, I humbled myself and asked for advice. They told me things I didn’t want to hear. But I needed to learn to listen. And I learned to pay attention to things that struck a sensitive chord within me; it was often a signal that it was something I needed to improve. The things that upset me most, or that I resisted most, were usually what I needed to work on most. And if I gave myself time to reflect on what I was told and seek improvement, I usually improved dramatically.’ Don’t be defensive; learn from the people you’re hooked to!</span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Fight to capture every thought until it acknowledges the authority of Christ.' 2 Corinthians 10:5 PHPS <br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span class=&quot;2dropcap&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>B</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>e careful what you allow into your mind, because your thoughts run your life. You say, ‘But thoughts come at me every day from all directions: at home, at work, through the media, in my relationships and in my private world. How can I manage my mind successfully?’ The answer’s surprisingly simple. You can be transformed by making this one decision: </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>I will submit my thoughts to the authority of Jesus. </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>It’s easy to overlook the significance of Christ’s claim: ‘All authority in Heaven and on earth has been given to Me.’ (Matthew 28:18 NIV) Jesus controls everything in Heaven and on earth. That means He has the final say on everything—including your thoughts. He has more authority, for example, than your parents. Your parents may have told you you’re worthless, but Jesus says you’re valuable, and He has authority over your parents. He even has more authority over you than you do. You may tell yourself you’re too bad to be forgiven, but Jesus has a different opinion. And when you repent and submit to His authority over your life, those old condemning thoughts are no longer allowed. Jesus also has authority over your ideas. Suppose, for example, you get an idea about robbing a grocery store. Jesus has already made it clear that stealing is wrong, and if you’ve submitted to His authority over your mind then the idea of stealing can’t linger in your mind. To manage your mind successfully, all you have to do is submit your thoughts to the authority of Christ. Will it happen overnight? No, but with practice and commitment you’ll get better at it.</span></p>

You can throw the door open and let it in, or do what the Bible says: ‘Fight to capture every thought until it acknowledges the authority of Christ.’ (2 Corinthians 10:5 PHPS) In other words, capture the thought before it captures you. Let’s say a thought regarding your self–worth arises and says, ‘You’ve been a loser all your life. You’ve failed in relationships and jobs and ambitions. You might as well write “loser” on your CV, for that’s what you are.’ The average person would say to that thought, ‘You’re right; come on in.’ But you’re </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>not </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>the average person! You’re a new creation in Christ, led by His Spirit. So rather than let the thought in, take it captive, present it to the Lord and say, ‘Jesus, this thought says I’m a loser and I’ll never amount to anything. What do </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>You</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;> think?’ See what you’re doing? You’re submitting that thought to the authority of Jesus. If He agrees with it, then let it in. If not, kick it to the kerb! How do you know if He agrees or disagrees? Open your Bible and find out what God says about you. ‘We are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.’ (Ephesians 2:10 NIV) What about this one? ‘Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.’ (Romans 8:1 NIV) Any thought that doesn’t line up with God’s Word doesn’t pass the test—and doesn’t gain entrance. </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>That’s </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>how you manage your mind! </span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Don't cherish exaggerated ideas of yourself.' Romans 12:3 PHPS<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span class=&quot;2dropcap&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>H</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>ere are two more examples of mind management. A thought knocks on the door of your mind and says, ‘You’re so wonderful, the world is lucky to have you.’ Typically it’s the kind of thought you’d welcome, but you don’t do things the typical way. You submit it to the authority of Christ, and as you unsheathe the Sword of the Spirit, His Word, you learn that pride doesn’t please God. ‘Don’t cherish exaggerated ideas of yourself.’ As much as you’d like to embrace an exalted image of yourself, you can’t. You only allow what Christ allows. Here’s another example: this time it’s temptation. If you’re a male, the thought comes in a low–cut red dress. If you’re a female, it comes in the form of the hunk you’ve always admired. Temptation whispers, ‘It’s all right, you’re both consenting adults.’ If you aren’t under Christ’s authority you throw open the door but, if you are, you say, ‘Not so fast.’ Then you take this steamy thought before Jesus and ask, ‘Yes or no?’ And nowhere does He answer more clearly than 1 Corinthians: ‘<span class=&quot;text&quot;><span style=&quot;font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';&quot;>You cannot say that our physical body was made for sexual promiscuity; it was made for God, and God is the answer to our deepest longings... let every man have his own wife and every woman her own husband.</span></span>’ (1 Corinthians 6:13; 7:1–2 PHPS) Now, armed with the opinion of Christ and the Sword of the Spirit, what do you do? Unless the tempter or temptress is your spouse—you slam the door shut. End of story! </span></p>

One weary weekend I was as drained as my phone battery. I went through my evening routine, dutifully placing my mobile phone on its charger. Unfortunately, I neglected to plug the charger into the socket. Next morning I woke refreshed—but my phone was no better than the night before. It was in the right place… but it wasn’t connected to the power source! Sometimes the consequences of not “plugging in” can be more severe…many people dutifully march to church every week, but leave as drained as when they came. They’re in the right place, but they’re not plugged in to the power of God…and without that it doesn’t matter if you sit in a pew or on a barstool… You can study the Scriptures for hours on end, “always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth” (2 Timothy 3:7 NAS); you can even do great things for God but lack power in your life. If I’d left my mobile phone on the charger for days or weeks instead of overnight, it wouldn’t have helped. Multiplication of effort isn’t a substitute for true power… Guard against things that disconnect you from the power source…obviously sin will do that, but so will weariness. We can’t remain connected if we’re weighed down by busyness. We can spend so much time doing things </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>for</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>God that we neglect our relationship </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>with </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>Him.’ Jesus said, ‘You cannot be fruitful unless you remain in Me.’ That means reading the Bible, praying and resting in His presence. </span></p>

<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span class=&quot;2dropcap&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>W</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>e must care about people’s spiritual </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>and </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>practical needs. It’s hard for someone to grasp the concept of God’s love when they don’t know where their next meal is coming from, or where they’ll sleep tonight. Food banks worldwide are seeing a dramatic upsurge in emergency requests. Volunteer Cindy Crosby writes: ‘Each client is as different as the patterns in a kaleidoscope: the retired, the mentally ill, single mothers, young men fallen on hard times… And not everyone is grateful. Some are angry… some refuse eye contact… some leave without saying more than a few words… If you volunteer just to feel good about yourself, you’ll give up. Lofty ideals shatter like stained glass pelted by rocks… It’s the success stories that stick… The refugee mother whose son went on to Harvard on a scholarship… the woman who thanked me more times than I could count… the mother of six who showed palpable relief because that month she could feed her family… I remember Jesus’ words, “I was hungry…you gave Me something to eat…I was a stranger…you invited Me in.” (Matthew 25:35 NIV) Now when I think of hunger, I see faces. And that has made all the difference.’ It’s easier to love in theory than reality, especially when it comes to people who are difficult or different. But genuine love isn’t defined by what feels good or bad; God’s already set the standard. ‘If anyone has material possessions and sees his brother in need but has no pity on him, how can the love of God be in him?…Let us not love with words…but…actions.’ (1 John 3:17–18 NIV)</span></p>

B–17s, better known as ‘flying fortresses’, carried thirteen .50 calibre machine guns. At one point scientists suggested the planes might actually be safer without them. Without the extra weight needed to operate the guns, they could fly faster and higher, increasing their odds of survival. The pilots, however, thought differently. They wouldn’t even consider embarking on a mission without guns to shoot back and defend themselves. With that thought in mind, Jon Walker says: ‘We make the same choice when it comes to fighting our own battles.’ God says we don’t need the guns… we can soar higher and faster with Him. ‘For though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does.’ The weapons He gives ‘have divine power to demolish strongholds’; we don’t need the ‘weapons of the world.’ (2 Corinthians 10:3–4 NIV) But we say ‘No thanks’; we have to shoot back and defend ourselves with arsenals of angry words, demanding attitudes, manipulative manoeuvres, excessive excuses, and bombs of blame. It takes courage to stop using weapons of the flesh, ‘take up the shield of faith’, and arm ourselves with the weapons of God (Ephesians 6:16 NIV). It’s the kind of faith David showed when he [told] Goliath, ‘You come against me with sword and spear…but I come against you in the name of the Lord.’ (1 Samuel 17:45 NIV) Stop fighting in your own strength and let God’s spiritual arsenal defend you; ‘He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him.’ (Proverbs 30:5 NIV) </span></p>

Jews considered astrology to be a counterfeit to true prophecy. Be careful; there are people whose lifestyles you may disapprove of, who are honestly seeking God. So be gracious in your dealings with them. The Greek philosophers on Mars Hill had a pantheon of gods. Was Paul shocked or put off? No. He commended them for being willing to search for God, adding, ‘He is not far from each one of us.’ (Acts 17:27 NKJV) Don’t jump to conclusions and write people off. In God’s eyes every weed is a potential rose and every loser is a potential winner.

Their round–trip journey took two years, taking them through a Jewish village where they didn’t fit in. Meanwhile, leaders who had access to the prophecies of Christ’s birth wouldn’t expend the time and effort to check them out. We often quote Jeremiah 29:11, ‘“The plans I have for you,” says the Lord… “are plans for good…to give you a future and a hope.”’ But don’t stop there, read on: ‘When you pray, I will listen. If you look for Me wholeheartedly, you will find Me.’ (Jeremiah 29:12–13 NLT) Poet Julie Carro wrote, ‘Now wise men still seek His face as they did in days of old; to give the Lord their hearts, more precious than silver and gold.’ How far are you prepared to go in your search for God? </span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Not My will, but Yours be done.' Luke 22:42 NIV <br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span class=&quot;2dropcap&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>I</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>f your goal is to be used by God, don’t be surprised when He permits seasons of adversity and brokenness. Jesus experienced it, and He said, ‘A servant is not greater than his master.’ (John 15:20 NKJV) Jon Walker points out: ‘God’s intent isn’t to hurt us, but to expand our capacity to carry His love to a world in need of compassion… Sorrow clarifies our thinking. In the school of Christ, brokenness is a good thing. It’s impossible to become intimate with God unless we’re broken of independence, pride and our insistence that our way is better than God’s. Brokenness is the last stop before we finally confess, “I can’t; God can.” It’s Paul confessing, “What a wretched man I am. Who will rescue me from this body of death?” (Romans 7:24 NIV) It’s the Prodigal fighting with the pigs over food (Luke 15:11–32). It’s Joseph, still in prison, forgotten by the cupbearer (Genesis 40:23). It’s Jonah in the whale’s belly confessing the consequences of running from God (Jonah 2:1–9). It’s Peter weeping bitterly outside Jesus’ trial (Luke 22:62). It’s Jesus abandoning everything to God, praying, “Father…not My will, but Yours be done.” (Luke 22:42 NIV) …God in His ruthless, loving pursuit will break us of pride, sin, folly and independence (Matthew 21:44). Like Jesus serving bread at the Last Supper, God takes us, breaks us, blesses us and uses us.’ Are you going through a season of brokenness? Be encouraged; in God’s Kingdom brokenness is the path to blessing. It has also been put this way: ‘To have God do His own work through us, even once, is better than a lifetime of human striving.’</span></p>

And don’t lock Him into a personal experience you had in the past where He guided you in a certain way. If God can move a star, He can rearrange any circumstance in your favour. How did the wise men know about the birth of Christ? Maybe because of an alignment of the planets, or because they were students of Old Testament prophecy. We don’t know. But one thing is certain: they were seeking God—and that’s the point at which we must all begin. </span></p>

Think: if he was willing to kill every Jewish baby boy under the age of two in order to get at Jesus, what were the chances that these men would get out of town alive? Not great—until God stepped in! ‘Then, being divinely warned in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed for their own country another way.’ (Matthew 2:12 NKJV) The devil is real, but you don’t have to be afraid, because Jesus has already defeated him. The main thing is: when your heart is set on seeking God, He will guide you, protect you and reward you. </span></p>

But the good news is, with God you’re already accepted.

A poll of college students confirmed that over 50 per cent suffered from low self–acceptance, with the majority citing their looks as the source of their unhappiness. ‘My nose is too long. My eyes are too small. I’m too fat here—too thin there. I’m too short—too tall. I’ve got freckles.’ And the beauty industry is more than willing to darken it, lighten it, accentuate it, lift it, tuck it and cover it up in an attempt to sell us a self–image we can accept. A little improvement might indeed be beneficial, but not as a basis for self–worth. Here’s how God sees the issue: ‘Does the clay dispute with the one who shapes it, saying, “Stop, you’re doing it wrong!” Does the pot exclaim, “How clumsy can you be?”’ (Isaiah 45:9 NLT) </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>You are God’s personal creation.</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;> And He makes no mistakes, overlooks no details and leaves nothing unfinished. You need to accept yourself because He created, redeemed and accepts you. In an age of media overload, we’re bombarded by images of perfect–looking people, with the inference that we need to look like them if we hope to amount to anything. But Paul says: ‘We do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves. When they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they are not wise.’ (2 Corinthians 10:12 NIV) The God Who made you who you are has a plan for perfecting you. You’re perfectly acceptable, if not yet acceptably perfect. You’re ‘predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son.’ So you’re a work in progress!</span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA['He will lift you up.' James 4:10 NKJV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span class=&quot;2dropcap&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>T</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>he Bible says, ‘Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and He will lift you up.’ It works this way: when you try to exalt yourself, God brings you down, but when you humble yourself in His sight, He lifts you up. He does it because you’re His child and He loves you. You may feel like a nobody right now, but in God’s eyes you’re a somebody. Who but God could reach behind a hedge, find a Rodney ‘Gipsy’ Smith and use him to win multitudes to Christ? Who but God could go to Old Comiskey Park in Chicago, find a baseball player called Billy Sunday and use him to impact the world? Who but God could look in a Galilean fishing boat and find Peter, call him, transform him and use him to build the church? God loves to do things like that. And since He ‘does not show favouritism’ (Romans 2:11 NIV) you’ve every right to believe He will do it for you too. The Bible says, ‘like one...inwardly calculating...but his heart is not with you.’ (Proverbs 23:7 ESV) When that little voice inside you whispers, ‘You’ve no talent and you’ll never amount to anything in life,’ that’s not God. It’s Satan—and the Bible says he’s a liar! (John 8:44) That’s why you need to tell him, ‘I don’t believe a word you’re saying. You can’t put me down because God is raising me up.’ God’s plan for you was established long before you were born, and He hasn’t changed His mind. So you need to discover His plan, then make sure your feelings, thoughts, actions and words line up with it. </span></p>

<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span class=&quot;2dropcap&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>I</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>n order to access power, you have to go to the outlet and plug in to the source of it. That’s what happens when you pray in faith; you plug in to God’s power. Picture a boat trapped in mud and stuck on the bottom. If you can get it to the dock, you can repair it and send it back out to sea. The trouble is you can’t move it. So what’s the answer? Bring in high–powered tugboats, connect steel cables to the sunken craft and wait for the tide to rise. Are you getting the idea? When you feel so low that you can’t lift yourself up, tap into God’s power and let Him lift you up to the place where He can repair, restore and re–commission you. If you keep that picture in mind, you’ll never think about prayer the same way again. Instead of seeing it as an obligation, you’ll start seeing it as an awesome power that works for you in all circumstances of life. And you’ll see reading the Bible in a different light as well. Paul says, ‘So now, brethren, I commend you to God and to the word of His grace, which is able to build you up.’ (Acts 20:32 NKJV) Your problems may be great, but the tide of God’s Spirit is greater, and if you let it, it’ll lift you out of your troubles. Will they suddenly vanish overnight? No, but you’ll be above them looking down instead of underneath them looking up. At that point you’ll be operating from a position of faith instead of a position of fear. It can happen for you. God can lift you up: ‘All things are possible to him who believes.’ </span></p>

They can be bad–tempered, selfish, critical, irritating, dismissive, aggressive and pompous. Sometimes you want to give them a piece of your mind; give them what they deserve—anything but acceptance. The command, ‘accept one another’, is inconvenient. And if Paul had stopped there we might dodge the directive by saying he obviously meant good, reasonable, acceptable people. Alas, he goes on, ‘just as Christ accepted you’. Were </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>you </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>good, reasonable and acceptable? No, but He accepted you—flaws and all—and He still does! You say, ‘Somebody has to straighten these people out and require them to act right!’ You mean like Jesus required before He accepted </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>you</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>? Roman Christians had difficulty accepting their less experienced brothers, and Paul corrected them: ‘Accept him whose faith is weak, without passing judgment… for God has accepted him.’ (Roman 14:1–3 NIV) Straightening people out isn’t our department; accepting them is. God calls us to accept messed–up, unspiritual, carnal, obnoxious, doctrinally misled, ‘just plain wrong’ people. You don’t have to approve of, like, or agree with them, but accepting them isn’t optional. There’s no elite, privileged, insider class. We occupy level ground because of two realities: our sin and the cross! Jews and Gentiles despised each other, even after salvation. Each wanted the other to become like them. But Paul took the axe to the root of that tree: ‘For Christ Himself…reconciled both groups…by means of His death on the cross, and our hostility toward each other was put to death.’ (Ephesians 2:14–16 NLT) </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>We're to accept people—and let God adjust them.</span></span></p>

Why would God say ‘no’ to you? Maybe the timing is wrong, or He has something better in mind. Gratitude comes when you realise what </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>could </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>have happened, but didn’t because God intervened. Stop trying to break loose from the loving grip of the One who holds you for your own protection. The Bible says: ‘Take delight in the Lord, and He will give you your heart’s desires. Commit everything you do to the Lord. Trust Him, and He will help you… Be still in the presence of the Lord, and wait patiently for Him to act.’ (Psalm 37:4–7 NLT) Looking back on her life, Billy Graham’s wife, Ruth, said, ‘If the Lord had said “Yes” to all my prayer requests I’d have married the wrong man—several times.’ What you’re so upset about now, you may be thanking God for later. The more spiritually mature you become, the more you begin to see how wise your heavenly Father is, and the more you learn to trust Him. The Psalmist wrote, ‘The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.’ (Psalm 23:1 KJV) What a picture: God leading you, God feeding you, God protecting you, God watching over you. Like a lifeguard at a beach, in order to save you, God will sometimes interrupt your life, risk embarrassing you in front of your friends, and maybe even bruise a rib or two. That’s because He loves you too much to let you drown in the thing you thought was so good for you. The main thing is: God has something better for you!</span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let him...boast...that he understands and knows Me.' Jeremiah 9:24 NIV<br /><br /><p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span class=&quot;2dropcap&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>G</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>od says: ‘Let not the wise man boast of his wisdom or the strong man boast of his strength or the rich man boast of his riches, but let him who boasts boast about this: that he understands and knows Me.’ (Jeremiah 9:23–24 NIV) The truth is, if you don’t know God it doesn’t matter how much money you have in your bank account, or what diplomas hang on your wall, or what position you hold in the company. Until you have a relationship with God, you haven’t really begun to live! And part of getting to know Him is learning the truth about yourself. After witnessing the miracle–working power of Christ, Peter acknowledged, ‘I am a sinful man!’ (Luke 5:8 NIV) When the prophet Isaiah saw the Lord sitting upon His throne, he cried, ‘Woe is me!’ (Isaiah 6:5 NKJV) But God doesn’t tell you the truth about yourself and then leave you that way. No, like a good doctor, He tells you you’re sick so that you can get the proper treatment. And the proper treatment for sin is salvation through the blood of Jesus. You will </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>never </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>know God until you are related to Him through Jesus Christ. So if you’ve never accepted Him as your Saviour, start this New Year by praying: ‘Lord, I repent and turn from my sin. I place my life in Your hands, trusting You as my Lord and Saviour. By faith I receive the gift of eternal life. Starting today, I ask You to lead and guide me and fulfil Your will through me. In Jesus’ name I pray: Amen.’ Happy New Year!</span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The word...which can...give you an inheritance.' Acts 20:32 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span class=&quot;2dropcap&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>L</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>inda Knox was in her eighties when she died of malnutrition in her Chicago apartment. Apparently she’d lost her sight, and her mind had failed. Among her belongings they found the equivalent of $186,000 in uncashed cheques, $206,000 in works of art, $440,000 in jewels, and $56,000 in antiques. In all, she had an estate worth over $900,000—yet she died alone in poverty. And what’s worse, she’d drawn up a will leaving these things to friends and family members. But she never filed it with the courts and it was never executed, so her beneficiaries were unaware of their inheritance. There’s a lesson here for you. When Christ died and went back to Heaven, He left a will. And you are named in it! You say, ‘Where can I find a copy?’ In His Word! You’re an ‘[heir] of God and a [co–heir] with Christ.’ (Romans 8:17 NKJV) Once that truth gets down into your soul, your attitude toward reading the Bible will be revolutionised. Instead of spending mindless hours watching TV or surfing the internet, you’ll start meditating ‘day and night’ in the Scriptures. As a result, you’ll start to ‘prosper in all that you do’ (Joshua 1:8; Psalm 1:2–3). Now you can understand why David said, ‘I will delight myself in Your commandments, which I love… The law of Your mouth is better to me than thousands of coins of gold and silver.’ (Psalm 119:47; 72 NKJV) Peter wrote: ‘His divine power has given us everything we need for life…He has given us His very great and precious promises, so that through them you may participate in the divine nature.’ (2 Peter 1:3–4 NIV) What more could you ask for? </span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Come, see a Man.' John 4:29 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext; mso-ansi-language: EN-AU; mso-fareast-language: EN-AU;&quot;>When the woman at the well met Jesus, unlike all the other men she’d met, He addressed her real need. ‘[He said,] “Go…get your husband”… “I don’t have a husband,” the woman replied. Jesus said…“you have had five husbands, and you aren’t…married to the man you’re living with.”’ (John 4:16-18 NLT) Because we’re weak, we keep getting into situations that leave us wounded. And those wounds can’t be healed by going from relationship to relationship. After meeting Jesus this woman ran to tell everybody, ‘Come…meet a Man who told me everything!’ (<span style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;&quot;>John 4:29 </span>TLB) Her answer wasn’t another man; she’d already tried that! Her answer was meeting <em>the</em> Man, and asking Him to fill the void in her life.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext; mso-ansi-language: EN-AU; mso-fareast-language: EN-AU;&quot;>The Bible refers to this as putting ‘on the new self, which is being renewed in…the image of its Creator.’ (Colossians 3:10 NIV) If you’re sick of the way you’re living and want to change, remember, the woman at the well couldn’t ‘put off the old man’ till she met the new One. When you’re attached to certain habits and relationships, it’s hard to break free in your own strength. You’ll only be able to disengage when you acknowledge Jesus as Lord of your life. Only by embracing the new will you find strength to say goodbye to the old. </span></p>
<p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext; mso-ansi-language: EN-AU; mso-fareast-language: EN-AU;&quot;>So what does all this mean for <em>you</em>? It means coming to Christ as you are, asking Him to save you, and entering into a relationship with Him. James says, ‘Surrender to God… Resist the devil, and he will run from you.’ (James 4:7 CEV) When you do that, God will give you the strength to forsake those old patterns and begin a new life!</span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA[He couldn't do any miracles among them... And He was amazed at their unbelief.' Mark 6:5-6 NLT<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span class=&quot;2dropcap&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>G</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>od answers prayer in a manner directly related to our level of faith. ‘According to your faith, be it unto you.’ (Matthew 9:29 KJV) Yet sometimes in spite of our doubts and human reasoning, He comes through for us anyway. The believers praying for Peter’s release from prison were amazed when he suddenly appeared on their doorstep (Acts 12). When Jesus returned to His home town and began to teach in the local synagogue, the people were amazed by His wisdom. Because He lacked formal education and credentials they wrote Him off as ‘just a carpenter’. (Mark 6:3 NLT) And the result? ‘Because of their unbelief, He couldn’t do any miracles among them except to place His hands on a few sick people and heal them.’ Question: How often does </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>your </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>unbelief tie God’s hands? The truth is: (a) sometimes our faith is so weak that we don’t expect Him to answer at all; (b) we fail to pray with confidence; (c) we don’t prepare ourselves for what He wants to do for us. You can’t ask God for forgiveness, then continue to live under condemnation over sins He has put under the blood. Or pray about your financial situation, then worry yourself sick about how He’s going to meet your needs. You can choose to live by your feelings, or in a way that reflects total trust in God. The Bible says, ‘Without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He…is a rewarder.’ (Hebrews 11:6 NKJV) So you must exercise faith.</span></p>

Life doesn’t stand still; there will always be challenges. Don’t let them destroy your confidence; instead, use them as opportunities to grow. Once you’ve grown in the areas where God thinks you need additional maturity, the season you’re in will pass. Nothing lasts forever. Although it’s hard to believe at the time, ‘You will forget your trouble and remember it…as water gone by.’ Forgetting doesn’t mean losing a block of memory. It means reaching the point where the memory is free of pain, just as poison is pulled from a snake bite. As healing begins, the mind’s continual replay of the event reduces and the memory becomes like ‘water gone by’. Kristin Armstrong says: ‘When someone died in Old Testament times, those who were in mourning marked their faces with ashes. They allotted a specified season, after which they scrubbed up and moved on. How much healthier is that than our society? We put on make–up, or a happy or stoic face, and prohibit people from having compassion and respecting the limits of where we are. We’re so busy hiding, we’re buried under ashes on the inside. God will call us to arise and shine when our light has come (Isaiah 60:1). Ask Him to set </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>your</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;> time limit, and be ready to wash your face.’ Then move on. </span></p>

Doing more, and doing it faster, isn’t taking us to a place of peace. The distraction is nothing more than a momentary escape. Sooner or later we have to stop… Psalm 46:10 says, “Be still, and know that I am God.” When we’re forced to be still the magnitude of the weight we carry becomes enormous, the loneliness unbearable. We think momentum keeps us from thinking…from feeling…from knowing sooner or later we have to stop.’ When you need to be spiritually restored, go to the </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>throne,</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>not the </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>phone! </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>No matter how good your friends are, they can’t meet your need like God can. Jesus said, ‘Come to Me…and I will give you rest.’ (Matthew 11:28 NIV) Consider it His personal RSVP to talk to Him and tell Him how you feel, like a child talks to a loving parent who can help them. Designate a special place to be alone with God, and discipline yourself to go there often. And don’t just tell Him what you need; listen for what He’s trying to tell you. Don’t be in a hurry to get back into the rat race; stay in God’s presence until you understand that the burdens you’re carrying were never meant to be shouldered alone. The most important thing: we find time for what we consider important, so get your priorities straight and ‘seek first His Kingdom.’ (Matthew 6:33 NIV) When you ‘come near to God…He will come near to you.’ (James 4:8 NIV) </span></p>

Every day holds twenty–four hours, and as gifted as we are at multi–tasking, there are concrete limits to what we can get done in any given day… We routinely neglect the top priorities of our lives. We’re irritable and impatient with those we love. We forfeit our need for sleep. We pass through many days oblivious to the presence of God.’ Can you recognise these things in yourself? When word got out that Jesus had healed Peter’s mother–in–law, a crowd gathered and He ministered to them late into the night. Early the next morning when He slipped away to a quiet place to pray, the disciples went looking for Him. ‘When they found Him, they exclaimed: “Everyone is looking for you!”’ But note Jesus’ response: ‘Let us go somewhere else.’ He chose to be Spirit–led, not guilt–driven. Before assuming you’ve been called to meet every need that arises, it’s ok to say, ‘Let me pray about it and get back to you.’ Then pray, listen carefully and make your decision based on how you answer this question: Will saying ‘</span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>yes’</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;> to this request mean having to say ‘</span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>no’ </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>to something else that’s important? It’s essential to recognise what you’ve been called to do for the season of life you’re in; it takes honesty, humility and courage to take a consistent line. When you face a situation you know will put you on overload, even if </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>you’re </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>willing to pay the price, are you willing to commit your </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>family </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>to pay the price with you?

Amos 4:13 NIV<br /><br /><p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span class=&quot;2dropcap&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>I read a story</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>: ‘A while back I bought an interesting torch. Before I decided to buy it I asked the sales lady how long the battery would last. “As long as you do,” she replied. “What do you mean?” I queried. “</span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>You </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>are the battery,” she explained. “There’s no battery inside. You have to pump the handle at the bottom of the flashlight to make it light up.” I tried it, and sure enough I generated the power needed to make it light up! As soon as I stopped pumping the light went out… If you make the right commitment to an idea but it seems impossible…pray…and keep pumping. Bright ideas will come your way—ideas that come from God’ (Isaiah 48:17). Albert Einstein said it’s important that we never stop asking questions, or lose our holy curiosity. God’s Word says He ‘forms the mountains…creates the wind, and reveals His thoughts to man.’ Imagine tapping into the resources of a God Who knows you and can fill your mind with imaginative, inspired, innovative ‘thoughts’. Jesus knows the </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>mind</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;> of God, the </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>plans </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>of God, the </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>will</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;> of God and the </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>purposes </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>of God because He </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>is</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;> God. And Paul says, ‘We understand these things, for we have the mind of Christ.’ (1 Corinthians 2:16 NLT) As Ted Engstrom observes, ‘Creativity has been built into every one of us. Each of us lives less of the life God intended when we choose not to release the creative powers we possess.’ When you tap into God’s creativity, He helps you see things not as they </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>are</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>, but as they </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>can</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>be.

It doesn’t come from inspiration (or perspiration), but from letting the Holy Spirit transform you. How? ‘By…renewing…your mind.’ Recalling when his boys were young, a preacher said they were playing with a toy lorry, complete with the sounds of grinding gears and roaring engines. ‘I didn’t pay much attention as I unwound from the day’s stresses. Distractedly, I glanced down and noticed the boys were now running an aeroplane down an imaginary runway. “What happened to the lorry?” I asked. “Daddy, this is a </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>transformer</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>. It can be transformed into whatever we want!” they explained. God made the first transformer. He created man in such a way that He could pull a woman out of him. From one creative act God transformed the man into a marriage, the marriage into a family, and the family into a society. All kinds of potential are locked into your spirit. And for the Christian, transformation at its optimum is the outworking of the internal. God placed certain things in you that must come out…and when you’re tired of trying to unlock your own resources, allow Him to release in you the power to become </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>whatever </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>you need to be.’ ‘But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God.’ (John 1:12 NKJV) Christ empowers us to slip out of who we were, and transforms us into who He </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>created </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>us to be.</span></p>

So how can the true Body of Christ be united? We can start by acknowledging that unity is God’s will and committing ourselves to work toward it. Next, we can learn the principles of unity.

Even when you’re right, or you’re the more knowledgeable party, you still have no right to judge. Your job is to ‘make every effort to keep yourselves united in the Spirit.’ (Ephesians 4:3 NLT) Discuss it with God, then trust His wisdom.

We’re quick to attribute negative motives: ‘He meant to hurt me. She’s selfish. They never consider others.’ The church in Rome was sabotaging its own unity over outward issues, so Paul reminded them that even though their behaviour was at odds, their motives were similar. ‘He who eats meat, eats to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he who abstains, does so to the Lord and gives thanks to God.’ (Romans 14:6 NIV) Unity doesn’t depend on outward conformity, but understanding hearts! </span></p>

You can follow the letter of the Word but violate its Spirit. Paul said, ‘Everything is permissible—but not everything is beneficial.’ (1 Corinthians 10:23 NIV) Yes, you can do it, but somebody else may end up being hurt. God has a higher law than that of ‘my rights’; it’s the law of love! He cares if you ‘by using your freedom...somehow make a believer who is weak in faith fall into sin.’ (1 Corinthians 8:9 GWT) What should you do? ‘Do nothing from selfishness…regard one another as more important than yourselves.’ (Philippians 2:3 NAS)</span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Lord has need of him.' Luke 19:34 NKJV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span class=&quot;2dropcap&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>L</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>uke records: ‘He sent two of His disciples, saying, “Go into the village…you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat. Loose it and bring it here. And if anyone asks you, ‘Why are you loosing it?’…say to him, ‘Because the Lord has need of it.’”’ (Luke 19:29–31 NKJV) Who notices a donkey tied to a tree in a town where nothing ever seems to happen? Jesus! During the busiest week of His life, on His way to Jerusalem to die, He paused for a lowly colt, saying, ‘Bring him to Me.’ There’s a lesson here for you. Jesus knows where you are today, and when the time is right He will call you. Notice the words, ‘A colt…on which no one has ever sat.’ Maybe that’s because nobody placed much value on it. But when God has a plan for your life, He’s not influenced by those who overlook or underestimate you. Note also the phrase ‘a colt tied’. You may be tied up with legitimate things like raising a family or holding down a job. Or you may be tied up with illegitimate things you can’t even talk about. Either way God knows, and He’s bigger than your problem. Note the words, ‘If anyone asks you, “Why are you loosing it?”…say to him, “Because the Lord has need of it.”’ Understand this: neither your friends nor your foes control your future—God does. How long had the colt been tied to that tree? Days? Weeks? Months? We don’t know. But this much is sure, when the Lord says, ‘Loose it and bring it here,’ the clock starts ticking and His plan for your life starts falling into place.</span></p>

Yet we wonder and even doubt if our prayers will be heard by an ever–present, ever–loving God.’ Wrap your prayer in God's gift of faith. </span></p>

(Matthew 6:11) ‘We respectfully petition, request and entreat that a due and adequate provision be made, this day and date first above and inscribed, for the satisfying of petitioners’ nutritional requirements, and for the organising of such methods of allocation and distribution as may be deemed necessary and proper, to assume the reception by and for said petitioners of such quantity of cereal products (hereinafter and herein called “bread”), and shall in the judgment of the aforesaid petitioners constitute a sufficient amount.’ That’s eighty words! Jesus used only seven! Sometimes the most effective praying is brief and to the point. </span></p>

The great thing about being specific is that whenever God answers, you know it. The loved one you prayed for was saved. The illness was cured. The more explicit you are, the more alert you’ll be for answers—which means you can be more specific with your thanks to God. </span></p>

When you’re in the middle of a sentence, they figure it’s a good time to play with their toys or chase the dog around the house. Sometimes that’s how we treat God.

Our problem is ‘the war of wandering thoughts’. Things we’ve forgotten suddenly ‘parade’ across our consciousness, demanding our attention. And as James says, if we’re ‘double–minded’ we don’t get answers to our prayers (James 1:8). What can we do? </span></p>

So ask yourself, ‘Is my request in line with Scripture; will it blend with my gifts; will it draw me closer to God; what is my part in answering it; have I obeyed the Lord?’ Now, when you pray, ‘Give us this day our daily bread’ (Matthew 6:11 NKJV), God probably won’t rain down groceries! He will give you opportunities you must seize and act on. The words, ‘Pray without ceasing’ (1 Thessalonians 5:17 NKJV), mean you should stay in God’s presence long enough for Him to answer your prayer, or change your request. </span></p>

And so does yours! The moment you become conscious of sin, confess it, then be confident that God has forgiven you and move forward. </span></p>

The difference between ‘catching a few moments’ with the Lord and spending quality time with Him is like the difference between driving through McDonald’s and spending the evening at a fine restaurant. At McDonald’s you drive up, shout into a microphone and drive around to a window where they hand you a bag of food. In a fine restaurant you sit down, savour every bite in a relaxed atmosphere, and leave satisfied and nourished. Too many of us live on spiritual fast food and never experience the banquet God has for us. The Bible says, ‘Seek His face continually.’ Have you learned how to stay in God’s presence and enjoy it? When it comes to prayer, we all face two challenges: </span></p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>(</span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>1)<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;> Lack of desire</em>. </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>We complain about lack of time, but the truth is we make time for what we truly care about and enjoy. If you want to build an effective prayer life you must be willing to forfeit some things. </span></p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>(</span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>2) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>We don’t know how</em>. </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>Find a place with no distractions. Take your Bible and a notepad with you. Use worship music to help you. Worship will change the atmosphere around you. Just do what works for you. And be patient! Sometimes it takes weeks or months before you develop a pattern, so stick with it—the rewards are worth it. And remember, prayer is a two–way street. It’s not about seeing how much you can tell God; it’s about learning to hear from Him as well. </span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA['And He went a little further.' Matthew 26:39 KJV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;2scripture&quot; style=&quot;line-height: normal;&quot;><span class=&quot;2dropcap&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>J</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>esus left the crowd. He left the twelve disciples. In Gethsemane He even left the three who were closest to Him, went ‘a little further’ and fell on His face and prayed, ‘Not as I will, but as You will.’ (Matthew 26:39 NKJV) It was here, face to face with His Father, that He found strength to embrace the will of God for His life. Today God is saying to you, ‘The strength to handle this crisis and the wisdom to know what to do will be yours if you’ll just go a little further, stay in My presence a little longer, and dig a little deeper in My Word. If only you knew how close you are to the answer!’ Jesus was only a few hours away from the cross, a few days away from the resurrection, and on the threshold of launching the church. Are you in Gethsemane? Sometimes surrendering your will to God is hard, isn’t it? Look at Jesus. Before Heaven accepted the sacrifice of a surrendered body, it demanded the sacrifice of a surrendered will. Have you surrendered to God? Why do we trust </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>others </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>so easily while God longs for us to trust </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Him</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>? You go to a doctor whose name you can’t pronounce, get a prescription you can’t read, take it to a pharmacist you don’t know, get medicine you don’t understand, and take it with confidence. Why is it so much easier to have confidence in these ‘unknowns’ than in God, Who is faithful in every way? The answer lies in where you place your trust. Trust comes from knowing someone intimately, listening to them and spending time with them. It doesn’t happen overnight; it takes time. </span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Cast your bread upon the waters.' Ecclesiastes 11:1 NKJV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span class=&quot;2dropcap&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>T</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>he Bible says, ‘Cast your bread upon the waters, for after many days you will find it again.’ Notice two things in this Scripture: </span></p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>(</span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>1) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>The risk requires faith</em>. </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>At first this verse doesn’t make sense. When you ‘cast your bread upon the waters’, the best you can hope to get back is mushy, waterlogged bread. Its meaning becomes clearer, however, when you realise it was written in a culture where seafood was the basis of trade and economic survival. Throwing bread into the water attracted fish, which you could then catch. There are important spiritual principles at work in this Scripture. For example, catching fish depends on the current flowing in the right direction, the sun, the moon and other elements only God can control. But when you do your part, God promises to do His. George Müller said, ‘Faith does not operate in the realm of the possible. There is no glory for God in that which is humanly possible. Faith begins where man’s power ends.’ </span></p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>(</span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>2) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>The return requires patience</em>. </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>‘After many days you will find it again.’ You ask, ‘When will it happen?’ When God is ready, when He knows you are ready, and when it all fits into His plan. The Bible tells us to ‘imitate those who through faith and patience inherit what has been promised.’ (Hebrews 6:12 NIV) You need faith </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>and</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;> patience to receive what God has promised. And even when you don’t know what’s ahead, you can be sure of one thing—God will be there. Today He’s calling you to choose faith, even when you don’t know what’s on the other side. </span></p>

No experiences, no lessons, no life. Boxes can be comfortable…but no matter how cosy you make it, it’s still a box. They come in all shapes and sizes. When we let unrealistic fears hold us back we can be fairly certain we’re climbing inside another box…and sooner or later we’ll run into the walls.

Stick your head out and look around. Find a fear and turn it into a ladder. Get out of the box of doubt and insecurity and into the freedom of courage and belief.’ If you let it, fear will cause your imagination to run riot. But ‘God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.’ (2 Timothy 1:7 NKJV) A sound mind restores your perspective and helps you see things from God’s viewpoint, where all things are possible. Today He wants to give you the courage to climb out of the box and bring you ‘into a large place’, because He ‘delights’ in you.</span></p>

As the small private jet approached the runway, we were celebrating the success of the week. Then, in a moment, everything changed. The plane was hit by crosswinds and dropped straight down to the runway, the wheels hitting out of balance. All conversation stopped and our eyes widened as we realised we were in danger. The pilot, without hesitation, pushed the throttle and launched the plane back into the air… We all realised that could have been it! We sat quietly as the plane circled the airfield and a few minutes later we landed safely.’ As he got off the plane, John asked the captain, ‘When did you make the decision to put the plane back into the air?’ He replied, ‘Fifteen years ago.’ He went on to explain how as a young pilot in training, he decided in advance what decision he would make for every possible air problem. His decision was made long before the crisis.

<introtext><![CDATA['Give your servant a discerning heart to...distinguish between right and wrong.' 1 Kings 3:9 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span class=&quot;2dropcap&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>C</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>hoices—they’re the determining factor in how your life turns out. When Solomon came to the throne as a young man, he prayed for wisdom to make the right choices in life. Legendary basketball coach John Wooden said, ‘There’s a choice you have to make in everything you do. So keep in mind that in the end, the choice you make, makes you.’ Some of us make life harder by making bad choices; others move through life more easily because they make good choices. The truth is, you don’t always get what you want but you always live with the consequences of your choices. Observe: </span></p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>(</span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>1) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Your choices reveal who you really are</em>.</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;> Theologian HP Liddon observed, ‘What we do on some great occasion will probably depend on what we already are; and what we are will be the result of previous years of self–discipline.’</span></p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>(2) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>The higher you rise, the more difficult your choices become</em>. </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>King Solomon could have had any woman he wanted. Sadly, he chose women who turned his heart away from God (1 Kings 11:4). </span></p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>(</span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>3) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Your choices change you for good or evil</em>.</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;> Once you choose, you become a servant of that choice. It impacts your life and often on the lives of others. CS Lewis said: ‘Every time you make a choice you are turning the central point of you, the part… that chooses, into something a little different from what it was before. And taking your life as a whole, with all your innumerable choices, you are slowly turning this central thing either into a heavenly creature or a hellish creature.’ So you must make your choices prayerfully and wisely. </span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA['He...saw...evidence of the grace of God.' Acts 11:23 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span class=&quot;2dropcap&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>W</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>here there’s grace, there’s growth. And where there’s growth, there’s clear evidence of it. The church at Jerusalem sent Barnabas to the church at Antioch, and ‘when he arrived and saw…evidence of the grace of God, he was glad.’ As believers, we should be growing in ‘grace and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour.’ (2 Peter 3:18 NIV) And there should be evidence of it! When you accept Christ, He ‘[equips] you with everything good for doing His will’ (Hebrews 13:21 NIV); you become ‘a new creation…old things have gone; everything is made new!’ (2 Corinthians 5:17 NCV) Grace makes you more caring and compassionate, and less critical and judgmental. It makes you slow to speak and quick to consider the other person’s point of view. You’re less likely to react in anger when things don’t go your way, and more likely to put the good of others ahead of your own (1 Corinthians 10:24). Jon Walker says: ‘When you become a believer your role changes. You no longer have the job of looking out for your own interests; your job is to represent the interests of Jesus. You are the face of Jesus; showing up in the lives of others on His behalf… in hospitals… at funerals… at weddings… across the table as you share coffee with a friend… You’re on the job for Jesus, and the more you serve others in love, the more you’ll influence them toward Christ.’ Paul wrote, ‘Though I am free…I make myself a slave to everyone, to win as many as possible.’ (1 Corinthians 9:19 NIV) That’s what it’s all about!</span></p>

<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span class=&quot;2dropcap&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>A </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>woman went shopping one day and came home with a very expensive dress. Her budget–conscious husband was very upset and demanded to know what on earth possessed her. ‘The devil made me do it,’ she replied sweetly. He asked, ‘Well, why didn’t you say, “Get thee behind me, Satan?”’ ‘I did,’ she replied. ‘But he said it looked great from the back as well—so I had to buy it!’ Satan is an expert at distorting the truth by getting us to blame circumstances and other people for our mistakes; that way we never have to take responsibility. We simply need to take responsibility for our own problems and not blame them on our parents, upbringing, government or peers. Florence Nightingale, hero–nurse of the Crimean War, said, ‘I attribute my success to one thing: I never gave or took an excuse.’ When a winner messes up, they admit they were wrong and ask for forgiveness. When a loser makes a mistake, they immediately look for somebody or something to blame. The Bible says, ‘Don’t try to disclaim responsibility by saying you didn’t know… God…knows you knew! And He will reward…according to [your] deeds.’ David constantly prayed about his shortcomings, and his honesty helped make him ‘a man after [God’s] own heart.’ (1 Samuel 13:14 KJV) Instead of denying and defending your mistakes, take responsibility, learn from them and move on. That’s how you grow! </span></p>

But to succeed in life, you must periodically ask yourself two questions: </span></p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>(</span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>1) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Am I committed to personal growth</em>? </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>‘Wisdom is supreme; therefore get wisdom. Though it cost all you have, get understanding.’ Keep reading, keep learning, keep asking questions. A Chinese proverb says, ‘He who asks is a fool for five minutes; he who doesn’t ask remains a fool forever.’ Some of us are like the little girl who thought she’d exhausted the subject of mathematics once she learned her twelve–times tables. When her grandfather asked with a twinkle, ‘What’s 13 times 13?’ she scoffed, ‘Don’t be silly, Grandpa, there’s no such thing!’ Your hunger for wisdom and knowledge determines your future. In order to keep giving out, you must keep taking in. </span></p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>(</span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>2) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Am I enjoying what I do? </em></span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>You’ll never fulfil your destiny doing something you despise. Passion lies at the core of true success and fulfilment; it’s the spark for your fuse. It energises you when those around you grow tired. It helps you come up with answers when others cease to have creative ideas and strengthens you when they drop out. It gives you courage to take risks while others crave security. When you lose your passion, two things happen: first, you fail to pursue excellence; second, you jeopardise your integrity, because you’re tempted to take shortcuts and compromise by settling for less than God intended. Clues to your destiny are found in those things that generates passion in you. When you find yourself working at what you love you’re being clued in to God’s purposes for you. </span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant.' Mark 10:43 NIV <br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span class=&quot;2dropcap&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>T</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>wo more questions you should constantly ask yourself are: </span></p>

Why? Until you answer that question with the right motives, God won’t promote you. Sometimes we just want to be in control. Other times we don’t want to pay the price for success. We just want the perks that come with it: a corner office, a higher salary, a respected title and the admiration of others. Jesus said, ‘Whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant.’ Leadership puts you in a position to take care of your own needs first—to set yourself up—before helping others. That’s always a temptation and it’s always wrong! You must genuinely care about people and help them to reach their potential. When you do that you’re honouring God and He will honour you. </span></p>

Henry Ford remarked, ‘The question, “Who ought to be the boss?” is like asking, <span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes;&quot;> </span>“Who ought to be the tenor in the quartet?” Obviously, the man who can sing tenor.’ To succeed in life, you must know what God gifted you to do. </span></p>

If you don’t do the right things today, tomorrow will be spent fixing today’s mistakes. You’ll never change your life until you change something you do daily. Only by asking yourself, ‘Am I making the most of today?’ will you be able to keep yourself on course, and make a course correction when you’re not. </span></p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>(</span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>2) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Am I taking time to think?</em></span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;> One of the wisest things you can do is take time to think. This is especially important if you’re action–oriented and goal–oriented. We like to feel we’re making progress, moving ahead and getting things done. But in order to do the right thing, in the right way, at the right time, you must take time to evaluate what you’re doing. Are you?</span></p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;> (</span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>3) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Is my life pleasing to God? </em></span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>Enoch is remembered by these words: ‘He…pleased God.’ (Hebrews 11:5 NIV) What a testimony! Jesus said, ‘What will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul?’ (Mark 8:36 NKJV) Regardless of what you accomplish, your supreme goal should be to please God. And to do that, you must spend time with Him in prayer and reading the Scriptures. In prayer you talk to God and through the Scriptures He talks to you. That’s a winning combination that never fails!</span></p>

Her boss wrote: </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>‘I don’t think I ever met anyone more courageous. Some days she was so ill…getting out of bed took all the strength she had! She’d deliberately fall out of bed, walk on her hands and knees to the bathroom, reach for the sink and pull herself up. She’d force herself to get dressed, stumble into the kitchen, drink some water, eat a dry piece of toast, search for her purse, and walk to the door. Perspiration pouring off her forehead, she’d look at her husband and say, “Well, Ralph, I think I can make it now.” Then she’d get into her car and drive to church. She was always there before me, and when I arrived with my usual greeting, “Good morning, how are you?” she’d always smile and say, “Great!” I never knew until after her funeral what she went through… Only God can give you that kind of courage.’ The Bible says, ‘From his…unlimited resources [God] will empower you with inner strength through his Spirit.’ There are many ways to say it, but none more eloquent than the hymnist Annie Johnson Flint, who put it like this: </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>‘When we have exhausted our store of endurance; when our strength has failed ere the day is half–done; When we reach the end of our hoarded resources our Father’s full giving has only begun. His love has no limit…His grace has no measure…His power no boundary known unto men. For out of His infinite riches in Jesus, He giveth, and giveth, and giveth again.’</span></span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things.' Colossians 3:2 NIV <br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span class=&quot;2dropcap&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>T</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>oday we’re big on the concept of instant gratification and acquiring more stuff. But ‘earthly things’ lose their appeal once the bill arrives and the interest on your credit cards starts piling up. When that happens, blessings can turn into curses and rob you of the joy of living. ‘Materialism doesn’t satisfy because it’s tyrannical, and human beings were born to be free… We find we don’t own the house—the house owns us. We’re married to a mortgage. We become slaves to gadgets and garments. After they’re purchased, delivered and installed, we enjoy a fleeting sense of pleasure, but they still dominate, dictate and demand, “Press me, polish me, patch me, paint me, prune me, plaster me!” We spend our best years and the bulk of our money working for “things” until…we’ve no time left to pursue life’s really enjoyable vocations: visiting friends, having fun, and going to church…no time to do good deeds, see places, or visit the people who give us the greatest inner joy. Paul says, “Godliness with contentment is great gain.” (1 Timothy 6:6 NIV) And to experience that contentment you need to count your blessings every day and thank the One who made them all possible.’ Jon Walker writes: ‘Assume there’s an imaginary line dividing what you can see from what you can’t see—the temporal from the eternal. Our objective in Jesus is to look upon the things “above”, so we can understand that what we see and feel is not a full and accurate measurement of God’s reality…people are eternal beings, and decisions that seem insignificant now, when seen in the fullness of reality, are of eternal significance.’ </span></p>

A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap.</span></span>’ (Luke 6:38 NIV) Note: ‘given to you’. When God blesses you, He often gives His blessing through people. So who should you be listening to and walking with? ‘He who walks with wise men will be wise.’ (Proverbs 13:20 NKJV) Observe the word ‘walks’. Wisdom comes when you’re moving forward, not resting on your laurels. You must be teachable, discerning, relational, and responsive. </span></p>

He reassured her the oil would flow until she had enough to pay off her debts and live well. (2 Kings 4:3–7) With God you always have enough to create what you need!

<introtext><![CDATA['As newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the word...' 1 Peter 2:2 NKJV<br /><br /><p>How does a newborn baby desire milk? With an intensity you can’t imagine unless you’ve heard the midnight cry! The fact that you’ve worked hard all day and are tired, or that you fed the baby just an hour earlier, doesn’t matter. An infant’s agenda is about as focused and uncluttered as you can get. He or she wants to eat—right now! When was the last time your spiritual stomach growled so much at midnight that you just had to get up and feed your soul on God’s Word? Here’s how Peter addressed the issue: ‘<em>Therefore, laying aside all malice, all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and all evil speaking, as newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the word, that you may grow thereby, if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is gracious</em>.’ (1 Peter 2:1–3 NKJV) Note the words ‘<em>if…you have tasted</em>’. When you’ve tasted the real thing you can’t get by on junk food. Your spiritual taste buds won’t let you. Note, not only can you not ignore a baby’s hunger, you can’t fool their sense of taste. When you start mixing stuff into their formula that wasn’t meant to be there, their taste buds and stomach will reject it. Have you ever heard the phrase ‘projectile vomiting’? Junk food is designed to fill a need with a quick fix that may satisfy you for a while, but it doesn’t provide any real nourishment. You can tell when you’re spiritually malnourished and underdeveloped. Peter says the symptoms are malice, deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and evil speaking. So open your Bible today and pray, ‘Lord, give me a hunger for Your Word.’</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Exod 16:1-35, Jn 6:30-40<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65389&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...You are Mine.' Isaiah 43:1 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Do you remember the hit song by Dean Martin, <em>You’re Nobody till Somebody Loves You</em>? Such lyrics show up our deepest concern. We want our lives to matter, to mean something. Our deepest fear is of coming and going—and nobody knowing! We strive with our lack of education, our spot on the financial totem pole, and our looks. That’s why it bothers us when a friend forgets to call, or a teacher forgets our name, or a colleague takes credit for something we have done. We crave attention, drop the names of important people in conversations, and put flashy hubcaps on our cars. Fashion publicists tell us, ‘You’ll be somebody if you wear our jeans.’ So we go out and spend half our wages on a pair of designer jeans. But then—horror of horrors—the style changes from tight to baggy, faded to black, and we’re left wearing yesterday’s jeans, feeling like yesterday’s news. Simply stated: you can’t gain significance from the outside. It’s an inside job. Your sense of significance must come from Someone you trust, Someone you know will never change, Someone who knows the worst about you and yet remains committed to maturing you. And that Someone is God. He keeps His promises to Israel and He’ll keep His promises to you. ‘<em>Thus says the Lord, who created you…who formed you…Fear not, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by your name; you are Mine. When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow you. When you walk through the fire, you shall not be burned…For I am the Lord your God…you [are] precious in My sight</em>.’ (Isaiah 43:1–4 NKJV)</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Num 16-18, Luke 7:24-35, Ps 107:33-43, Prov 3:27-28<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65390&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Thank You for making me...' Psalm 139:14 NLT<br /><br /><p>We search for significance in different ways. We think that if we can connect with someone special, we’ll become someone special. Or we try to outlive life. When the billionaire realises he will run out of years before he runs out of money, he establishes a foundation. We have kids for the same reason. One day, when we die, we hope our descendants will remember ‘good old Dad’ or ‘sweet old Mum’ and we’ll extend our lives via theirs. The famous atheist Bertrand Russell said, ‘I believe that when I die my bones will rot and nothing shall remain of my ego.’ You say, ‘He can’t be right.’ He’s not! Jesus said, ‘…<em>the very hairs on your head are all numbered</em>.’ (Matthew 10:30 NKJV) We monitor other things like the amount of money in the bank, petrol in the tank, and kilos on the scale. But hair? We style hair, colour hair, cut hair, but we don’t count hair. God does. God planned you, knows everything about you, and loves you. The Psalmist said: ‘<em>You made all the delicate, inner parts of my body and knit me together in my mother’s womb. Thank you for making me so wonderfully complex! Your workmanship is marvellous—how well I know it. You watched me as I was being formed in utter seclusion, as I was woven together in the dark of the womb. You saw me before I was born. Every day of my life was recorded in your book. Every moment was laid out before a single day had passed. How precious are your thoughts about me, O God</em>…’ (Psalm 139:13–17 NLT)</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Num 19-21, Luke 7:36-50, Ps 111, Prov 3:29-30<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65391&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.' Romans 8:18 KJV<br /><br /><p>When Viktor Frankl was sent to Auschwitz, he’d been researching a book on <em>Finding Life’s Meaning</em>. But when his clothes were suddenly taken from him, including the manuscript he’d hidden in his coat lining, he questioned whether his life had real meaning at all. Then something happened: the Nazis gave him the rags of an inmate who’d just been sent to the gas chamber and Frankl found in the pocket a page containing a Jewish prayer (from Deuteronomy 6:4–5): ‘<em>Hear, O Israel! The Lord our God is one God. And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might</em>.’ ‘How should I interpret such a coincidence?’ he asked himself. ‘Other than to live my thoughts instead of merely putting them on paper?’ Later he wrote, ‘Nothing in the world will so effectively help you to survive as the knowledge that there is a purpose to your life. He who has a “why” to live for, can bear almost any “how”.’ Charles Dickens was lame. Homer was blind. Plato was a hunchback. Sir Walter Scott was paralysed; Paul spent almost seven years of his ministry in prison. What gave each of these people the stamina to overcome their circumstances? Purpose! Each of them had a dream, fuelled by a fire within that could not be extinguished. They had a ‘why’ that was bigger than every ‘how’.

<introtext><![CDATA['...God will bring every work into judgment, including every secret thing, whether good or evil.' Ecclesiastes 12:14 NKJV<br /><br /><p>One of the chief attributes of God is His omniscience. It’s a word comprising two parts. The first part, ‘omni’, means ‘all’, and the second part, ‘science’, relates to knowledge. That means He is an omniscient God who knows everything you say, everything you think and everything you do. The story is told of a wealthy grandfather who had a hearing aid fitted. When he went for a routine check–up, his doctor commented, ‘Your family must be happy to know that now you can hear.’ The grandfather said, ‘Actually, I haven’t told them about the hearing aid. I just sit around and listen to their conversations—and I’ve already changed my will twice!’ God wants to bless you, but sin and disobedience can keep that from happening. When David committed adultery with Bathsheba, he tried to conceal it. But God exposed him. In God’s eyes the only thing that’s worse than sin is your unwillingness to own up to it. Finally, David came clean and prayed, ‘<em>Against You, You only, have I sinned, and done this evil in Your sight</em>…’ (Psalm 51:4 NKJV) Then he added, ‘<em>Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.</em>’ (Psalm 51:7 NKJV) Note two important words: ‘hyssop’, which spoke of a branch dipped in blood during Passover, and ‘wash’. David needed a spiritual bath and God gave him one. The fact is, God knows your ‘<em>every work…whether good or evil</em>’, and no matter how badly you’ve failed He will cleanse you, forgive you, and restore your joy.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Num 25-26, Luke 8:16-25, Ps 120, Prov 3:33-35<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65394&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Blessed is he who considers the poor...' Psalm 41:1 NKJV<br /><br /><p>One of the most common excuses for not giving to the needy is: ‘I had to work hard for what I’ve got; so should they.’ True, the Bible teaches that if you’re not willing to work you’re not entitled to support (2 Thessalonians 3:10). But did you know: (1) Six million children under five die every year of starvation? (2) One out of seven people goes to bed hungry every night? (3) The three richest people on the planet have more collective wealth than the combined gross national product of the world’s 48 poorest countries? General Booth, who founded the Salvation Army, said, ‘How can you convince a man of the love of God if his feet are perishing with the cold?’ If your prayers aren’t being answered, here’s something to consider. The Israelites fasted and prayed, then complained that God wasn’t answering their prayers. That’s when He told them: ‘<em>The kind of fasting I want is this: Remove the chains of oppression and the yoke of injustice, and let the oppressed go free. Share your food with the hungry and open your homes to the homeless poor. Give clothes to those who have nothing to wear… Then My favour will shine on you…and your wounds will be quickly healed. I will always be with you to save you; My presence will protect you on every side. When you pray, I will answer you.</em>’ (Isaiah 58:6–9 GNT) When you care for the needy, the Lord promises to ‘<em>deliver [you] in times of trouble</em>’ (Psalm 41:1 NKJV)—and you can take that to the bank.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Num 27-29, Luke 8:26-39, Ps 67, Prov 4:1-2<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65395&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in His steps.' 1 Peter 2:21 NIV<br /><br /><p>At creation God said, ‘<em>Let us make human beings in our image and likeness…</em>’ (Genesis 1:26 NCV) Clearly God’s intention for each of us has always been to reflect His nature, His character, His purposes, His thoughts, and His ways. And if you want to know what that looks like, examine the life of Christ. Paul said, ‘<em>Now He [Jesus] is the exact likeness of the unseen God [the visible representation of the invisible]; He is the Firstborn of all creation.</em>’ (Colossians 1:15 AMP) So your greatest goal, especially if you want to be used by God, must be Christ–like–ness. That means you should endeavour to handle situations as He did, and treat people the way He would. Peter writes, ‘<em>For even to this were you called [it is inseparable from your vocation]…Christ…suffered for you, leaving you [His personal] example…that you should follow in His footsteps</em>.’ (1 Peter 2:21 AMP) Jesus is your example when it comes to these three things: (1) <em>Suffering</em>. When He was mistreated, instead of retaliating He responded with love, patience, and kindness. (2) <em>Serving</em>. He stooped to wash the feet of His disciples, then told them to follow His example because even the lowest menial should not be beneath them (John 13:15–17). (3) <em>Submitting</em>. He said, ‘<em>…I carry out the will of the One who sent me, not My own will.</em>’ (John 5:30 NLT) And here’s the good news: God will keep working on you—indeed; He’s committed to it—to bring you to the place where in every circumstance of life, you act the same way as Jesus.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Num 30:1-32:24, Luke 8:40-56, Ps 125, Prov 4:3-4<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65398&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Indeed, the &quot;right time&quot; is now.' 2 Corinthians 6:2 NLT<br /><br /><p>The story of this incapacitated man’s healing is rich in lessons. Let’s look at them for the next few days: (1)<em> He was in a beautiful situation but he wasn’t enjoying it</em>. ‘…<em>A man who was lame from birth was being carried to the temple gate called Beautiful, where he was put every day to beg</em>…’ (Acts 3:2 NIV) When you have a stubborn problem, even if you’re in a beautiful situation, you can’t enjoy it. (2) <em>He was close to the answer but it was beyond his reach</em>. Every day he sat at the Temple gates watching others go in and be blessed. But because of his condition, the Law of Moses prevented him from doing the same. Is that where you are today—in church, but not able to receive what God has for you? You sing the songs, pray the prayers, and listen to the sermons, but you still have the same old problem? (3) <em>When his moment of deliverance came, he needed help to seize it</em>. ‘<em>Peter said…“In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk.” Taking him by the right hand, he helped him up</em>…’ (Acts 3:6–7 NIV) This man had no reason to think that today would be any different. He didn’t know God had earmarked it on His calendar as the day of his deliverance. And this could be your day! ‘<em>At just the right time, I heard you. On the day of salvation, I helped you</em>.’ (2 Corinthians 6:2 NLT) The ‘right time’ for you is now. But it won’t happen until you acknowledge your need of God and get ready to receive His help. That means keeping your faith strong, your heart open, and speaking God’s promises over your situation.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Is 53:1-12, Acts 8:26-40 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65399&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...A man who was lame from birth was being carried to the Temple gate...to beg.' Acts 3:2 NIV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says: ‘<em>When he saw Peter and John…he asked them for money…Then Peter said, “Silver and gold I do not have, but what I have I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk.” Taking him by the right hand, he helped him up, and instantly…he jumped to his feet and began to walk</em>…’ (Acts 3:3–8 NIV) This story raises three questions: (1) <em>What’s your area of weakness?</em> That’s important to know, because a handicap in one area can cripple you in other areas. Apart from lacking strength in his ankles this man was normal, but his weakness stopped him from living a happy life. We all struggle with something. <em>‘The temptations in your life are no different from what others experience…</em>’ (1 Corinthians 10:13 NLT) (2) <em>How are you handling your weakness?</em> This man was at the Temple gate to beg. Why are you there? You need to know that, before you can get up and move on. Refuse to settle there; rise up and say: ‘This may be who I am now, but by God’s grace it’s not who I’m going to be!’ (3) <em>What are you expecting?</em> A crutch to help you live with your problem? A way to avoid doing what’s necessary to become whole? This man was looking for handouts, not healing. But handouts won’t get you back on your feet. Furthermore, when your focus is limited to what people can do for you, it can cause you to miss what God can do for you. By God’s power this man got up and walked—and you can, too.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Num 32:25-33:56, Luke 9:1-17, Ps 134, Prov 4:5-13<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65400&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Taking him by the right hand, he helped him up...' Acts 3:7 NIV<br /><br /><p>A few important observations: (1) <em>Peter allowed God to change his plans</em>. ‘…<em>Peter and John were going up to the temple at the time of prayer—at three in the afternoon.</em>’ (Acts 3:1 NIV) Is prayer important? Yes, it’s all–important! But you can get so caught up in church activities that you walk past hurting people sitting on the church’s doorstep. You must be sensitive to people’s needs, available to God, and willing to change your plans at a moment’s notice. (2) <em>Peter used the name that’s bigger than any problem</em>. ‘…<em>In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk</em>.’ (Acts 3:6 NIV) And he did! Paul writes, ‘…<em>At the name of Jesus every knee should bow…every tongue should confess that Jesus…is Lord…</em>’ (Philippians 2:10–11 NKJV) You say, ‘What’s in a name?’ In this case—everything! At the name of Jesus hell trembles, sin is forgiven, sickness is healed and stubborn habits broken. (3) <em>Peter did more than pray</em>; he extended a helping hand. ‘<em>Taking him by the right hand, he helped him up, and instantly the man’s feet and ankles became strong. He jumped to his feet and began to walk</em>.’ (Acts 3:7–8 NIV) Today you’re surrounded by people who need help to get back on their feet spiritually, emotionally, physically, and financially. Reach out in love and lift them! They don’t need you to spend the rest of your life supporting them. They just need a hand up—and an introduction to the One who’s able and waiting to meet their need. God used Peter to bring deliverance to this man, and He will use you too. But you have to be ready.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Num 34-36, Luke 9:18-27, Ps 138, Prov 4:14-17<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65401&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I require...the first-fruits and the choicest of your contributions...' Ezekiel 20:40 AMP<br /><br /><p>In the Old Testament, the first part of the harvest was to be offered to God in gratitude. So when God says, ‘…<em>I require…the first–fruits and the choicest of your contributions</em>,’ it means instead of fitting Him into your agenda you must put Him at the top. Notice: He wants your ‘first–fruits’, not your leftovers. Increasingly, Christian bloggers are saying they’ve trained themselves to start each day by giving God the first–fruits of their time. Realising that they’re not going to get through the day peacefully otherwise. So, at the beginning of the day, they spend as much time with God as necessary to walk in the Fruit of the Spirit throughout the day. Giving the choicest part of the day to God gives Him the ‘first–fruits’. Giving Him the first moments of the morning helps keep our priorities straight for the rest of the day. If you want to be like these bloggers, don’t use this gift of time with God to mull over your problems. Set your heart as the Psalmist did: ‘…<em>I trusted in, relied on, and was confident in You, O Lord; I said, “You are my God. My times are in Your hands.”</em>’ (Psalm 31:14–15 AMP) Note the words: ‘<em>my times are in Your hands</em>…’ Each day will bring times of joy, times of testing, times of challenge, and times of temptation. That’s why you need to pray, ‘Lord, each hour of this day I’m depending on You. Let my words, my attitudes, my decisions, and my actions bring glory to You.’</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Jonah 1-4, Luke 9:28-36, Ps 141, Prov 4:18-19<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65402&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['When I heard these things, I sat down and wept...' Nehemiah 1:4 NIV<br /><br /><p>In spite of impossible odds and implacable enemies, Nehemiah rebuilt the walls of Jerusalem in just 52 days. It was an incredible accomplishment! And he wasn’t even a builder; he was a waiter in the palace of Artaxerxes, a heathen king. Pioneer rocket scientist Robert Goddard said, ‘It’s difficult to say what is impossible, for the dream of yesterday is the hope of today and the reality of tomorrow.’ So before you say, ‘It can’t be done,’ or ‘I don’t have the qualifications,’ let’s examine Nehemiah’s story for the next few days. The first lesson we learn is: you must find a need that moves you. ‘<em>They said to me… “The wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates have been burned with fire.” When I heard these things, I sat down and wept. For some days I mourned…fasted and prayed before…God…</em>’ (Nehemiah 1:3–4 NIV) And what did Nehemiah fast and pray for? ‘…<em>Give your servant success…</em>’ (Nehemiah 1:11 NIV) When you find a need that moves you to tears and causes you to say, ‘Something must be done about this!’ the chances are that God’s calling you to do something. You may be a leader like Nehemiah, or you may simply be like one of the followers who helped him. Either way, when God stirs your heart about a need, He’s calling you to get involved and take action. If you’re willing to say, ‘Yes!’ then He’ll place Heaven’s resources at your disposal. When your heart says, ‘This is what I was born to do,’ you may have found your life’s vision.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Titus 1-3, Luke 9:37-45, Ps 145:1-13, Prov 4:20-22<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65403&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...If it pleases the king and if your servant has found favour in his sight...' Nehemiah 2:5 NIV<br /><br /><p>Pray for favour with the right people. When you study the lives of successful people, you’ll find they had vision, patience, determination, character and talent. And you’ll also find one more thing at work—favour. There are some closed doors that will open when you approach them in faith, and there are other doors that’ll open only with help from the right people. That’s when you need favour! Alex Haley, the author of <em>Roots</em>, had a picture in his office. It was of a turtle sitting on top of a tall fencepost, and the caption read, ‘You can be sure he didn’t get up there by himself’! Nehemiah needed an army to protect him, and resources to enable him to build. So he prayed, then went to the one man who could provide what he needed: the king. He said, ‘<em>If it pleases the king and if your servant has found favour in his sight, let him send me to the city in Judah where my fathers are buried so that I can rebuild it</em>.’ (Nehemiah 2:5 NIV) And the king did. There’s an important lesson here: when your heart is set on promoting God’s kingdom, He will give you ‘kingdom connections’. But be careful; your help may not always come via the people you expect, agree with, or even like. God used a heathen king to help Nehemiah, and He used a penniless widow to feed the prophet Elijah. Don’t dictate to God who He can and cannot use. Just pray for favour, expect it, and accept it with thanks in whatever form He sends it.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Th 1-5, Luke 9:46-56, Ps 145:14-21, Prov 4:23-24<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65404&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...They replied, &quot;Let us start rebuilding.&quot; So they began this good work.' Nehemiah 2:18 NIV<br /><br /><p>It’s said that of all the people who have dreams, only one out of ten will fulfil theirs. Why? Because the other nine never started! To enter the Promised Land, the Israelites had to cross the Jordan River when it was in flood and they were afraid. But God told them that when the priests stepped into the water it would roll back. (See Joshua 3) It did, and they reached their destiny. So, what are you waiting for? (1)<em> Perfect conditions?</em> You’ll never find them. ‘<em>Whoever watches the wind will not plant; whoever looks at the clouds will not reap.</em>’ (Ecclesiastes 11:4 NIV) The New Living Translation says, ‘<em>If you wait for perfect conditions, you will never get anything done.</em>’ You say, ‘I’m waiting for God to move.’ Has it occurred to you that maybe He’s waiting for you to move? (2) <em>Everybody to agree with you?</em> When David announced his intention to fight Goliath, his older brother Eliab, a general in King Saul’s army, told him to go back home because he was embarrassing the family. But David refused to be put off or put down; instead, he went out and defeated the giant. And with God’s help you can too! (3) <em>Until you feel ‘qualified’?</em> God doesn’t always call the qualified, but He always qualifies the called. Regardless of your education, nationality, or gender, God can use you. Oliver Wendell Holmes started studying Greek at eighty. When a friend asked him why, he replied, ‘Frankly, it’s now or never!’ Because Nehemiah was willing to start, God gave him a glorious finish. And He will do the same for you. So what are you waiting for? Get moving!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Heb 1-4, Luke 9:57-62, Ps 149, Prov 4:25-27<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65405&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Lord, let Your ear be attentive to the prayer of this Your servant...' Nehemiah 1:11 NIV<br /><br /><p>You must ask God for the plan. Why? Because the only plan He will bless is the one He gives you. Every good idea isn’t necessarily a God–idea. The Bible says, ‘<em>Many are the plans in a man’s heart, but it is the Lord’s purpose that prevails</em>.’ (Proverbs 19:21 NIV) How will you know your plan lines up with God’s plan, especially when you encounter obstacles and opposition? In two ways: (1) <em>A fire will burn within you</em>. Jeremiah said, ‘…<em>His Word is in my heart like a fire…shut up in my bones. I am weary of holding it in; indeed, I cannot</em>.’ (Jeremiah 20:9 NIV) When God places a burning desire within you, He will enable you to rise above the adverse circumstances that surround you. You’ll find yourself drawn, driven, directed, and dedicated. You may not always be able to explain it to others, but you’ll know deep inside that you are in the will of God. (2)<em> God will show you the right path to take</em>. ‘…<em>along unfamiliar paths I will guide them; I will turn the darkness into light before them and make the rough places smooth. These are the things I will do; I will not forsake them</em>.’ (Isaiah 42:16 NIV) Note the words ‘<em>unfamiliar paths… darkness… rough places</em>’, but don’t be thrown or discouraged by them. Instead, expect them! David said, ‘<em>The Lord will work out His plans for my life—for Your faithful love, O Lord, endures forever</em>…’ (Psalm 138:8 NLT) And David’s God is your God—He hasn’t changed one tiny bit!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Isa 9:1-7, Luke 2:1-7, Matt 4:12-16<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65406&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Those who carried materials did their work with one hand and held a weapon in the other.' Nehemiah 4:17 NIV<br /><br /><p>Do you know how Nehemiah’s team rebuilt the walls of Jerusalem? With a sword in one hand and a trowel in the other. Why is that significant? Because even though God gives you the plan, the chances are you’ll have to fight for it. Not everyone wants you to succeed. In fact, some will do everything they can to stop you. That’s when you must constantly remind yourself that God gave you the plan, that He’s on your side, and that if you’re willing to persevere, you’ll win. God guarantees it! Listen to what Nehemiah’s enemies said about him: ‘<em>It is reported…you are about to become their king and have even appointed prophets to make this proclamation about you in Jerusalem: “There is a king in Judah!” Now this report will get back to the king…</em>’ (Nehemiah 6:6–7 NIV) Nehemiah had to overcome threats and intimidation. He wrote: ‘…<em>They were scheming to harm me; so I sent messengers to them with this reply: “I am carrying on a great project and cannot go down. Why should the work stop while I leave it to go down to you?</em>”’ (Nehemiah 6:2–3 NIV) Every minute devoted to your critics is time stolen from your God–given assignment. Don’t step down to their level! It’s not what your enemies say that matters; it’s what what God’s Word says to you when your enemies have finished talking that matters. ‘<em>[Nehemiah] answered them by saying, “The God of Heaven will give us success…but as for you, you will have no share in Jerusalem or any claim…to it.”</em>’ (Nehemiah 2:20 NIV) Now that’s the winning attitude.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Heb 5-8, Luke 10:1-12, Ps 5, Prov 5:1-2<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65407&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Wise people are rewarded...' Proverbs 14:24 GNT<br /><br /><p>The Bible says, ‘<em>Wise people are rewarded</em>.’ So keep learning. Knowledge in most major fields is exploding, and if you don’t stay up to date you’ll be left behind. Repeating the same lessons over and over means you’re not learning enough. Study those who’ve succeeded where you want to succeed, in order to know what to do and what not to do. U.S. Admiral Hyman Rickover said, ‘You have to learn from the mistakes of others; you won’t live long enough to make them all yourself.’ So: (1) <em>Respect those with experience and expertise greater than your own</em>. Instead of shrinking away from them, reach for them. The Bible says, ‘<em>God has given each of you some special abilities…use them to help each other…</em>’ (1 Peter 4:10 TLB) We all struggle in certain areas; be careful lest your insecurity be misinterpreted as arrogance. (2) <em>Become a good listener</em>. Don’t try to impress people by seeking to be their intellectual equal. If you find yourself in a discussion that intimidates you, ask questions, talk only about what you know, listen attentively, and the next time you meet you’ll be that much further ahead. (3) <em>The more you prepare yourself, the more opportunities you’ll get</em>. Don’t go to a lesson unless you’ve done your homework. When God starts taking you higher, prepare your speech, your wardrobe, and your mind. Consult a trusted friend who understands where you are, and where you need to go. If you can’t find one, read up until you grasp the basics. ‘<em>A king rejoices in servants who know what they are doing</em>…’ (Proverbs 14:35 TLB) The more prepared you are, the more God will open doors of opportunity for you.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Num 6:1-21, Mt 4:1-17, Mk 2:18-22, Lk 9:23-26<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65409&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Share in the troubles we have like a good soldier of Christ Jesus.' 2 Timothy 2:3 NCV<br /><br /><p>Salvation enlists you into the service of Jesus, the King of Kings. His battles become your battles, and His strategies your strategies. There are no exemptions; you’re ‘in for the long haul’. Satan has declared war on you, and it’s ‘conquer or be conquered’. He will attack you on three fronts. Let’s look at each: First, the attack from the world. Do you ever feel like you don’t ‘fit in’? You’re not supposed to! ‘…<em>Don’t you realise that friendship with the world makes you an enemy of God? I say it again: If you want to be a friend of the world, you make yourself an enemy of God</em>.’ (James 4:4 NLT) The line has been drawn; there’s no peaceful coexistence in this war. What is ‘worldliness’? It’s not being in the world, but being like it. It’s not mixing with the world, but blending in with its self–centred values, its ‘relative’ morality and its attitudes toward God, His cause, His Word, and His people. The world’s hunger for power, popularity and self–promotion contradicts the principles of Scripture. ‘…<em>Genuine religion in the sight of God [is]…refusing to let the world corrupt you</em>.’ (James 1:27 NLT) Jesus told us to avoid becoming swept up in the world’s obsession with material things, or its fear of not having enough to meet our needs (Matthew 6:25–34). You are called to be ‘<em>salt</em>’ and ‘<em>light</em>’ (Matthew 5:13–14). You are to be the influencer, not the influenced. When the world can’t tell you apart from them, your light has gone out and your salt has lost its flavour.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Heb 11:17-13:25, Luke 10:25-37, Ps 33:1-12, Prov 5:7-14<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65410&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Make no provision for the flesh...' Romans 13:14 NAS <br /><br /><p>The second attack: the attack from the flesh. Your most vulnerable point is your ‘flesh’, which drives you to do your own thing. Its motto is ‘It’s all about me!’ From start to finish it ‘looks out for number one’, always wanting to be ‘first in line’. That’s the genetic make–up of our flesh. And it can’t be saved, sanctified, or spiritualised because ‘<em>That which is born of the flesh is flesh</em>…’ (John 3:6 NKJV) and nothing else. ‘<em>The Spirit and your desires are enemies of each other. They are always fighting each other and keeping you from doing what you feel you should</em>.’ (Galatians 5:17 CEV) So how do you control your ‘flesh’? (1) <em>Make a choice</em>. ‘…<em>Choose today whom you will serve</em>…’ (Joshua 24:15 GWT) During the American Civil War thousands of Yankee and Confederate soldiers were killed by ‘friendly fire’. Why? Because they lacked uniforms that identified the side to which they belonged. Be clear about which side you’re on, and let those around you know it. (2) <em>Cut the supply lines to the flesh</em>. In wartime, generals devote a lot of attention to blowing up bridges, highways and railroads to deprive the enemy of the vital supplies they need to win. Your flesh can’t control you if you cut off its supply line. ‘…<em>Don’t let yourself think about ways to indulge your evil desires</em>.’ (Romans 13:14 NLT) (3) <em>Maintain regular communication with base command</em>. Even well–trained soldiers with the finest equipment and best officers can’t win when they’re cut off from base command. So stay in touch: ‘<em>Pray in the Spirit at all times and on every occasion…</em>’ (Ephesians 6:18 NLT)</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Ki 1-2, Luke 10:38-42, Ps 33:13-22, Prov 5:15-20<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65411&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['God places the lonely in families...' Psalm 68:6 NLT<br /><br /><p>Life in God’s family can be challenging. To enjoy and fulfil your role as a family member you must understand three things: (1) <em>Your rights</em>. When you trusted Christ as your Saviour you became a member of God’s redeemed family (John 3:3–6). That means you have the right to be accepted, loved, protected, respected, provided for, trained, equipped, and rewarded. Regardless of your past mistakes, God guarantees you these rights, so embrace and enjoy them. (2) <em>The rules of the house</em>. Without the rule of law, you end up with anarchy. And it’s the same in a family. Can you imagine what would happen if the kids ran the house? Well, God’s family isn’t a democracy. You don’t get to vote on the rules. God has established unchanging principles in His Word that guarantee His blessing. ‘<em>If you are…obedient, you shall eat the good of the land</em>.’ (Isaiah 1:19 NKJV) (3) <em>Our responsibilities to one another</em>. You’re called to accept, love and help your brothers and sisters even when they’re selfish, immature, critical and irresponsible. Remember that God’s family is still ‘under construction’, but it’s much better than any other alternative! You need to participate in regular family life and activities. Early church believers met together ‘daily’ (Acts 2:46); as a result they survived all Satan’s attempts to destroy them. So support the life and mission of your church family with your tithes, talent and time. Don’t just be a taker; ‘…<em>God loves a cheerful giver</em>.’ (2 Corinthians 9:7 NIV)</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Ki 8-9, Luke 11:29-44, Ps 40:9-17, Prov 6:6-8<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2015</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=65415&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...God's Spirit, who is in you, is greater than the devil, who is in the world.' 1 John 4:4 NCV</p>
<p><em>The third attack: the attack from Satan</em>. We either trivialise or exaggerate Satan's power and each spells trouble! The first makes you feel vulnerable; the second creates in you an unfounded fear. Understanding Satan's ways—and your weapons—equips you to handle his attacks and resist him. How can you do that? (1) <em>By understanding that God effectively destroyed Satan's power through Christ's victory at the cross</em>. '<em>He stripped the rulers and authorities of their power and made a public spectacle of them as He celebrated His victory in Christ</em>.' (Colossians 2:15 GWT) Satan's attempt to destroy Jesus backfired in a glorious defeat that allows you to celebrate your victory in Christ! (2) <em>By understanding that</em> '...<em>God's Spirit, who is in you, is greater than the devil, who is in the world</em>.' (1 John 4:4 NCV) No power is greater than the Spirit of God who lives within you. If you abide in Christ, Satan can't control or conquer you. Why? Because he would have to overcome Jesus to do it! (3) <em>By understanding that, you can defeat Satan because Jesus has</em> '...<em>given you authority over all the power of the enemy</em>...' (Luke 10:19 NLT) The criminal must submit to the police officer because the officer is vested with and backed up by the full authority of the government. So when you draw on the authority God has given you in Christ, Satan has no choice; he must observe the limits God places on him. He can do nothing without God's permission and God empowers us to resist him. Job is a perfect example and Satan hopes you never discover that!</p>

By forgiving, you set yourself free to enjoy life. (</span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>2) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Releasing the wrongdoer from all expectations.</em></span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>By changing your expectations, you reclaim your peace of mind. Whether or not the other person changes is his or her business—move on! Requiring a certain response keeps you bound to them. Paul says, ‘We have freedom now, because Christ made us free. So stand strong. Do not change and go back into the slavery of the law.’ (Galatians 5:1 NCV) (</span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>3) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Transferring to God all expectations for your needs.</em></span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>His Word says, ‘God will supply all your needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.’ (Philippians 4:19 NAS) Note the word ‘all’. God can supply the people, resources and opportunities you need to live a joyful life. (</span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>4) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Asking God to bless your offender.</em></span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>Yes, it’s difficult, but Jesus said, ‘Love your enemies! Pray for those who persecute you!’ (Matthew 5:44 NLT) That kind of prayer puts you in the driver’s seat of your life. (</span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>5) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Doing something nice for your offender.</em></span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>Ask God how you can bless them. ‘If your enemies are hungry, feed them. If they are thirsty, give them something to drink. In doing this, you will…conquer evil by doing good.’ (Romans 12:20–21 NLT) You defeat anger and bitterness by believing and acting on God’s Word.</span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Whenever I am afraid, I will trust in You.' Psalm 56:3 NKJV <br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span class=&quot;2dropcap&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>T</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>he solution to financial worry isn’t necessarily having more money. Indeed, the more money you have, the more you have to lose. And the thought of losing it can cause you to worry more, not less. It’s a vicious circle. Trying to find security in money is like tying a boat to a dock; when a big enough storm comes along, the ropes will break and it’ll be swept away. So since we </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>all</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>wonder when the next economic storm will hit, what’s the answer? More rope? Stronger rope? Tighter knots? No—that just gives you knots in your stomach! For the next few days let’s look at some Bible answers to money worries: </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Tackle your fear head–on.</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>The Psalmist said, ‘Whenever I am afraid, I will trust in You.’ Now, since David was a king, he probably didn’t worry a lot about money. But he </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>did </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>worry about his enemies stalking him, catching him off guard and killing him. We each have different areas of worry, and the ones that control us are called ‘core fears’. Sometimes you can keep them at bay; other times they control and consume you and make you act in ways you’re not proud of. Christian financial advisor Ron Blue says that for years he was trapped by the fear of not having enough money, or losing what he had. The people around him didn’t know it, but that’s what drove him. Today he’s a best–selling author and financial counsellor to multitudes. But to get there he had to confront his core fear, and trust more in God than he did in himself. And so will you. </span></p>

<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span class=&quot;2dropcap&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>A</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>nger is often the product of frustrated expectations. We expect something, and when we don’t get it we end up disappointed and angry. And our anger leads to a dysfunctional personal, spiritual and relational lifestyle. Frustrated expectations are often rooted in early experiences with our parents, siblings and authority figures. Perhaps our needs for love, acceptance, security and significance were never met; then later we experienced broken commitments in marriage, business and friendships. Ultimately, smouldering anger becomes a weapon in our arsenal, threatening to hurt everything and everybody we care about. We become bitter people—avoided, excluded and lonely. God instructs us to ‘get rid of all bitterness’, so that ‘no bitter root grows up to cause trouble and defile many.’ (Hebrews 12:15 NIV) How do we obey His command? (</span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>1)<em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;> By believing and acting on His Word.</em></span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>Without a Scriptural foundation, old emotions will repeatedly undermine your efforts to overcome them. ‘Get rid of all bitterness’ is an order that implies the promise of success when you obey it. (</span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>2) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>By choosing to be released from bitterness.</em> </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>Choice isn’t an emotion, and it doesn’t require an emotional response. God won’t control your emotions, but neither will He be influenced by them. Believing God’s Word and making the choice to obey it always results in success. So start strengthening your will and your faith. How? By choosing to obey God in spite of your feelings! Practise this every day until it becomes a lifestyle. Then instead of being mastered by your moods, you’ll find yourself ‘reigning in life’ (Romans 5:17), no longer controlled by your negative emotions. </span></p>

When it came to business practices, he had more angles than a pyramid! First he cheated his older brother, Esau, then his father–in–law, Laban. Then, one night, the Angel of the Lord showed up in his tent and Jacob wrestled with Him until daybreak. As the sun rose, the Angel said to him, ‘Let me go, for it is daybreak.’ But Jacob said, ‘I will not let you go unless you bless me.’ At that point the Angel told him he would no longer be called by his old name, Jacob, which means ‘deceiver’, but by his new name, Israel, which means ‘a prince with God’. Up until this time Jacob thought making money would make him happy, but it didn’t; it almost cost him his family. Sound familiar? But after wrestling with God he received a new name, a new nature, a new walk and a new future. Isn’t that what you want too? Well, the good news is—you can have it! The Bible says, ‘If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.’<br /> (2 Corinthians 5:17 NKJV) Jacob was a self–made man. The problem was he wasn’t enjoying the life he’d made for himself. He didn’t know he’d been born for a purpose greater than merely acquiring ‘stuff’, and it was only in God’s presence that he discovered this. His story in a nutshell is this: Jacob was who he was. He wanted to be like Esau. But, Israel, a prince with God, was who God made him. And God can do the same for you if you will follow Him. </span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The commands of the Lord are radiant, giving light to the eyes.' Psalm 19:8 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span class=&quot;2dropcap&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>T</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>he Psalmist writes, ‘The commands of the Lord are radiant, giving light to the eyes.’ God can put an idea in your mind that changes the direction of your life. Marconi had an idea and the result was the radio. Bell had an idea and the result was the telephone. God, the Creator, gives creative ideas to people all the time. But you must act on them; otherwise He will give them to somebody else. Isn’t it time you asked Him for one of His ideas for your life? The fact that you believe in God is wonderful. But here’s something equally wonderful—God is committed to His purposes in you! Instead of looking at your present situation and thinking, ‘I guess my life’s as good as it’s ever going to get,’ start asking, ‘Lord, what do You have in mind for me?’ If you let it, life can beat you down and make you feel low, lost, lacking, and limited in ability and potential. And if you act on these feelings and thoughts instead of what God says about you in His Word, you’ll never move forward and fulfil what He put you on this earth to do. You say, ‘God has never given me one of His great ideas.’ Maybe that’s because you have never asked Him for one! He gives them to seeking hearts, prepared hearts, faith–filled hearts, obedient hearts and those who seek and trust in His Word.. Here’s a profile of the kind of person God gives great ideas to: ‘His delight is in the Law of the Lord, and on His Law he meditates day and night…Whatever he does shall prosper.’ (Psalm 1:2–3 NKJV)</span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA['He came seeking fruit on it and found none.' Luke 13:6 NKJV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span class=&quot;2dropcap&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>J</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>esus said: ‘A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it and found none. Then he said to the keeper of his vineyard, “Look, for three years I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none. Cut it down; why does it use up the ground?” But he answered and said to him, “Sir, let it alone this year also, until I dig around it and fertilise it. And if it bears fruit, well. But if not, after that you can cut it down.”’ (Luke 13:6–9 NKJV) How long have you been serving the Lord? What are the tangible ‘fruits’ of your service to Him? We’re not all capable of the same level of productivity. Jesus taught that some of us have thirtyfold potential, some sixtyfold, and some a hundredfold (Matthew 13:8). The faith and giftings given to each of us by God are what determine our level of productivity. For example, God doesn’t expect a ‘thirtyfolder’ to produce a sixtyfold harvest. He’s not an unreasonable taskmaster. But if this parable teaches us anything, it’s that God won’t let you just sit on your hands and do nothing. The words, ‘cut it down’, are a sobering reminder of this. God is patient. He will work with you year after year in an attempt to bring you to the place of spiritual maturity where you can fulfil the purpose for which He brought you into His Kingdom. But if after all His efforts you refuse to produce fruit, He will go elsewhere and find what He’s looking for. The main thing is, in the end, God’s purposes </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>will</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>be fulfilled! </span></p>

But when fear becomes your fixed state of mind, something’s wrong; it’s time to unwrap the package. Fear can be hereditary, passed from generation to generation. And it can trap you in a cycle that’s hard to break. But you can break it! Gideon tore down the altar where his family had worshipped idols for generations—and they were angry with him when he did it (Judges 6:25–30). But Gideon knew that in order to win in life, he must trust in nobody but God. (</span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>2) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Rise above your past failures.</em></span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>Have you made bad investments and now you’re afraid to take a risk? Are you hoarding as a hedge against future failure? Here’s the problem: nothing ventured, nothing gained! In football, the players who score the most goals are often the ones who miss the most chances. But they keep trying because if they don’t aim for the goal they can’t win. A barn filled with seed doesn’t produce a harvest. Furthermore, when the farmer plants his seed, drought and frost and pests can wipe him out. Yet if he doesn’t plant, failure is guaranteed. Getting the idea?<br /> </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>(3) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Anticipate God’s goodness.</em></span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>As you get older you become more risk–averse, more inclined to look for a safe harbour. That’s understandable, but you can’t let fear control your life.

Prayer is submitting to God in the situation, letting Him know your requests and asking for His will to be done. <span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes;&quot;> </span>(</span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>2) ‘I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, so that you may be established.’</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>(Romans 1:11 NKJV) What did Paul long for? The chance to strengthen his fellow believers, and he was willing to travel a long way at great personal risk to do it. When two people decide to recognise and nurture the God–given gifts in each other, not only are they blessed </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>personally</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>, everybody around them benefits too.

There are powerful dynamics at work here! First, we pray for one another. Second, we recognise and nurture God’s gifts in one another. Third, we unite our faith and focus on a shared goal. Paul said: ‘For the Kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. For he who in this way serves Christ is acceptable to God and approved by men. So then we pursue the things which make for peace and the building up of one another.’ (Romans 14:17-19 NAS) </span></p>

Instead of focusing on behaviour you don’t want, praise and reward behaviour you want more of. If your child feels like you’re always ‘on their back’ instead of ‘on their team’ about how they dress, their friends, their music, etc., they’ll resist you at every turn. The Bible says about parenting: (a) ‘Children, obey your parents.’ (Ephesians 6:1 NKJV) (b) ‘Do not exasperate your children.’ (Ephesians 6:4 NIV) Use the carrot and stick approach. If you’re all ‘stick’ and no ‘carrot’ you’ll provoke them into rebelling, going undercover and cutting off communication. And if you grew up in a home where you were never praised or rewarded, you’ll have to work harder to break the cycle. Exploding at your teen just teaches them to handle their own anger explosively. Expect to be shocked and be prepared to respond constructively. If you take their mood swings and inconsistencies personally, you’ll end up reacting in ways you regret. Do you remember your own adolescence and how </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>you</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>felt about your parents’ opinions, tastes and rules? Mark Twain said: ‘When I was fourteen my dad was so ignorant I could hardly stand to have him around. But when I got to be twenty–one I was astonished at how much the old man had learned in seven years!’ If you’re raising a teen, here are two Scriptures worth remembering: ‘Love never fails.’ (1 Corinthians 13:8 NKJV) ‘Use wisdom and understanding to establish your home.’ (Proverbs 24:3 CEV)</span></p>

<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span class=&quot;2dropcap&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>I</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>f you want to know God’s original intention for each of us, look at Adam. ‘God created human beings in his own image…Then God blessed them and said, “Be fruitful and multiply. Fill the earth and govern it.”’ (Genesis 1:27–28 NLT) We were created to be </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>productive</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>, to </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>multiply</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>and to </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>govern</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>. And every profession known to man is encapsulated in those three words. A priest is one who represents God on behalf of others, and others on behalf of God. But in reality, that was the original description of all of us. We were made in God’s image to continue His work of making the earth flourish, and by our flourishing, give voice to the whole earth to praise God. </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>All</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>work was designed by God to be priestly work. It’s not just professional clergy or missionaries who are called by God, nor are they more pleasing or important to Him. Bible scholar NT Wright paints a wonderful image of this concept. Picture human beings as mirrors set at a 45–degree angle between Heaven and earth. We were created to reflect God’s care and dominion of the earth, and reflect the worship and gratitude of creation back to God. This is what we do when we work. You have a calling. You are gifted. You are a priest. This isn’t just something that relates to volunteering at church. Your work is a primary place—maybe </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>the</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>primary place where your calling gets lived out. When you start seeing yourself as ‘ordained by God’ to do the job you do, it’ll put a smile on your face, a spring in your step, and add dignity to your work. </span></p>

<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span class=&quot;2dropcap&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>I</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>n his book </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Habits of the Heart</span></em></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>, sociologist Robert N. Bellah described three attitudes people have towards their work. The first group treats it as a </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>job</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>. When you do this, you see it strictly as a way to make money and pay the bills. Like the bumper sticker says, ‘I owe, I owe, so off to work I go.’ But if your main focus is on what you receive from your work, you’ll most likely come to resent it. The second group approaches work as a </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>career</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>. Here your motivation will be higher, but your focus is on advancement and prestige. That means, however, when your career isn’t going well it can feel like your self–worth is on the line. The third group sees their job as their </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>calling</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>. Now, logically speaking, if there’s a ‘calling’ there must be someone making the call, right? That someone is God. You’re not the ‘caller’, you’re the ‘call–ee’, and any work that has meaning, that can be a blessing to people, and fulfils His purposes, is a calling. A doctor or pastor might get sucked into treating work solely as a means of earning a good income, therefore they see it as just a job. On the other hand, a dustman may view what he does—making the world a cleaner place—as a calling. We’re not downgrading the importance of those who stand in pulpits and preach; we’re upgrading the importance of those who serve God forty hours a week in other jobs. The main thing is: when the job’s done well, </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>both</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>will hear the commendation, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant.’ (Matthew 25:23 NIV) </span></p>

Six months later they have left their job and bought a new house. A survey of lottery winners confirmed these two things: (1) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>The majority were more unhappy after than before winning.</em> Why? Unfulfilled demands and unmet expectations on the part of family and friends led to disappointment and resentment. (2) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>None of them would give up the money they’d won. </em>When you’ve had more money, you tend to be miserable with less. But having more money doesn’t give you more self–worth. It’s notable that the song <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Take This Job and Shove It</em> was recorded by a man named Johnny Paycheck! Isaiah wrote: ‘When a farmer ploughs for planting, does he plough continually?…Does he not plant wheat in its place?…God instructs him and teaches him the right way…All this…comes from the Lord.’ (Isaiah 28:24–29 NIV) That means whether you’re a farmer or a fireman—God gave you your job! It’s your ‘calling’, and it was designed to do more than simply provide financial security. It was designed to give you dignity and worth, and to fulfil God’s purposes on earth. It's been said: ‘All human work, however complicated or simple, is made possible by the operation of the Spirit of God in the working person; and all work whose nature and results reflect the values of the new creation is accomplished under the instruction and inspiration of the Spirit of God.’ So, ‘Whatever you do, work…with all your heart…for the Lord.’ (Colossians 3:23 NIV)</span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'The Word of the Lord came to Jonah a second time.' Jonah 3:1 NIV</p>
<p>We spend too much of our lives in the junkyard of regret. We focus on what might have been, could have been and should have been. Maybe we think that by replaying it enough we can change the outcome. But we can’t. The only thing you can control is what you do in the present. The more you replay yesterday, the further you get from today’s opportunities. And the further you move from today’s opportunities, the tougher the road back becomes. Opportunities never look as good coming as they do going. And they wait for no one, so you need to be attentive and grab them. They come in many forms, and they can come from any direction. But one thing’s for certain: they can be seen and seized only in the present. Whatever has happened in your life, has happened. And since you can’t undo it no matter how hard you try, wipe the slate clean and go on to what’s next. We all make mistakes. Jonah’s mistake caused a storm that threatened the lives of everybody around him, and ended up taking him all the way to the bottom. But that’s not the end of his story: ‘From inside the fish Jonah prayed to…God…And the Lord commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land. Then the Word of the Lord came to Jonah a second time.’ (Jonah 2:1;2:10–3:1 NIV) He’s a God of second chances—and third, fourth, and fifth ones too! ‘They are new every morning.’ (Lamentations 3:23 NIV) Today is a gift—that’s why it’s called ‘the present’. So repent of the past, seize the present and start living again!</p>

In that year he lost his children, his money, and his health. That’s when he prayed, ‘Oh, that I knew where I might find Him.’ Notice, Job didn’t pray, ‘Oh, that I knew how to get back my children, my money, and my health.’ He focused on none of those things. He realised that when you are in right standing with God, all the rest will fall into place. Here’s a truth you learn when you lose what you love: </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>when you’ve nothing left but God, you discover that God is enough! </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>Much of the book of Job is about </span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext; mso-ansi-language: EN-AU;&quot;>his confusion regarding God and his complaints</span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot;> <span lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>about his lot in life.

If you are, don’t worry. God can handle it. As long as your eyes are on </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Him,</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>He can correct you, teach you, help you, and cause you to grow stronger in faith. Job wasn’t privy to what had gone on behind the scenes. He didn’t know that a discussion had taken place between God and Satan in which Satan said that if God stripped Job of all he had, he would curse Him (Job 1:11). But God knew differently, so He allowed Satan to attack Job for a season. When it was over, God hadn’t changed His mind about Job and Job hadn’t changed his mind about God. If you’re wondering how the story ends: ‘The Lord blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning.’ (Job 42:12 NKJV) So if you’re in trouble today, your answer is—God. Keep trusting Him and He will bring you through victorious!</span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'A thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan to buffet me.' 2 Corinthians 12:7 NKJV</p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;>Paul isn’t referring to the kind of ‘thorn’ you find on rosebushes, but a sharp, pointed stake that inflicts pain. And the word ‘buffet’ means ‘to render blow after blow after blow’. This makes his next statement all the more amazing: ‘I begged the Lord three times to take this problem away from me. But He said to me, “My grace is enough for you. When you are weak, My power is made perfect in you.” So I am very happy to brag about my weaknesses. Then Christ’s power can live in me.’ (2 Corinthians 12:7–9 NCV) Paul responded to his thorny situations by doing six things: (1) Admitting he needed God’s strength. (2) Asking, even begging, for God’s help. (3) Accepting the answer when God said, ‘No.’ (4) Appreciating&amp;nbsp;it as a gift of grace. (5) Acting&amp;nbsp;with confidence and continuing to fulfil his mission. (6) Acknowledging&amp;nbsp;that the problem allowed God to work through him. When the driving force within Paul had been redirected by God, he wrote: ‘I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.’ (Galatians 2:20 NIV) Paul’s will had been taken to the cross and crucified. Now he operated in the will of God and no longer questioned the path or the price. That’s&amp;nbsp;the place God wants to bring you to!</p>

<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span class=&quot;2dropcap&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>W</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>hen asked, ‘How do you grow old so gracefully?’ Alexandre Dumas replied, ‘Because I give all my time to it.’ If you’re over fifty, let your age be measured by your spiritual progress instead of a date on the calendar. How would you like to have these words as your memorial? ‘Enoch lived…365 years. Enoch walked …with God; then he was no more, because God took him away.’ (Genesis 5:23–24 NIV) Picture this: Enoch goes for a walk with God and when they reach a certain point, God says, ‘It’s closer to My house than yours, so just come home with Me.’ Like an old oak tree, a mature Christian’s roots have weathered life’s storms. But don’t take your wisdom to the grave with you; share it with people who’ll listen. And those who are wise </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>will</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>listen, because they recognise the foolishness of paying twice for the same information. Don’t retire—refocus. Victor Hugo once said, ‘Forty is old age to youth, fifty is youth to old age.’ With God, </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>availability</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>, not age, is what counts. The Bible says: ‘There was…a prophetess, Anna…she was eighty–four. She never left the temple but worshipped night and day, fasting and praying. Coming up to them [Mary and Joseph with the Christ child] at that very moment, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all.’ (Luke 2:36–38 NIV) The world respects ex–generals and ex–presidents, but not ex–Christians. A respected character actor said, ‘As we grow older we must discipline ourselves to continue expanding, broadening, learning, keeping our minds active and open.’ So live for God until your last breath.</span></p>

<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span class=&quot;2dropcap&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>T</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>he disciples were overwhelmed by a sense of failure: ‘We have toiled all night and caught nothing.’ (Luke 5:5 NKJV) Look at them, washing their nets—the last thing fishermen do before they pack up and head for home. And that’s when Jesus showed up! He waits until you’ve reached the end of your rope, then He steps in. Why? Because as long as you think you can solve the problem on your own, you won’t reach for Him. Do you feel overwhelmed by failure today? Are you saying, ‘Lord, I tried so hard, but look at my marriage, my finances, my career. I’ve been mistreated and overlooked. Perhaps they’re right about me; maybe I’m not supposed to be blessed.’ No, Jesus can turn your situation around if you’ll go to Him and say what Peter said: ‘Master…because you say so, I will.’ Obedience, even when it doesn’t seem to make sense, is what leads to blessing. Notice what happened next: ‘They caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break.’ (Luke 5:6 NIV) On the other side of your decision to obey God waits a blessing so great that it’ll also touch the lives of those around you. One word changed everything—‘Master’. It’s an expression of worship. It’s an acknowledgment that He’s in control of the circumstances you’re facing. Master over weakness. Master over fear. Master over lack. Go ahead and say it: ‘Master, take control of things. Better still, take control of </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>me.</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>’ Jesus had bigger things in mind for the disciples. After this miracle we read, ‘They…left everything and followed Him.’ (Luke 5:11 NIV) </span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Seek His will in all you do, and He will show you which path to take.' Proverbs 3:6 NLT <br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span class=&quot;2dropcap&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>N</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>othing matters more than recognising and walking in God’s will. When you don’t know His will, it can be a real source of insecurity. Knowing you’re walking in His will enables you to rise above the challenges life throws at you. The question is: does God intend us to know His will? If not, why bother searching? Let His Word settle the issue once and for all: ‘Seek His will in all you do, and He will show you which path to take.’ There’s no vagueness there! ‘The Lord directs the steps of the godly. He delights in every detail of their lives.’ (Psalm 37:23 NLT) God will address even your smallest concern. So what do you need to discern it? Let’s consider some practical Bible principles: </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>There’s no room for two wills</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>. If you want God’s will, you must be prepared to surrender your own will. Jesus said, ‘As I listen to the Father, I make My judgments. My judgments are right because I don’t try to do what I want but what the One who sent Me wants.’ (John 5:30 GWT) Wills frequently clash, so there are choices you must make, and maintain, if you want to walk in obedience to God (Matthew 26:39). Begin your search by surrendering your will; then focus your heart and mind on God and His enlightening Word. Once you accept that He is the leader and you are the follower, it’s a lot easier to say, ‘I delight to do Your will, O…God… Your law is within my heart.’ (Psalm 40:8 NKJV) </span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The mind controlled by the Spirit is life and peace.' Romans 8:6 NIV <br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span class=&quot;2dropcap&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Choose a spiritual, not carnal mindset. Carnality is at the core of our unregenerate nature and it lives on even after we become Christians. Its gravitational pull’s always away from God to self–centred living. The Bible says, ‘The carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can it be.’ (Romans 8:7 NKJV) The carnal mind makes us suspicious, sceptical, self–promoting, and spiritually blind to God’s will. Being spiritually–minded means centring your choices on God’s Word and the Spirit’s prompting. The good news is, ‘You…are not controlled by your sinful nature. You are controlled by the Spirit, if you have the Spirit of God living in you.’ (Romans 8:9 NLT) Giving in to the flesh isn’t inevitable. You can decide whether the flesh or the Spirit guides you! Peter, in a spiritual mindset, received a revelation of Jesus’ deity. ‘You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.’ Jesus replied, ‘This was not revealed to you by [flesh], but by My Father.’ (Matthew 16:16–17 NIV) Shortly after, Jesus told His disciples the dreadful means of His death. In a moment of misguided carnality, Peter refused to accept it. ‘Never, Lord!’ he said. ‘This shall never happen to You!’ (Matthew 16:22 NIV) A carnal mindset is an invitation to Satan. So Jesus told Peter, ‘Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me; you do not have in mind the things of God, but…of men.’ (Matthew 16:23 NIV) So keep your mind spiritually focused and ready to do God’s will.</span></span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA['This is God's will for you.' 1 Thessalonians 5:18 NIV <br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span class=&quot;2dropcap&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>P</span></span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>ray that you may know God’s will.</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>Strive to live in an attitude of prayer. ‘Be joyful always; pray continually; give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God’s will.’ (1 Thessalonians 5:16–18 NIV) Rejoicing, praying continually, and giving thanks puts you in the active hub of God’s will. If you only pray when you’re desperate for answers, your receptors will be rusty and your impressions nebulous at best. Regular communication with God sharpens your senses and fine–tunes your ability to distinguish His voice from all the rest. ‘Teach me to do Your will…my God; may Your good Spirit lead me on level ground.’ (Psalm 143:10 NIV) Seek God, and He will smooth the path for you. </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Receive the counsel of others for confirmation, not necessarily direction.</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>Paul said, ‘When God…called me…I did not consult any man.’ (Galatians 1:15–16 NIV) Only embrace other people’s advice when it agrees with God’s Word and the Spirit’s leading. Friends can be a source of confirmation, but not revelation. Even your own experiences and impressions aren’t enough to discern God’s will unless they line up with His Word. Peter did this on Christ’s transfiguration. ‘<span class=&quot;versetext&quot;>We ourselves heard this voice...when we were with Him on the sacred mountain.<a name=&quot;9&quot;></a> And we have the word of the prophets made more certain<a name=&quot;10&quot;></a>...as to a light<a name=&quot;11&quot;></a> shining in a dark place.</span>’ (2 Peter 1:18–19 NIV) Paul’s converts at Berea received his teachings enthusiastically, but they also checked them against the written Word of God (Acts 17:11). That’s always a good policy.</span></p>

Wait until He opens the door, because ‘what He opens no one can shut, and what He shuts no one can open.’ (Revelation 3:7 NIV) Impatience, or acting independently of God, or ‘rushing in where angels fear to tread’ will get you into trouble. God doesn’t ask for your opinion, He asks for your obedience. Red lights are part of His strategy. A closed door is as important as an open door when God’s in control. He closed the doors to Paul at Asia and Bithynia, then opened the door for him at Macedonia (Acts 16:6–10).</span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Heed the umpire’s call.</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>The Holy Spirit’s role is vital; He alone knows God’s mind and takes the guesswork out of the search. Jesus said, ‘When…the Spirit of truth…comes, He will guide you into all the truth…He will disclose to you what is to come.’ (John 16:13 NAS) The Holy Spirit is committed to leading you through all issues. Remember, you don’t have to instantly be an authority on theology; the indwelling Holy Spirit gives understanding of the Scripture to guide you! The Bible says, ‘The true children of God are those who let God’s Spirit lead them.’ (Romans 8:14 NCV) He will bring a deep peace to your heart once He gets you on track. ‘Let the peace…from Christ rule (act as umpire continually) in your hearts [deciding and settling with finality all questions that arise in your minds].’ (Colossians 3:15 AMP) Let God’s peace in your heart ‘make the calls’ all along the way. That way you’ll never go wrong. </span></p>

Beginners often lose sales by ‘overselling’. They present their product and demonstrate how it meets their client’s needs. It’s priced right and the customer is ready to purchase, but the novice keeps on ‘selling’ until the customer becomes suspicious of his pitch and he loses the sale. Knowing when to ‘close’ is essential. Accurate aim is important, but you must know when to pull the trigger. Trust the steps you’ve taken and move forward; otherwise you’ll get stuck in a cycle of second–guessing. At some point in your search for God’s will, you must take that decisive and often intimidating next step. All your studying, praying, discussing, researching, checking and rechecking are fruitless if you don’t act. All the faith in the world will fail you if you stop short of doing something (James 2:17–18). Here’s a last–minute test: (1) Have you submitted your will to God? (2) Are you faithfully serving where He appointed you? (3) Are you willing to do what He has revealed? (4) Have you received and believed the Spirit’s leading? (5) Are you trusting in His power to fulfil His directions? How did you do? Did you pass? Then it’s time to move forward! Don’t wait until you feel fearless. Take that first, fearful step. Act your way into boldness, and fear will lose its ability to control or paralyse you. When the light turns green, God’s resources are available for your assignment. </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>Now’s</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>the time to move! </span></p>

As a result, companies complain that it takes too long to get goods for their customers, and the ship’s owners are unhappy because it hurts profit margin in a competitive market. The effort required to remove the ‘junk’ is back–breaking and time–consuming, but there’s no other way to do it. Finally, after months of hard work the dry dock is flooded with water, the gates open, and the big vessel heads out to sea and back into the profit column. Writing to the believers at Corinth, Paul says, ‘Examine yourselves as to whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves.’ (2 Corinthians 13:5 NKJV) Let’s be honest; it’s easier to examine your neighbour than to examine yourself, or to talk about what you once accomplished rather than what you’re accomplishing now. Are you slowing down? Are you losing spiritual momentum? Are you in the profit or loss column? You’ll find the answer under the waterline where only God and you can see. Carelessness, a critical spirit, compromise, conformity to the world, and coldness of heart: that’s the ‘junk’ that builds up and slows you down. These are the subtle sins you must deal with in order to be everything God called you to be and enjoy the blessings He has in store for you. </span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA['You shall not commit adultery.' Exodus 20:14 NIV <br /><br /><p>The seventh commandment says, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’ But Jesus takes it one step further by saying, ‘Anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery… in his heart. If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better…to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.’ (Matthew 5:28–29 NIV) You’re not responsible for what you see, but you are responsible for what you continue to look at. Paul told Timothy, ‘Flee…youthful lusts’ (2 Timothy 2:22 NKJV); and James writes, ‘After desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full–grown, gives birth to death.’ (James 1:15 NIV) Immorality in practice or in thought can result in the death of your marriage, your self–respect, your influence, and your joy. In <em>The Door</em>, theologian Mike Yaconelli writes: ‘Author Susan Howatch made a fortune writing blockbuster novels… She had houses in several countries, drove a Porsche, and after divorcing had a number of “transient liaisons”. But at age thirty, she said, “God seized me by the scruff of the neck... and shook me until my teeth rattled.” Now a Christian, she reflects: “I was promiscuous, but finally one morning I woke up and said, ‘What am I trying to prove, and to whom?’ I knew exactly what—that, even though my marriage broke up, I could still attract men. The fact that I could control men boosted my fractured ego.” What was her conclusion? Promiscuity is a sign you’re not aligned right with God or yourself.’</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Exo 39-40; John 5:1-15; Ps 41; Pro 27:7-9<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62097&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Lord is my portion... therefore I hope in Him.' Lamentations 3:24 NKJV<br /><br /><p>When you haven’t accomplished what you’d hoped for, regret can become a major pastime. The computer analyst wishes he’d become an accountant, the accountant wishes he’d become a doctor, etc. Maybe you planned to leave a legacy, but to date all you’ve left is a trail of unfilled aspirations. It’s not too late; you can begin again! You just have to be prepared to pursue your dream and pay the price. ‘To win the contest you must deny yourselves many things that would keep you from doing your best.’ (1 Corinthians 9:25 TLB) Don’t listen to the critics and complainers who’ve settled for less. Your goal shouldn’t just be to live long, but to make a difference in your world and glorify God. Aviator Charles Lindbergh said, ‘I feel I lived on a higher plain than the sceptics on the ground… Who valued life more highly, the aviators who spent it on the art they loved, or these misers who doled it out like pennies through their antlike days?…If I could fly for ten years before I was killed in a crash, it would be a worthwhile trade for an ordinary lifetime.’ Look at Moses. Look at Paul. They both began again. Look at Winston Churchill: instead of retiring after World War II, he went on to win the Nobel Prize in literature. When Heinrich Schliemann retired from business to look for Homer’s legendary city of Troy—he found it. Here’s a Scripture you can stand on: ‘Through the Lord’s mercies we are not consumed, because His compassions fail not. They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness. The Lord is my portion… therefore I hope in Him!’ (Lamentations 3:22–24 NKJV) That means you can begin again.</p><br /><br />SoulFood (Day of Atonement): Lev 16; Lev 23:26-32; Heb 9:1-14; Heb 13:11-16<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62078&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Cast all your anxiety on Him.' 1 Peter 5:7 NIV <br /><br /><p>Learn to ‘cast all your anxiety on Him.’ Only when you have done that will you be able to ‘catch yourself’ when you begin to open the door to worry, allowing it to move in, set up shop and start doing business. What’s your top ten list of worries? Health? Money? A relationship? Children? Your looks? Get to know your most common worries so well that you’re able to treat them like mosquitoes. You don’t procrastinate when a blood–sucking bug lights on your skin. You don’t say, ‘I’ll take care of it in a moment.’ No, you give the creature the slap it deserves. Be equally decisive with anxiety. The moment a worry surfaces, deal with it. Don’t dwell on it. Head it off before it gets the best of you. Instead of ulcerating over what your boss thinks, ask him. Before you diagnose that mole as a cancer, have it examined. Instead of assuming that you’ll never get out of debt, consult an expert, draw up a plan, and take back your power. As long as you’re willing to live with worry, you’ll never overcome it. Instead of allowing worry to cast a big shadow over a small problem, rise up in faith and say, ‘The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?’ (Hebrews 13:6 NKJV) Who’s your helper? The Lord! So give your worries to Him and don’t take them back. The Psalmist said, ‘Cast your burden on the Lord and He will sustain you; He will never let the righteous be shaken.’ (Psalm 55:22 NAS) Peter writes, ‘Cast all your anxiety on Him because He cares for you.’ Learn to ‘cast’.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Heb 11:8-12; Gen 17:1-27; Gen 22:1-18; Jas 2:21-24 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62079&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.' John 13:17 NIV<br /><br /><p>Holiness brings happiness, but sin never can. Sometimes we find this hard to believe. The story’s told of a mother saying to her son, ‘Be good, and have fun.’ He replies, ’Please make up your mind!’ How revealing! Today the word ‘holiness’ has got a bad reputation. Some see it as a list of all the things the church says you can’t do. Others recall those who claimed to practise holiness, but came across as rigid, joyless, narrow and judgmental. So let’s define it: ‘Holiness is the whole of Christ in the whole of life.’ Furthermore, holiness vanishes when you talk about it; it only becomes attractive when you live it. ‘The blessing of the Lord makes one rich, and He adds no sorrow with it.’ (Proverbs 10:22 NKJV) The only thing that adds no sorrow is the blessing of the Lord. James writes, ‘When desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full–grown, brings forth death.’ (James 1:15 NKJV) When we’re immature we think we can sin and get away with it, but as we grow wiser and more mature we know better. You’ll never meet a smoker who recommends his or her habit. And you’ll meet very few who shipwrecked a marriage, recommending an affair. The law of the harvest is: ‘...whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.’ (Galatians 6:7 NKJV) Sin destroys your capacity for happiness. A loving parent doesn’t want to see their children get hurt—and God is a loving parent. David, who tasted the bitter fruits of sin first–hand, wrote, ‘Worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness.’ (Psalm 29:2 KJV) Holiness is a beautiful thing when you fully understand and practise it.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Exo 4-6; John 1:1-13; Ps 63; Pro 25:26-28<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62080&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before.' Job 42:10 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Helping others brings happiness, but selfishness never can. A ragged urchin stood looking into a sweet shop window. A man came along and observed the scene, took him inside and said to the saleslady, ‘Fill a bag with every kind of sweet he wants.’ The boy couldn’t believe his luck. As he filled his mouth with sugary delights, his benefactor asked, ‘Is that good, son?’ He nodded in the affirmative: ‘Uh huh.’ Then the man asked, ‘Could I have some?’ Immediately the boy’s look of joy turned to fear, and clutching the bag he ran away shouting, ‘Mine, mine!’ Happiness doesn’t come by getting; it comes by forgetting yourself and living for others. Job, one of the richest men in his day, lost his health, his wealth, and his family. It’s hard to imagine, right? Then an amazing thing happened: ‘The Lord restored Job’s losses, when he prayed for his friends.’ (Job 42:10 NKJV) Job actually got back twice what he lost. How? By reaching out to others instead of dwelling on his own problems. And that principle still works today. Jesus warned, ‘Take heed and beware of covetousness, for one’s life does not consist in the abundance of the things he possesses.’ (Luke 12:15 NKJV) God blesses you for one reason: to make you a blessing to others. You’re not supposed to be a warehouse—but a clearing house. For every verse in Scripture that promises material success, there’s another that speaks of the dangers of hoarding. So the word for you today is: helping others brings happiness, but selfishness never can.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Exo 7-9; John 1:14-28; Ps 92; Pro 26:1-3<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62082&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['We wait for the blessed hope--the glorious appearing of our...Saviour, Jesus Christ.' Titus 2:13 NIV <br /><br /><p>Hope brings happiness, but scepticism never can. You may be alive when Christ returns, or you may be resur-rected to meet Him in the air. Either way, Jesus is coming again! Don’t let doubters or false date–setters dull your sense of hope. Ray Bakke shares this story: ‘I knew an old Glasgow professor named McDonald, who, along with a Scottish chaplain, was put in a prisoner–of–war camp. A high wire fence separated the Americans from the British, and McDonald was put in the American barracks. The Americans had a little homemade radio and were able to get news from the outside. Every day McDonald would take a headline or two to the fence and share it with the chaplain in the ancient Gaelic language, indecipherable to the Germans. One day news came that the German High Command had surrendered. McDonald took the news to his friend, then watched him disappear into the barracks. A moment later a roar of celebration came from inside. Life in that camp was transformed. Men walked around singing and shouting, waving at the guards, even laughing at the dogs. When the German guards finally heard the news three nights later, they fled into the dark, leaving the gates unlocked. The next morning, Brits and Americans walked out as free men. Yet they had truly been set free three days earlier by the news that the war was over.’ The certainty of Christ’s soon return sets you free to hope, to rejoice in the worst of circumstances, and to live with purpose. For God’s redeemed people, the best is yet to come!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Exo 10-12; John 1:29-42; Ps 29; Pro 26:4-6<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62083&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<alias><![CDATA[taking-communion]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['He took bread, blessed and broke it.' Luke 24:30 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Taking communion can be a meaningless ritual, or an intimate time spent in the presence of Jesus. Read the story of Cleopas and his companion, they were travelling home to Emmaus when Jesus suddenly appeared and walked along with them. First He opened their eyes to see that the crucifixion wasn’t the tragedy they thought, but a fulfilment of prophecy and God’s way to redeem a lost world; something to celebrate and not be sad about. Later, as He sat in their home and ate supper with them, ‘He took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them. Then their eyes were opened and they [knew] Him.’ (Luke 24:30–31 NIV) Are you battling fear and doubt today? Are you wondering if God will keep His promise to you? He will! Earlier that day, Cleopas and his companion met some women who had just been to the empty tomb and reported that Jesus was alive. But try as they might, they couldn’t believe it. This story proves that Jesus loves doubters enough to walk with them, take away their fears, and strengthen their faith. And guess when He did it? As they broke bread. So next time you’re taking communion, stop and pray, ‘Lord, speak to me. Show me Your will and Your way.’ That’s a prayer He will answer. Your mind may be confused and your anxiety great, but if you’re spiritually hungry He will show up and meet you at the point of your need.</p><br /><br />SoulFood (Feast of Tabernacles): Lev 23:33-44; John 7:1-40; Zech 14:16-21 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62085&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<alias><![CDATA[the-importance-of-patterns-in-marriage]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Make everything according to the pattern I have shown you.' Exodus 25:40 NLT<br /><br /><p>We focus on individual incidents, but the God of the big picture focuses on patterns. He determined twenty–four hours in each day, seven days in each week, four seasons in each year, two people in each marriage, etc. Birth is followed by infancy, childhood, youth, adulthood, old age. Imagine how different your life would be without these patterns! God created us to need patterned lives. Patterns provide predictability, and predictability provides comfort, control and security. Simply knowing that Saturday follows Wednesday helps you get through an exhausting work week. Many of our relational issues would be resolved if we paid less attention to our negative patterns and concentrated on establishing positive ones. Does this conversation sound familiar? The husband asks, ‘Why do you always bring things up just when I’m falling asleep? Can’t you find a better time?’ The wife returns fire: ‘There’s never a better time to get your attention!’ The use of words like ‘always’ and ‘never’ only intensifies the problem. Until you understand and change your patterns, you’ll forever be attempting to put out relational fires. Establishing a simple pattern of spending an hour or two together each week (date night?) assures your wife of a set time to be heard, and your husband an opportunity to listen when he’s alert and responsive. Patterns are God’s idea. The predictability and promise they bring help defuse reactive emotions and establish an environment where you both feel loved and valued!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Exo 13-15; John 1:43-51; Ps 131; Pro 26:7-9<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62086&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['We can make our plans, but the Lord determines our steps.' Proverbs 16:9 NLT<br /><br /><p>Here are three important truths to help you enjoy the life God wants you to live: (1) <em>Believe God wants you to succeed</em>. Give up the unscriptural notion that this life has no value. God has a special work for you to do—here and now (Jeremiah 29:11). You ask, ‘What defines success?’ Answer: the progressive achievement of a God–given goal resulting in feeling good about yourself. ‘Carefully follow the terms of this covenant, so that you may prosper in everything you do.’ (Deuteronomy 29:9 NIV) (2)<em> Consult God before you set your goals</em>. The Bible says, ‘We should make plans—counting on God to direct us.’ (Proverbs 16:9 TLB) If you’re constantly stressed out and confused, you may be on the wrong track. Go back and check with God; what has He told you to do? It’s His will for you to succeed in these six areas: (a) <em>spiritual</em>; (b) <em>relational</em>; (c) <em>physical</em>; (d) <em>mental</em>; (e) <em>social</em>; (f) <em>financial</em>. ‘Whatever he does shall prosper.’ (Psalms 1:3 NKJV) (3) <em>Invest in yourself</em>. ‘Though it cost all you have, get understanding.’ (Proverbs 4:7 NIV) If you’re willing to spend money at fine restaurants but not on good books, your future is already determined. And the first book you need to invest in is a Bible. John writes, ‘And the Word was God.’ (John 1:1 NIV) That means each time you read God’s Word, you’re depositing more of God into you. Wow! Think how that affects your life! Cultivate a teachable spirit. ‘Let the wise listen and add to their learning.’ (Proverbs 1:5 NIV) This is the life God wants you to live!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Exo 16-18; John 2:1-11; Ps 23; Pro 26:10-12<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62087&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Labouring fervently for you in prayers.' Colossians 4:12 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Paul writes, ‘Epaphras, who is…always labouring fervently for you in prayers.’ Sometimes praying for others feels like ‘labouring’. Once you understand and accept that, not having ‘tingling sensations’ when you pray won’t discourage you. You can smile and tell yourself, ‘This is the way the Bible says it will be sometimes.’ G. Campbell Morgan said, ‘A man may offer a prayer, beautiful in diction and perfect in the number of its petitions. But if it gives him gratification afterwards, that prayer cannot have been truly prayed.’ What did he mean? Simply this: you’ll feel good after you’ve prayed, but your goal isn’t to feel good about the fact that you have prayed, or that you felt particularly good during the process. Observe: (1) <em>Prayer is a duty</em>. It’s like going to work. You do it because it’s a commitment, and because of the rewards it brings. (2) <em>Prayer is a discipline</em>. The old–timers used to talk about ‘praying through’. Through what? Through wandering thoughts, through fatigue, through fears, and every other form of resistance and distraction. When you enter the ‘prayer zone’, Satan will fight you at every turn. But when you stand in the name of Jesus, the powers of darkness will retreat and you’ll prevail (John 14:13–14). (3) <em>Prayer is a delight</em>. It won’t happen every time, but if you’re faithful to the place of prayer there’ll be times when your whole being will be conscious that God is present, answering your prayer and giving you guidance. And even when the answer isn’t completely clear, you’ll leave His presence saying, ‘Now I have peace about it.’</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Heb 11:22; Gen 39:1-23; Gen 45:1-11; Gen 50:15-26 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62088&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Come near to God and he will come near to you.' James 4:8 NIV<br /><br /><p>We all want what successful people have; we’re just not willing to pay the price they paid to get it. When you see someone with sculpted abs and a well–toned body, they probably spend time sweating in a gym. There’s a reason Paul talks about ‘labouring…in prayers.’ (Colossians 4:12 NKJV) When you pray, you must be passionate, persistent and positive, expecting good things from God. You’ve got to put your heart into it and believe God will do what He promised. It’s not easy to fight off distractions and focus on Him. Don’t expect your fleshly nature to co–operate; it comes to the place of prayer kicking and screaming. And don’t expect your intellect to cheer you on; your self–sufficient nature will always choose prayer as a last resort. But God will urge you, and draw you into His presence. ‘If you draw near to Me, I will draw near to you.’ An unknown poet wrote: ‘I got up early one morning, and rushed right into the day. I had so much to accomplish, I didn’t have time to pray. Troubles tumbled about me, and heavier came each task; “Why doesn’t God help me?” I wondered. He answered, “You didn’t ask.”…I woke up early this morning, and paused before entering the day. I had so much to accomplish that I had to take time to pray.’ Many problems can be resolved, or avoided altogether, when you take time to pray and include God in every part of your day. ‘Oh what peace we often forfeit; oh what needless pain we bear; All because we do not carry everything to God in prayer.’ (Joseph M. Scriven, 1855)</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Exo 19-21; John 2:12-25; Ps 110; Pro 26:13-16<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62089&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Lord, where do I put my hope?' Psalm 39:7 NLT<br /><br /><p>Here are four suggestions to help you survive and grow through upheavals such as an unexpected job loss, the death of a loved one, a failed marriage or a serious health issue: (1) <em>Admit how you feel</em>. That doesn’t mean sitting around wallowing in negativity; it means trusting God enough to acknowledge how you really feel. Pretending things are fine when they’re not, makes it harder to get back up. We all have down times. The Psalmist asked God to help him cope with despondency (Psalms 42–43). And at one point Paul was under so much pressure he ‘despaired even of life.’ (2 Corinthians 1:8 NKJV) (2) <em>Identify the source</em>. Discouragement often comes on the heels of a setback or disappointment. Did something you set your heart on fall apart? Were your hopes unrealistic to start with? Did somebody let you down? Or is your dejection coming from a generalised feeling of burnout? (3) <em>Talk with a trusted counsellor</em>. Solomon said, ‘…there is safety in having many advisers.’ (Proverbs 11:14 NLT) Don’t let pride prevent you from opening up to those who will listen empathetically and respond wisely. Talking to the right people can lessen your sense of isolation, and also pave the way for others who are hurting to do the same. (4) <em>Be open before God</em>. He, not fate or circumstances, gets to write the last chapter. Maybe He’s trying to teach you something or redirect your energies. David said, ‘Lord, where do I put my hope? My only hope is in You.’ When your hope is in God, He replaces discouragement with confidence so that what you’re going through can become a path to spiritual growth.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Exo 22-24; John 3:1-21; Ps 89:1-14; Pro 26:17-19<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62090&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord.' Psalm 37:23 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The Psalmist writes, ‘The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord, and He delights in his way. Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down; for the Lord upholds him with His hand.’ (Psalm 37:23–24 NKJV) Observe: (1) <em>God delights in the fact that you’re willing to step out in faith and try</em>. (2) <em>He doesn’t guarantee that you won’t stumble, but that ultimately He won’t let you fail.</em> (3) <em>When you feel like you can’t go on, He will uphold and strengthen you</em>. What more could you ask for? Now, God never changes, but life does. So you must be ready to adapt to unforeseen circumstances. Sam Walton, the founder of Walmart, is credited with having been a visionary leader. His dream was to provide value to customers in order to improve their lives. But he was notorious for changing plans and abandoning strategies that didn’t work. Sam’s son Jim Walton admitted, ‘We all sniggered at some writers who viewed Dad as a grand strategist who intuitively developed complex plans and implemented them with precision. Dad thrived on change, and no decision was ever sacred.’ What good is a well–planned strategy if it doesn’t yield good results? To quote Winston Churchill: ‘However beautiful the strategy, you should occasionally look at the results.’ God is more committed to the vision He’s given you than you are. But when He leads you in a new direction, you must be ready to follow Him. Like Israel in the wilderness, when the guiding cloud moved they had to move with it. The same goes for you. So, be flexible.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Exo 25-27; John 3:22-36; Ps 89:15-37; Pro 26:20-22<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62091&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Jesus Himself came up and walked along with them.' Luke 24:15 NIV<br /><br /><p>Following the crucifixion, Cleopas and his companion were on the road that led home to Emmaus. That’s when ‘Jesus himself came up and walked along with them.’ Their hopes lay buried in a tomb; their faith had turned to doubt. So what did Jesus do? He held a Bible study! ‘Jesus took them through the writings of Moses and all the prophets, explaining from all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.’ (Luke 24:27 NLT) Jesus knows that when you’re walking the road of doubt, you need to get into His Word and get it into you. When you do, three things happen: (1) <em>Your eyes will be opened</em>. ‘Then their eyes were opened and they knew Him.’ (Luke 24:31 NKJV) There are things you will only see when God reveals them to you through His Word. That’s why Bible reading must be one of your highest priorities. (2) <em>Your heart will burn</em>. ‘They said to one another, “Did not our heart burn within us while He talked with us?”’ (Luke 24:32 NKJV) When you put God’s Word to work and begin to walk out its precepts, it will energise you and change your life. (3) <em>You’ll want to tell everybody</em>. ‘They rose up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together, saying, “The Lord is risen indeed.”’ (Luke 24:33–34 NKJV) You say, ‘But I’m timid, and not very good with words.’ When you truly fall in love, you’ll find a way to express it. So today look for an opportunity to tell someone what Jesus has done for you.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Exo 28-29; John 4:1-12; Ps 89:38-52; Pro 26:23-26<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62092&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I have talked with you from Heaven.' Exodus 20:22 NKJV<br /><br /><p>When God gave the Ten Commandments to His people, He said, ‘I have talked with you from Heaven.’ In other words, you have ‘the Word from the top’. End of discussion. Just do it! That being said, let’s spend the next few days looking at how the Ten Commandments apply to you. (1) ‘<em>You shall have no other gods before Me</em>.’ (Exodus 20:3 NIV) Have you seen the new all–purpose greeting card? The front says, ‘Generic card’ and the inside reads, ‘Happy whatever!’ The first commandment was designed to stop us from going through life doing whatever we feel like. It grabs us by the collar and says, ‘Hold on, Jesus is supposed to be Lord of your life, so put Him first!’ (2) ‘<em>You shall not make for yourself an idol</em>.’ (Exodus 20:4 NLT) Now, most of us wouldn’t dream of worshiping an idol. But how about your loyalty to things that have no eternal value, like pleasure, power, position and possessions? Isn’t that idolatry too? Anything that comes before God is an idol. (3) ‘<em>You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God</em>.’ (Exodus 20:7 NIV) But just because you don’t use profanity doesn’t mean you honour the name of the Lord. As a believer you must honour God in your speech, your conduct and your attitude. The truth is, you are the only Bible many people will ever read. Paul writes, ‘Clearly, you are a letter from Christ showing the result of our ministry among you. This “letter” is written not with pen and ink, but with the Spirit of the living God.’ (2 Corinthians 3:3 NLT)</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Exo 30-32; John 4:13-26; Ps 100; Pro 26:27-28<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62093&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.' Exodus 20:8 NIV<br /><br /><p>The fourth commandment says, ‘Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.’ This commandment wasn’t meant to be interpreted in: (a) <em>A legalistic way</em>. In Jesus’ day there were over fifteen hundred things the Law of Moses said you couldn’t do on the Sabbath, such as bathing, walking too far, or scratching a flea bite. (b) <em>A loose way</em>. The flip side of legalism is licence. We go everywhere on Sunday except to church, then excuse ourselves by saying, ‘I’ll be there in spirit,’ or ‘I feel closer to God on the golf course or the beach.’ That doesn’t wash with God! (c) <em>A limited way</em>. You can’t attend church on Sunday and ignore God the rest of the week. He’s not just Lord of the Sabbath, He’s Lord of your life. Here’s what the Sabbath was designed to be: (1) <em>A day of rest</em>. Restoration begins with rest. Somebody said, ‘When you love what you do, it’s not work.’ That may be true, but that philosophy can lead to burnout and breakdown. David said, ‘He leads me beside the still waters. He restores my soul.’ (Psalm 23:2–3 NKJV) Note the word ‘still’. Every seventh day God calls ‘time out’. (2) <em>A day of restoration</em>. Toward the end of his life, Bible commentator William Barclay said, ‘I’m old, and I’ve learned that there are very few things in life that really matter—but those few things matter intensely.’ Worshiping with other believers matters because it highlights those things which are important to God, like His Word, His will, His worship, His call, His grace and His family.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Exo 33-35; John 4:27-38; Ps 32; Pro 27:1-3<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62094&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Honour your father and your mother.' Exodus 20:12 NIV<br /><br /><p>In the fifth commandment, God says, ‘Honour your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land that the Lord your God is giving you.’ That means children must respect their parents, and parents must prove worthy of respect. Abraham and Lot were from the same family, but there was a big difference in their parenting styles. And it showed up dramatically at the destruction of Sodom. Concerning Abraham, God said, ‘I have chosen him, so that he will direct his children and his household after him to keep the way of the Lord by doing what is right and just, so that the Lord will bring about for Abraham what He has promised him.’ (Genesis 18:19 NIV) Before God destroyed Sodom, we read: ‘The two men (angels) said to Lot, “Do you have anyone else here…Get them out …because we are going to destroy this place”…So Lot went out and spoke to his sons–in–law…He said, “Hurry and get out of this place, because the Lord is about to destroy the city!” But his sons–in–law thought he was joking.’ (Genesis 19:12–14 NIV) Do you have credibility with your children? Do they take you seriously? Here are two quotes from history every parent needs to think long and hard about. The first is from evangelist Billy Sunday: ‘The tragedy of my life is that although I’ve led thousands of people to Jesus Christ, my own sons are not saved.’ The second is from Lord Houghton: ‘The Christian home is the Master’s workshop where the processes of character moulding are silently, lovingly, faithfully and successfully carried on.’</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 13:21-22; 1 Sam 16; 1 Sam 17:32-51; 1 Sam 24:1-17 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62095&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['You shall not murder.' Exodus 20:13 NIV <br /><br /><p>The sixth commandment says, ‘You shall not murder.’ Now, most of us don’t need a lecture on murder, so let’s address the real issue: <em>the tongue</em>, which kills by destroying a person’s self–worth and future hopes. Paul writes: ‘All the law is fulfilled in…this: “You shall love your neighbour as yourself.” But if you bite and devour one another, beware lest you be consumed by one another!’ (Galatians 5:14–15 NKJV) Who can forget the 1994 tabloid headline, ‘<em>Killer bug ate my face</em>’? The reporting was sensational, but the stories were based on factual cases of invasive streptococcal bacteria found in Gloucestershire. When invasive Strep A (which isn’t the same as strep throat [Bacterial tonsillitis]) takes hold, necrotising fasciitis can begin, which causes the victim’s flesh to die at the rate of several centimetres per hour. Meanwhile toxic shock sets in, shutting down organs and causing death. Dr Jeffrey Crowley describes what happens after the deadly microbes take hold: ‘The bacteria multiply rapidly, producing toxins… For three days the patient may suffer swollen lymph nodes, rising fever, and excruciating pain at the site of infection. Penicillin can stop the attack at this stage, but by day four, infected tissues start dying. Bacteria saturate the bloodstream, destroying muscles and organs, sending the body into shock, and death can follow within hours… invasive streptococcus is rare, but unforgiving.’ You say, ‘That’s gruesome!’ Yes, and so is gossip, and slander! They’re deadly. They make people feel worthless by destroying their self–esteem and undermining them to the point where life doesn’t seem worth living. Learn to guard your tongue and speak words that bring life, not death.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Exo 36-38; John 4:39-54; Ps 87; Pro 27:4-6<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62096&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['You shall not steal.' Exodus 20:15 NIV<br /><br /><p>The eighth commandment says, ‘You shall not steal.’ Think how strange this commandment must have seemed to the Israelites. As a nomad society, thieving and looting had always been acceptable in their culture—even expected. But God said, ‘That day is over. Stealing distorts your priorities. It makes things more important than people. It violates the rights of others by saying, “I’m more important than you.” So from this day on I want you to be rigorously honest in all your dealings.’ But there’s another kind of stealing, the kind some Christians think nothing of practising. The Bible says: ‘Will a man rob God? Yet you rob Me. But you ask, “How do we rob You?” In tithes and offerings. You are under a curse—the whole nation of you—because you are robbing Me. Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. “Test Me in this,” says the Lord Almighty, “and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of Heaven and pour out so much blessing that you will not have room enough for it. I will prevent pests from devouring your crops…the vines in your fields will not cast their fruit…Then all the nations will call you blessed, for yours will be a delightful land.”’ (Malachi 3:8–12 NIV) When you rob God, you end up robbing yourself. ‘Robbing myself of what?’ you ask: (1) <em>God’s blessing in your life</em>. (2) <em>His protection when times get tough</em>. (3) <em>The privilege of sharing His goodness with the people around you</em>. Is it really worth it? Think about it!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Isa 1-3; John 5:16-30; Ps 15; Pro 27:10-12<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62098&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['You shall not give false testimony.' Exodus 20:16 NIV <br /><br /><p>The ninth commandment says, ‘You shall not give false testimony against your neighbour.’ Why do we lie? For lots of reasons: to escape the consequences of our actions; to avoid paying our dues; to create a false image; to convince others we’re something we’re not. But it doesn’t work; time and truth force deception to surface—literally! In 1996 the body of the former ambassador to Switzerland was buried in Arlington National Cemetery, America’s resting place for war heroes. The granite tombstone read, ‘S1C [Seaman First Class] U.S. Merchant Marine.’ But according to investigative reporters, Don Van Natta Jr. and Elaine Sciolino, in a 1997 issue of The New York Times, cemetery workers hauled the tombstone away and exhumed the casket. The reason? The man lied. For years he told others he’d served on the Coast Guard ship Horace Bushnell during World War II. He said the Germans torpedoed the ship and he’d been thrown overboard, sustaining a head injury. But the record shows that at the time he said he was serving in the Merchant Marine, he was actually attending Wilbur Wright College in Chicago. The Coast Guard had no record of his having served in the Merchant Marine, or having earned the rank of Seaman First Class. Somehow the lie wasn’t discovered when the State Department investigated his background and he was made an ambassador. As a result, his remains were buried in Arlington Cemetery, and his tombstone engraved with a lie. But the truth came out, as it always does, and posterity now knows the facts. Think about that, the next time you’re tempted to spin a story that’s less than truthful.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Isa 4-7; John 5:31-47; Ps 5; Pro 27:13-16<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62100&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['You shall not covet.' Exodus 20:17 NIV<br /><br /><p>In the last of the Ten Commandments, God told His people: ‘You shall not covet your neighbour’s house…[nor] your neighbour’s wife, or his manservant or maidservant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbour.’ Coveting means grasping and craving for things that don’t belong to you. Haddon Robinson said, ‘Covetousness is simply craving more of what you have enough of already.’ It’s why Paul writes, ‘Godliness with contentment is great gain.’ (1 Timothy 6:6 NKJV) In his book of sermons, Feminine Faces, Dr. Clovis Chappell writes: ‘When Pompeii was being excavated there was found a body that had been embalmed by the ashes of Vesuvius. It was that of a woman. Her feet were turned toward the city gate, but her face was turned backward toward something that lay just beyond her outstretched hands. The prize which those frozen fingers were reaching for was a bag of pearls. Maybe she herself had dropped them as she was fleeing for her life. Maybe she had found them where they had been dropped by another. But be that as it may, though death was hard at her heels and life was beckoning to her beyond the city gates, she could not shake off their spell. She turned to pick them up, and death was her reward. But it was not the eruption of Vesuvius that made her love pearls more than life. It only froze her in this attitude of greed.’ There’s nothing wrong with wanting more in life, as long as you’re enjoying the things God has already given you, and you’re sharing them with others.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Isa 8-11; John 6:1-24; Ps 126; Pro 27:17-19<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62101&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['But none of these things move me.' Acts 20:24 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Paul writes: ‘The Holy Spirit testifies in every city, saying that chains and tribulations await me. But none of these things move me; nor do I count my life dear to myself, so that I may finish my race with joy.’ (Acts 20:23–24 NKJV).Dr. John Maxwell says one day when he was discouraged and tempted to quit, he took out a dictionary and looked up the word ‘quit’. After spending a few minutes considering that option, in a symbolic act of defiance he took out his scissors and cut the word right out of his dictionary. It didn’t make his problems go away, but it sure did strengthen his resolve. When every avenue looks like a dead end and you feel as if you’ve exhausted every possibility—you haven’t. There are always other ways, other options, other opportunities. Even if you don’t see them right now, they are there. So don’t give up. Former heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey once said, ‘A champion is one who gets back up when he can’t.’ People who reach their goal keep going when they think they can’t. They’re tenacious, and as a result they keep moving closer to their goal day by day. Some days they may be moving only a few centimetres at a time, but they’re moving forward. They believe in their God–given destiny, they believe in themselves, and they say so. Now, saying you believe in yourself won’t guarantee your success, but saying you don’t believe in yourself will guarantee your failure. The truth is you’re not alone, God is with you. ‘He gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak.’ (Isaiah 40:29 NIV) So be tenacious!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Isa 12-16; John 6:25-34; Ps 85; Pro 27:20-22<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62102&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['A wife should put her husband first, as she does the Lord.' Ephesians 5:22 CEV<br /><br /><p>If you want a great marriage, you’ve got to work at it every day. The Bible gives us God’s blueprint for one: ‘You wives must learn to adapt yourselves to your husbands, as you submit yourselves to the Lord, for the husband is the “head” of the wife in the same way that Christ is head of the Church and saviour of the Body. The willing subjection of the Church to Christ should be reproduced in the submission of wives to their husbands. But, remember, this means that the husband must give his wife the same sort of love that Christ gave to the Church, when He sacrificed Himself for her... Men ought to give their wives the love they naturally have for their own bodies. The love a man gives his wife is the extending of his love for himself to enfold her. Nobody ever hates or neglects his own body; he feeds and looks after it. And that is what Christ does for His body, the Church. And we are all members of that body, we are His flesh and blood! “For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.” The marriage relationship is doubtless a great mystery, but I am speaking of something deeper still—the marriage of Christ and His Church. In practice what I have said amounts to this: let every one of you who is a husband love his wife as he loves himself; let the wife reverence her husband.’ (Ephesians 5:21–33 PHPS) That’s how to build a great marriage!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ruth 1:8-18; Ruth 2:5-12; Ruth 3:1-6; Ruth 4:9-13 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62103&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be strong in the Lord and in His mighty power.' Ephesians 6:10 NIV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says, ‘Be strong in the Lord and in His mighty power. Put on all of God’s armour so that you will be able to stand firm against all strategies of the devil. For we are not fighting against flesh–and–blood enemies, but against evil rulers and authorities of the unseen world, against mighty powers in this dark world, and against evil spirits in the heavenly places. Therefore, put on every piece of God’s armour so you will be able to resist the enemy in the time of evil. Then after the battle you will still be standing firm. Stand your ground, putting on the belt of truth and the body armour of God’s righteousness. For shoes, put on the peace that comes from the Good News so that you will be fully prepared. In addition to all of these, hold up the shield of faith to stop the fiery arrows of the devil. Put on salvation as your helmet, and take the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. Pray in the Spirit at all times and on every occasion. Stay alert and be persistent in your prayers for all believers everywhere.’ (Ephesians 6:10–18 NLT) The way to make a comeback is to get back up and move forward. Winning consists of getting up one more time than you were knocked down. Booker T. Washington said, ‘Success is not measured by the heights one attains, but by the obstacles one overcomes in its attainment.’ The God you serve is bigger than the obstacles you face. The strength He provides is greater than the forces arrayed against you. So be strong in the Lord!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Isa 17-21; John 6:35-51; Ps 98; Pro 27:23-24<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62104&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Let us lay aside every weight... and let us run.' Hebrews 12:1 NKJV<br /><br /><p>In the days of the Roman Empire, Olympic runners practised with heavy weights strapped to their bodies. But on the day of the race all the weights were stripped from them; hence we are told in Scripture, ‘Let us lay aside every weight… and let us run.’ When Elijah passed by, Elisha was busy ploughing. This was Elisha’s moment of opportunity. He could become a prophet and enjoy twice the success of his new mentor. But first he had to be willing to break his plough and sacrifice his yoke of oxen. His plough and oxen represented the financial security he was willing to walk away from in order to fulfil God’s plan for his life. Think for a moment about your dream, and everything that will result from it. If you’re like most people, what comes to mind are the benefits you’ll receive, the places you’ll go, the people you’ll meet, the things you’ll own, and the position or title you’ll earn. Do you notice anything in particular about that list? It outlines all the things that will be added to you, and none of the things you’ll have to give up in order to achieve it. And your greatest challenge won’t be giving up the obvious things you know will hurt you; it’ll be giving up the good things you like but won’t help you. Removing the non–essentials from your daily routine will be a constant struggle, but it’s worth fighting for. Why? Because most people who fail to reach their destination aren’t stopped because of insurmountable barriers, but because they’re worn out trying to carry too many things on their journey.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Isa 22-25; John 6:52-71; Ps 127; Pro 27:25-27<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62105&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['He...gave some to be...pastors.' Ephesians 4:11 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Pastors have a tough job. They get more kicks than kisses. If a pastor is young, he lacks experience; if he’s grey–haired, he’s too old. If he has five kids, he has too many; if he has none, he’s setting a bad example. If his wife sings in the choir, she’s being forward; if not, she’s not dedicated enough. If he preaches from notes, he’s dry; if his words are impromptu, he’s too shallow. If he spends too much time in his study, he’s neglecting his people; if he makes home visits, he’s not a good time manager. If he’s attentive to the poor, he’s after public approval; if he attends to the wealthy, he’s ingratiating. If he suggests improvements, he’s a dictator; if he doesn’t, he has no vision. If he uses too many illustrations, he neglects the Bible; if he doesn’t use enough stories, he’s unclear. If he speaks against wrong, he’s legalistic; if he doesn’t, he’s a compromiser. If he preaches for an hour, he’s windy; less than that, he has nothing to say. If he preaches the truth, he’s offensive; if he doesn’t, he’s wishy–washy. If he fails to please everybody, he’s hurting the church; if he tries to please everybody, he has no convictions. If he preaches tithing, he’s a money–grabber; if not, he’s failing to develop his people. If he receives a large salary, he’s mercenary; if he doesn’t, it proves he’s not worth much. If he preaches on a regular basis, people get tired of hearing the same person; if he invites guest preachers, he’s shirking his responsibility. Wow! And you thought your pastor had an easy life! How’d you like to change places? Bottom line: love your pastor.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Isa 26-29; John 7:1-13; Ps 114; Pro 28:1-4<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62106&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['So be careful how you live... Make the most of every opportunity...' Ephesians 5:15-16 NLT<br /><br /><p>Following a plan is like using a GPS device (Global Positioning System). If it knows where you are, you tell it where you want to go, and it creates a personalised road map. The difference between a GPS and you is you have to create all your own turn–by–turn directions. Mark Twain said, ‘The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks, and then starting the first one.’ To reach your destination you must ask yourself three questions: (1) <em>What’s my present position?</em> It’s impossible to ignore the reality of where you are right now and still be successful. The former CEO of General Electric observed, ‘Strategic management is trying to understand where you will sit in tomorrow’s world, not where you hope to sit; it’s assessing where you want to be, and where you can be.’ (2) <em>What’s my desired destination?</em> Write down what your dream will look like when you’ve achieved it. Henry J. Kaiser, founder of Kaiser–Permanente health care system, said, ‘The evidence is overwhelming that you cannot begin to achieve your best unless you have some aim in life.’ (3) <em>What are the in–between steps?</em> Don’t expect them to be quick or easy. Creativity is messy. It’s far from an exact science. But unless you know where you want to go and identify the steps that will get you there, ten years from now you’ll still be where you are today. So the word for you today is: Make the most of every opportunity.’</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Isa 30-33; John 7:14-24; Ps 104:1-23; Pro 28:5-8<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62108&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Pray without ceasing.' 1 Thessalonians 5:17 NKJV<br /><br /><p>When the Bible says, ‘Pray without ceasing,’ that means pray every day, not just periodically or when you’re in trouble. ‘The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much.’ (James 5:16 NKJV) The word ‘fervent’ means passionate, persistent and determined. It’s not the number of our prayers, how many they are; nor the rhetoric of our prayers, how eloquent they may be; nor the geometry of our prayers, how long they may be; nor the music of our prayers, how sweet our voice may be; nor the logic of our prayers, how argumentative they may be; nor the method of our prayers, how orderly they may be; nor even the theology of our prayers, how good the doctrine is, that God responds to. Fervency of spirit is what ‘avails much’. The most powerful thing you can do is pray! And when you join with a prayer partner, your potential is awesome. ‘If two of you agree on earth concerning anything that [you] ask, it will be done for them by My Father in Heaven.’ (Matthew 18:19 NKJV) It works like this: the less you pray, the less you want to pray; the more you pray, the more you want to pray. Nothing will motivate you to pray like answered prayer. But you can’t start with the answer; you’ve got to start with the prayer! Here’s a fact of life: we only keep doing what rewards us. So the key to building a great prayer life is to pray until you get answers. Think how deeply rooted doubt has actually become in our hearts when we’re surprised to find our prayers answered! So pray in faith and expect God to answer!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Deut 18:9-18; Dan 2; Isa 47:5-15; Acts 16:16-34<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62110&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

As he read it they wept, worshipped, and went home rejoicing. Think: God’s Word is so powerful that all you have to do is expose people to it and their lives are changed. Notice the words, ‘Ezra…stood on a platform…they had made for the purpose.’ When the printing press was invented, one of the first books produced was the Bible. It gave birth to the Reformation, influenced the Industrial Revolution, and changed the world. Now fast–forward to the age of the internet. Today we have a ‘platform’ capable of reaching every level of society, all the way to the most remote corners of the earth. Instead of complaining about the garbage on the internet, become an internet evangelist, teacher, counsellor or encourager. Don’t let the enemy monopolise it! ‘Those who turn many to righteousness [will shine] like the stars forever and ever.’ (Daniel 12:3 NKJV) A geologist–turned–missionary was asked by a large oil company to go to work for them in the country where he ministered. His annual salary would be more than he’d earn in his entire lifetime as a missionary. But he said, ‘No.’ When they asked, ‘Isn’t the salary high enough?’ he replied, ‘The </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>salary’s</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>high enough; the </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>job</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>isn’t!’ Jesus said, ‘When I have been lifted…I will draw all people toward Me.’ (John 12:32 GWT) And we have been given a platform to reach the world—let’s use it! </span></p>

There’s the kind that warns you to stay away from fire. There’s the kind that cultivates respect for God (Psalm 2:11). Oswald Chambers said, ‘When you fear God, you fear nothing else, whereas if you do not fear God, you fear everything else.’ There’s fear that makes you feel helpless; sometimes it’s rooted in parental criticism or a bully’s threats and, although it’s groundless, it still haunts you. There’s the fear of failing, which if left unchallenged becomes the father of failure. Job said, ‘What I feared has come upon me.’ (Job 3:25 NIV) There’s fear of the unknown where your imagination runs amok. What if you never meet the ‘right person’, or you lose your job, or the biopsy confirms the worst? Over and over in His Word, God says, ‘Don’t be afraid…I am with you.’ Paul Tournier notes: ‘Life and faith always insist on moving forward—and I cannot move forward without leaving something behind. The trapeze artist must let go of one trapeze at precisely the right moment and hover in the void before grabbing the other. Faith calls us out of our comfort zone…to learn new skills and minister in different ways.’ But we get uptight. We think, ‘What if God asks me to do something I can’t do?’ or ‘I don’t have the strength, wisdom, or faith.’ If you were relying on your own resources, you’d be in trouble. But the fact is, ‘God…knew you and chose you.’ (1 Peter 1:2 NLT) Every time you meet a new challenge He strengthens you by proving that He not only supplies the tools, but is responsible for the outcome. </span></p>

It works like this: when you feel a certain way, you </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>act </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>accordingly. And when you </span><span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;>don’t </span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-GB&quot;>feel like doing something, but you do it anyway, that same dynamic creates the feeling consistent with your actions. Sure, it’s possible to live a life that’s opposite to the words you say, but at the end of the day you cannot live a life that’s antithetical to what you believe. Because fear is a learned response, it can be unlearned. There are two kinds of courage. The first kind calls for action. President Andrew Jackson said, ‘Take time to deliberate, but when the time for action arrives, stop thinking and go in. One man with courage makes a majority.’ The second kind calls for patience: the tenacity to keep persevering after you’ve done your best and before you’ve seen results. Often the difference between a hero and a coward is that a hero hangs in there five minutes longer! When you run from intimidating situations, fear multiplies until eventually it controls your life. But when you tackle your problems head–on, ‘not in human wisdom but in the power of God’, your confidence rises until you reach a point where you’re no longer controlled by fear. William Cowper wrote: ‘God moves in a mysterious way His wonders to perform. He plants His footsteps in the sea and rides upon the storm... Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take; the clouds ye so much dread are big with mercy and shall break in blessings on your head.’ </span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>‘Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not men.’ Ephesians 6:7 NIV</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>The story is told of a jockey who won more races than anybody else. When asked how he did it, he said before every race he went into the stables and read this poem to his horse: ‘Roses are red, violets are blue; horses that lose are made into glue!’ Fortunately, God doesn’t take that approach with us! But since He was the first employer in the universe, His Word has a lot to say about the responsibilities and rewards of hard work. ‘Slaves, obey your masters here on earth... just as you obey Christ... With all your heart you must do what God wants as people who are obeying Christ. Do your work with enthusiasm. Work as if you were serving the Lord, not as if you were serving only men and women. Remember that the Lord will give a reward to everyone...for doing good. Masters, in the same way, be good to your slaves. Do not threaten them. Remember that the One who is your Master and their Master is in Heaven, and he treats everyone alike.’ (Ephesians 6:5–9 NCV) If you’re the boss, Andrew Carnegie offers the following insights: (1) Organise. Always make sure you have the right person in the right slot. (2) Deputise. Don’t micro–manage. Give a man or woman full authority to do the job you hired them to do, then give them the freedom to do it. (3) Supervise. You don’t get what you expect; you get what you inspect. (4) Recognise. Good workers are hard to find. If you want to keep the ones you’ve got, recognise and reward their efforts.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>‘They go from strength to strength.’ Psalm 84:7 NKJV</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>The three essential steps to success are: (1) Do something; (2) Do something today; (3) Do something every day. One personal growth expert says, ‘We read about people who sail around the world in a thirty–foot sailboat or overcome handicaps to win a gold medal at the Olympics, and we later find their stories are all about persistence.’ If you want to know your future, look at your daily routine. You don’t determine your future, you determine your habits and your habits determine your future. The secret to success lies in doing the right things day after day. If you do that, you will eventually succeed. But a word of caution: important priorities have a way of slipping out of place while you’re focused on less important things. Some sacrifices are simply not worth it: (1) In your attempt to build a reputation, don’t lose your character. Reputation is what people think you are; character is what God and those closest to you know you are. (2) Don’t sacrifice your family for your career. If you do you’ll end up winning the admiration of those who don’t matter, while losing the love of those who do. (3) Don’t sacrifice your relationship with God for material things. God told His people, ‘You may say to yourself, “My power and the strength of my hands have produced this wealth for me.” But remember the Lord your God, for it is He who gives you the ability to produce wealth… If you ever forget the Lord… you will surely be destroyed.’ (Deuteronomy 8:17–18 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>‘His heart is established; he will not be afraid.’ Psalm 112:8 NKJV</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>Cartoonist Jonny Hawkins drew a sketch of five board members sitting around a table at the annual church business meeting. One says, ‘I see our church’s biggest problems as communication and procrastination.’ To which a fellow board member replies, ‘I vote that we postpone this discussion till next year.’ We smile, but we know it’s the truth, don’t we? In yesterday’s daily devotion we discovered that the first step to success is: Do something! Now let’s discuss the second step: (2) Do something today. Runner, author and cardiologist George Sheehan puts it this way: ‘There are those of us who are always about to live. We are waiting until things change, until there is more time, until we are less tired, until we get a promotion, until we settle down—until, until, until. It always seems as if there is some major event that must occur in our lives before we begin living.’ If you want to achieve your God–given dream, you can’t allow yourself to be one of those people! ‘How can I avoid it?’ you ask. By doing something that will move you forward today! You can’t fulfil your dream all at once. You have to get there in steps, and the only time you can actually take a step is—today. German philosopher Johann Wolfgang von Goethe said, ‘Each indecision brings its own delays, and days are lost lamenting over lost days… What you can do, or think you can do, begin it. For boldness has power and genius in it.’ So before the sun sets today, do something that will move you further toward your dream.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Forgiveness...in accordance with the riches of...grace.' Ephesians 1:7 NIV<br /><br /><p>'Peter asked, &quot;How many times should I forgive someone who does...wrong to me? Is seven times enough?&quot; Jesus answered: &quot;Not...seven...but seventy-seven times!&quot;' (Matthew 18:21-22 CEV) But we shouldn't stop there. If God gave each of us only seventy-seven 'forgiveness passes', we'd be in trouble! You can't bankrupt your 'forgiveness account' with God. But when you refuse to forgive others, you're overlooking the fact 'that next time it might be one of you who is in the wrong.' (Galatians 6:1 TLB) Jesus said, 'Whenever you pray, forgive anything you have against anyone. Then your Father in Heaven will forgive your failures.' (Mark 11:25 GWT) Whether it's seven, seventy-seven, or seven thousand times, you always reap what you sow (Galatians 6:7). We're all human, and when somebody hurts us we want justice. But God wants you to forgive the wrongdoer before he asks or shows any sign of remorse. Does that mean he will escape the consequences of his actions? No, it just means you're not responsible for making it happen - God is. Harbouring grudges is spiritually, emotionally and physically draining; forgiveness energises and frees you to move on. Remember, you've been forgiven 'in accordance with the riches of... grace... He lavished on us.' But it comes with the requirement that you forgive others! When you think about the debt God forgave you, anything anyone could ever do to you pales by comparison, right? Hymnwriter Annie Johnson Flint wrote: 'His love has no limits, His grace has no measure, His power no boundary known unto men; For out of His infinite riches in Jesus, He giveth and giveth and giveth again.' Now that's lavish grace!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Chron 4:24-5:26; Luke 11:45-54; Ps 119:1-8; Pro 20:15-18<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61982&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.' Matthew 5:9 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Try to picture these two scenes. First: Christ in Heaven defending you and acting as your Advocate before God. 'If anybody does sin, we have One who speaks to the Father in our defence - Jesus Christ...' (1 John 2:1 NIV) Second: You here on earth, accusing someone. The Bible calls Satan 'the accuser of our brothers... who accuses them before our God day and night.' (Revelation 12:10 NIV) Which side are you on? You say, 'But I heard it on the grapevine.' Has it ever occurred to you that you might not be connected to the right vine? Jesus said, 'I am the vine; you are the branches. If a man remains in Me and I in him, he will bear much fruit.' (John 15:5 NIV) The fruit Jesus referred to here is 'good' fruit. He said, 'Blessed are the peacemakers.' And what's the opposite of a peacemaker? A stirrer! These are often people with inner turmoil, unresolved issues or a chip on their shoulder who go through life stirring stuff up. When they see a tapestry, they look for a thread to unravel it. Some do it deliberately, others unwittingly. When you have little or no joy in your own life, it's hard to celebrate joy in the lives of others. To be a peacemaker you must nip conflict, criticism and complaining in the bud. Tactfully steer the conversation in a different direction. And if need be, talk to the person who is stirring things up. At best, you'll help them to change. At second best, they'll think twice about what they say to you.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Chron 3:1-4:23; Luke 11:29-44; Ps 78:65-72; Pro 20:11-14<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61981&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ 'If your gift is to encourage others, be encouraging.' Romans 12:8 NLT<br /><br /><p>Many a man and woman who quit would have kept going if they had just received a word of encouragement from someone. Encouragement is so vital that the Scriptures rank it up there with gifts like teaching and leadership (Romans 12:6-8). Here are two stories that illustrate the power of encouragement. Story one: Not long ago, the world watched as three grey whales, icebound off Point Barrow, Alaska, floated battered and bloody, gasping for breath at a hole in the ice. The whales' only hope was to be somehow transported eight kilometres past the ice pack to the open sea. Rescuers began cutting a string of breathing holes about 20 m apart in the 15 cm thick ice. For eight days they painstakingly coaxed the whales from one hole to the next, kilometre after kilometre. Along the way, one of the trio vanished and was presumed dead. But finally, with the help of Russian icebreakers, the other two whales, Putu and Siku, swam to freedom. Story two: Jackie Robinson was the first black player in the US to play major league baseball. While breaking baseball's colour barrier, he faced jeering crowds in every stadium. Playing one day in his home stadium in Brooklyn, he made an error and his own fans began to boo him. As he stood, humiliated, at second base, 'Pee Wee' Reese came over and stood next to him. He put his arm around Robinson and they faced the crowd together. The fans grew quiet; the game continued. Robinson later said that arm around his shoulder saved his career! Encouragement - it's a powerful thing. So who can you encourage today?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...When He saw the multitudes, He was moved with compassion for them...' Matthew 9:36 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Christ's concern for a hurting world revealed itself in two ways: condemnation towards those who took advantage of others and compassion towards those who couldn't help themselves. One time He took a whip and threw the money changers out of the temple; another time He healed the sick and fed the hungry. There's a lesson here: you can become complacent and say, 'I know there's trouble in the world. It's regrettable. But as long as it doesn't touch me personally, I'd prefer not to think about it. Cheating goes on every day in business and politics. That's just the way things are.' Like the priest and the Levite in the story of the Good Samaritan, you 'pass by on the other side' (Luke 10:30-36). The sad fact is that even churches that faithfully preach the Word and win souls (two all-important missions) fail in this area. Why? Because they're afraid of being identified with those who promote a 'social gospel'. But the opposite should concern us! 'If anyone has material possessions and sees his brother in need but has no pity...how can the love of God be in him? ...Let us not love with words or tongue but with actions and in truth.' (1 John 3:17-18 NIV) What moves you? Success in business? Building a great family? Excelling in ministry? Those are worthy goals, but if you want to know what moved Christ, read this: 'When He saw the multitudes, He was moved with compassion.' So don't lose your compassionate edge.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Nah 1-3, Lk 8:16- 25, Ps 14, Prov 19:1-4 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62070&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...Faith...if it does not have works, is dead.' James 2:17 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Mother Teresa said, 'The biggest disease today isn't leprosy or cancer. It's the feeling of being uncared for, unwanted - of being deserted and alone.' As a result, she spent her life rescuing sick babies and giving dignity to the dying. Asked why she did it, she replied, 'Because Jesus did.' What a great answer! When simultaneous disasters hit different countries around the world, humanitarian organisations say we suffer from 'donor fatigue'. Let's add one more: 'compassion failure.' Philosopher Miguel de Unamuno wrote, 'Warmth, warmth, more warmth! For we are dying of cold and not of darkness. It is not the night that kills, but the frost.' Think about this: of the 1,189 chapters in the Bible, 250 contain the words of the prophets. That's roughly 21 percent. Half of what they say denounces sin and the other half condemns those who see human suffering and do nothing about it. Yet events that horrified those same prophets take place in our world every day, and we're immune to them. Like wearing a watch, you get used to it and after a while you don't even notice it. But the prophets noticed! They never became desensitised to sin - or human suffering. And you mustn't either. You say, 'But my main focus at the moment is on building up my faith.' That's a good thing; but never forget that 'Faith by itself, if it does not have works [of compassion], is dead.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...We do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathise with our weaknesses...' Hebrews 4:15 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Dr Joseph Parker told his theology students, 'Preach to the suffering and you will never lack a congregation. There is a broken heart in every pew.' Don't lose your compassionate edge, because you can't heal a broken heart unless you can first empathise with it. The Bible says, 'We do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathise with our weaknesses.' When you lose touch with people, you lose your touch when it comes to ministering to them. Jesus went looking for the leper, the loser, the lonely, the lost and the lowest in society. And He was comfortable around them. Are you? Serving others is actually good for your health. A survey conducted at 44 major universities reveals that giving protects your overall health twice as much as an aspirin protects your heart against disease. Dr Stephen Post, who conducted the survey, says, 'Giving is the most potent force on the planet and will protect your whole life.' The benefits of compassion to your physical health are so strong that if compassion wasn't free, pharmaceutical companies would herald the discovery of a stupendous new drug called 'give back' instead of Prozac.' We give for different reasons: to get an income tax deduction; to make a good impression and have people think well of us; or because we're put under pressure. You can give without loving, but you can't love without giving. Your time, talent and treasure are to be shared with others. When you refuse, you're neither happy, holy nor healthy.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...You need someone to teach you...' Hebrews 5:12 NIV<br /><br /><p>Marlene LeFever quipped, 'Becoming an effective teacher is simple. You just prepare and prepare until drops of blood appear on your forehead.' In the 1920s Charlie Chaplin was the most famous person in the world. Born into poverty, he worked on the stage to support himself and by the age of 17 he was a veteran performer. Then at the age of 29 he did something unheard of: he signed the entertainment industry's first million-dollar contract. But he wasn't successful simply because he had talent and drive. He was also teachable. He kept learning and perfecting his gift. Even at the height of his career, the highest paid performer in the world didn't rest on his laurels. He said: 'When I watch one of my pictures, I pay attention to what the audience doesn't laugh at. If several audiences don't laugh at a stunt, I tear it apart and try to discover what's wrong. On the other hand, if I hear laughter I hadn't expected, I ask myself why that particular thing rang the bell with the audience.' The truth is, if Charlie Chaplin had replaced teachability with complacency and arrogance, we probably wouldn't even remember his name today. But he didn't. He never forgot the basics and he committed himself to learning. Eventually he co-founded United Artists, a mega-movie company that's still in business today. There's an important principle in this story. The Bible says, 'Though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you the elementary truths of God's Word all over again.' If you want God to use you, stay teachable and never stop learning.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[ 'A person without self-control...' Proverbs 25:28 NLT<br /><br /><p>The boy said, 'He made me do it, Dad. He was nasty to me.' Attempting to teach his son responsibility, his father replied, 'Son, you've got to learn that you are the guard at the door of your own life. You're in charge. Nothing gets in or out without your permission.' That's a picture of how things work in your spiritual life! 'A person without self-control is like a city with broken-down walls' - a defenceless city, because its guard failed to protect it. But what if the enemy is too powerful for you? For God's people, all warfare is spiritual. Whether you're tested on the social, financial, emotional or sexual front, the battle must be won spiritually. And the rule in spiritual warfare is: '...Greater is He that is in you, than he that is in the world.' (1 John 4:4 KJV) When your personal territory is under assault, you're never abandoned to your own devices - unless you choose to be. However inadequate you feel, however intimidating the situation looks, no matter how many battles you've already lost, the power of the Holy Spirit within you is always adequate to guarantee your victory. What's the key to releasing that power? (1) '...Clothe yourself with the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ. And don't let yourself think about ways to indulge your evil desires.' (Romans 13:14 NLT) Invite the Lord to take the wheel and redirect your thoughts. (2) '...The Holy Spirit produces this kind of fruit in our lives...self-control...' (Galatians 5:22-23 NLT) God's Spirit won't forcibly control you. But He will enable you to control yourself, resist temptation, master your vulnerability and win the victory.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Mt 5:10, 1 Th 2:13-3:5, 1 Cor 4:11-13, Rev 6:9-11 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62071&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ 'The Gospel...of which I, Paul, have become a servant.' Colossians 1:23 NIV<br /><br /><p>Who am I? What's my calling? The apostle Paul, who considered himself '...not in the least inferior to the most eminent apostles' (2 Corinthians 11:5 NAS), answers simply: 'I am Paul. My role is serving. I am a servant to the Gospel and the body of Christ.' Certain people in the early church tried to determine which of the apostles were the greatest. Some claimed Paul, and others Apollos. But Paul challenged them, 'What, after all, is Apollos? And what is Paul? Only servants, through whom you came to believe...' (1 Corinthians 3:5 NIV) Whatever your calling, be it pastor of a megachurch or a lay member, you're no more - and no less - than a servant. In God's Kingdom class distinctions don't count. 'There is neither Jew nor Greek...slave nor free man...male nor female...you are all one in Christ Jesus.' (Galatians 3:28 NAS) We're servants called to do the will of God, wherever He appoints us to serve. And that's a good thing! In being a servant there's relief from 'the pressure to perform'. No one has the right to judge you except your Master. 'Who are you to judge the servant of another? To his own master he stands or falls...' (Romans 14:4 NAS) We should be concerned about what pleases God, not people. He alone can evaluate our service. Jesus came to serve His Father, saying, '...I do not seek My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.' (John 5:30 NAS) And He has also sent you to do God's will, promising that, '...If anyone serves Me, the Father will honour him.' (John 12:26 NAS)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[ 'Make up your mind not to put any stumbling block...in your brother's way.' Romans 14:13 NIV<br /><br /><p>If you want to win someone to Christ, there are certain stumbling blocks you may have to remove. Let's be honest, people are turned off by religion for a lot of reasons - legitimate ones. Let's look at some: (1) <em>Hypocrisy</em>. Think about the twelve disciples; one of them betrayed Jesus, one denied Him, and one doubted Him. That's a 25% failure rate! But the good news is, Jesus continues to love us and work with us in spite of our problems. (2) <em>Terminology</em>. If you grew up in the church, you're probably familiar with Bible terminology. But don't assume everybody else is, or you'll talk over their heads. When Jesus talked to shepherds, He discussed sheep. When He talked to farmers, He discussed sowing and reaping. Identify the person's interests and spiritual needs, then use language they understand. (3) <em>Negative emphasis</em>. If your major emphasis is on what people don't do, they'll run in the opposite direction. A well-known preacher says, 'I grew up understanding what our church was against, but never what it was for. Basically, we were against everything!' Smiling, he added, 'We preached against smoking and drinking. We especially preached against adultery, because we believed that could lead to dancing.' Seriously, the Gospel is not about what you lose when you come to Christ, but what you gain. Jesus said, '...I have come that they may have life and have it to the full.' (John 10:10 NIV) If you're serious about winning people to Christ, you must recognise the stumbling blocks that stand in their way and try to remove them.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezra 1-2, Lk 9:34-45, Ps 46, Prov 19:18-20 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62072&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ 'Make up your mind not to put any stumbling block...in your brother's way.' Romans 14:13 NIV<br /><br /><p>Here are two more stumbling blocks you need to remove in order to win someone to Christ: (1) <em>Boredom</em>. Jesus isn't boring, but sometimes religion is. The story is told of a lady who fell asleep during the sermon. Pointing at the man sitting next to her, the pastor said, 'Please wake that woman up!' The man replied, 'You put her to sleep, Reverend, you wake her up!' Jesus is called 'the Good Shepherd' (John 10:11), and the Greek word for '<em>good</em>' is 'kalos', which means '<em>captivating</em>'; that's the Christ we need to present to those seeking spiritual direction. (2) <em>Money</em>. It's been said the most sensitive nerve in a person's body is the one that runs to their wallet. Have there been financial scandals in the church? Yes. They even had them in the New Testament church (Acts 5). But don't throw the baby out with the bath water! It takes money to build churches, feed and clothe the needy and send out missionaries. When money is in the right hands, it's a solution, not a problem. Furthermore, if God can trust you to finance His plans, He will show you how to make more money. He said, '...I am the Lord your God, Who teaches you to profit...' (Isaiah 48:17 AMP) (3) <em>Discomfort</em>. People say, 'I just don't feel comfortable in church.' The truth can do that to you! The Gospel is designed to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable. When Paul preached, some people trembled, but when trembling leads to trusting in Christ, it's a good thing.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezra 3-5, Lk 9:46-62, Ps 78:1-8, Prov 19:21-23 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62073&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...If we could control our tongues, we...could also control ourselves in every other way.' James 3:2 NLT<br /><br /><p>The saying goes, 'We are like cats; we lick ourselves with our tongues!' When someone spreads gossip, mark that person carefully. Why? Because if they talk to you about somebody else, they'll talk to somebody else about you. The Bible warns us about three things: (1) <em>a hasty tongue</em>. 'Do you see a man hasty in his words? There is more hope for a fool than for him.' (Proverbs 29:20 NKJV) If you take time to get the facts, much of the time you'll speak differently. Hannah prayed so passionately for a child that Eli the high priest thought she was drunk. When the disciples saw Jesus walking toward them on the Sea of Galilee, they thought He was a ghost. So think, or better yet, pray before you jump to conclusions. (2) <em>a flattering tongue</em>. '...There is no faithfulness in their mouth...they flatter with their tongue.' (Psalm 5:9 NKJV) Say what you mean and mean what you say. Be genuine. When you flatter people, you manipulate them for your own ends. Don't do that. Give it to them straight. If you love them, be truthful with them. (3) <em>a judgmental tongue</em>. Jesus said, 'Judge not, that you be not judged. For with what judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with the measure you use, it will be measured back to you.' (Matthew 7:1-2 NKJV) If you live long enough, you'll be guilty of many of the same things you're so quick to condemn in others. The truth is, how you deal with other people determines how God deals with you.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezra 6-8, Lk 10:1-15, Ps 78:9-16, Prov 19:24-26 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62074&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Jesus was...tempted by the devil.' Matthew 4:1 NIV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says, 'Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.' Notice who led Jesus there: God! You're in training for your destiny, and a good trainer has one thing in mind - turning flab into muscle. So he takes you into the gym and increases the weights until you break a sweat and start thinking, 'I don't know how much more of this I can take.' But God does. It's only when you look back that you realise you're handling situations today you couldn't have handled a year ago. Sometimes old temptations will return with a vengeance. They'll hound you until you think you need some new, novel, quick-fix strategy. Like the Israelites at the Red Sea, just when they thought they were finally free from a life of slavery, here comes Pharaoh. At that point they cried out to God in fear, saying, 'It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians...' (Exodus 14:12 NIV) 'Then the Lord said to Moses, &quot;Why are you crying out to Me? Tell the Israelites to move on. Raise your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea to divide the water&quot;...' (Exodus 14:15-16) God used Moses' rod - again! Victory over the Egyptians didn't come from discovering something new; it came from using what God had already given them. You have the power inside you today to overcome the temptation you're facing right now. You just need to tap into it. Paul said, 'Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us.' (Ephesians 3:20 NKJV)</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezra 9-10; Luke 10:16-28; Ps 78:17-31; Pro 19:27-29<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61975&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Each one is tempted.' James 1:14 NKJV <br /><br /><p>Ignorance of Scripture is one of the greatest weapons Satan has against you. Three times he tempted Jesus, and he used Scripture to do it! But he didn't prevail because Jesus knew what God's Word says - and doesn't say. We're vulnerable to Satan's attacks when we know only snippets of Scripture and favourite passages instead of '...the whole counsel of God.' (Acts 20:27 NKJV) Paul writes, 'All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.' (2 Timothy 3:16-17 NIV) We get into trouble when we wrench a Scripture out of context, and make it a pretext for claiming something God never promised. Or if He did, we fail to read the fine print that spells out His terms and conditions. Paul commended the Thessalonians: '...when you received the Word of God...from us, you welcomed it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the Word of God, which also effectively works in you who believe.' (1 Thessalonians 2:13 NKJV) Notice the order here: God's Word must first work in you before it works for you! We like to quote such Scriptures as '...whatever he does shall prosper,' (Psalm 1:3 NKJV) but you must take into account the preceding verses: 'Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stands in the path of sinners, nor sits in the seat of the scornful; but his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in His law he meditates day and night.' (Psalm 1:1-2 NKJV) If you want God's blessing, you must meet His conditions.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 John 1:1-3:10; Luke 10:29-42; Ps 78:32-39; Pro 20:1-3<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61976&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['My strength is made perfect in weakness.' 2 Corinthians 12:9 NKJV <br /><br /><p>You ask, 'How long will this temptation last?' Sometimes the enemy's attack is short-term, other times it is long-term. Paul had a 'thorn' in his flesh, one that wouldn't go away. Why did he have it? Pride! 'Lest I should be exalted above measure by the abundance of the revelations, a thorn in the flesh was given to me.' (2 Corinthians 12:7 NKJV) Paul spoke several languages and wrote half the New Testament. With credentials like that, it's easy to become arrogant. Finally he stopped praying for an exit strategy and began to understand God's purpose: 'My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.' (2 Corinthians 12:9 NKJV) Pride is one of the most neglected subjects in church today. Perhaps that's due to the fact that we receive our teaching from people who often struggle with it themselves. Pride doesn't necessarily show on your face, but when you're under pressure it surfaces in your actions and attitudes. Pride originated with Satan: 'I will make myself like the Most High.' (Isaiah 14:14 NIV) Often the core of atheism is pride; a person with no god plays God. Satan used this strategy in Eden. 'God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God.' (Genesis 3:5 NKJV) That's why Paul told the Philippians, 'You must have the same attitude that Christ Jesus had. Though He was God... He gave up His divine privileges; He took the humble position of a slave... Therefore, God elevated Him to the place of highest honour.' (Philippians 2:5-9 NLT) The key to overcoming temptation is submitting to God and living in daily dependence on Him.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: John 1:1-14; Matt 4:12-16; Matt 5:14-16; Acts 9:1-19 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61977&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Don't you know Me...?' John 14:9 NIV<br /><br /><p>A fascinating encounter took place between Jesus and Philip. When 'Philip said, &quot;Lord, show us the Father...&quot; Jesus answered: &quot;Don't you know Me, Philip, even after I have been among you such a long time?&quot;' (John 14:8-9 NIV) There's a lesson here for all of us. You can go to church regularly, serve on the board and sing in the choir, yet not really 'know' the Lord. To truly know someone, you must spend time with them, sharing and opening your heart. In other words, the relationship must become your top priority. What you are reading is called a 'devotional' because its aim is to bring you to the place where you're more devoted to Christ than anything else. Does that mean neglecting other things? No, it'll actually enhance every other area of your life. The Bible says, 'He made known His ways to Moses, His acts to the children of Israel.' (Psalm 103:7 NKJV) Israel knew God's acts because they were observers, whereas Moses knew His ways because he was intimate with Him. Israel saw what God did; Moses was close enough to understand His thinking and why He did what He did. Three times Jesus asked Peter, 'Do you love Me?' (John 21:15 NKJV) The first two times Peter answered, 'Yes.' The third time, frustrated by the question, he answered, 'Lord, You know all things; You know that I love You.' (John 21:17 NKJV) Note the words, 'Lord, You know.' You can fool others, and even yourself, but the Lord knows the quality of your love for Him. Today His desire is to draw you closer to Himself. Are you available?</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 John 3:11-5:21; Luke 11:1-13; Ps 78:40-55; Pro 20:4-6<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61979&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['A sensible man watches for problems ahead and prepares to meet them.' Proverbs 27:12 TLB<br /><br /><p>The path to your God-given destiny will have different challenges, so you must expect them. Indeed you must prepare yourself to face them. Solomon wrote, 'A sensible man watches for problems ahead and prepares to meet them.' Wouldn't you rather look ahead and prepare, instead of looking back with regret? Why does the Bible record the failures of great men like Abraham, Moses, Elijah and Peter? To give you hope; to let you know that nobody performs flawlessly; to help you believe if they can do it, by God's grace you can too. The road to success has many potholes. You'll fall into some - and they're messy. Not only will you have to climb back out, you'll have to dust yourself off, refocus, recommit, and keep going. Since failure is inevitable, why not make it your friend by examining each experience and growing stronger through it? Once you learn to do that, you won't keep repeating the same mistakes, and you'll become more emotionally and spiritually stable. Timelines change, resources dry up, assumptions prove false, plans and people fail. As comedian Bill Cosby quipped, 'Nothing fits in a pigeonhole but a pigeon.' As you walk the pathway to your God-given dream, remember the old Italian proverb: 'Between saying and doing, many a pair of shoes is worn out.' No problem; you can get another pair of shoes! Just make sure you don't wear out and give up. Here's God's promise to you: 'Keep travelling steadily along His pathway and in due season He will honour you with every blessing.' (Psalm 37:34 TLB)</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Chron 1-2; Luke 11:14-28; Ps 78:56-64; Pro 20:7-10<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61980&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I press on toward the goal for the prize.' Philippians 3:14 NIV<br /><br /><p>Paul writes: 'Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me... All of us...who are mature should take such a view of things.' (Philippians 3:13-15 NIV) Paul was driven by his vision of reaching the world for Christ (Romans 10:1). It was his yardstick for daily living and his motivation for every effort. It made him relentless. An unknown poet wrote: 'When things go wrong as they sometimes will, and the road you're trudging seems all uphill. When funds are low and the debts are high, and you want to smile but you have to sigh. When things are pressing you down a bit, rest if you must, but don't you quit! Life is strange with its twists and turns, as every one of us sometimes learns. And many a failure turns about, when he might have won if he'd stuck it out. Don't give up, though the pace seems slow - you might succeed with another blow. Often the goal is nearer than it seems, to a faint and faltering man. Often the struggler has given up, when he might have captured the victor's cup. And he learned too late, when the night slipped down, how close he was to the golden crown. Success is failure turned inside out - the silver tint of the clouds of doubt. You never can tell how close you are, it may be near when it seems afar. So stick to the fight when you're hardest hit - it's when things seem worst that you mustn't quit.'</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Chron 6:1-7:19; Luke 12:1-12; Ps 119:9-16; Pro 20:19-21<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61983&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['One's life does not consist in the abundance of the things he possesses.' Luke 12:15 NKJV<br /><br /><p>It is said that, in 1923, seven of the world's most successful men met at a Chicago hotel: the president of the largest independent steel company, the president of the largest utility company, the greatest wheat speculator, the president of the New York Stock Exchange, a member of the President's Cabinet, the president of the Bank of International Settlements and the president of the world's greatest monopoly. Collectively these tycoons controlled more money than there was in the United States' Treasury. Now, fast forward 25 years and let's see what happened to them. Charles Schwab, president of the largest independent steel company, lived the last five years of his life on borrowed money and died a pauper. Arthur Cooger, the greatest wheat speculator, shot himself. Richard Whitney, president of the New York Stock Exchange, spent three years in prison. Albert Fall, a member of the President's cabinet, went to prison for bribery. Leon Fraser, president of the U.S. Bank of International Settlements, shot himself. Ivan Kreuger, head of one of the world's largest monopolies, also committed suicide. If the recent economic upheaval has taught us anything, it's that money brings neither security nor happiness. Yes, God will bless you with money (Deuteronomy 8:18). And He will do it for two reasons: (1) Because He delights in seeing His redeemed children walk in His blessings (Psalms 35:27). (2) Because He expects you to use your money to reach a hurting world with God's love. If you keep those two things in mind, you'll be living for the right reasons.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Chron 7:20-9:44; Luke 12:13-21; Ps 119:17-24; Pro 20:22-24<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61984&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['God is working in you, giving you the desire and the power to do what pleases Him.' Philippians 2:13 NLT <br /><br /><p>Owning your dream means having your belief in yourself outweigh your fears. Acclaimed leadership author John Maxwell wrote in his book, <em>Failing Forward: How to Make the Most of Your Mistakes</em>, this inspirational thought: 'If you know who you are, make the changes you must in order to learn and grow, and then give everything you've got to your dreams, you can achieve anything your heart desires.' It's not about the failures you've experienced in the past. As Maxwell says: 'If you tend to focus on the particular events in your life, try to put things into perspective. When you do, you'll be able to share the philosophy of someone such as the apostle Paul, who was able to say, &quot;I have learned, in whatever state I am, to be content.&quot; (Philippians 4:11 NKJV) And that was saying a lot, considering that Paul had been shipwrecked, whipped, beaten, stoned, and imprisoned. Throughout everything, his faith enabled him to maintain perspective. He realised that as long as he was doing what he was supposed to do, his being labelled success or failure by others really didn't matter.'</p>
<p>So which matters more to you? Your past failures or the dreams God has laid on your heart? God gave you these unique abilities because He has plans for you: 'I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans to prosper and not harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.' (Jeremiah 29:11 NIV)</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Exo 16:1-18; John 6:1-15; John 6:25-40; 1 Cor 11:23-24 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61986&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Christ also loved the church and gave Himself for her.' Ephesians 5:25 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The church isn't made up of people who are better than everybody else. It's made up of people who want to be better than they are, and who know that, by the grace of God, they can be. Have church leaders sometimes failed us? Yes, but Jesus Christ, the Head of the church, hasn't failed us - and He never will! Christ's church, of which your local church is a part, was planned by God before the world began (Ephesians 1:4). It was paid for in the crimson cash of Jesus' blood, has been sustained through history by the sacrifice of the martyrs, is prophesied to be more glorious in its ending than its beginning, and is being prepared right now as a bride for her Husband. John the Revelator describes it this way: 'Rejoice and give Him glory, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready.' (Revelation 19:7 NKJV) So before you attack the leadership, withdraw your membership or withhold your stewardship, remember that nothing on earth is dearer to the heart of God than His church. The truth is, when you hurt any part of the body you also hurt the Head. And here's something else to keep in mind: the only thing on earth that has a future is the church; all the rest is going up in smoke. And the church's insurance policy is guaranteed by Jesus Himself, Who said, 'I will build My church; and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.' (Matthew 16:18 NKJV) So love your church - Jesus does!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Chron 10:1-12:22; Luke 12:22-34; Ps 119:25-32; Pro 20:25-27<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61987&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['You also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house.' 1 Peter 2:5 NIV<br /><br /><p>We don't go to church, we are the church! If we met for worship in the parking lot, we'd still be the church! Consider Solomon's temple. It was planned by David the father, built by Solomon the son, and at its dedication filled with the Holy Spirit. Here are three ways your church is just like Solomon's temple: (1) <em>It was built on redemption ground!</em> Mount Moriah, the scene of Solomon's temple, is where Abraham took his son Isaac to offer him as a sacrifice. Guess what? Two thousand years later God led His only begotten Son up that same mountain to die for our sins. As GD Boardman said, 'The cross is the only ladder high enough to touch Heaven's threshold.' (2) <em>It was the most unique building ever constructed.</em> It was built from stones made ready before they were brought together. They were washed, then fashioned, then fitted together. And that's our story too, isn't it? 'You also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house... offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.' (3) <em>The building materials came from many nations.</em> We aren't saved by race, but by grace. It's not the blood that flows in your veins that saves you; it's the blood that flowed from Christ's veins that makes you righteous and accepted before God. Two unique phrases are used to describe Solomon's temple: 'exceeding magnificent' (1 Chronicles 22:5 NKJV); 'famous everywhere for its greatness and beauty.' (1 Chronicles 22:5 NCV) That's how God feels about His church, and you should too!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Chron 12:23-15:29; Luke 12:35-48; Ps 119:33-40; Pro 20:28-30<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61988&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The glory of the Lord filled the house of the Lord.' 1 Kings 8:11 NKJV <br /><br /><p>Only when the Ark of the Covenant was brought into the temple and set in its rightful position, which was the central place, did God's glory fill the temple. 'Then the priests brought in the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord to its place...[And] the cloud filled the house of the Lord, so that the priests could not continue ministering because of the cloud; for the glory of the Lord filled the house of the Lord.' (1 Kings 8:6, 10-11 NKJV) There's a lesson here for all of us, particularly those in church leadership. Christ alone must have centre stage! Programmes and promotions are fine but only when Jesus is honoured as Lord, His Word preached and His presence reverenced and relished, will His glory fill the church. Next time you're standing in God's house singing His praise, pause and remind yourself: it's about Him, not me! One day the telephone rang in the clergyman's office at the Washington church President Franklin Roosevelt attended. A voice enquired, 'Do you expect the President to be in church on Sunday?' The pastor answered, 'That, I cannot promise. But we expect the Lord to be there, and that should be incentive enough for a reasonably large attendance.' Hymnist Fanny Crosby wrote these words: 'Were the whole realm of nature mine, that were a present far too small. Love so amazing, so divine, demands my soul, my life, my all.' Next Sunday don't just fill the pew, fill God's house with your heartfelt praise.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Chron 16-18; Luke 12:49-59; Ps 119:41-48; Pro 21:1-3<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61989&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The many parts make up one whole body.' 1 Corinthians 12:12 NLT <br /><br /><p>The Bible says, 'The human body has many parts, but the many parts make up one whole body.' Let's use what may seem like a ridiculous illustration. Imagine your foot no longer wanting to be part of your body and when you ask why, it starts saying things like, 'I'm tired of getting walked on and dragged through the mud. Other parts of the body get off easy, but I have to do the heavy lifting. Nobody appreciates me. They talk about beautiful eyes and hair and lips, but nobody writes songs about feet. So I'm leaving.' When you enquire what your foot's future plans are, it says, 'I'm just going to sit at home and watch Christian TV.' Now, Christian broadcasting has a very important role in society, especially for those who are shut in and can't get out to church. But when you leave a church without God's permission, you no longer function as He designed you to. You may have peace for a while, but you'll have no fulfilment. And because you are cut off from your spiritual food supply - you won't grow into maturity. 'Yes, the body has many different parts, not just one part. If the foot says, I am not a part of the body because I am not a hand, that does not make it any less a part of the body...God has put each part just where he wants it...In fact, some parts of the body that seem weakest and least important are actually the most necessary.' (1 Corinthians 12:14-22 NLT) Why should you come back to church? For fellowship, food, function and fulfilment.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Chron 19:1-23:20; Luke 13:1-17; Ps 119:49-56; Pro 21:4-6<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61992&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['If My people who are called by My name will humble themselves.' 2 Chronicles 7:14 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Can you imagine God's presence being so real in a Sunday morning service that the pastor doesn't get to preach, the choir and special singers don't get to perform and the deacons can't attend to their duties? It happened in Solomon's temple. Observe the elements at work in church that day: (1) <em>They confessed their sins</em>. John Owen said, 'He that hath slight thoughts of sin, never had great thoughts of God.' Things that trouble you nowhere else will trouble you profoundly in the presence of God. What kinds of things? Politics without principle, pleasure without conscience, reputation without character, and knowledge without conviction. (2) <em>They humbled themselves</em>. The Bible says, 'God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.' (James 4:6 NKJV) Humility means saying, 'Lord, I don't have a thing You didn't give me. And everything I'll ever need comes from You.' (3) <em>They prayed</em>; not formal, poetic prayers, but heartfelt prayers of repentance. Here's how God responded: 'If My people who are called by My name will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from Heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land. Now My eyes will be open and My ears attentive to prayer made in this place.' (2 Chronicles 7:14-15 NKJV) (4) <em>They gave sacrificially</em>. The people brought 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep, the largest sacrifice recorded in the Bible. When you open your hand to lift the name of God up, He opens His hand to lift you up. But here's the thing: God has a bigger hand!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Chron 23:21-26:19; Luke 13:18-35; Ps 119:57-64; Pro 21:7-9<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61991&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Lord will lift up a standard [shield of defence].' Isaiah 59:19 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Notice what Solomon prayed for at the dedication of the temple. 'If there is famine in the land...if Your people's enemies are in the land...whatever disaster or disease there is... then hear from Heaven where You live...Then they will fear You and walk in Your ways as long as they live.' (2 Chronicles 6:28-31 NLT) When you're functioning in your rightful place in church you can: (1) <em>Pray with confidence in times of economic difficulty</em>. One of the names by which Israel knew God was 'Jehovah Jireh' which means the Lord will provide. Your security isn't in Wall Street or any other street! It's in God's unfailing goodness (Psalm 23:6). (2) <em>Pray with confidence in times of sickness</em>. God's promise to you is this: 'Is any among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise him up.' (James 5:14-15 NKJV) (3) <em>Pray with confidence when you're facing disaster</em>. 'He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress; My God, in Him I will trust.' (Psalm 91:1-2 NKJV) (4) <em>Pray with confidence when the devil is attacking you</em>. 'When the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard [shield of defence] against him.' (Isaiah 59:19 NKJV) As a redeemed member of Christ's church, these are your 'rights', so exercise them!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Chron 26:20-29:30; Luke 14:1-14; Ps 119:65-72; Pro 21:10-13<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61993&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['You too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives.' Ephesians 2:22 NIV <br /><br /><p>Jesus lives in each of those who make up His church. 'You are... members of God's household, built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus Himself as the chief cornerstone. In Him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord. And in Him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by His Spirit.' (Ephesians 2:19-22 NIV) Nothing is nearer and dearer to the heart of God than His church. 'Christ... loved the church and gave Himself for her.' (Ephesians 5:25 NKJV) His greatest interest, and the core of His eternal purpose, is that 'through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known.' (Ephesians 3:10 NIV) You ask, 'How can I become a member of Christ's church?' It's a family; you must be born into it. That's why Jesus told Nicodemus, 'You must be born again.' (John 3:7 NKJV) You don't get in by shaking a preacher's hand, filling out a membership card or making a donation to the building fund. The Bible says, 'Receive one another, just as Christ...received [you].' (Romans 15:7 NKJV) Once you've accepted Christ and He has accepted you, you're 'in'. You may not have the high profile others enjoy in your church, but in God's eyes you're a bona fide, blood-washed, Heaven-bound member of His family. The Bible says, 'The Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved' (Acts 2:47 KJV) - and when He adds you, there's not a soul on earth who can subtract you!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: John 4:4-26; John 7:37-41; Exo 17:1-7; Isa 35:1-7 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61994&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...after you have suffered a while, [may God] perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle you.' 1 Peter 5:10 NKJV<br /><br /><p>It took seven years to build Solomon's temple. In Scripture the number seven represents completion. So when it comes to your 'position' in Christ, you're as saved right now as you'll be when you stand in Heaven. When Jesus cried, 'It is finished', everything required to reconcile you to God was completed. The word 'complete' means lacking nothing. And when you put your trust in Jesus, that's how God sees you. When He positions you in Christ, 'You are complete in Him.' (Colossians 2:10 NKJV) You say, 'But I still sin.' The Bible says, 'We all... beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image...by the Spirit of the Lord.' (2 Corinthians 3:18 NKJV) Did you get that? The Holy Spirit is at work in your life every day, in every way, moulding you into the image of Jesus. God's ultimate plan for you is greater than you can comprehend. Jude writes, 'Now unto Him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy... be glory and majesty.' (Jude 1:24-25 KJV) Note the words 'Him that is able'. This is something Christ does for you, not something you do for yourself! And one of the tools He uses to bring about your perfection (maturity) is trouble. Peter writes, 'May the God of all grace, who has called us to His eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a while, perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle you.' It may take a while, but you'll get there!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Chron 1-4; Luke 14:15-24; Ps 119:73-80; Pro 21:14-16<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61995&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['He departed again to the mountain by Himself alone.' John 6:15 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says: 'When Jesus perceived that they were about to come and take Him by force to make Him King, He departed again to the mountain by Himself alone. Now when evening came, His disciples went down to the sea, got into the boat, and went over the sea toward Capernaum... Then the sea arose because a great wind was blowing. So when they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near the boat; and they were afraid. But He said to them, &quot;It is I; do not be afraid.&quot; Then they willingly received Him into the boat, and immediately the boat was at the land where they were going.' (John 6:15-21 NKJV) Notice three things in this story: (1) <em>The control Jesus exercised</em>. People wanted to plan His life for Him. Sound familiar? When that happened, 'He departed again to the mountain by Himself alone.' Note the word 'again'. Spending time with God was something He did regularly. Do you? (2) <em>The criticism Jesus evoked</em>. When the crowd wants to make you 'King', it's hard for your ego to walk away. But Jesus did. Others couldn't impose their will or agenda on Him. Why? Because He was committed to doing the will of God and nothing else. (3) <em>The communion Jesus enjoyed</em>. He emerged from a night of prayer empowered to walk on the water and subdue the storm. If you want to succeed in life, there's only one source you can go to for strength and guidance: God. Do you want to take control of your life? That's how you do it!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Chron 5-7; Luke 14:25-35; Ps 119:81-88; Pro 21:17-19<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61996&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you.' Matthew 5:44 NKJV<br /><br /><p>An unforgiving attitude can keep you from moving forward in life. So isn't it time you got serious about forgiving the one who hurt you? You say, 'But then they'll have got away with it.' They're not getting away with anything! God is qualified to judge; you're not. Remember, your critics are making decisions about you based on limited information, but God knows the truth and He will deal with your detractors in His own time. By trying to defend yourself and prove them wrong, you're stepping into territory that belongs exclusively to God. The Bible says: 'Never pay back evil with more evil. Do things in such a way that everyone can see you are honourable. Do all that you can to live in peace with everyone... never take revenge. Leave that to the righteous anger of God. For the Scriptures say, &quot;I will take revenge; I will pay them back,&quot; says the Lord. Instead, if your enemies are hungry, feed them. If they are thirsty, give them something to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals of shame on their heads. Don't let evil conquer you, but conquer evil by doing good.' (Romans 12:17-21 NLT) Satan's goal is to get you all tied up in knots and steal your peace. Don't play into his hands! Christ, your example, prayed for those who drove the nails into His hands: 'Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.' (Luke 23:34 KJV) Your enemies may think they're smart, but often they're acting in ignorance. Don't come down to their level by retaliating. Forgive them, and let it go.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Chron 8-11; Luke 15:1-10; Ps 119:89-96; Pro 21:20-23<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61997&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I lay prostrate before the Lord... forty days.' Deuteronomy 9:25 NIV<br /><br /><p>A preacher got into the habit of writing his sermons word for word. It worked well - until one Sunday he found himself in the pulpit without his notes. Addressing the congregation, he said, 'I've forgotten my notes this morning, so I'll have to pray and rely on the Lord. But at tonight's service, I'll come better prepared.' Cute story, but it's not so cute when it's a reality! Pastor, your people may be impressed with your speaking abilities short-term, but they'll only be impacted long-term when your words are inspired by the Holy Spirit. The ability to change hearts is above your pay grade, so don't fall into that ego trap or you'll fizzle like a wet firecracker! Study the life of Christ. Before He chose His disciples, or walked on the water, or fed the multitude, He spent hours in prayer. So in order to choose the right people, feed your flock on Sunday morning, or 'walk on water' and accomplish great things for God, you must focus on preparing your heart and not just your message. You say, 'But I'm a people person.' That's good, but you'll have nothing to say to people that'll make any real difference unless you get it from God. You say, 'But I'm a project person.' Unless you spend time with God, you'll get into things you shouldn't - things you may not be able to get out of. Moses said, 'I lay prostrate before the Lord...forty days and forty nights because the Lord had said He would destroy you.' And the end result? God not only saved the nation, He blessed it. So pastor, prepare your heart.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Chron 12-15; Luke 15:11-32; Ps 119:97-104; Pro 21:24-27<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61998&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Warn... those who are out of line.' 1 Thessalonians 5:14 AMP<br /><br /><p>'Warn... those who are out of line... encourage the timid... help... the weak.' Sadly, we'd rather stay quiet and be popular than speak difficult truth into the lives of others. A member of the Blackaby family writes: 'A church isn't a group of individuals who happen to meet in the same place every week; it's a spiritual body... a loving family. It's far easier to comfort and encourage than to warn or exhort, but both are necessary. Ephesians 4:15 tells us to speak the truth in love so that the whole body may grow up in all things. If we don't take the time to exhort, encourage, warn, comfort, uphold and be patient... we [all] suffer in the end. Your body doesn't function properly when one part is hurting or performing poorly. And the church suffers when one of its members is unruly, fainthearted, weak, or falls into bad doctrine. Letting a body part fester, or not supporting a part that's hurt, can lead to irrecoverable damage... letting serious issues go unaddressed does a grave disservice to the member in question.' As parents we love our children too much to let bad behaviour go unchecked. Down the road we know it will negatively affect their attitude toward authority, relationships, accountability and personal discipline. We care enough to correct and guide them. Paul says, 'If a person gets trapped by wrongdoing, those of you who are spiritual should help that person turn away from doing wrong. Do it in a gentle way. At the same time watch yourself so that you also are not tempted.' (Galatians 6:1 GWT) The truth is the only safe ground to stand upon, and your goal should be to speak it in love.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Chron 16-18; Luke 16:1-18; Ps 119:105-112; Pro 21:28-31<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61999&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['In everything set them an example.' Titus 2:7 NIV<br /><br /><p>Smoke rose over a neighbourhood where 18 people died and 850 had been arrested in street riots. Jon Walker said: 'My dad, a special investigator for a government agency, sat with me watching the violence on TV. In a matter-of-fact manner, he said, &quot;That's exactly where I'm scheduled to be today...&quot; I said, &quot;Why go?... Tell them you can't come...reschedule...&quot; He looked at me and said, &quot;Why wouldn't I go? It's my job.&quot;' Walker continues, 'It was an <em>Aha</em> moment for me... of course he'd go. He'd made a commitment... to be where he was supposed to be, regardless of circumstances. The same way he flew Cold War reconnaissance missions... the same way he took pictures showing Cuban missile sites being assembled... the same way he stood with me day in and day out throughout his life. In that moment I grasped the example. I understood the importance of remaining committed, regardless of the difficulty or how unreasonable it might seem... My dad spoke more by what he did than by what he said... his example became the story of God at work in a human life.' Question: <em>What would happen if people followed your example instead of your advice when it comes to your work ethic, your online computer use, your integrity in business, and how you treat your family?</em> Be honest! Paul challenges each of us to 'be an example...in word... conduct... love... spirit... faith... purity.' (1 Timothy 4:12 NKJV) He told Titus, 'In everything set them an example by doing what is good... show integrity.' If you think that sounds like a tall order - you're right. But 'His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness.' (2 Peter 1:3 NIV)</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Chron 19-21; Luke 16:19-31; Ps 119:113-120; Pro 22:1-3<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62000&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['That you may be successful wherever you go.' Joshua 1:7 NIV<br /><br /><p>God wants you to succeed in life (Joshua 1:8). Once you're convinced of that: (1) <em>Take into account your temperament</em>. A fillet steak cooks best at a very high heat for a short time, but a roast joint cooks best at a lower heat for a longer time. Either way, you can have a delicious meal. You just need to know what kind of meat you have, and how to cook it. Are you getting the point? (2) <em>Overcome your fear of being different from others</em>. Because Daniel wouldn't obey the decree only to pray to the king and not God, he landed in a lions' den. But he came out, and prospered in a top spot in government (Daniel 6:28). You can't be part of the crowd and still 'stand out'. To achieve great things you must trust God, disregard the negative opinions of people and pursue your destiny. (3) <em>Resist the apathy that often accompanies ageing</em>. Keep the enthusiasm of your youth and mix it with the wisdom of your old age. Don't lose your sense of idealism. Don't let day-to-day difficulties discourage you or allow life's disappointments to get you down. At every age and stage of life there are obstacles and advantages, trials and triumphs. It's up to you to make the most of the positive, and not let the negative derail you. At about seventy years old, Paul said, 'I am ready to come... to... Rome to preach.' (Romans 1:15 TLB) At eighty, Moses led Israel out of slavery. At eighty-five, Caleb said, 'Give me the mountain...the Lord promised me.' (Joshua 14:12 NCV) You're only 'old' when your regrets take the place of your dreams.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: John 10:1-18; Rev 7:13-17; Ps 23; Luke 15:1-7 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62001&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Whatever we do, it is...because Christ's love controls us now.' 2 Corinthians 5:14 TLB<br /><br /><p>Paul writes, 'Whatever we do, it is certainly not for our own profit, but because Christ's love controls us now.' God is looking for volunteers, not conscripts. Conscripts are motivated by law; volunteers are motivated by love. After the attack on Pearl Harbour, enlistment centres all over America were jammed with boys too young to fight, men who had retired, and even the blind. One elderly man said to a recruitment officer, 'I'd consider it my greatest privilege to die defending this country.' Why do men and women do this? Duty? Yes, but something even greater - devotion! Their hearts have been captured by a cause. Facing the loss of his freedom, his ministry and possibly his life, Martin Luther told the ecclesiastical powers of his day, 'I will not recant. My conscience is captive to the Word of God!' No one should ever have to beg and pressure you to teach a Sunday school class, work with young people, give to the cause of Christ, visit the sick, lonely and needy, or serve others. You should be begging for the privilege! Paul said, 'What things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ... for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ.' (Philippians 3:7-8 KJV) Commitment to Christ is like signing your name on a blank cheque and saying, 'Lord, You fill in the amount.' You're not doing God a favour by serving Him; He's honouring you by allowing you to serve Him. Today, measure what you would do for the Lord - by what you actually do.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Chron 22-24; Luke 17:1-10; Ps 119:121-128; Pro 22:4-7<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62002&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['No evil shall befall you.' Psalm 91:10 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Here's a promise you can stand on in times of trouble: 'Because you have made the Lord...the Most High, your dwelling place, no evil shall befall you, nor shall any plague come near your dwelling; for He shall give His angels charge over you, to keep you in all your ways.' (Psalm 91:9-11 NKJV) There's a spiritual realm around you that's as real as the physical one you live in. One is the world of darkness; the other is the world of light. One is governed by Satan, the other is governed by God. How else can you account for the brutal, senseless killing of men, women and children at the hands of evil people? Paul explains it like this: 'We are not fighting against people made of flesh and blood, but against persons without bodies - the evil rulers of the unseen world, those mighty satanic beings and great evil princes of darkness who rule this world.' (Ephesians 6:12 TLB) Does that mean you're supposed to live in fear? No, and here's why: (1) <em>You are shielded by the blood of Jesus</em>. Just as the angel of death on the night of the Passover couldn't enter a home with blood on its doorposts, the blood of Jesus is a protective shield around you that the devil cannot penetrate. (2) <em>The odds are on your side</em>. When Satan fell from heaven he took one-third of the angels with him. That means we still have two angels for every one of his! 'Angels [are] ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation.' (Hebrews 1:14 NIV) Rejoice: as a redeemed child of God you are protected from evil!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Chron 25-28; Luke 17:11-19; Ps 119:129-136; Pro 22:8-10<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62003&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Hide me in the shadow of Your wings.' Psalm 17:8 NIV <br /><br /><p>Here are three ways you can open yourself up to the power of evil: (1)<em> By choice</em>. The author of<em> The Satanic Bible</em> said, 'A successful witch or wizard must first surrender totally to Satan.' You're probably wondering what kind of person would say or do such a thing. But the fact is, God gives each of us a free will capable of surrendering to Christ or to Satan. Paul writes, 'Do you not know that to whom you present yourselves slaves to obey, you are that one's slaves... so...present your [bodies] as slaves of righteousness.' (Romans 6:16-19 NKJV) (2) <em>By unrestrained indulgence</em>. When any natural desire is indulged to excess, it can become an addiction and a force of destruction. Now, let's be clear here: addiction doesn't equate to someone being demon-possessed. Many Christians battle stubborn habits, and Christ has promised to set them free (John 8:32). When you were saved, Christ moved in and Satan moved out, because Christ won't live in a building with the devil. (3) <em>By dabbling in the occult</em>. God told Israel that those who put their trust in mediums were to be cut off from the community (Leviticus 20:6). Ever wonder why spiritual mediums can't pick the right lottery number, win a fortune and feed the starving masses? Because they're fake, that's why! Speaking of Satan, Jesus said, 'There is no truth in him...he is a liar and the father of [lies].' (John 8:44 NKJV) Don't mess with the powers of darkness through horoscopes or anything else. The only true guidance that comes from a star, comes from Jesus, 'the Bright and Morning Star.' (Revelation 22:16 NKJV)</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Chron 29-31; Luke 17:20-37; Ps 119:137-144; Pro 22:11-13<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62004&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I give...you power...over...the enemy.' Luke 10:19 KJV<br /><br /><p>Have you dabbled in the occult and now you're wondering what to do? Repent and renounce it. 'If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us...and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.' (1 John 1:9 NKJV) Note the words 'all unrighteousness'. It doesn't matter what you've done; there are no big sins and no little sins. God forgives them all! Learn from your past, leave it, and don't look back. 'No one who has become part of God's family makes a practice of sinning, for Christ... holds him securely and the devil cannot get his hands on him.' (1 John 5:18 TLB) Is Satan powerful? Yes, but Jesus is all-powerful! He said, 'All power in Heaven and on earth is given unto Me,' then He delegated that power to you. 'Behold, I give you the authority...over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you.' (Luke 10:19 NKJV) God has given you three powerful weapons of protection: (1) <em>The sword</em>. 'Take...the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.' (Ephesians 6:17 NKJV) Satan has the advantage when you don't know what God says, but he flees when you stand on the Scriptures. (2) <em>The shield</em>. 'Taking the shield of faith...you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one.' (Ephesians 6:16 NKJV) Your faith is a protective shield against the arrows of doubt and fear Satan directs at you. (3) <em>The Spirit</em>. 'You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you.' (Acts 1:8 NKJV) Positioned 'in Christ' and filled with the Holy Spirit, you're more than a match for the forces of evil that surround you.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Chron 32-34; Luke 18:1-17; Ps 119:145-160; Pro 22:14-16<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62005&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Give me life through Your Word.' Psalm 119:37 NLT<br /><br /><p>Jane Johnson Struck set out on a frigid winter evening to deliver dinner to the family of a friend who had died. Snarled in traffic and juggling an already overloaded schedule, she was feeling sorry for herself - and irritated when she arrived and found nobody home. Using her mobile phone to let them know she'd been there, she was dumbfounded when the answering machine kicked in and a familiar voice started singing: '<em>Grab your coat, collect your hat, Leave your worries on the doorstep; Life can be so sweet on the sunny side of the street</em>.' It was her friend Annie, the one who died after a prolonged battle with breast cancer, leaving three kids and a grieving husband. Struck writes: 'People who'd been touched by Annie's larger-than-life personality, perseverance, and testimony in the face of gruelling and unfair circumstances, hadn't expected to hear her voice on the machine. Her indomitable spirit amazed me... she'd talked openly about her prognosis, yet never hesitated to give God glory for the grace and peace she experienced. She knew that life with Jesus, come what may, was a walk on the sunny side of the street.' The Psalmist prayed, 'Give me life through Your Word.' Struck continues: 'As I listened to Annie's voice on the machine... even in death God used her life to challenge me. I drove home pondering how He illuminates the darkest journey... how pity parties keep me from savouring life's sweetness... then asking forgiveness for my selfish attitudes. It was a powerful reminder that one day life will be complete on the sunny side of the street... in Heaven, where there's no darkness, disease or death.'</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Chron 35-36; 2 John; Luke 18:18-30; Ps 119:161-168; Pro 22:17-19<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62006&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Occupy till I come.' Luke 19:13 KJV<br /><br /><p>Jesus said, 'A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return. And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten minas [about $100,000 today], and said unto them, &quot;Occupy till I come.&quot;' (Luke 19:12-13) The word 'occupy' is a military term which means 'to take possession of'. We haven't been called to 'hold the fort', but to 'go up and possess the land'. Christ isn't coming back for a vanquished church, but a victorious church. You say, 'But the odds against me don't look good.' Then you need to look at 'God's odds'. According to His mathematics one can defeat a thousand enemies, but two can defeat ten thousand (Deuteronomy 32:30). God loves to take something that looks small and insignificant, multiply it by Himself and bring victory out of it. When God told Gideon He would use him and three hundred soldiers to destroy an army of hundreds of thousands, Gideon reminded God that he came from the smallest tribe and the smallest family. But God said, 'Surely I will be with you, and you shall smite the Midianites as one man.' (Judges 6:16 AMP) One 'surely' from God does away with all our 'maybes' and 'what ifs'. Gideon told his three hundred men: 'When I blow with a trumpet...you blow the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and shout, &quot;For the Lord, and for Gideon!&quot;' (Judges 7:18 AMP) When you're swinging your sword on this side, look over your shoulder and you'll see the Lord swinging His sword on the other side. You're not alone. God is fighting alongside you, so you will win.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 3 John; Jude; Luke 18:31-43; Ps 119:169-176; Pro 22:20-23<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62007&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['When you were little in your own eyes.' 1 Samuel 15:17 NKJV<br /><br /><p>When King Saul disobeyed God, the prophet Samuel told him, 'When you were little in your own eyes... did not the Lord anoint you king over Israel?... Why then did you not obey the voice of the Lord?' (1 Samuel 15:17-19 NKJV) There's a sobering lesson here. The most dangerous moment in your life is when you think you can succeed without God. When you get a few wins under your belt, it's easy to forget Who's responsible for your success. Where once you would have consulted God, you now launch out on your own and ask Him to add His blessing to your decisions. You say, 'But things are going pretty well for me these days.' Then remember Who made your success possible, and live with gratitude and dependence on God! Looking back on how God blessed Israel, the Psalmist records, 'Then they believed His words; they sang His praise. [But] they soon forgot His works; they did not wait for His counsel.' (Psalm 106:12-13 NKJV) Our capacity for forgetfulness is staggering. The old-timers used to tie a string around their finger to remind them of something they might easily forget. Maybe you need to wear a string on your finger to remind you that God is the secret, the source of all your blessings. Frustrated by how long he had to wait in line to renew his driver's licence, the CEO of a big plumbing company asked his wife, 'Don't they know who I am?' She responded, 'Yes, you're a plumber's son who got lucky.' The word for today is: stay humble, and don't get too big for your boots!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Phil 2:5-11; Rev 19:11-16; Acts 3:1-16; Matt 1:18-21<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62008&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Know that it is near-at the doors!' Matthew 24:33 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Almost three thousand years ago, God said through the prophet Amos that just before the coming of the Lord, the Jews would return from the four corners of the earth and rebuild the nation of Israel. 'I will bring back my exiled people Israel; they will rebuild the ruined cities and live in them. They will plant vineyards and drink their wine; they will make gardens and eat their fruit. I will plant Israel in their own land, never again to be uprooted from the land I have given them, says the Lord your God.' (Amos 9:14-15 NIV) In 1948 the nation of Israel was born. In 1949 they elected their first president, hoisted their own flag, instituted their own constitution and started minting their own money. It's an amazing fulfilment of prophecy. Now read what Jesus said: 'Learn this parable from the fig tree: When its branch has already become tender and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near. So you also, when you see all these things, know that it is near - at the doors!' (Matthew 24:32-33 NKJV) In Scripture the fig tree represents the nation of Israel. Surrounded and threatened by hostile neighbours, she stands today as a testimony to the accuracy and reliability of God's prophetic Word. And the same Christ who announced the rebirth of Israel made an even greater promise to those of us living in the end of the age. 'Behold, I am coming quickly! Hold fast what you have, that no one may take your crown.' (Revelation 3:11 NKJV) Are you ready? Are you living your life in the light of His soon return?</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Josh 1-4; Luke 19:1-10; Ps 84; Pro 22:24-26<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62036&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Go into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature.' Mark 16:15 NKJV<br /><br /><p>One day a pastor told the manager of a big department store, 'I've talked about carpets and bedding and appliances with you many times, but I've never talked about my business. Will you give me a few minutes?' After being led to a private office, the pastor took out his New Testament and urged the manager to become a Christian. Finally, tears began to roll down the man's cheeks and he said, 'I'm seventy years old. I was born in this city, and more than a hundred ministers and five hundred officers of various churches have known me in a business capacity. But you're the only man who has ever talked to me about my soul.' That day he knelt down and gave his life to Christ. We've got the cart before the horse! We keep thinking if we can just bring visitors to church they'll get saved. And thank God that happens. But when those in the New Testament church met together to celebrate, usually they'd already been won to Christ by someone before they got there! Christ's last act before He died was winning a soul. His last command was for us to win souls. His last prayer on the cross was for the forgiveness of a soul. You don't have to be theologically articulate; you just have to be in love with Jesus. When you're in love, it shows on your face and expresses itself in your words. Jesus said, 'I, if I be lifted up...will draw all men unto Me.' (John 12:32 KJV) Don't worry about drawing people to Christ; just introduce Him and He will do the drawing.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Josh 5:1-8:29; Luke 19:11-27; Ps 103:1-12; Pro 22:27-29<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62010&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Encourage [motivate] one another.' Hebrews 3:13 CEV<br /><br /><p>Leslie was born with physical and mental challenges so severe that doctors had to remove his eyes. When he was six months old, a nurse named May Lemke, who was raising five children of her own, adopted him and asked God to give him some kind of talent. When Leslie was thirteen, May bought a used piano and played some simple songs, hoping he'd respond. No expression... nothing. She continued trying to motivate her adopted son to engage in life. Then when he was sixteen, he pulled himself up to the piano, and without ever having touched a keyboard before, played a Tchaikovsky piano concerto. It was flawless, and May soon discovered that Leslie could play anything he heard. Then out of the blue one day, he started singing, and that led to his playing and singing at concerts all over the country. All this came about because a mother facing incredible odds became a tireless motivator! In the movie <em>Seabiscuit</em> one of the main characters, Tom Smith, was asked why he kept a lame, ageing horse. He replied, 'You don't throw away a whole life just because he's banged up a little!' That old horse ended up leading a younger horse to a spectacular racing career. Thank God for motivators who make the difference between a trip to the glue factory and winning a blue ribbon! Paul says, 'Encourage [motivate] one another.' Somebody said, 'Dreams always come a size too big so we can grow into them.' Motivators help you to dream big, then help you grow in order to fulfil your dream. People can run a long way on just a little encouragement. So become a motivator.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Josh 8:30-10:43; Luke 19:28-40; Ps 103:13-22; Pro 23:1-3<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62011&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Every man shall bear his own burden.' Galatians 6:5 KJV<br /><br /><p>Here is the first of three Scriptures you can use to measure your spiritual growth: 'Every man shall bear his own burden.' The old saying, 'You're only young once,' is true, but you can be immature for a lifetime. Paul writes: 'I couldn't talk to you as I would to spiritual people. I had to talk... as though you were infants in the Christian life. I had to feed you with milk, not with solid food, because you weren't ready for anything stronger. And you still aren't ready, for you are still controlled by your sinful nature.' (1 Corinthians 3:1-3 NLT) As a parent, you expect a higher level of responsibility and maturity from your teenager than you do from your toddler, right? And your heavenly Father requires the same of you. If you're still being defeated by the same habits and hang-ups you struggled with as a new believer, seek God's help. If you're to fulfil your God-given destiny, you must grow into maturity. Instead of always having to be 'carried', you must get to the place where you can feed yourself spiritually, pray in faith over your own problems, and make Spirit-led decisions concerning your life. God's growth plan for us is: 'We will no longer be immature like children. We won't be tossed and blown about by every wind of new teaching. We will not be influenced when people try to trick us with lies so clever they sound like truth. Instead, we will speak the truth in love, growing in every way more and more like Christ.' (Ephesians 4:14-15 NLT) Spiritual growth must be your priority; otherwise it won't happen!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Josh 11-13; Luke 19:41-48; Ps 111; Pro 23:4-6<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62012&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.' Galatians 6:2 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Paul writes, 'Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.' You must take responsibility for your own spiritual growth, because until you learn to carry your own burdens you won't be able to help others carry theirs. Remember the old Hollies' song, <em>He Ain't Heavy...He's My Brother</em>? Instead of always having to be lifted, God wants you to lift others. Instead of always having to be prayed for, God wants you to pray for others. Instead of always needing to receive, you should be able to give. Why is it 'more blessed to give than to receive' (Acts 20:35 NKJV)? Because in receiving, the process ends with you. But in giving, you activate the law of reciprocity. Paul says: 'Every one must make up his own mind as to how much he should give... cheerful givers are the ones God prizes. God is able to make it up to you by giving you everything you need and more, so that there will not only be enough for your own needs, but plenty left over to give joyfully to others... Yes, God will give you much so that you can give away much... Those you help will be glad not only because of your generous gifts to themselves and to others, but they will praise God for this proof that your deeds are as good as your doctrine.' (2 Corinthians 9:7-13 TLB) When you're all wrapped up in yourself, you make a very small package. It's when you open up and reach out in love to others that you begin to grow spiritually.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Josh 14-15; Luke 20:1-8; Ps 142; Pro 23:7-9<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62013&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Cast your burden on the Lord, and He shall sustain you.' Psalm 55:22 KJV<br /><br /><p>First, you must learn how to carry your own burden. Second, you must be able to help those who are weak to carry theirs. Third, you must learn to give your burden to the Lord. 'Cast your burden on the Lord, and He shall sustain you.' Sounds easy, but it's not, because: (1) If you're self-centred, you will think only about your own personal wants, needs and plans. (2) If you're a self-starter and self-motivator, you will struggle with the humility required to get down on your knees and say, 'Lord, I need You; before I make a move I need to know You are with me'. (3) If you're self-sufficient, you will wait until your knees are buckling and your back is breaking, then send an SOS up to heaven asking, 'Lord, where are You?' And He will reply, 'I'm right here, wondering when you're going to start trusting Me, leaning on Me and drawing strength from Me.' Jesus said, 'I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing.' (John 15:5 NKJV) The key to success in God's Kingdom is: work like it all depends on you and pray like it all depends on God! Martin Luther said, 'I have held many things in my hands, and I have lost them all; but whatever I have placed in God's hands, that I still possess.' If He has to, God will allow you to fall flat on your face in order to get you on your knees. If you're wise, you won't wait for that to happen.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Josh 16:1-19:23; Luke 20:9-19; Ps 20; Pro 23:10-12<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62014&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...He will turn the hearts of the fathers to their children.' Malachi 4:6 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Almost 20 million children in America grow up without a father - 75% of them in poverty. And it gets worse; these children are five times more likely to commit suicide, ten times more likely to take drugs and 20 times more likely to go to prison. Luther Burbank said, 'If we paid as much attention to our plants as we do to our children, we'd be living in a jungle of weeds.' Father, answer these three questions: (1) <em>Are you giving your children things instead of yourself?</em> By the time they're 12, it's said they'll have learned 75% of all they'll ever know. The question is who will their teachers be? Television? Some drug-addicted celebrity? Their peers? As the twig is bent, so grows the tree. (2) <em>Are you giving your best to your career or to them?</em> If you spend all your energy at work and leave none for your family, you'll pay a high price. Remember, you get only one bite at the apple. Your children will grow up either to resent you, repeat your mistakes or rejoice in the memory of a home where love was spelt T.I.M.E. (3) <em>Are you setting a spiritual tone for your family?</em> Or does your wife run circles around you in this area? Thank God for mothers who 'stand in the gap', but the Bible holds fathers responsible for the spiritual training of their children. Listen: 'Fathers...bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord.' (Ephesians 6:4 NIV) Ten or twenty years from now, what are you going to wish you'd done today? Start doing it!</p><br /><br />SoulFood Father's Day: Heb 11; Matt 21:18-22; Matt 8:5-13; Mark 6:1-6 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62015&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Discretion will preserve you.' Proverbs 2:11 NKJV<br /><br /><p>We've all said the wrong thing, at the wrong time, to the wrong person, and ended up regretting it. A pastor was being honoured at a retirement dinner, and a local politician had been asked to make a speech. The politician was running late so the pastor decided to say a few words: 'When I came here twenty-five years ago I thought this was a terrible church. The first man I talked to said he'd stolen, lied, embezzled, had an affair and done drugs. I was appalled. Then I realised everybody isn't like that; this church is filled with good people.' Just then the politician arrived and stood up to speak: 'I'll never forget the day the pastor arrived and I had the privilege of being the first church member to talk to him.' Loose lips sink ships! The Bible says: 'Discretion will preserve you.' Being discreet means having the ability to keep sensitive information private - including things you may have heard years ago! The writer of Proverbs said, 'He who is trustworthy conceals a matter' (Proverbs 11:13 NAS), and in the New Testament Paul cautions believers about discussing 'things not proper to mention.' (1 Timothy 5:13 NAS) Divulging what you know about other people's problems and failures may make you feel good momentarily, but afterwards it has a predictably negative impact on the relationship. Plus, you get a reputation as a person who can't be trusted. A wise man said, 'If your lips would keep from slips, five things observe with care: of whom you speak, to whom you speak, and how, and when, and where.' That's advice you would do well to pay attention to!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Josh 19:24-21:45; Luke 20:20-26; Ps 112; Pro 23:13-15<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62016&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I cry out to You, O God, but You do not answer.' Job 30:20 NIV<br /><br /><p>Do you feel like God isn't answering your prayers? Job the patriarch felt the same way: 'I cry out to You, O God, but You do not answer; I stand up, but You merely look at me... When I hoped for good, evil came; when I looked for light, then came darkness.' (Job 30:20; 26 NIV) All of us go through times when it feels like God has moved and left no forwarding address. What's He up to? Why doesn't He respond? There are some lessons you only learn when God is silent: (1) <em>Silence isn't absence</em>. An old proverb says, 'Speech is silver, silence is gold!' Sometimes God says to you, 'Be still, and know that I am God.' (Psalm 46:10 NIV) You have to be really secure with somebody to just sit quietly with them. Silence takes the emphasis off words and builds a level of intimacy where they're no longer necessary. If you want to be comfortable with God, learn to enter into meditation and silence with Him. (2) <em>Silence tests your faith</em>. How much faith is actually involved when somebody's coaching your every step? It's like a parent running alongside a child who's learning to ride a bike. Right now the child lacks confidence, but they're going to look strange at age twenty if that parent is still trotting along beside them! At some point God takes His hands off the wheel to see how far you've progressed. And for a while it can be a wobbly ride. That's when you demonstrate how far you've come, and where you're placing your trust.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Josh 22-24; Luke 20:27-40; Ps 27; Pro 23:16-18<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62017&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['He will bring justice if you will only wait.' Job 35:14 NLT<br /><br /><p>Have you ever tried to sit and watch a seed sprout? You can't, can you? It stays in the ground until the time is right for it to emerge. There's a lesson here. God has planted certain things within you, and you must wait for them to take root and grow. And the unresolved issues of your past can undermine this process. Often it takes prayer and counselling to bring these issues to the surface so that you can effectively deal with them. With God, a delay is not a denial. When speaking to Job, his friend Elihu said, 'It is wrong to say God doesn't listen, to say the Almighty isn't concerned. You say you can't see Him, but He will bring justice if you will only wait.' (Job 35:13-14 NLT) What great advice! Charles Trumbull said, 'God knows when to withhold or grant visible signs of encouragement. It's good when He sends confirmation, but we grow faster when we've trusted Him without it. Those who do, always receive the greatest visible evidence of His love.' God answers every prayer; it's just that across some He writes, 'The time is not right yet.' Job asks, 'How long will this trial last? Why doesn't God answer?' Because it takes as long as it takes - and usually feels uncomfortable the whole time. But there's good news. Eventually your prayers become less about getting answers and more about connecting with God. By letting Him work: (1) <em>you begin to realise that He is with you</em>; (2) <em>you develop a deeper level of intimacy with Him</em>; (3) <em>you discover you can trust Him for the entire trip</em>.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Col 1-2; Luke 20:41-47; Ps 78:1-8; Pro 23:19-21<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62018&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['My future is in your hands.' Psalm 31:15 NLT<br /><br /><p>September 11, 2001, Americans awoke to scenes of horror that would remain enduringly etched on the national memory. Its shock waves told the world that things would never be the same again. Sleepy eyes stared transfixed as television brought home the collapsing twin towers with their thousands of innocent occupants, the deadly attack on the Pentagon, and the cruel fate of an airliner and passengers hurtling into a rural Pennsylvania field. Unexpected, swift and violent, these attacks shook people to the core and exemplified a jarring new reality: the proliferation of universal terrorism. Fears of suicide bombers, chemical and biological attack still reverberate through our world of high-tech, security-conscious cities, airports, trains and bus terminals. Centuries before, King David faced the threat of conspiracy from both his enemies and his friends. Feeling abandoned, alone and vulnerable, he cried out, '[There is] terror on every side.' (Psalm 31:13 NIV) King, warrior and giant-slayer, David still felt the palpable terror of his situation. Frightened, he refocused his thoughts and heart to the source of real protection. 'But, I am trusting You, O Lord.' (Psalm 31:14 NLT) Afraid, but still trusting! And choosing to trust restored his perspective. 'My future is in Your hands.' (Psalm 31:15 NLT) His litany of fears gave way to faith and prayer. 'How great is the goodness You have stored up...You lavish it on those who come to You for protection.' (Psalm 31:19 NLT) 'You hide them in the shelter of Your presence, safe from those who conspire against them.' (Psalm 31:20 NLT) In Jesus, you'll find peace in the time of terror!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Col 3-4; Philemon; Luke 21:1-11; Ps 78:9-16; Pro 23:22-25<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62019&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The real power comes from God and not from us.' 2 Corinthians 4:7 CEV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says, 'We have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us.' (2 Corinthians 4:7 NIV) Some people don't read the Bible because they think it's all about saintly people whose lives have no bearing on reality. If you feel that way, read the book of Genesis. The dysfunctional families there will make yours seem normal! Cain was jealous of his brother Abel so he murdered him. Lamech introduced the world to polygamy. Noah, the most righteous man of his time, got drunk and cursed his children. When the men of Sodom wanted the two angels who visited Lot, in order to save himself Lot offered them sex with his daughters instead. And the Bible still refers to him as 'godly'! (2 Peter 2:7) Abraham slept with his wife's maid, got her pregnant and then banished her and her son to the wilderness because his wife Sarah complained about 'the other woman'. Jacob's firstborn son Reuben slept with one of his father's wives. The list goes on ad infinitum. The question is: why would God include this cast of characters in the Bible? To make the point that we're all flawed in some way! We like to think we're normal, but by God's definition we fall far short. We all have habits we struggle with, past mistakes we can't undo, and inherent tendencies we can't overcome without His help. God said, 'My power shows up best in weak people.' (2 Corinthians 12:9 TLB) You say, 'But shouldn't I strive to be better?' Yes, but if God only used perfect people, He would never call anyone to work with Him.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Neh 1-4; Luke 21:12-24; Ps 78:17-31; Pro 23:26-28<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62020&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Find enjoyment in... all the days which God gives.' Ecclesiastes 5:18 AMP<br /><br /><p>Over one hundred times in Scripture we read, 'It came to pass.' That's because most things in life aren't permanent. Things change, but God doesn't! Knowing that can help you to handle the bad times and stop you from clinging so tightly to the good ones. Here are three important truths to keep in mind: (1)<em> Enjoy today</em>. It's a gift - that's why it's called 'the present'! Solomon said, 'To enjoy your work and accept your lot in life...is...a gift from God.' (Ecclesiastes 5:19 NLT) Even though you are constantly moving toward another goal or objective, learn to live in the present. Don't put your joy on hold, or let it slip away while you're waiting for the next big event. (2) <em>Learn to appreciate the little things</em>. They're all around you: the love of a good friend, a kind deed, a fresh insight, a good night's sleep, the delight on your child's face. When you appreciate what you have, it multiplies. When you're grateful for the little things, God will give you more to appreciate (Matthew 25:23). (3) <em>Each ending brings a new beginning</em>. There are two myths you should never believe. The first is the 'forever myth', which says your situation will never improve. The second is the 'never myth', which says if things get any worse you'll never be able to handle them. Both are distortions. God's Word says everything comes 'to pass'. And while you're going through it, He promises to 'strengthen...and help you.' (Isaiah 41:10 NIV) Yes, this ending will bring your new beginning. So keep trusting God.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Neh 5-7; Luke 21:25-38; Ps 78:32-39; Pro 23:29-35<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62021&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Be...[a ready listener].' James 1:19 AMP<br /><br /><p>Talking instead of listening will get you into trouble. Two geese were preparing to fly south when a frog asked if he could go along. They questioned how he could do it. 'Easy,' he said. 'You guys hold a stick between your beaks and I'll hang on with my mouth.' Off they went as people looked up, admiring their teamwork. The trio was making great progress until somebody below shouted, 'Great idea! Whose was it?' That's when the frog opened his mouth and yelled, '<em>Miiiiiiiine</em>!' Every time you open your mouth there are consequences! So learn to listen. Plutarch said, 'The talkative listen to no one, for they are ever speaking. And the first evil that attends those who know not how to be silent is that they hear nothing.' Listening without having to air your knowledge or interject your opinion is a quality of character that proves you're mature. Television host Larry King once said, 'I remind myself every morning: nothing I say this day will teach me anything. So if I'm going to learn, I must do it by listening.' Jesus was a great listener, and as a result He attracted people like a magnet. Doubtless there were times He was tired and didn't feel like it - but He listened anyway. When the disciples fussed among themselves, and the Pharisees grumbled and caused trouble, Jesus focused on the important things. He listened, He spoke, and people followed. Listening is often more effective than talking. In fact, there's a point in every conversation where you need to say less and listen more. In those moments you not only hear what others are saying, but what God is saying to you!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Micah 5-7; Luke 22:39-53; Ps 24; Pro 24:15-18<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62026&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The... Lord is my strength... He enables me to [go on].' Habakkuk 3:19 NIV<br /><br /><p>Are things in your life falling apart? Your finances look uncertain, the career you worked to build is floundering, your health is failing, the people you trusted have let you down. Nobody enjoys such times, but if you live long enough you'll go through them. And they have a way of making you re-examine your responses. When the things the prophet Habakkuk counted on started to crumble, he was forced to discern between what's truly important and what's merely temporal. It's a re-evaluation we all have to make at some point. Here's what Habakkuk said: 'Though the fig tree does not bud... there are no grapes on the vines... the olive crop fails... the fields produce no food... there are no sheep in the pen and no cattle in the stalls, yet I will rejoice in the Lord... The Sovereign Lord is my strength... He enables me to [go on].' (Habakkuk 3:17-19 NIV) Habakkuk realised he had no control over certain things. So he chose to control his response by rejoicing in the Lord regardless of what happened, and drawing from God the strength to 'go on'. What can you learn from this man? That you have a choice! That you can decide to praise God regardless of the hand life deals you. God doesn't promise to take you out of your situation; He promises to bring you through it. So change your response and begin to praise God for His faithfulness, for your salvation, for your health, for your friends and family, and all the other blessings He's given you. If you look for reasons to rejoice, you'll find them!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Tim 1-4; Luke 22:54-62; Ps 19; Pro 24:19-22<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62027&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Jealousy is like cancer in the bones.' Proverbs 14:30 NLT<br /><br /><p>Christian educator Henrietta Mears said, 'The man who keeps busy helping the man below him, won't have time to envy the man above him.' Doctor Seuss wrote hundreds of children's stories. One of his most famous is about the Grinch, a cartoon character who gets so jealous of others that he ends up biting himself. Jealousy does that. It targets others, but ends up consuming you. God blessed King Saul and lifted him from obscurity to the highest position in Israel. But when David slew Goliath and won the adulation of the people, Saul started acting insecure and threatened. Instead of rejoicing that God had sent David to help him, he grew resentful and became 'David's enemy from that time forward.' (1 Samuel 18:29 NRS) The Bible says, 'A peaceful heart leads to a healthy body; jealousy is like cancer in the bones.' Jealousy is malignant; left unchecked it can destroy every relationship in your life. It poisons your attitude by making you compare yourself with others. It robs you of joy and contentment. You become ungrateful and self-centred. It makes you assume that God's resources aren't sufficient for Him to bless others and still bless you. Saul's jealousy cost him his throne, his family, his respect in the eyes of the people, and ultimately his life. Don't let jealousy do that to you. Repent before it robs you of your destiny. God made all of us His children when none of us deserved it. So when you feel resentful of somebody else's blessings, ask God to remind you of the many ways in which He has blessed you even when you didn't deserve it.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Zech 1-4; Luke 22:63-71; Ps 3; Pro 24:23-25<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62028&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Why is this happening to me?' Genesis 25:22 NIV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says: 'The Lord answered [Isaac's] prayer, and his wife Rebekah became pregnant. The babies jostled each other within her, and she said, &quot;Why is this happening to me?&quot; So she went to enquire of the Lord. The Lord said to her, &quot;Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples from within you will be separated; one people will be stronger than the other, and the older will serve the younger.&quot;' (Genesis 25:21-23 NIV) Even when your vision is born of God, you'll experience times of both faith and fear. You can have clarity in one area, yet experience confusion in another. What should you do when this happens? Do what Rebekah did: take it to the Lord in prayer. She asked, 'Why is this happening to me?' Question: Are you experiencing fear and foreboding in the middle of your success? Are you wondering, 'What's wrong with me? Things are going well, so why am I anxious?' You've achieved some success and things are starting to come together after a long, hard struggle. But instead of feeling happy, you're disappointed because you're not experiencing the joy and fulfilment you expected; you're actually worrying about what might go wrong in the future. In every success story you'll find chapters of uncertainty. And when it happens, you must bring your turmoil to the Lord. Ask Him for help with the inner conflict you're experiencing, and to give you peace concerning the vision He's given you. And remember - no matter what you achieve, its ability to satisfy you is limited. No amount of success can ever take God's place in your life.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Ki 17:1-6; 1 Ki 18:16-39; 1 Ki 19:9-18; 2 Ki 2:1-12 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62029&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The merciful... will be shown mercy.' Matthew 5:7 NIV<br /><br /><p>The German philosopher Schopenhauer compared the human race to porcupines huddled together on a winter night: 'The colder it gets outside, the more we huddle together for warmth. But the closer we get...the more we hurt one another with our sharp quills. And in the lonely night of earth's winter, eventually we begin to drift apart and wander out on our own and freeze to death in our loneliness.' What's the answer? 'Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.' (Matthew 6:12 Tyndale Bible 1526). President Ronald Reagan understood this. After an attempt on his life in 1981, his daughter Patti Davis said, 'The following day my father said he knew his physical healing was directly dependent on his ability to forgive John Hinckley. By showing me that forgiveness is the key to everything, including physical health and healing, he gave me an example of Christ-like thinking.' Perhaps your wounds are old ones: an abusive parent, a cheating spouse, a business deal gone sour. Or maybe they're still fresh: an overlooked promotion, an unpaid debt, kids who've forgotten you exist. Either way, you've a decision to make. Get over it, or get even. Let it heal, or turn to hate. Release it, or resent it. Resentment allows whatever's eating you, to eat you up. It stokes the fire, fans the flames, and replays the pain. Think about it: has your resentment brought you relief? If today you stood by the grave of the one who hurt you, would you be free? It's doubtful. 'The merciful... will be shown mercy,' because they've experienced an even greater grace - <em>God's</em> - and forgiveness is the key to understanding it.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Zech 5-8; Luke 23:1-12; Ps 39; Pro 24:26-28<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62031&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['God blesses those who work for peace.' Matthew 5:9 NLT<br /><br /><p>Dr Gary Fenton says church conflict is a lot like championship wrestling - not nearly as painful as it looks! As a leader, you need to recognise the difference between: (1) <em>Disagreement and conflict</em>. Conflict exists when a group is stuck and can't make a decision. For example, two strong-willed church committee members had a spirited discussion, and the following morning a concerned young pastor met with them to iron out their differences. He asked them if they were ready to make a decision, or if their heated debate the night before had stopped them from moving on. After due consideration both conceded that while their discussion the previous night had resembled a street fight, it was more like a tv reality show which is good theatre, but where the participants don't quit when things get heated! (2) <em>Reconciliation and resolution</em>. Resolution is about coming up with answers; it's about bringing people into relational unity, not necessarily into agreement. The fact remains that while some issues will never be resolved, they can still be reconciled. It's in the process of seeking resolution that you learn to compromise and find middle ground. (3)<em> Being peaceful and being a peacemaker</em>. A pastor who refused to get involved in church controversy was a constant no-show at board meetings. He justified his absence as 'the desire to be peaceful'. But being peaceful and being a peacemaker aren't the same. Peacemakers don't sit on their hands... they're in the thick of things trying to reconcile the parties... they're risk-takers who are willing to enter the fray with an expanded heart. That's why 'those who work for peace...will be called the children of God.'</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Zech 9-11; Luke 23:13-25; Ps 34; Pro 24:29-31<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62032&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Through love serve one another.' Galatians 5:13 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Bill Wilson builds Sunday schools in some of New York City’s worst areas. He has been stabbed and shot, and had team members killed. A Puerto Rican lady who could barely speak English said to him one day, ‘I want to do something for God, please.’ Bill said, ‘Okay, ride a different Sunday school bus every week and just love the kids.’ So she rode a different bus—Bill has dozens of them—and loved the children. After several months she became attached to one little boy. ‘I don’t want to change buses any more. I want to stay on this one,’ she told Bill. The boy came to Sunday school every week with his sister and sat on the lady’s lap, but never made a sound. She would repeatedly tell him, ‘I love you, and Jesus loves you.’ One day to her amazement, he turned around and stammered, ‘I… love you too.’ Then he gave her a big hug. That was at two–thirty on a Sunday afternoon. At six–thirty that night the boy was found dead in a dumpster under a fire escape. His mother had beaten him to death and thrown his body in the trash. ‘I love you, and Jesus loves you.’ Those were some of the last words that little boy heard in his short life—from the lips of a Puerto Rican woman who could barely speak English. Bill says, ‘Who among us is qualified to minister? Who among us even knows what to do? Not you; not me. But I ran to an altar once and got some fire and just went. So did this woman who couldn’t speak English. And so can you.’</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Zech 12-14; Luke 23:26-34; Ps 52; Pro 24:32-34<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62047&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Whoever desires to become great among you shall be your servant.' Mark 10:43 NKJV <br /><br /><p>Pontius Pilate had an opportunity to acquit Jesus of any wrongdoing, but instead he called for a basin and washed his hands of the entire matter. His attitude was, 'I'm not getting involved.' And a lot of people have that same attitude. But not Jesus. The night before His death He called for a basin of water and washed His disciples' feet. He taught them: 'Whoever desires to become great among you shall be your servant.' (Mark 10:42-43 NKJV) Peter objected because foot-washing was a duty designated to the lowest servant in Middle Eastern households, and he considered it beneath Christ's dignity. Catherine Marshall writes: 'We, the disciples, are to be the servants, I want to insist along with Peter. But Jesus answered him, &quot;If I do not wash you, you have no part with Me.&quot; (John 13:8 NKJV) This is a stunning and stupendous thought. Unless I can believe in this much love for me, unless I can and will accept Him by faith as my servant as well as my God, unless I can truly know that it's my good He seeks... then I cannot have His companionship.' This is so contrary to the world's philosophy where everybody wants to lead and nobody wants to serve. But to be like Jesus is to be a servant, for that's what He called Himself. Never have goals so lofty that they blind you to the needs of those around you. Without a servant's heart, you'll be tempted to use your gift for personal gain, or to exempt yourself from areas you consider beneath you. The truth is, the only way to serve God is by serving those He loves.</p><br /><br />SoulFood (Feast of Trumpets): Num 29:1-6; Matt 24; Rev 11:15-19; 1 Cor 15:50-58 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62045&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['If you think you are too important to help... you are only fooling yourself.' Galatians 6:3 NLT <br /><br /><p>Author of <em>Swim with the Sharks</em>, Harvey Mackay, wrote in his column about Philip Pillsbury of the famous Pillsbury milling family: 'The tips of three of his fingers were missing... the unmistakable mark of a journeyman grain miller, albeit a somewhat less-than-dexterous one. Philip Pillsbury had an international reputation as a connoisseur of fine foods...but to the troops his reputation as a man willing to do a hard, dirty job was the one that mattered... And you can be sure everyone was aware of it.' Following in the footsteps of Jesus calls for being service-oriented, not self-absorbed. Often the reason we don't volunteer is because we think we can't do it as well as somebody else. We've made the mistake of making excellence an idol by buying into the philosophy, 'If I can't do it right, I won't do it at all.' The fact is, less-than-perfect service is better than the best of intentions. If you're not willing to do it imperfectly in the beginning, you'll never get out of the starting gate. Almost everything we do is done poorly at first. That's how we learn. God's plan has always been to involve as many people as possible, not have everything run by a few experts. The best of people make mistakes; it's how you gain knowledge and develop character. The Bible says, 'If you think you are too important to help... you are only fooling yourself.' Sometimes you're called to serve upward to those in authority; other times you're called to serve downward to those in need. Either way, you're serving God only when you're willing to do what's required.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Cor 1-3; Luke 23:35-43; Ps 54; Pro 25:1-3<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62039&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord.' 1 Corinthians 15:58 NIV<br /><br /><p>Paul writes, ‘Am I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God?… If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ.’ (Galatians 1:10 NIV) A true servant of God is content to work quietly in the shadows. They know that in Heaven God will openly reward people we’ve never even heard of—people who taught emotionally disturbed children, cleaned up after the incontinent, nursed AIDS patients, and gave their lives in a thousand unnoticed ways. ‘Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your labour in the Lord is not in vain.’ During World War II, when England needed to increase its coal production, Winston Churchill called together labour leaders. He asked them to picture in their minds a victory parade which he knew would be held in Piccadilly Circus after the war. First in line would be the sailors who kept the vital sea lanes open. After them would come the soldiers who returned from Dunkirk, then went on to defeat Rommel in Africa. Next would be the pilots who’d driven the Luftwaffe from the skies. Last of all, he said, would come a long line of sweat–stained, soot–streaked men in miners’ caps. Someone would shout from the crowd, ‘And where were you during the critical days of our struggle?’ And from ten thousand throats would come the answer, ‘We were deep in the earth with our faces to the coal.’ Not all jobs are prominent and glamorous. But those who serve God with their ‘faces to the coal’ play a vital role in fulfilling His purposes in the earth.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Cor 4-6; Luke 23:44-56; Ps 13; Pro 25:4-8<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62048&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Through love serve one another.' Galatians 5:13 NKJVSimply Serving (5)<br /><br /><p>In his book <em>The Pursuit of Excellence</em>, Ted Engstrom writes: ‘I was cleaning out a desk drawer when I found a flashlight I hadn’t used in over a year. I flipped the switch but wasn’t surprised when it gave no light. I unscrewed it and shook it to get the batteries out but they wouldn’t budge. Finally after some effort they came loose. What a mess! Battery acid had corroded the entire inside of the flashlight. The batteries were new when I put them in and I’d stored them in a safe, warm place. But there was one problem. Those batteries weren’t made to be warm and comfortable. They were designed to be turned on—to be used. And it’s the same with us. We weren’t created to be warm, safe and comfortable. You and I were made to be turned on.’ You must constantly remind yourself that first and foremost you’re called to be God’s servant. That way, interruptions won’t frustrate you. ‘Whenever we have the opportunity, we have to do what is good.’ (Galatians 6:10 GWT) Be sensitive and spontaneous; otherwise great opportunities to serve God will pass you by. ‘Never tell your neighbours to wait until tomorrow if you can help them now.’ (Proverbs 3:28 GNT) Look for small tasks nobody else wants to do, then do them as if they were great things—because God is recording it all. Make yourself available. Don’t fill your time with other pursuits that limit your availability. Be ready to jump into service at a moment’s notice. Allow God to change your plans without becoming resentful. As a servant, you don’t get to choose where you’ll serve. God does.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Heb 11:7; Gen 6:9-22; Gen 8:18-22; Matt 24:36-41 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62049&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Whoever believes will not be in haste.' Isaiah 28:16 ESV<br /><br /><p>As twins go, Jacob and Esau were very different. But they quickly learned to negotiate. Have you ever watched children make a deal that favoured one over the other? For example, one offers the other a candy bar in exchange for an expensive video game. Well, that same dynamic was at work between Jacob and Esau. Esau had been out hunting and came home exhausted and hungry. Nothing mattered to him except food—and certainly not something as remote as a future inheritance. In a moment of weakness he said, ‘“I am about to die…what is this birthright to me?”…So…he…sold his birthright to Jacob…[for] bread and stew.’ (Genesis 25:32–34 NKJV) It was a decision Esau would live to regret, and couldn’t undo. Recovering addicts are taught the importance of observing their H.A.L.T. sign. When they’re Hungry, Angry, Lonely or Tired, they’re in danger. And so are you! Acting on impulse will cause you to: (1) <em>buy stuff you don’t need at prices you can’t afford</em>; (2) <em>react before you get all the facts</em>, resulting in a loss of respect, opportunities and good relationships; (3) <em>compromise your character for a few moments of sinful pleasure</em>; (4) <em>quit in the middle of the race</em>, or worse, on the threshold of victory. The Bible says, ‘Whoever believes will not be in haste.’ When you make choices based on short–term gratification rather than life–long convictions and goals, you always lose out in the end. So don’t take the deal; don’t trade your God–given destiny for momentary gratification. Be patient and hold fast. When you do, God will bring your dreams to pass in ways that honour instead of diminishing them.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Cor 7-9; Luke 24:1-12; Ps 91; Pro 25:9-12<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62051&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God.' Matthew 5:9 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Jesus spent much of His ministry tearing down barriers and building bridges. He did it through acts of love such as washing the feet of those who would fail and betray Him, eating with a tax collector everybody in town despised, and giving hope to a fallen woman whom society condemned. The Bible says, ‘Peacemakers will plant seeds of peace and reap a harvest of righteousness.’ (James 3:18 NLT) Words of peace are like seeds. They don’t produce fruit overnight, but slowly and silently they work their way to the surface, changing hearts, minds, attitudes and futures. General Omar Bradley said: ‘Ours is a world of nuclear giants and ethical infants. We know more about war than we know about peace, more about killing than we know about living. We have grasped the mystery of the atom and rejected the Sermon on the Mount.’ Jesus said, ‘Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called the sons of God.’ Every day you’ll meet frightened, despairing, lonely, angry people who need a word of peace. Do you have one? Solomon offers us three ways to calm strife, defuse a tense situation, and get a better result: (1)<em> Patience</em>. ‘A hot–tempered man stirs up dissension, but a patient man calms a quarrel.’ (Proverbs 15:18 NIV) (2) <em>Self–control</em>. ‘Better a patient man than a warrior, a man who controls his temper than one who takes a city.’ (Proverbs 16:32 NIV) (3) <em>Wisdom</em>. ‘A man’s wisdom gives him patience; it is to his glory to overlook an offence.’ (Proverbs 19:11 NIV)</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Cor 10-11; Luke 24:13-24; Ps 68:1-18; Pro 25:13-16<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62053&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['I have become all things to all men so that by all possible means I might save some.' 1 Corinthians 9:22 NIV<br /><br /><p>Paul’s passion was winning souls to Christ. But he understood that people must be reached in different ways, so he constantly adapted his approach to them. Now apply that same principle to your life, career, or calling. Is your outlook fixed, or is it flexible? General George S. Patton Jr. said, ‘Successful generals make plans to fit circumstances, but do not try to create circumstances to fit plans.’ When you have a clear plan for reaching your destination, there’s a danger of becoming inflexible and trying to stick with it no matter what. Sometimes it’s wiser to explore other options. When you’re having a hard time moving forward, don’t be quick to revise your dream. Revise your plan instead. Peter Drucker said, ‘The question that faces the strategic decision–maker is not what his organisation should do tomorrow. It is, “What do we have to do today to be ready for an uncertain tomorrow?”’ The best way to face the uncertainty of tomorrow is to put your full faith in God, remain flexible, and consider your options as events unfold. The Psalmist said, ‘The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord.’ (Psalm 37:23 NKJV) Clinton Utterbach said, ‘The steps and the stops of a good man are ordered by the Lord.’ Paul’s plan called for going to a certain place, ‘But the Spirit…would not allow them to.’ (Acts 16:7 NIV) Instead, God opened up new territory for him elsewhere. A rigid mindset won’t serve you well when you’re trying to fulfil your God–given assignment. So be open, stay flexible, and learn to adapt.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Cor 12-14; Luke 24:25-35; Ps 68:19-35; Pro 25:17-20<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62075&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<alias><![CDATA[dont-drift-away]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['We must give...earnest heed...lest we drift away.' Hebrews 2:1 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says, ‘We must give the more earnest heed to the things we have heard, lest we drift away…How shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation?’ (Hebrews 2:1–3 NKJV) Note the words ‘drift’ and ‘neglect’. Those words should set off alarm bells! Samson’s decline was so gradual that he didn’t even realise it was happening. Like flipping a switch, he’d become used to drawing on the power of God and overcoming every enemy and obstacle. But sin and self–indulgence became his undoing. When Delilah said, “‘The Philistines are upon you, Samson!”…he awoke from his sleep, and said, “I will go out as before, at other times, and shake myself free!” But he did not know that the Lord had departed from him. Then the Philistines took him.’ (Judges 16:20–21 NKJV) When you neglect God you begin to ‘drift away’. Your prayers aren’t as effective. You’re no longer a godly influence on those around you. You slip back into old habit patterns. You refuse to forgive those who’ve offended you. You fail to make amends to those you’ve hurt. You start doing what’s expedient and comfortable instead of what’s right. You harbour attitudes of fear and resentment. You feed your old nature and neglect your new one. These are all signs that you need a spiritual checkup. Ask God today to highlight those attitudes, activities and relationships that need to be dealt with and start weeding them out. The good news is that when you’re obedient to God’s Word and the Spirit’s leading, you regain your spiritual vitality and God can use you more effectively.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Cor 15-16; Luke 24:36-44; Ps 60; Pro 25:21-22<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62076&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['All our busy rushing ends in nothing.' Psalm 39:6 NLT<br /><br /><p>If there aren’t enough hours in your day to get everything done, chances are you can relate to David’s lament: ‘All our busy rushing ends in nothing.’ Mark Roberts writes, ‘It’s hard to think of a more relevant insight for our time… we’re seeing our nest eggs dry up and our economic hopes dashed… We feel as if we’ve been rushing about “[like] moving shadows” (Psalms 39:6 NLT), without substance.’ To maximise your time, Mary M. Byers says: ‘Make lists: what do you want to accomplish this week? List work–related tasks on one side and home–related on the other. That way you won’t have to struggle to remember everything. Consult your schedule first: understanding your current workload is essential to maintaining realistic goals. Are you booked solid, or is this a more relaxed week? If it’s the latter, you can tackle more than you could during times when you’re constantly on–the–go. Prioritise: highlight what has to be done this week, and put everything else on a secondary list. Focus on your highest priority and work on the rest as time permits. Delegate: is there a colleague who can assist at work? The same applies to home–based activities; let your kids pitch in. It’ll help you, and instil a sense of pride and responsibility in them. Identify extenuating circumstances: are you running yourself ragged caring for a loved one, or doing double duty while your spouse is away? At particularly challenging times, give yourself permission to let some things slide without feeling guilty that you’re not accomplishing as much as usual. Learn to let go: the longer something is on your list, the less important it’s likely to be.’</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Exo 1-3; Luke 24:45-53; Ps 51; Pro 25:23-25<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62077&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>‘The righteous are as bold as a lion.’ Proverbs 28:1 NIV</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
<p>John Ruskin said, ‘What we think, or what we know, or what we believe is, in the end, of little consequence. The only consequence is what we do.’ If you’re serious about succeeding at what you believe God called you to do, you must take three steps: (1) Do something! Sir Edmund Burke said, ‘Nobody made a greater mistake, than he who did nothing because he could do only a little.’ Praying, planning and deliberating are all good, but there comes a point when you have to step out in faith and act. And if you’re naturally sedentary or easily discouraged, you’ll have to confront your fear and reluctance and take that first step. American Declaration of Independence signer John Hancock said, ‘All worthwhile men have good thoughts, good ideas and good intentions, but precious few of them ever translate those into action.’ God promised to part the waters of the Jordan River so that His people could go through and enter the Promised Land. But the waters parted only after they stepped in (Joshua 3:11–17). The same principle applies to you. In the beginning you just need to get moving. Try different things. It’s easier to start doing something right if you’ve already started doing something. It’s easy to steer a car when it’s moving forward, but almost impossible when it’s standing still. Dennis Bakke, co–founder and former CEO of global energy supplier AES Corporation, said, ‘We try a bunch of stuff… see what works… and call that our strategy.’ In other words, if you don’t know exactly what to do, don’t let it keep you from doing something.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...Their eyes were opened and they recognised Him...' Luke 24:31 NIV<br /><br /><p>One day Jesus touched the eyes of a blind man and he exclaimed, 'I see men as trees, walking.' (Mark 8:24 KJV) In other words, 'I see something, but it's not completely clear yet.' So Jesus touched him again, cleared his perceptions, removing his limitations and setting him free to become the man God made him to be. Without a God-given vision you'll stumble through life, blind to who God is and what He can do; blind to who you are and what He can accomplish through you. Thomas Edison 'saw' incandescent light before the first electric bulb ever glowed. It's what sustained him through thousands of failed experiments. Bill Gates 'saw' a PC in every office and home, while the so-called experts were busy announcing, 'It'll never happen in our lifetime.' Forty years before Israel set foot in the Promised Land, Moses 'saw' it (Hebrews 11:27). God can be doing all sorts of things, yet you don't see them because you're spiritually blind. Remember the two disciples on the Emmaus Road? It was only after Jesus had walked with them for several kilometres and explained the Scriptures to them that we read, '...Their eyes were opened and they recognised Him...' (Luke 24:31 NIV) When you begin to see God at work in your situation, your fear is diminished and your faith is strengthened. How does He reveal Himself? At church? Sometimes. But mostly He opens His Word and understanding and we start to see Him in a way we never have before. So today pray, 'Open my eyes that I may see...' (Psalm 119:18 NIV)</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Sam 1-3, Lk 1:57-66, Ps 59:1-8, Prov 16:20-22 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61898&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...After waiting patiently, Abraham received what was promised.' Hebrews 6:15 NIV<br /><br /><p>When you're praying for something, the last thing you want to hear God say is 'Wait!' But sometimes He does. And in order to walk with Him you must learn to be patient, because He works according to His schedule and not yours. All your praying and pleading won't accelerate the process, it'll just frustrate you. Furthermore, if life has indulged your every want and whim, learning to wait on God will be like going through spiritual rehab. When Abraham was 75, God promised to make him '...a father of many nations.' (Genesis 17:4 NKJV) But he had to wait over 24 years before he 'received what was promised'. Waiting isn't simply something you do in order to get what you want; waiting produces patience, maturity, understanding and character. What God accomplishes in you while you're waiting is often more important than the thing you're waiting for. 'You need to persevere, so that when you have done the will of God, you will receive what He has promised.' (Hebrews 10:36 NIV) Now, waiting isn't an excuse for dodging reality, shirking your responsibility, or not doing the right thing. For example, if you're up to your eyeballs in debt due to overspending, don't sit around waiting for God to send you a big cheque. Learn to discipline yourself and adopt sound financial principles like tithing, budgeting and doing without things until you can pay for them. Above all, waiting means making a decision to trust and obey God when things aren't going the way you planned. It's saying, 'Lord, I'm counting on You and I don't have a backup plan.'</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Song 5-8, Lk 1:39-56, Ps 21, Prov 16:16-19 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61897&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ 'A good man leaves an inheritance...' Proverbs 13:22 NIV<br /><br /><p>Paul probably didn't leave any money or property when he died, but he did leave a legacy - a superior one! His legacy was his writings, those he won to Christ, those he mentored and his enduring influence. Every day your life touches other lives in unseen ways. You don't have to know someone personally in order to experience the blessing of their legacy. Like walking into an empty room and catching a whiff of someone's perfume, your impact can continue to be felt long after you're gone. Usually we associate legacies with dying and we don't particularly like the topic. Or we assume that since our legacy won't be revealed for years, we don't need to start investing in it now. In some cases, we feel like we've little or no control over what we leave behind anyway. Not so: 'A good man leaves an inheritance.' What will yours be? More importantly, what's it going to cost you? Since the best gifts aren't always handed down in your will, why not try for something more meaningful - something that points to who you were. It's one thing to measure success by the money in your bank account, the size of your property holdings and the value of your stocks portfolio. It's entirely another to measure it by intangibles like being a faithful marriage partner, raising great kids, building God's Kingdom and leaving your light burning brightly when you go. All great legacies come with a price tag. To move beyond mediocrity, you must invest every day in the accounts of those who follow you!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Sam 4-7, Lk 1:67-80, Ps 59:9-17, Prov 16:23-26 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61900&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...And the Lord added to the church daily...' Acts 2:47 NKJV<br /><br /><p>God doesn't mind your church having a small congregation. What He objects to is your church having a small vision, for that limits what He can do through you. The story's told of a tourist visiting a small English village. He asked an old gentleman, 'Is there anything special about this place?' The old man smiled and said, 'Yes, you can start here and go anywhere else on earth.' In Acts chapter 5 verse 28 the New Testament church was accused of '...filling Jerusalem with your doctrine...' And in chapter 17 verse 6, Paul and Silas were accused of '...turning the world upside down...' What impact! God has a plan for church growth and you have a part to play. You are called to: <em>invite others</em>. You say, 'Isn't that my pastor's job?' No, your pastor is a shepherd. Shepherds don't give birth to sheep; sheep do that. When was the last time you brought someone to church? If you discovered a cure for cancer or Alzheimer's, wouldn't you share it? Jesus said, 'A certain man gave a great supper and invited many and sent his servant...to say to those who were invited, Come, for all things are now ready.' (Luke 14:16-17 NKJV) When the invited guests started making excuses as to why they couldn't come, 'The master said to the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.' (Luke 14:23 NKJV) Note the words 'compel them to come.' Pick them up in your car, arrange breakfast before church or lunch afterwards. Get creative, but whatever you do, bring them to church!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Sam 8-10, Lk 2:1-15, Ps 64, Prov 16:27-30 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61902&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ 'My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.' Hosea 4:6 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Instruct others. 'Go...make disciples...teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you...' (Matthew 28:19-20 NKJV) When your focus is on not only winning people to Jesus but making them disciples of Jesus, He promises, '...I am with you...' (Matthew 28:20 NKJV) Today we are raising a scripturally unenlightened generation. In a survey conducted in New York City, nine out of ten people couldn't repeat one of the Ten Commandments or name one of the first four books of the New Testament. One man thought Dan and Beersheba were husband and wife! Another thought an epistle was the wife of an apostle! We smile, but it's a deadly serious issue. God said, 'My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.' Jesus said, '...Are you not in error because you do not know the Scriptures?...' (Mark 12:24 NIV) Many of the problems we seek counselling for could be resolved and in some cases avoided altogether, if we took time each day to get into God's Word. The reason many of us are spiritually sick is not because the medicine failed, but because we don't take it. Basically, we're all motivated by reward. So read this: 'This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate in it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success.' (Joshua 1:8 NKJV) Do you want to be strong spiritually? Get into the Scriptures. Do you want to succeed in life? Get into the Scriptures.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...They were all filled with the Holy Spirit...' Acts 4:31 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Inspire others. To be inspired is to feel motivated and excited about what you are doing. The story is told of a little boy sitting in church with his mother. On the platform behind the pastor were three flags; the little boy asked her about the first one. 'That's our nation's flag,' she said. Then he wanted to know about the second flag. She whispered, 'That's the Christian flag.' Finally he asked about the third flag. Telling him to be quiet, she whispered, 'That's for those who died in service.' Innocently he asked, 'Which service did they die in, the morning or evening service?' Yes, your church should be a place of reverence and order, but it should also be alive with the power and presence of God. A sign on a little country store said it all: 'There's no place anywhere near this place, that's anything like this place, so this must be the place!' That's what God wants His church to be. You ask, 'What was church like back in the days of the early apostles?' Distinctive! Dynamic! Demonstrative! 'When they had prayed, the place where they were assembled...was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the Word of God with boldness.' According to the latest opinion poll, nowadays a 'committed' church member is somebody who attends church twice a month. Wow! The New Testament believers went every day. Furthermore, 'They were all (every member) filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the Word of God with boldness.' Jesus is many things - but boring isn't one of them. So let's invite people, instruct them and inspire them!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Sam 14-15, Lk 2:36-52, Ps 98, Prov 17:1-3 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62054&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ 'The new wine is found in the cluster...' Isaiah 65:8 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The fourth, and perhaps the most frustrating challenge we face when it comes to church growth, is to involve others. Why is that? A message on a bulletin board outside a church gives us a clue. The top line says, 'We care about you,' and the line underneath reads: 'Sundays. 10 am only.' A cartoon by Erik Johnson puts it another way. At the top in big bold letters is a sign that reads: 'The challenge of starting a men's ministry.' Standing directly under the sign is a group of bored-looking guys. To the right of the group is the pastor, who quips: 'So far, the only thing we have in common is an aversion to singing, socialising and sharing.' People can feel lost and lonely in a crowd, even if it's in church. Sitting in a pew looking at the back of somebody's head for an hour and a half doesn't meet anyone's emotional, relational or spiritual needs. As a member of Christ's body, the church, it's your job to take the first step and initiate contact with those around you. Jesus went out of His way to love the fallen, the fraudulent and the faithless - people others wouldn't have anything to do with. When someone comes into your church and finds Christ, your job has only begun. They are called to serve and you are called to show them how, when and where. 'The new wine is found in the cluster...' Wine speaks of joy. But you can't get it out of a single grape; you've got to have a 'cluster'. Are you getting the idea?</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Sam 16-17, Lk 3:1-14, Ps 102:1-11, Prov 17:4-6 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62055&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[ '...Forgive as the Lord forgave you.' Colossians 3:13 NIV<br /><br /><p>A lady writes: 'I found my husband with another woman. Although he begged me for forgiveness, I wanted my pound of flesh, so I filed for divorce even though our kids asked me not to. Two years later my husband was still trying to get me back, but I wanted none of it. He'd hurt me and I wanted revenge. Finally he gave up, married a young widow with two children, and rebuilt his life without me. They're all so happy and I'm just a lonely, miserable woman, who let bitterness ruin her life.' Now there's no question that infidelity is wrong. But without forgiveness, what's left? There's a point at which anger stops being a healthy emotion and becomes a driving force. Like a drug, you need larger and larger doses. Once that happens, you move even further from forgiveness, because without anger you've no energy at all. It's what drives hate groups and extremists. Without bitterness they've no reason to exist. If you take bigotry from the racist, revenge from the zealot and chauvinism from the sexist, what's left? 'Bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances you may have against one another. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.' Bitterness is fatal; it kills your soul. So how can you stop yourself from becoming bitter when you've been hurt? (a) By looking into the face of the person who hurt you and seeing, instead, the face of the One who showed you mercy when nobody else would have given you another chance. (b) By realising that before the day, the week, the month or the year is out, you'll be needing mercy yourself.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...He will reward each person according to what he has done.' Matthew 16:27 NIV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says, 'For the Son of Man is going to come in His Father's glory with His angels and then He will reward each person according to what he has done.' Let's be clear: how you live now will determine what happens to you after you die. The choices you make each day don't come to nothing when you pass away. They matter and they'll continue to matter throughout eternity. Your eternal destination is determined by what you believe, but your eternal reward is the result of how you behave. If you believe that and live accordingly, it will change how you think about life, how you think about God, indeed what you do one minute from now. God wants you to know that the positive consequences of your actions today can change your eternal prospects in astounding and wonderful ways and He doesn't want you to waste another minute. You don't have to worry what awaits you on the other side of your last heartbeat. Others don't decide that - you do! When the truth of this hits you, you'll say, 'I can't believe I've prepared for my children's future and my own retirement, but not given a thought to my real future!' One man put it like this: 'I've always thought about finishing well. Now it turns out that death is just the starting gate.' The truth is that you can't do anything about your past, but starting right now you can change your future - one choice, one day, one act at a time. It's up to you.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Mt 5:7, Mt 18:21-35, Ps 103:8-18, Lam 3:22-24  <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62056&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...The humble...retain honour.' Proverbs 29:23 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The first lie Satan told Adam and Eve was a direct appeal to the ego in all of us: '...You will be like God...' (Genesis 3:5 NRS) The crafty old serpent pulled back the curtain to Heaven's throne room and gave our first parents a glimpse of power and glory and they were hooked. And we've been hooked ever since! If you've spent any time in the company of social climbers and 'name droppers', you realise human nature hasn't changed much. It's still about staying on top! And since manners can take you where money alone can't, you can actually take classes that teach you 'power table manners'. Things like never handing your plate to the waiter and never stooping to retrieve dropped cutlery. In fact, to ensure your place on the ladder of upward mobility, a cardinal rule is never to stoop at all! Not even to help meet people's needs, admit your mistakes, or give to those who can't repay you. The pursuit of power makes you think you're better than others and prevents you from serving them. It makes you susceptible to flattery, resistant to honest counsel and leads to isolation and non-accountability. You see it every day in little things like never complimenting those under you in case they 'forget their place'; refusing to be loving and courteous to your mate in case you lose your most powerful weapon - control; putting personal ambition ahead of personal integrity; withholding intimacy to punish and manipulate someone. Such power plays are designed to get you what you want at other people's expense. That's why the Bible warns, 'A man's pride will bring him low, but the humble...retain honour.'</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Sam 20:30-23:29, Lk 4:1-13, Ps 102:18-28, Prov 17:11-14 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62057&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[ 'Choose...men...full of the Spirit.' Acts 6:3 NIV<br /><br /><p>Stephen was also chosen for leadership in the New Testament church because he was 'full of...the Holy Spirit.' (Acts 6:5 NIV) Why is that important? Because Jesus said to His disciples: '...You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem (<em>your home base</em>), and in all Judea (<em>those within driving distance</em>) and Samaria (<em>places where you won't necessarily be welcomed</em>) and to the end of the earth.' (Acts 1:8 NKJV) Paul writes, '...Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit...' (Ephesians 5:18 KJV) The story is told of a pastor who was seen drinking a glass of wine at dinner. Seizing on Paul's words, 'Be not drunk with wine,' the deacon board called for his immediate resignation. Whereupon the pastor responded, 'Then let's all resign. You say I failed the first half of the commandment, &quot;Be not drunk with wine.&quot; But you've all failed the second half, &quot;Be filled with the Spirit.&quot;' Understand this: you need to be continually filled with God's Spirit. After all, you're not still running your car on the first tank of petrol you put in it, are you? Remember the old ad for Brylcreem hair gel for men? 'A little dab'll do ya!' That doesn't work when it comes to leadership in God's Kingdom! You're either being led by the Holy Spirit - or your spirit. 'But I have talent,' you say. Yes, and God will use it. But when it comes to building what He wants built, it's, 'Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit, says the Lord.'

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[ 'A new command I give you: Love one another.' John 13:34 NIV<br /><br /><p>A newspaper told the story of a boy with cancer who was going through chemotherapy and losing his hair. To show their love and support, his classmates all shaved their heads so he wouldn't be embarrassed about returning to school. The newspaper carried a picture of them all with their bald heads, accompanied by the caption, 'Everything we do, we do together.' That's the 'law of love' Jesus was talking about when He said, 'A new command I give you: Love one another.' This must have sounded radical to the people Jesus was addressing, for they lived by two Old Testament laws: (1) <em>the law of revenge</em>. Before Moses came along, the law of the land was the law of the jungle. It said in essence, 'If you hurt me I'll hurt you and then hurt you even more!' Enemies actively sought ways to settle old scores because revenge wasn't just acceptable, it was encouraged. (2) <em>the law of retribution</em>. In Moses' time, revenge was replaced with retribution, which allowed 'an eye for an eye', but no more (Leviticus 24:20). You could do to your enemies only what they had done to you. To us this sounds harsh, but back then it was major progress. Then Jesus came along and introduced a third law: the law of love. It meant you didn't have to get even; you could choose to forgive. Indeed, if you didn't, your prayers wouldn't be answered. This new commandment demonstrates the unconditional love God shows to us - then calls us to live the same way. So the law of love should govern your life every day.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Sam 24-26, Lk 4:14-30, Ps 110, Prov 17:15-17 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62059&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ 'Above all, clothe yourselves with love...' Colossians 3:14 NLT<br /><br /><p>God's love is the most powerful force the world has ever seen. And as a follower of Christ, it is up to you to carry the torch and keep it burning. The Bible says, '...Clothe yourselves with tender-hearted mercy, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience... Above all, clothe yourselves with love, which binds us all together in perfect harmony.' (Colossians 3:12-14 NLT) It's one thing to quote Scriptures, pray long articulate prayers in public, study theology and attend church. But only when people see your love will they be impacted by your life. Love, not words, is the true test of your discipleship. It's said that General Omar Bradley once made a business trip on a commercial airline wearing a regular suit instead of his military uniform. When he reached his seat, he started doing some paperwork. As it turned out, the man sitting next to him was a young army private who didn't recognise Bradley. So, after take-off, he turned to the general and said, 'Since we're going to be together for a while, it would be nice if we got to know each other. My guess is that you're a banker.' Not wishing to seem rude, but needing to finish his work, Bradley replied, 'No, I'm General Omar Bradley, a five-star general in the US Army. I head up the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon in Washington, DC.' Without missing a beat, the young private replied, 'Well, sir, that's a very important job, and I sure hope you don't blow it!' Your most important job today is to show God's love - so don't blow it!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 1 Sam 27-31, Lk 4:31-44, Ps 122, Prov 17:18-21 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62060&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...You are members of God's family.' Ephesians 2:19 NLT<br /><br /><p>Nathaniel Hawthorne said, 'No man, for any period, can wear one face to himself and another to the multitude, without finally getting bewildered as to which is the true one.' We like to wear masks in public, yet, only as we open up to one another can we truly change and grow. '...If we live in the light...we can share fellowship with each other...' (1 John 1:7 NCV) The world promotes the idea darkness is needed for intimacy, but the Word tells us the opposite: it occurs when we live in the light. We can keep hidden sin a secret in the dark but, in the light, it can be exposed to healing truth. We're afraid of transparency, yet it's the only way to become spiritually and emotionally whole. None of us is as strong individually as all of us are collectively. We're more consistent in our faith when others walk with us and encourage us. Over and over in the New Testament we're told to be devoted to one another, submit to one another, forgive one another, bear one another's burdens, honour one another, accept one another, teach one another, serve one another, encourage one another, pray for one another and love one another. You're not responsible for everyone in your church, but you are responsible to them. God expects you to do whatever you can to serve them. Paul challenged the believers in Rome, saying, '...I want us to help each other...Your faith will help me and my faith will help you.' (Romans 1:12 NCV) That's what it's all about!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Eph 1:1-4:16, Lk 5:1-11, Ps 137, Prov 17:22-23 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62061&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[ '...If you suffer for doing good...this is commendable...' 1 Peter 2:20 NIV<br /><br /><p>Have you ever watched water run off a duck's back? That's how you should treat unkind comments. 'But they hurt my feelings,' you say. Stop and think about that: if they are really your feelings, others have no control over them, other than what you give them. The truth is, almost everybody is more preoccupied with themselves than with you; therefore, you know more about yourself than they will ever know. It's not what others say about you that counts. It's what God says about you and what  say about yourself that counts. When you know who you are, you won't allow others to define your worth. Jesus knew that His accusers were ignorant; that's why they feared Him. People fight what they don't understand. The mind tends to resent what it cannot master. Jesus never begged anyone to believe in Him. Why? Because He knew that integrity cannot be proven, it must be discerned. So He stayed focused on His goal. His enemies accused Him of being possessed by devils, but He paid no attention. He just continued to cast out devils. He didn't try to look good, He was good. He didn't try to be truthful, He was truthful. It's human to want to be loved, valued and admired, but your enemies will never leave your reputation untarnished. You must rise above that and not allow what others say about you to change your opinion of yourself. Be like the New Testament believers. 'The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name [of Jesus].' (Acts 5:41 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[ 'A despairing man should have the devotion of his friends.' Job 6:14 NIV<br /><br /><p>In the summer of 1989, Mark Wellman, a paraplegic, gained national recognition by climbing the towering granite face of El Capitan in Yosemite National Park. On the seventh and final day of his climb, a headline in <i>The Fresno Bee</i> read: 'Showing a will of granite.' Accompanying the headline was a photo of Mark Wellman being carried on the shoulders of his climbing companion Mike Corbett. The caption underneath read: 'Paraplegic and partner prove no wall is too high to scale.' What most people didn't know was Mike Corbett had already scaled El Capitan three times, in order to help Mark Wellman pull himself up once. Sympathy addresses our struggles; support gives us the strength to overcome them. Sympathy says, 'I understand what you're going through and I'm here for you.' It meets two fundamental needs: the need to be understood and the need to have our feelings validated. It's when life comes crashing in on us that we need our friends the most. In the midst of his suffering Job cried out, 'A despairing man should have the devotion of his friends.' We all need sympathy and support, because we all stumble and need help getting back up. So we need to offer them to others and be willing to receive them in return. The Bible says, 'When people sin, you should forgive and comfort them, so they won't give up in despair.' (2 Corinthians 2:7 CEV) It takes grace to create and maintain true fellowship. But the good news is, you'll never be asked to extend more grace to others than God has extended to you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...Simon, Satan has asked to have you, to sift you like wheat...' Luke 22:31 TLB<br /><br /><p>Out of all Christ's disciples, Peter was the one who believed that failure couldn't happen to him. But it did, and in a big way. Jesus told him, '...Satan has asked to have you, to sift you like wheat, but I have pleaded in prayer for you that your faith should not completely fail. So when you have repented and turned to Me again, strengthen and build up the faith of your brothers.' (Luke 22:31-32 TLB) Notice three important truths: (1) <em>we are all capable of falling</em>. Don't believe the lie that says, 'If you were really a Christian, you wouldn't have failed like that.' When God saves you, your spirit is immediately changed. But until your emotions, appetites and desires come under the control of Christ, you'll always struggle in certain areas. This has nothing to do with your salvation and everything to do with becoming spiritually mature. (2) <em>we must be willing to repent</em>. The trouble with temptation is that it usually starts out as pleasure. You think you can handle it and when you become ensnared, you try to overcome it in your own strength. But it doesn't work. The Bible says, '...God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.' (James 4:6 NKJV) God's grace isn't for the arrogant. It's only given to humble, repentant hearts. (3) <em>once we are free, we stay free by helping others</em>. God takes us out of a bad situation to place us in a good one; otherwise we'll seek out our old connections. So the way to keep what we have is to give it to others.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Mt 5:8, Ps 24:3-6, 2 Pet 3:3-14, Ps 17:15  <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62062&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...And they chose Stephen...' Acts 6:5 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The New Testament church grew so fast that the administrative aspect of it became overwhelming. The apostles weren't getting enough time to pray and study the Scriptures, so they picked seven men to handle the business side of things. Stephen was one of them. For the next few days let's examine his qualifications: financial integrity. '...Seek out from among you seven men of good reputation...whom we may appoint over this business.' (Acts 6:3 NKJV) Now, it goes without saying that if you're going to handle the church's finances, you must first have a proven track record in handling your own. That calls for saving, sowing and spending wisely. It also means putting God first in your finances. Here's a Biblical question you need to think about: 'Will a man rob God?' Apparently, yes. God said, '...You have robbed Me! But you say, In what way have we robbed You? In tithes and offerings.' (Malachi 3:8 NKJV) Maybe you're thinking, 'Uh-oh, here comes the commercial!' No, tithing isn't a matter of money, but of priorities. God doesn't want your leftovers, He wants your 'first-fruits' (Proverbs 3:9). Tithing is also a matter of obedience. 'If they obey and serve Him, they shall spend their days in prosperity...' (Job 36:11 NKJV) When it comes to leadership in God's work, if you're not 10% behind it, how can you be 100% behind it? If you're not already doing it, try tithing your income for one year. It's like going into partnership with God. Loving the Lord our God with all our heart and mind and soul and strength (Mark 12:30) must impact the priorities we display with our money.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Sam 3:22-7:17, Lk 6:1-16, Ps 109:16-31, Prov 18:1-3 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62063&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ 'Choose...men...full of...wisdom.' Acts 6:3 NIV<br /><br /><p>Another leadership qualification Stephen possessed was: <i>wisdom</i>. 'Seek out...men ...full of...wisdom.' (Acts 6:3 NKJV) Charles Spurgeon said, 'Wisdom is the right use of knowledge.' You can have a head full of knowledge, but if you don't have the wisdom to use it properly, you can't lead people. Just as a stream rises no higher than its source, an organisation can rise no higher than its leadership. Dr John Maxwell refers to this as the 'Law of the Lid'. In his book <i>The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership</i>, he writes: 'Leadership ability is the lid that determines a person's level of effectiveness. The lower an individual's ability to lead, the lower the lid on his potential. The higher their leadership, the greater their effectiveness. To give you an example, if your leadership scores an eight, then your effectiveness can never be greater than a seven. If your leadership is only a four, then your effectiveness will be no higher than a three. Your leadership ability - for better or for worse - always determines your effectiveness and the potential impact of your organisation.' Paul told Timothy, '...Give attendance to reading...' (1 Timothy 4:13 NKJV) Someone who won't read is more to be pitied than someone who can't read. The difference in what you are right now and what you'll be 25 years from now will always be in direct proportion to your reading habits, the relationships you cultivate and the time you spend with God. Obviously Stephen was the right choice. 'Then the word of God spread and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem and a great many of the priests were obedient to the faith.' (Acts 6:7 NKJV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...Stephen, a man full of faith...' Acts 6:5 NIV<br /><br /><p>Another quality that opened the door to leadership in the church for Stephen was: <em>faith</em>. Oswald Chambers said, 'Faith that is sure of God, is the only kind of faith there is.' When drought hit some farming communities, faith made a little girl take her umbrella to a prayer meeting called especially to pray for rain, while all the grown-ups wore sunglasses. Faith isn't just what you say, it's what you do. And it's not just about what you can do, but what you can trust to do. When it comes to faith you must: (1) <em>feed your faith</em>. The Bible is faith food. '...Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God.' (Romans 10:17 NKJV) Note the word 'hearing'. When you read God's Word out loud, it enters your spirit through both the eye-gate and ear-gate, doubling its impact. (2) <em>protect your faith</em>. When terrorists attack, they have more in mind than just blowing up a few buildings and killing some people. Their goal is to strike fear into hearts and cause others to capitulate. Jesus warned Peter that his faith was about to come under attack (Luke 22:31-32). It's not just your finances or your health or your relationships that are under attack; it's your faith! (3) <em>use your faith</em>. Faith is like money; it's the currency of God's Kingdom. You must have it in order to do business with God. When Christ encountered someone who demonstrated real faith, He was ecstatic. And He always responded to them. So you must 'exercise' your faith daily, until it becomes your 'reflex action' in any given situation.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Sam 14:21-17:13, Lk 6:43-7:10, Ps 118:19-29, Prov 18:10-12 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62065&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...Jesus...went about doing good...' Acts 10:38 NKJV<br /><br /><p>The Bible says, 'God anointed Jesus...with the Holy Spirit and with power, Who went about doing good...' When you're led by God's Spirit, your focus won't be on looking good, but on doing good. You say, 'But I'm so busy!' Nobody was busier than Jesus, yet He always responded to those in need. In Luke chapter 10 He tells of a Jewish traveller who was attacked by a gang and left to die by the road. First a Levite, then a priest passed by. But each had important appointments to keep, so they didn't stop. Then a Samaritan came along. Now, he had every reason to look the other way, because the Jews and the Samaritans were long-standing enemies. Instead, '...He...came where he was. And when he saw him, he had compassion.' (Luke 10:33 NKJV) Compassion will make you stop and rearrange your priorities. This Samaritan realised that where he was at that moment was more important than his next appointment. What would you have done that day? Do you think you'd have acted like him? How about when God tries to interrupt your inflexible, tightly-organised, written-in-concrete schedule and asks you to make time for someone who's hurting? Are you willing to forgo your plans and do what He wants? If you're too busy to reach out to those who are hurting, you're too busy! You say, 'But I'm shy around people.' Then start with the people you know in your local church. 'Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all, especially to those who are of the household of faith.' (Galatians 6:10 NKJV)</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Sam 17:14-19:43, Lk 7:11-23, Ps 123, Prov 18:13-16 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62066&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...That you may not bear it yourself alone.' Numbers 11:17 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Moses said to God, 'Why have You...laid the burden of all these people on me?' (Numbers 11:11 NKJV) God replied, '...Gather to Me seventy men... I will take of the Spirit that is upon you and will put the same upon them...that you may not bear it yourself alone.' (Numbers 11:16-17 NKJV) Identify your God-given strengths, then delegate the rest to those who have strengths in your areas of weakness. Every leader is responsible for areas in which they have little or no competence. And when they try to exercise authority in those areas, they hinder everything and everybody under their watch. Put bluntly, there are things you are responsible for that you'll never be good at, that you need to keep your nose out of and give to others! Why do we have such a hard time doing this? (1) <em>Pride</em>. Success is intoxicating and intoxicated people don't think too clearly. We assume our abilities are broader than they actually are. Admitting weakness doesn't make you less effective; it just confirms what everybody around you already knows! (2) <em>Ignorance</em>. We feel bad about delegating our weak areas because we assume everybody hates to do what we hate to do. Not so. You're allowing others to shine; your limitations are opportunities. (3) <em>Independence</em>. We think if the job is to be done 'right' we must do it ourselves. But leadership isn't just about getting things done; it's about getting things done through others. If you can't find somebody to hand things to, look in the mirror! The people who follow you are exactly where you've led them! If you've nobody to delegate things to, guess who needs to change?</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Sam 20:1-22:30, Lk 7:24-35, Ps 133, Prov 18:17-20 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62067&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ 'Grey hair is a crown of splendour; it is attained by a righteous life.' Proverbs 16:31 NIV<br /><br /><p>We all live for something; the question is: <em>what?</em> Ben Patterson writes in <em>The Grand Essentials</em>: 'I have a theory about old age...I believe when life has whittled us down, when joints have failed and skin has wrinkled and capillaries have clogged and hardened, what is left of us will be what we were all along in our essence. Exhibit A: a distant uncle. All his life he did nothing but find new ways to get rich. He spent his [last years] very comfortably, drooling and babbling constantly about the money he had made. When life whittled him down to his essence, all that was left was raw greed. This is what he had cultivated in a thousand little ways over a lifetime. Exhibit B: my wife's grandmother. When she died in her mid-eighties she had already been senile for several years. What did this lady talk about? The best example I can think of was when we asked her to pray before dinner. She would reach out and hold the hands of those sitting beside her, a broad, beatific smile would spread across her face, her dim eyes would fill with tears as she looked up to Heaven and her chin would quiver as she poured out her love to Jesus. That was Edna in a nutshell. She loved Jesus and she loved people. She couldn't remember our names, but she couldn't keep her hands from patting us lovingly, whenever we got near her. When life whittled her down to her essence, all there was left was love...for God and love for people.' What are you living for?</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Mt 5:9, Rom 12:17-21, Jas 3:17-18, 2 Ki 6:8-23<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=62068&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'...When he died...his eyes were not weak nor his strength gone.' Deuteronomy 34:7 NIV<br /><br /></p>
<p>Don't listen to those who tell you you're 'too old'. God's promise is, 'They will still bear fruit in old age, they will stay fresh...' (Psalm 92:14 NIV) For 20 to 30 years the century plant spreads out but produces no flowers. Then in one year, without warning, a bud sprouts. The bud, which resembles a tree-trunk-sized asparagus spear, shoots into the sky at the fantastic rate of nearly 20 cm per day, and reaches an eventual height of 8 to 10 m. Then it crowns itself with several clumps of yellowish blossoms that last almost a month. Some of God's oldest are among His finest! The older, mellower Abraham was wiser than the brash, younger one. Caleb was still defeating giants and climbing mountains at 85. Anna, an elderly widow, didn't just pray for the Messiah; her vision kept her alive until He came. In his nineties, imprisoned on the Isle of Patmos, John wrote the Book of Revelation. Jesus said, 'Those who try to make their life secure will lose it, but those who lose their life will keep it.' (Luke 17:33 NRS) You can approach life in two ways: protect it or pursue it. When the voice of safety says, 'Build a fire in the hearth and stay in where it's warm,' the voice of faith says, 'Build a fire in your soul, then go out and pursue your vision with a passion.' Asked why he was still studying Greek in his nineties, Oliver Wendell Holmes is reported to have said, 'My good sir, it's now or never!' What matters is not the years in your life, but the life in your years. So, live till you die!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[ 'Demas...loved this...world.' 2 Timothy 4:10 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Again we ask, 'What happened to Demas?' (1) Was he troubled by Paul's diminishing prestige? When Paul came to town, church growth exploded - and so did riots. In one town the new converts brought out pornographic books and artefacts of witchcraft and burned them in the town square. That didn't win Paul any points with the publishers and manufacturers! He had the social status of a person with leprosy at a health retreat. Who said the Christian life was supposed to be easy? Not Jesus: 'If the world hates you, you know that it hated Me before it hated you. If you were of the world, the world would love its own. Yet because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.' (John 15:18-19 NKJV) Attack is a sign of respect; it means you haven't been conquered. Indeed, the level of the attack that comes against you is an indicator of the level of God's blessing that awaits you beyond it. (2) Did he resent Paul's growing ostracism by professing Christians? A man asked his friend, 'How's the world treating you?' He replied, 'The world treats me just fine, it's the saints who give me a hard time!' Sometimes the church supported Paul financially, other times he had to make tents to support himself. So how did he respond? '...I will very gladly spend and be spent for your souls; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I am loved.' (2 Corinthians 12:15 NKJV) The burning desire in Paul's life was '...to be well pleasing to [Christ].' (2 Corinthians 5:9 NKJV) Is that your desire, too?</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Judg 16:1-19:15, Mk 9:14-29, Ps 47, Prov 13:11-12 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61723&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[ '...I want my share...now.' Luke 15:12 NLT<br /><br /><p>The Prodigal Son made two mistakes: (1) <em>he rejected his father's authority</em>. The first step that gets you into trouble is the one that takes you away from God. Like the Prodigal Son, you leave home saying, 'Give me.' And if you're fortunate enough to survive your own best thinking, you come back home saying, 'Forgive me.' God loves you. Everything you need, He has already provided! (2) <em>he left his father's house</em>. The devil will do whatever it takes to get you out from under God's influence and protection. He'll put a restless spirit in you so that nothing makes you happy. Two areas he will work the hardest to generate discontent in are: (a) <em>your marriage</em>. That's why you constantly need to work on it. The reason there are weeds in your garden instead of roses is because you don't spend enough time working there. Your marriage isn't just a covenant before God, it's a shelter for your passions and dysfunctions. Furthermore, that 'other person', who looks so attractive to you, has baggage, too. And when they move in, they'll bring it with them! (b) <em>your church</em>. Who feeds you spiritually? Who monitors your growth in God? Would you let your children stay home from school because they don't like the teacher or don't want to learn? Come on, be sensible! God says His Word is like '...a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces.' (Jeremiah 23:29 NKJV) When the hammer of God's Word falls in church next Sunday morning - you need to be under it. You should say, 'I was glad when they said unto me, &quot;Let us go into the house of the Lord.&quot;' (Psalm 122:1 NKJV)</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Cor 9:1-11:15, Lk 1:1-10, Ps 144:9-15, Prov 16:4-7 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61894&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...You will live safely in the land and prosper.' Psalm 37:3 NLT<br /><br /><p>Frank Furedi documented an increasing use of fear in the media by counting the appearances of the term 'at risk' in British newspapers. In 1994 the term appeared 2,037 times. By the end of the next year the total had doubled. During the year 2000, 'at risk' was printed more than 18,000 times. Now, did world danger increase ninefold in six years? Or are we just getting the bad news faster, in real time? 'Information overload' has produced the most medicated generation known to man. Not only do we need antidepressants and tranquilisers, our children do, too. Even our pets are taking them! Thank God for increased medical knowledge, but you have to ask, 'How did folks in the old days get by? What did they do when they were stressed out?' Here are words some of them woke up with every morning and went to bed with every night: 'Don't worry about the wicked or envy those who do wrong. For like grass, they soon fade away. Like spring flowers, they soon wither. Trust in the Lord and do good. Then you will live safely in the land and prosper. Take delight in the Lord and He will give you your heart's desires. Commit everything you do to the Lord. Trust Him, and He will help you... Be still in the presence of the Lord and wait patiently for Him to act... The Lord rescues the godly; He is their fortress in times of trouble. The Lord helps them, rescuing them from the wicked. He saves them, and they find shelter in Him.'

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...This is My body which is broken for you; do this in remembrance of Me.' 1 Corinthians 11:24 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Here are three reasons you need to partake of Holy Communion: (1) <em>To make you grace-minded</em>. No one will ever stand in Heaven and say, 'Look what Jesus and I have accomplished.' If you had to pay one cent of your debt of sin, it would make you a co-redeemer with Christ. What an offence to the cross! (Ephesians 2:8-9) Hymnist Horatio Spafford wrote: 'My sin, oh the bliss of this glorious thought. My sin, not in part but the whole, is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more. Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!' (2) <em>To keep you sensitive to sin</em>. '...Let a man examine himself and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup. For he who eats and drinks in an unworthy manner eats and drinks judgment to himself...' (1 Corinthians 11:28-29 NKJV) You say, 'If I sin and take communion, does that mean I'm drinking liquid damnation?' No, it's the 'manner' in which you approach God that counts. You don't have to avoid the communion cup; you need only confess your sin, then drink deeply with gratitude. (3) <em>To keep you focused on Christ's return</em>. '...I will no longer drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the Kingdom of God.' (Mark 14:25 NKJV) Every communion service brings you one step closer to the greatest communion service of all: the marriage supper of the Lamb in Heaven (Revelation 19:7). Are you planning on being there?</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Judg 19:16-21:25, Mk 9:30-37, Ps 45, Prov 13:13-16 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61727&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[ 'When I consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers...' Psalm 8:3 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Let's look at the finger of God in Scripture: <i>the finger of God in creation</i>. The Psalmist David said, 'When I consider...the work of Your fingers, the moon and the stars, which You have ordained, what is man that You are mindful of him?' (Psalm 8:3-4 NKJV) The Bible opens by telling us, 'In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.' (Genesis 1:1 NIV) In a day when many challenge the inspiration and infallibility of the Bible, we need to teach our children Who made the universe, Who runs it, and to Whom each of us is ultimately accountable. In 1961 Yuri Gagarin, the first Russian cosmonaut to go into space, is alleged to have boasted, 'I looked and looked but I didn't see God.' Guess what? One day he will see God and stand before Him and be judged (Romans 14:11-12). We all will! Faith and reason are not necessarily opposed. But when reason won't take you another step, faith keeps on going because it connects you to God. The stars convinced David of God's existence. They say if you counted stars at a rate of 125 a minute, it would take 2,000 years just to count the stars in our Milky Way. And that it would take ten billion human beings standing side by side to span the diameter of the average star. Awesome, isn't it? Paul says: 'For since the creation of the world, God's invisible qualities - His eternal power and divine nature - have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse.' (Romans 1:20 NIV) If you look you will see God at work everywhere - including your own life.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[ 'The magicians said to Pharaoh, This is the finger of God.' Exodus 8:19 NIV<br /><br /><p><i>T</i><i>he finger of God in calamity</i>. When God sent plagues that Pharaoh's wizards couldn't duplicate, they cried out in fear, 'This is the finger of God.' Finally Pharaoh got the message: 'Maybe God's trying to tell me something.' The calamity that befell Egypt was a direct result of Pharaoh defying God. Ten times Moses stood before him with God's Word, saying, 'Let my people go.' Notice, God was only asking for what was rightfully His. The question is: What is He asking of you? Only when you say 'yes' to God, will things begin to go right for you! When you see His purpose in the reversals and setbacks you're going through, you can actually turn them into stepping stones to blessing. The Psalmist wrote, 'Your way, O God, is in the sanctuary.' (Psalm 77:13 NKJV) Then he added, 'Your way was in the sea, Your path in the great waters...' (Psalm 77:19 NKJV) The sanctuary or the storm! God will bring you the easy way or the hard way. If you refuse to listen to His voice in the sanctuary, He will speak to you in life's storms. Pharaoh rebelled against the providential dealings of God and it cost him his kingdom and his life. Don't miss the lesson here. God wants what belongs to Him, what He bought and paid for at Calvary. He wants His rightful place in your life, which is first place. And you have an option: you can rebel against Him or respond to His love. If you feel God tugging at your heart today, it's because He wants to save you, use you and bless you. If you're wise you'll say 'yes' to Him.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...And He gave to Moses...tablets of stone, written with the finger of God.' Exodus 31:18 ESV<br /><br /><p><em>T</em><em>he finger of God in stone</em>. Why do you think God wrote the Ten Commandments in stone? Because His principles are permanent and unchanging. You say, 'But what about all those people who have never heard God's Word? How will He judge them?' Paul answers: 'Even Gentiles, who do not have God's written law...show that they know His law when they instinctively obey it...They demonstrate that God's law is written in their hearts, for their own conscience and thoughts either accuse them or tell them they are doing right.' (Romans 2:14-15 NLT) Your conscience acts like a compass. If you let it, it'll guide you right. But when you reject its warnings, its voice gets quieter and quieter until you can no longer hear it. That's a dangerous condition to be in. Paul writes, 'Having faith and a good conscience, which some have rejected, concerning the faith, have suffered shipwreck.' (1 Timothy 1:19 NKJV) Picture yourself standing on a bridge, dropping pebbles into a pond and watching the ripples go out to the edge. It's just a little pebble, but look at the effect it has! Yet in winter, when that same pond freezes over, you can drive a truck across it. Your conscience is like that. When you keep disobeying God, your heart becomes calloused and hardened and you no longer hear Him speaking to you. Paul writes, '...I strive always to keep my conscience clear before God and man.' (Acts 24:16 NIV) That's a good rule of thumb for you to live by!</p><br /><br />SoulFood Ascension: Lk 24:50-53, Acts 1:1-11, Eph 4:7-10 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61735&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...A tree is known by its fruit.' Matthew 12:33 NKJV<br /><br /><p>In a letter to George Whitefield, a leader of the Great Awakening, Benjamin Franklin wrote: 'I can only show my gratitude for those mercies from God, by a readiness to help His other children and my brethren. For I do not think that thanks and compliments, though repeated weekly, can discharge our real obligations to each other, and much less those to our Creator. You will see in this, my notion of good works, that I am far from expecting to merit Heaven by them. By Heaven we understand a state of happiness, infinite in degree and eternal in duration. I can do nothing to deserve such rewards... The faith you mention certainly has its use in the world. I do not desire to see it diminished, nor would I endeavour to lessen it in any man. But I wish it were more productive of good works than I have generally seen it; I mean real good works; works of kindness, charity, mercy and public spirit; not holiday-keeping, sermon-reading or hearing; performing church ceremonies, or making long prayers filled with flatteries and compliments...The worship of God is a duty; the hearing and reading of sermons may be useful; but if men rest in hearing and praying, as too many do, it is as if a tree should value itself for being watered and putting forth leaves, though it never produce any fruit.' In aiming to declare that salvation is by grace and not works, never forget that saving faith always produces good works! Faith is the root of salvation. But deeds of generosity and kindness are the fruit of salvation - and 'a tree is known by its fruit.'</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Mt 5:5, Num 12:1-15, Ps 37:1-11, Phil 2:5-11 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61882&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...The message...did not benefit them, because it was not mixed with faith...' Hebrews 4:2 AMP<br /><br /><p>A catalyst facilitates change; it makes things happen! For example, Alka-Seltzer without water has no effervescence, flour without yeast produces no bread, seeds without sunshine means no flowers, blue without yellow means no green, an egg without sperm means no baby, a spark without air produces no flame. Faith makes God's Word work in your life. Without it, nothing happens. Talking about the Israelites, Paul said, 'When the good news of deliverance...came to them...the message...did not benefit them, because it was not mixed with faith.' Kristin Armstrong says: 'Without specific catalysts certain results can never be achieved. To make spiritual progress, it's not enough to read the Bible or listen to sermons. The activating ingredient to understanding is faith. After we hear God's message, we must on it... Maybe you're experiencing bitterness or anger because of a failed relationship and God told you to put those emotions behind you, but you lack the will to do it. Let me encourage you; trust God's Word and act in faith. His promises will bloom in your life, once you activate your faith.' Faith is not intellectual assent, or paying lip service to what you read in God's Word. It's acting on it, confident that God will do what He promised. There's a difference between faith and trust. You may believe a chair will hold you, but, only when you sit down and put your full weight on it, are you trusting it. Getting the idea?</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Cor 5-8, Mk 16:1-20, Ps 144:1-8, Prov 16:1-3 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61884&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...before the throne of our merciful God... we will be treated with undeserved kindness, and we will find help.' Hebrews 4:16 CEV<br /><br /><p>When you pray, 'Our Father,' you define every other relationship in your life: (a) <em>You define your relationship to the material world</em>. Since God is your Father, you're not a stranger but an heir to the blessings of His universe (Psalms 24:1). But beware of the values of the world: 'Never give your hearts to this world or to any of the things in it. [You] cannot love the Father and love the world at the same time.' (1 John 2:15 PHPS) Nothing must take God's place! (b) <em>You define your relationship to others</em>. Everyone around you is your Father's creation and as such you must accept, love and value them. We're commanded to love our neighbour as ourselves regardless of colour, creed or distinction. We're not to compete with them or strive for superiority over them or use them for our own ends. (c) <em>You define your relationship to yourself</em>. God says He's your Father; what a foundation on which to build your self-worth! Regardless of what's been said or done in the past to make you feel inadequate or inferior, you can hold your head high. You're not a nobody once God calls you His child. (d) <em>You define your relationship to God</em>. Because of your relationship to Jesus, the Father declares you '...accepted in the Beloved.' (Ephesians 1:6 NKJV) As He accepts Jesus, so He accepts you! '...As many as received Him...He gave the right to become children of God...' (John 1:12 NAS) You no longer need to approach Him in fear. You can walk right up 'before the throne of our merciful God [and] be treated with undeserved kindness and...find help.' It doesn't get any better!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Deut 30:1-32:28, Mk 6:14-29, Ps 57, Prov 12:15-17 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61699&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...The word of the Lord came to Elijah...saying... I will send rain on the earth.' 1 Kings 18:1 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Three years earlier, God told Elijah to announce the coming of a severe drought. As a result, it was all people talked about. Then God told him to announce that rain was coming and they were to prepare for it. Understand this: unless you learn to attune your spiritual ear to what God is saying, you won't be ready for what life throws at you. God can tell you when to save and when to sow, when to buy and when to sell, when to come to the table and when to walk away. 'Your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, &quot;This is the way, walk in it.&quot;' (Isaiah 30:21 NKJV) But Satan can also speak to you and tell you things like, 'You're going bankrupt. You're going to die. You'll never succeed. Nobody loves you.' You'll never hear that from God! In spite of what you're hearing around you or within you, you must believe in God's faithfulness and trust Him to fight for you. Knowing He would soon be crucified, Jesus prayed, '&quot;Father, glorify Your name.&quot; Then a voice came from Heaven, saying, &quot;I have both glorified it and will glorify it again.&quot; Therefore the people who stood by and heard it said that it had thundered...' (John 12:28-29 NKJV) Isn't it amazing? Some can hear the voice of God, while others standing right beside them hear only noise. What Jesus heard that day galvanised His faith and gave Him the strength to march victoriously to the cross. So who are you listening to? What are you hearing?</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Mt 5:4, Is 51:1-16, Ps 30, 2 Cor 1:3-7<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61850&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...Jesus stooped down and wrote on the ground with His finger...' John 8:6 NKJV<br /><br /><p><i>T</i><i>he finger of God in cleansing</i>. One day the Pharisees brought a woman to Christ. She'd been 'caught in the act' of adultery and they expected Him to condemn her. But instead, 'Jesus stooped down and wrote on the ground with His finger, as though He did not hear.' This is Jesus at His best! He stooped down to identify with the victim in her shame, refusing to listen to the words of her accusers. Then He scattered them with a single statement: '...He who is without sin among you, let him throw a stone at her first.' (John 8:7 NKJV) <i>Ouch!</i> Then the One Who came not to tear us down but to build us up, said to her, '...Neither do I condemn you; go and sin no more.' (John 8:11 NKJV) The question is, where would she find strength to live such a life? Through Christ! His commandments are His enablings. He said, '...I am the light of the world, He who follows Me shall not walk in darkness, but have the light of life.' (John 8:12 NKJV) Jesus sees every weed as a potential rose, every doubter as a potential believer and every sinner as a potential saint. Stop listening to the voices that condemn you. Stop beating yourself up over your failures. Come to Jesus today; He will cleanse you, make you whole and give you the life you've always longed for. You don't have to live under Satan's control anymore. Jesus said, '...If I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come.' (Luke 11:20 KJV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[ 'We give great honour to those who endure...' James 5:11 NLT<br /><br /><p>During their famous expedition, American explorers, Lewis and Clark, faced incredible hardships. On reaching the Missouri River, they thought the worst was over - then they saw the Rockies! Instead of the easy ride downstream that they'd expected, they faced their biggest challenge: retreat or start climbing! Looking back, they realised it was in conquering the Rockies that they gained the confidence they needed for what they'd face later. John Maxwell writes, '...you will become a better, stronger, wiser and more resilient person through solving problems.' Sociologists who study resiliency - the ability to bounce back - tell us that people handle trauma in two ways. They either give up because they're afraid, or they grow up by developing the capacity to handle it. What makes the difference? Instead of acting like victims, resilient people: (1) take charge of their lives; (2) refuse to relinquish their values; (3) refocus on their goal. A challenge is a gift, a blessing in disguise. Quitting is always simpler than enduring. But it produces a pattern that's hard to break; one you live to regret. So if you're thinking, 'This relationship is too hard, I want out,' or, 'This job isn't what I expected, I'm quitting,' remember, you develop resiliency by remaining faithful in situations you don't like and can't change. That's why the Bible says, 'We give great honour to those who endure.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[<p>'When he finally came to his senses...' Luke 15:17 NLT</p>
<p>The Prodigal Son's journey to ruin didn't happen overnight. It was a slow, steady build-up, like cholesterol in your arteries. He took his father's blessings for granted and stopped being grateful. No wonder David wrote, 'Bless the Lord, O my soul; and all that is within me, bless His holy name! Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all His benefits: who forgives all your iniquities... heals all your diseases... redeems your life from destruction... crowns you with loving kindness and tender mercies... who satisfies your mouth with good things...' (Psalm 103:1-5 NKJV) The Prodigal Son was from one of the best families in town, yet he ended up penniless, friendless, eating with pigs, trying to satisfy a legitimate hunger in an illegitimate way. Why do we get involved in extramarital affairs, go on drinking and drug binges, or work ourselves to death and sacrifice our families in the process? Because inside each of us is an emptiness that nothing and no one but God can fill. Jesus said, 'When he finally came to his senses, he said to himself...&quot;I will go home to my father and say, 'Father, I have sinned'&quot;...' (Luke 15:17-18 NLT) If you let Him, God will stop you in the nick of time. He will remind you of who you are and you belong. You will start seeing the mud you're wallowing in, the false friends, the empty achievements, the people around you who are no happier than you. If that's where you are right now, come home. Your Father is waiting to wipe your slate clean. He still loves you. Tell the devil, 'I've changed my mind. I'm going home.'</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[ 'Deliver us from the evil one.' Matthew 6:13 NKJV<br /><br /><p>'<em>Deliver us from evil</em>.' (Luke 11:4 KJV) The original Greek language reads, 'Deliver us from the evil one,' not from some abstract entity called evil. So, should we fear Satan? No, but we must be alert to his strategies (1 Peter 5:8-9). If we're unaware and fail to put on the full armour of God, we invite defeat (Ephesians 6:10-18). But when alert and fully armed, we needn't be afraid of Satan: '...Greater is He that is in you, than he that is in the world.' (1 John 4:4 KJV) Jesus, not you, guarantees your victory. The Holy Spirit within you is what enables you to resist the devil. 'Look, I have given you authority over all the power of the enemy, and...Nothing will injure you.' (Luke 10:19 NLT) When you're battling the evil one, this prayer activates the power of the 'greater One' who is in you, and by His strength you can triumph over him. Add to this God's Word dwelling in your heart and mind, enabling you to rebuff Satan's temptations as Jesus did with, 'it is written' (Matthew 4:3-11). Satan was vanquished by the power of God's Word, and it'll work for you too! '<em>For Thine is the Kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever</em>.' (Matthew 6:13 KJV) What a final note of recognition and praise! No uncertainty or tentativeness here. It mirrors David's great doxology: 'Yours, O Lord, is the greatness...the power...the glory...the majesty and the splendour... Yours, O Lord, is the Kingdom; You are exalted as head over all.' (1 Chronicles 29:11 NIV) Your prayers are certain to be effective when you pray in faith to such a God.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ruth 1-4, Mk 7:14-23, Ps 18:30-50, Prov 12:25-28 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61703&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...He will show you a way out...' 1 Corinthians 10:13 NLT<br /><br /><p>'<em>As we forgive our debtors</em>.' (Matthew 6:12 NKJV) Forgiving others isn't an option, it's an obligation. Being forgiven depends on forgiving others. Young Robert Louis Stevenson's family customarily prayed the Lord's Prayer before dinner. One evening he left the table before they reached the part, 'As we forgive our debtors.' Asked why, he replied, 'I'm not prepared to pray that prayer today.' Recognising his reluctance to forgive, he knew he couldn't receive God's forgiveness. 'If you forgive men...your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not...your Father will not forgive your sins.' (Matthew 6:14-15 NIV) No matter how badly you've been wronged, God requires you to forgive. '<em>...Lead us not into temptation</em>.' (Matthew 6: 13 NIV) This seems odd in the light of God's Word: 'When tempted, no one should ever say, God is tempting me. For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone.' (James 1:13 NIV) William Barclay says the Greek word used here for <em>temptation</em> means 'testing', as in the ordeals and trials of life. It refers to life's stressful experiences. An athlete might use these words with his trainer, 'Please don't push me beyond my endurance!' It calls for acknowledging three realities: (1) your human limits and vulnerabilities. (2) that God's in charge of your testing. (3) that He wants you to ask for help and not try to handle it alone. '...God is faithful. He will not allow the temptation to be more than you can stand...He will show you a way out so that you can endure.' (1 Corinthians 10:13 NLT) He won't just intervene on your behalf; He will use the experience to strengthen you spiritually.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Obad, Mal 1-4, Mk 7:1-13, Ps 18:1-29, Prov 12:23-24 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61702&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...[He] wasted his substance...' Luke 15:13 KJV<br /><br /><p>The Prodigal Son told his father, 'I want it all, now!' To know whether something is good for you or not, you need to understand where the desire for it came from. Loving parents don't give their children things because they cry for them; they reward them for acting responsibly. They know what's age-appropriate. And God is a loving parent. We all know good, well-intentioned people whose talents elevated them. Yet they crashed and burned because of some immature, undisciplined area in their life. Please listen to your heavenly Father and don't leave home until He says you're ready! The Prodigal 'wasted his substance with riotous living.' Note the word 'substance'. Satan is after more than your material possessions: he's after your character, your self-esteem, your staying power, and your life's purpose. Like the Prodigal Son, you can reach a place where you lose your very desire for life itself. It's possible to bask in the accolades of others and think you're going places in life, yet be only a few steps from the pig sty. The Bible says, '...He...joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.' (Luke 15:15 KJV) Note the word 'joined'. To gauge where you are spiritually, look at who you're 'joined' to. The company you keep is like a compass that points you in the direction you're headed. And that compass doesn't lie. But there's hope. When the Prodigal Son returned home, his father was waiting for him with open arms. And your heavenly Father is waiting for you too, so come while you still can.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Cor 11:16-13:14, Lk 1:11-25, Ps 8, Prov 16:8-11 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61895&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...Demas has forsaken me...' 2 Timothy 4:10 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Paul writes one of the saddest verses in Scripture: 'Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world.' The runner has stumbled. The lights have gone out in the life of a believer. Why? (1) Did he resent his minority status as a Christian? It's been said that there wasn't just one, but two Martin Luthers in church history. And they both received the same revelation of justification by faith as the way to salvation. But the first wrote it down and hid it in a monastery wall because he feared the authorities. The second nailed it to the door of Wittenberg All Saints Church and started the Reformation. Christ promised that our message would be a powerful one, but not always a popular one: 'Do not fear, little flock...' (Luke 12:32 NKJV) Wear your minority status as a badge of honour! (2) Was he cut down by the doctrinal sword? We have the message people need to hear, but don't always want to listen to. Even some Christians don't want to hear it. 'Therefore many of His disciples, when they heard this, said, &quot;This is a hard saying; who can understand it?&quot; ...From that time many of His disciples went back and walked with Him no more.' (John 6:60;66 NKJV) You say, 'But if we're too strict with people we'll lose them.' If we're legalistic we will, but if we're Scriptural, we'll build men and women of God, who shine like lights in a dark world. Jesus said, 'You shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free.' (John 8:32 NKJV) Sometimes, before the truth sets people free, it puts them through the wringer! But we must preach it nonetheless.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Judg 12-15, Mk 9:1-13, Ps 97, Prov 13:9-10 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61722&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ 'Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus.' Philippians 2:5 NIV<br /><br /><p>Paul writes: 'You must have the same attitude that...Jesus had. Though He was God, He did not think of equality with God as something to cling to. Instead, He gave up His divine privileges...took the...position of a slave...humbled Himself in obedience to God and died a criminal's death on the cross. Therefore, God elevated Him to the place of highest honour and gave Him the name above all other names...' (Philippians 2:5-9 NLT) Being a celebrity often means we expect others to serve us, but being a Christ follower means we are called to serve others. There's a big difference, isn't there? Christ modelled servanthood before His disciples. On the social totem pole, the lowest servant in the house washed feet. Try to picture God washing the feet of common fishermen, then saying, 'As I have served you, now go and serve one another.' Download that picture the next time you view somebody as a burden, or beneath you or an obstacle to your success. You'll never serve as Christ served if your focus is on building your own image. 'Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands and that He had come from God and was going to God ...began to wash the disciples' feet.' (John 13:3-5 NKJV) Jesus had settled three big issues: (1) He knew Who sent Him. (2) He knew Who sustained Him. (3) He knew Who was going to reward Him. Therefore He was liberated from the fear of people, the fear of failure and the fear of rejection.

<introtext><![CDATA[ 'I desire to do Your will, my God.' Psalm 40:8 NIV<br /><br /><p>If you're upset over giving up your 'rights' and 'privileges' to serve others, consider what Christ gave up to serve you. '...He humbled Himself and became obedient to the point of death...' (Philippians 2:8 NKJV) When you're tempted to remind others of the sacrifices you've made, hear Christ's Words: '...When you have done all things which you are commanded, say, We are unprofitable servants. We have done what was our duty to do.' (Luke 17:10 NKJV) Have you ever observed a dog that graduated from obedience school? It's a source of pleasure to its master because it has learned to respond to a word, sometimes even a look. God says, 'I will guide you with My eye.' (Psalm 32:8 NKJV) God wants to bring you to the place where you don't have to be begged, badgered or browbeaten to serve. One look from Him and you do it without question. As a servant you can't change your master's orders! Dr JR Miller said, 'It is a great deal easier to do that which God gives us to do, no matter how hard it is, than to face the responsibilities of not doing it.' God doesn't want foot-dragging compliance, He wants willing obedience. And when He gets it, He blesses it. 'If you are willing and obedient, you will eat the best from the land.' (Isaiah 1:19 NIV) God's best is reserved for those who say yes. You ask, 'How will I know when I arrive at that place?' Because you'll be able to say, 'I desire to do Your will, O my God.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...Take heart...l have overcome the world.' John 16:33 NLT<br /><br /><p>On 3 May, 1943, air raid sirens sounded over London. People raced toward Bethnal Green Underground station, where more than 500 people had already taken refuge. In the next ten minutes, 1500 more would join them. A woman carrying a baby lost her footing on one of the 19 steps leading down from the street. Like dominoes, people started falling on top of one another. In the end, 173 people died. Bombs didn't kill them, fear did! Today there's a stampede of fear around us and, if you're not careful, you'll get caught up in it. It's ok to recognise danger, but God doesn't want you to be overwhelmed by it. So you need to monitor what you listen to, think and say. The disciples needed a rock to stand on in the coming storm. Jesus had just told them how bad things were going to get in the world and the extent to which they would suffer. He announced He was leaving and told them He would send the Holy Spirit to be with them. John chapter 16 ends with these words: 'I have told you all this so that you may have peace in Me. Here on earth you will have many trials and sorrows. But take heart, because I have overcome the world.' No matter what the situation, Jesus is on top of it. No matter what trial you face, Jesus will bring you through it. Though surrounded by fear and the fearful, you will have His peace. And that stabilising peace will fortify you and cause others to turn to you for answers.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Gal 5:23, Is 40:9-11, Is 42:1-4, Ps 18:31-35 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61704&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[ '...To him who knows to do good and does not do it...it is sin.' James 4:17 NKJV<br /><br /><p>We tend to focus on sins of commission - the wrong we do. But what about sins of omission - the good we fail to do? In Christ's parables, when someone was condemned, it was often over a sin of omission. A man was put out of a wedding because he had no wedding garment (Matthew 22:12). Five virgins were excluded from the wedding party because they'd no oil in their lamps (Matthew 25:3-11). A servant who buried his talent in the ground instead of using it, forfeited it (Matthew 25:25-28). A rich man who failed to care for his neighbour was condemned for it (Luke 16:19-24). A barren fig tree that failed to produce fruit was cursed and died (Mark 11:20-24). You say, 'But I'm interested in a deeper spiritual life.' Well, the deepest spiritual life is one spent doing good to others! And it's the basis on which you'll be judged and rewarded. 'Then the King will...say... I was hungry, and you didn't feed me. I was thirsty, and you didn't give me a drink. I was a stranger, and you didn't invite me into your home. I was naked, and you didn't give me clothing. I was sick and in prison, and you didn't visit me. Then they will reply, &quot;Lord, when did we ever see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and not help you?&quot; And He will answer, &quot;I tell you the truth, when you refused to help the least of these my brothers and sisters, you were refusing to help me.&quot;' (Matthew 25:41-45 NLT) So when you've a chance to do good - do it!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Judg 1-3, Mk 7:24-37, Ps 88:1-9a, Prov 13:1-3 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61706&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[ 'It will produce thorns...for you.' Genesis 3:18 NIV<br /><br /><p>In Scripture there are three thorns that paint a picture of redemption. Let's look at two of them today and see what we can learn. (1) <em>thorn-cursed creation</em>. When Adam and Eve sinned, God said, 'Cursed is the ground because of you... It will produce thorns... By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground.' (Genesis 3:17-19 NIV) Everything changed for us in that moment. Roses began to grow thorns, fellowship with God was broken - and man, who was born to live forever, began to die. It was tragic, but God had a solution. (2) <em>A thorn-crowned Saviour</em>. 'When they had twisted a crown of thorns, they put it on His head...' (Matthew 27:29 NKJV) The curse that fell in a garden was lifted in a garden! When God drove Adam and Eve out of the Garden of Eden, He placed an angel with a flaming sword at the gate to prevent them from ever re-entering it. But at the cross Christ, the last Adam, was cut down outside the gates to become our Saviour and substitute, and secure our salvation. Now we can re-enter God's presence. What did Adam lose? Fellowship with God, immortality and sinless perfection. At the cross Christ reclaimed and restored all these to us. 'Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.' (2 Corinthians 5:17 NKJV) Notice the words, 'in Christ' - keep them close to your heart each day this month. Rejoice! God loves and accepts you 'in Christ'.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezek 34-36, Mk 14:27-42, Ps 80:12-19, Prov 15:15-17 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61852&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '[He] will be proved right in what [He] says.' Romans 3:4 NLT<br /><br /><p>Paul writes, 'What's the advantage of being a Jew?...Yes, there are great benefits! First of all, the Jews were entrusted with the whole revelation of God. True, some of them were unfaithful; but just because they were unfaithful, does that mean God will be unfaithful? Of course not!...[He] will be proved right in what [He] says.' (Romans 3:1-3 NLT) God has spoken specific things concerning you. Those things are His  for your life. You must believe them, carry them within you and speak them over your life. Don't be held back by the notion that everybody has to accept what God has said about you. Your vision should be independent of outside support. That's a difficult concept to grasp, especially in a democracy, where others vote and the majority rules. God's Kingdom is a theocracy: only one voice and one vote counts - His! Refuse to put your vision on hold, waiting for everybody to come into agreement with you. Not only do they not have to support you, they don't even have to believe what God has told you! You can't afford to wait for them to get comfortable with your vision before you pursue it. When people misunderstand you or refuse to help you, you can still get there without them. God is a covenant-making, covenant-keeping God and what He has spoken over your life will surely come to pass. If you doubt that, read this: '...My Word...will not return to Me empty, but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it.' (Isaiah 55:11 NIV) That's all the validation you need!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...I am watching to see that My Word is fulfilled.' Jeremiah 1:12 NIV<br /><br /><p>Don't waste your life trying to do things that God has neither called nor equipped you to do. Your parents may think you'd make a wonderful doctor or lawyer, but what does God think? What has He said about you? God told Jeremiah, '...I am watching to see that My Word is fulfilled.' If God said it - He will back it up. If He didn't - you're on your own! Too many people waste their lives trying to do things that God never called and equipped them to do. Identify the source of your vision! Look deep within yourself; who are you trying to impress? Are you trying to prove to your ex-husband or wife that you can make it successfully without them? Or show your parents that you're as talented as your brother or sister? Or demonstrate to the world how you overcame your roots and pulled yourself up by your bootstraps? Your vision cannot be born out of unresolved issues; that just breeds a need for control and recognition and dooms you to failure. What's more, if your vision is from God, you can't afford to be impatient like Abraham and try to accomplish it in your own strength and ingenuity. God's promises can never be fulfilled through fleshly effort. If only Abraham had waited, he could have avoided a lot of heartache with Hagar and Ishmael. The Bible says, 'The blessing of the Lord makes one rich, and He adds no sorrow with it.' (Proverbs 10:22 NKJV) No matter how long it takes, seek God's will, wait on His timing, prepare yourself thoroughly and move only when He says go!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Amos 1:1-5:17, Mk 10:35-52, Ps 82, Prov 14:5-8 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61736&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...In all things at all times, having all that you need...' 2 Corinthians 9:8 NIV<br /><br /><p>When God tells you to give of your finances in order to fulfil someone else's vision, you must realise: (1) He's testing your faith and your willingness to obey in difficult circumstances. When Elijah the prophet asked a widow to share her last meal with him, the timing seemed strange. There was a famine in the land and people were dying. Who would have blamed her for saying 'no'? But by putting God's interests before her own, she connected herself to a divine, unending source of supply. The Bible says: 'Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly and whoever sows generously will also reap generously ...God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that in all things at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work.' (2 Corinthians 9:6-8 NIV) (2) He's giving you an opportunity to sow into another's life and reap in your own. We love to quote, 'My God will meet all your needs...' (Philippians 4:19 NIV), but do you remember who this promise was made to? It was written to those who supported Paul's ministry. 'When I set out from Macedonia, not one church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving, except you only; for even when I was in Thessalonica, you sent me aid again and again, when I was in need.' (Philippians 4:15-16 NIV) Then Paul added these words: 'My God will meet all your needs according to His glorious riches in Christ Jesus.' When you give, you invest in an account you can draw on when you have a need yourself.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...He did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise...' Romans 4:20 NIV<br /><br /><p>If your vision is simply to be a great parent, that doesn't mean your faith is inadequate. It just means you understand your calling. All Moses' mother did was give birth - but what a baby! God protected her son when she couldn't do a thing to help him. Then He arranged to have him raised in Pharaoh's royal courts. And when you discover God's purpose for your life, He will provide for you, too! Some days your vision won't look like it's coming together. As a child, Joseph dreamed of being a great leader, but before he could get to the palace, he had to go through the prison. Pastor James Petrow says, 'You can't build a foundation in a storm, so God will prepare you in advance.' Sometimes your vision will seem to die before it springs to life. That happened to Abraham. 'Against all hope, Abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many nations... he faced the fact that his body was as good as dead - since he was about a hundred years old - and that Sarah's womb was also dead. Yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God, being fully persuaded that God had power to do what He had promised.' (Romans 4:18-21 NIV) Paul wrote, 'We are fools for Christ...' (1 Corinthians 4:10 NIV) God uses radical people who don't care how they look: people who've survived difficult pasts, defied the odds, held onto their vision, and declared, 'My God is able!' And you can be one of those people!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezek 1-4, Mk 11:12-26, Ps 121, Prov 14:13-16 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61828&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ 'You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power.' Revelation 4:11 NJKV<br /><br /><p>In the book of Revelation, Christ stands knocking on the door of the last of the seven churches, asking them to let Him in. Amazing! Did the people inside not miss Him? Here's a frightening thought: it's possible to build a large institution, call it a church, and yet for Jesus to be marginalised in its emphasis and activities. The measure of a ministry is how it treats Christ. Even in emphasising the importance of Spirit-filled living, we can produce believers who are Spirit-filled but not Jesus-thrilled! We can reduce Christianity to principles that work as effectively in the secular marketplace as they do in the church. John the Revelator saw Christ sitting upon a throne. Next he heard the voices of a multitude singing, '...Worthy is the Lamb who was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom, and strength and honour and glory and blessing!' (Revelation 5:12 NKJV) And it was a mixed multitude. 'Every creature which is in Heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, I heard saying: &quot;Blessing and honour and glory and power be to Him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb, forever and ever!&quot;' (Revelation 5:13 NKJV) London once had two great preachers. When a lady went to hear the first, Dr Joseph Parker, she left saying, 'What a preacher!' When she went to hear the second, Charles Spurgeon, she left saying 'What a Christ!' Do you love the Lord supremely? Is His name written on your heart?</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezek 5-9, Mk 11:27-33, Ps 4, Prov 14:17-20 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61829&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ 'Let us hold tightly without wavering to the hope...' Hebrews 10:23 NLT<br /><br /><p>Some of the people around you today are living without hope. Look at them; they smile, but their eyes are dead. They talk, but the music has left their voice. They're like mannequins: all dressed up and going nowhere because they feel hopeless. But as a follower of Christ, you don't have to live that way. 'Let us hold tightly without wavering to the hope we affirm, for God can be trusted to keep His promise.' Our hope isn't luck, like winning the lottery. No, it's confidence that God will do what He said. No one knew the truth of this better than David. He had every reason to lose hope. After Samuel anointed him to be Israel's next king, he had to wait for seven years while a paranoid ruler occupied the throne. He had to flee for his life and hide in caves, surrounded by enemies. He saw Israel devastated, his friends killed and his family taken captive. But he never wavered or threw in the towel. Faced with circumstances that would wipe many of us out, he sang, '...My hope is in You.' (Psalm 39:7 NKJV) '...Weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning.' (Psalm 30:5 NKJV) In other words, 'It's going to get better!' You can't lose with an attitude like that. David became king because he never lost confidence in the promises of God. They kept him focused; they kept him on top of the circumstances; they kept him going! What has God promised you? Stand on His Word and declare, 'If God promised it, I believe it, and that settles it!'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...If they keep quiet, the stones will cry out.' Luke 19:40 NIV<br /><br /><p>When scientists analyse the 'matter' that comprises our universe, the movement of molecules can be translated into music. When the Pharisees tried to silence those who were praising the Lord, perhaps that's why Jesus said, 'If they keep quiet, the stones will cry out.' The Bible speaks of trees clapping their hands in praise and oceans and the mountains exalting God. All of creation is designed to praise Him. And when you don't, there's no connection with God and, as a result, an emptiness forms within you that nothing else can fill. David said, 'Let my prayer be set before You as incense, the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.' (Psalm 141:2 NKJV) Here the word 'prayer' in Hebrew means 'songs of praise' and the Bible uses it no less than 70 times in this context. So start singing praise to God! The Ark of the Covenant represented three things: victory, guidance and God's presence. No wonder Israel felt lost without it. But observe how they brought it back from the camp of their Philistine foes: 'Israel played before God with all their might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels...' (1 Chronicles 13:8 KJV) Notice the phrase, 'with all their might'. Away with pale, pathetic praise! Put your heart and soul into it! Worship brings intimacy with God. When it came to rebuilding Jerusalem, the singers were as vital to the success of the operation as the soldiers and builders. In fact, their role was so important they were paid to do it (Nehemiah 11:23-24 KJV). So start praising God!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...His praise will always be on my lips.' Psalm 34:1 NIV<br /><br /><p>The book of Job speaks about the rain cycle: '...He draws up drops of water which distil as rain from the mist, which the clouds drop down and pour abundantly on man. Indeed, can anyone understand the spreading of cloud, the thunder from His canopy?' (Job 36:27-29 NKJV) There's a spiritual parallel in this Scripture that works like this: as our vapours of praise go up to God, the of His presence form and the rains of His blessing begin to fall on us. Sometimes we leave church saying, 'That was a dry service.' The problem isn't dry services; it's dry servants! In praise you are the initiator and God is the responder. '...They were joined by 120 priests who were playing trumpets. The trumpeters and singers performed together in unison to praise...the Lord... they raised their voices... At that moment a thick cloud filled the Temple of the Lord. The priests could not continue their service because of the cloud, for the glorious presence of the Lord filled the Temple of God.' (2 Chronicles 5:12-14 NLT) Wouldn't you love to have been in church for that service! There's a story about a wealthy man who dropped a dollar into the offering plate at church, then complained all the way home that he didn't get anything out of the service. His son, who observed the whole thing, said, 'I suppose that just proves if you don't put much into it, you don't get much out of it.' Here's a key to blessing you need to think about: worship isn't just for God's benefit, it's also for yours!</p><br /><br />SoulFood Pentecost: Lev 23:15-22, Acts 2:1-21   <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61830&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...Is anything too hard for Me?' Jeremiah 32:27 NIV<br /><br /><p>The words '<em>Our Father</em>' remind us of God's unconditional love. Ever looked into the eyes of a suffering child and wanted to make them well, but found you lacked the power? '<em>...who art in Heaven</em>' reminds us of God's unlimited power to do what we can't. 'I am...the God of all mankind. Is anything too hard for Me?' The answer in the Hebrew language comes back, 'No, absolutely nothing; everything with You will be extraordinary.' You can have total confidence that what God's love prompts Him to do, His power enables Him to do. '<em>Hallowed be Thy name</em>' distinguishes His name and character from all others. 'Hallowed' in Greek indicates He's unlike others, different, special, the only One. In an age where respect for authority is disappearing, because it challenges our self-importance, Jesus teaches us to pray, 'Heavenly Father, enable us to give You the place Your Holy Name and character deserve.' '<em>Thy kingdom come</em>.' Jesus came preaching God's Kingdom; it was the heart of His gospel. The kingdom incorporating Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and so on was past. The present Kingdom includes all who acknowledge Jesus as Lord. And the future Kingdom will encompass the whole earth at Christ's return. Each time you submit to God's will, His Kingdom is brought into operation. As a believer, you are in His Kingdom, and His power is available to you. '<em>Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven</em>.' (Matthew 6:10 KJV) In Heaven God's will is never questioned. Nor should it be in your life. And Jesus instructs us to pray and believe that what happens in Heaven will also happen through you here on earth.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Deut 32:29-34:12, Mk 6:30-44, Ps 62, Prov 12:18-19 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61700&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ 'Give us each day our daily bread.' Luke 11:3 NRS<br /><br /><p>The second part of the Lord's Prayer addresses our everyday concerns: '<em>Give us each day our daily bread</em>.' Your Father is willing to meet your physical and financial needs. The word Jesus used here meant literal 'food'. God is more concerned about the necessities of your everyday life than you are. He multiplied food for five thousand hungry people. '...He...healed all who were sick.' (Matthew 8:16 NKJV) And He wants to meet your needs, too. '...Do not worry, saying, &quot;What shall we eat?&quot; or &quot;What shall we drink?&quot; or &quot;What shall we wear?&quot;' (Matthew 6:31 NIV) The 'bread man' delivers fresh bread daily! So trust Him for today's needs, and tomorrow morning get up and do the same. '<em>...Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors</em>.' (Matthew 6:12 NKJV) The moment you enter God's presence, you become aware of your sin. And Satan will try to bring condemnation on you. How does he do it? By making you feel unwelcome and uneasy in God's presence. But Satan is a liar. 'There is...no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus...' (Romans 8:1 NKJV) God's Spirit brings your sins to light not to condemn you, but to motivate you to confess them and receive His forgiveness. God's Word identifies several categories of sin that we need to recognise. There's falling short of what's required; the deliberate violation of a specific rule; unintentional and often passionately motivated slips; deliberate disobedience and rebellion; failure to fulfil your indebtedness; the sin of omission.

<introtext><![CDATA[ 'O Lord...give me success today.' Genesis 24:12 NIV<br /><br /><p>We seldom know ahead of time the full significance of what we do or don't do in our work. The Bible simply says, 'Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might.' (Ecclesiastes 9:10 NIV) Judaism, Christianity and Islam all trace their roots to Abraham - who was a farmer. Abraham was '...now old and well advanced in years.' (Genesis 24:1 NIV) So he realised the time had come to find a wife for his son Isaac. Since there were no internet dating services in those days, he assigned the task to his 'chief servant' Eliezer. The servant set out with a caravan of ten camels to the region Abraham had directed him. Finding a wife for the son of your boss was an important assignment that required considerable thought. Certainly, it isn't a job you'd want to fail. So the servant began his work with a prayer: 'O Lord, God of my master Abraham, give me success today.' Do you ever pray and ask God to make your work successful? People sometimes wonder if it's ok to pray for your work to be successful. Of course! Now, if 'Success' is becoming your God, you will have to find a way to dethrone it. But generally speaking, if you can't pray for the success of what you're doing, you should start doing something else! Any good parent wants their child to succeed. Any wise employer wants their workers to succeed, because when they succeed the company succeeds. Here's what God told His people: 'Carefully follow the terms of this covenant, so that you may prosper in everything you do.' (Deuteronomy 29:9 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[ 'Drink, and I'll water your camels too.' Genesis 24:46 NIV<br /><br /><p>When Abraham's servant arrived in the town of Nahor, a young woman named Rebekah offered to give him a drink of water. When he had finished drinking, Rebekah said, 'I'll water your camels, too.' We are told that she 'quickly' emptied her jar into the trough and ran back to the well. It all sounds fairly unremarkable, until you read between the lines: 4 litres of water weighs 4 kg. A thirsty camel can drink up to 120 litres of water and there were ten camels. Do the maths. Rebekah is drawing 1200 litres - over a tonne! - of water for a stranger. She does all that could be reasonably expected of her - and then some. This was a pivotal moment in her life. Because of her act of service, Rebekah became the wife of Isaac and went on to the adventure of a lifetime, becoming part of sacred history. To this day, her name is remembered and revered by people of faith. Rebekah did not know all that was at stake that day. She did not offer to draw 1200 litres of water because she knew what the reward could be. It was simply an expression of her heart. Rebekah proved the truth of Scripture: 'Lazy people want much but get little, but those who work hard will prosper.' (Proverbs 13:4 NLT) Where did we get the idea that it is wrong to give, expecting a return, or serve, expecting a reward? Certainly not from the Bible! Some of our rewards will come in this lifetime, others in the next one. But, 'You know that the Lord  reward everyone for whatever good he does.' (Ephesians 6:8 NIV)</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[ 'I will make you fishers of men.' Matthew 4:19 NKJV<br /><br /><p>We read, 'Jesus...saw...Simon...and Andrew...casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen. Then He said to them, &quot;Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men!&quot;' (Matthew 4:18-19 NKJV) To follow Christ you must learn how to fish for men and women and then do it! Max Lucado grew up fishing. He said: 'We set out...dreaming of...sun. But...next morning the sky was grey, the lake a mountain of white-topped waves...there was no way we could fish...Next day...it was ice! We tried to be cheerful...but I began to notice...Mark had a few personality flaws...Dad was touchy...Nothing like being cooped up with someone to see his real nature! When we awoke the next morning to sleet...we were flat-out grumpy...Mark became even more of a jerk...Dad couldn't do anything right, and when he announced we were going home, nobody objected... When energy intended for outside is used inside...instead of casting nets, we cast stones. Instead of helping hands, we point accusing fingers. Instead of being fishers of the lost, we become critics of the saved. Rather than helping the hurting, we hurt the helpers. The result? Split churches. Poor testimonies. Broken hearts. Legalistic wars. But when those who are called to fish, fish - they flourish...Nothing unites soldiers like a common task. Leave them inside and they'll invent things to complain about. The bunks will be too hard, food too cold, leadership too tough. Place those same soldiers in the trench and let them duck a few bullets and a boring barracks will seem like a haven... The next time outside challenges tempt you to stay inside... get out! When those who are called to fish don't fish, they fight!'</p><br /><br />SoulFood: 2 Cor 1-4, Mk 15:33-47, Ps 139:13-24, Prov 15:31-33 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61881&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[ 'It will produce thorns...for you.' Genesis 3:18 NIV<br /><br /><p>Heaven's answer to a thorn-cursed creation was a thorn-crowned Saviour. But notice something important. God didn't remove the thorns; He decided to use them for His redemptive purposes. That's why we each get (3) <em>A custom-designed thorn</em>. Here's how Paul describes his thorn: '...Lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me... Concerning this thing I pleaded the Lord three times that it might depart from me. And He said to me, &quot;My grace is sufficient for you: for My strength is made perfect in weakness.&quot; Therefore most gladly will I boast in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong.' (2 Corinthians 12:7-10 NKJV) The word 'buffet' means 'to render blow, after blow, after blow'. Does that describe your life at the moment? If Paul's experience is anything to go by, the Christian life is a series of blessings and buffetings. And the God Who promises the first, permits the second. Why? To make sure we live our lives dependent on Him. Look what God used to make sure Paul relied totally on Him: 'infirmities, reproaches, necessities, persecutions, distresses.' Where do you find strength to handle such a catalogue of complaints? From God - and God alone. You say, 'I want to be more fruitful in the service of the Lord.' That happens when the thorny situations in life drive us closer to God!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezek 37:1-40:9, Mk 14:43-52, Ps 73:1-16, Prov 15:18-21 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61877&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[ 'They...compare themselves with themselves.' 2 Corinthians 10:12 NIV<br /><br /><p>One definition of success is: 'Gaining wealth and fame.' But how much wealth do you need to be successful? How much fame? Should you pick an arbitrary target? Should you compare yourself to others? What if you have decided to devote yourself to raising children of character, or serving your church and your community? Does that mean you are less successful? No. Success is doing the best you can, with what you have, wherever you are in life. The Bible warns, 'When they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they are not wise.' When you play the comparison game you are like the two cows that saw the milk lorry go by with a sign, 'Pasteurised, homogenised, Vitamin A added.' One cow said to the other, 'Makes you feel sort of inadequate, doesn't it?' God will help you to be all that you can be, but He will never help you to be someone else. When you focus your attention on who you aren't, by comparing yourself with someone else, you lose sight of who you need to become. Ever heard of the twenty/forty/sixty rule? When you're twenty, you worry about what everybody's thinking about you. When you're forty, you realize it doesn't really matter what they think about you. When you're sixty, it dawns on you most of them weren't thinking about you at all! Paul's life changed dramatically with one question: 'Lord, what do You want me to do?' (Acts 9:6 NKJV) Only when you ask that question, will you discover who you and what God's called you to be.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezek 40:10-42:20, Mk 14:53-72, Ps 73:17-28, Prov 15:22-24 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61878&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ 'It is sin to know what you ought to do and then not do it.' James 4:17 NLT<br /><br /><p>Brian Tracy says: 'There are so many good things you can do, that your ability to decide may be the critical determinant of what you accomplish. If you're like most people, you're overwhelmed with too much to do and too little time. Mark Twain once joked that if first thing every morning you eat a frog, you'll go through the rest of the day knowing that's the worst that can happen! Your 'frog' is the most important task...the one you're likely to procrastinate on...the one that can have the greatest positive impact...Treat it as a personal challenge...resist the temptation to start with the easier task. If you 'eat' it first, it'll give you energy and momentum for the rest. Success is determined by the habits you develop. Setting priorities, overcoming procrastination and getting on with the most important task is a mental and physical skill, learnable through practice and repetition until it becomes a permanent part of your behaviour. Once it becomes a habit, it's automatic and easy to do. When you complete a task of any size or importance, you get a surge of energy. It triggers the release of endorphins that give you a natural high. The rush that follows makes you feel more positive, personable, creative and confident.' What you put off until tomorrow, you'll put off again tomorrow. Plus, it's 'sin to know what you ought to do and...not do it.' Success requires decision, discipline and detemination. Make the decision, discipline yourself until it becomes automatic and stay determined until it becomes part of who you are.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezek 43-45, Mk 15:1-15, Ps 139:1-6, Prov 15:25-27 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61879&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ 'Listen to advice...and...you will be wise...' Proverbs 19:20 NIV<br /><br /><p>You may be good at what you do. Indeed, you may be better than most, but without the help of others you will never be as good as you could be. You will never reach your highest potential without a good adviser. It's impossible. Why would a world-class tennis player need a coach, especially one who is not as good on the court as he or she is? André Agassi answered the question this way: 'Tennis requires subtle adjustments crucial to winning and my coach, Gill, is the best at making them. The older I get, the more valuable he becomes.' Why is that? Because age and don't necessarily make you better; often they just deepen the rut you're in. In life, as in sports, you never reach the point where you don't need good input. Yet many of us operate under the misguided assumption that because we lead, we don't need to be led. We make the mistake of measuring ourselves against others instead of our own God-given potential and in the end we never become what we could have been. Self-evaluation is important, but the evaluation of others is crucial. A good coach measures your performance against your strengths, not somebody else's. That's because he or she knows what you're capable of and they will push you to your limit. And by the way, good coaches are constantly on the scene observing, not back at the office waiting for a report. That's because they are personally invested in your success; a win for you is a win for them. Ruth needed Naomi and Timothy needed Paul. Who advises you?</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezek 46-48, Mk 15:16-32, Ps 139:7-12, Prov 15:28-30 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61880&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...I do not seek My own will, but the will of the Father.' John 5:30 NKJV<br /><br /><p>In His dealings with people, the Bible says of Christ: 'Having loved His own...He loved them unto the end.' (John 13:1 KJV) And when it came to His dealings with God, He could say, 'I do not seek My own will but the will of the Father who sent Me.' (John 5:30 NKJV) Can God count on you? Can others? When you make a commitment, do you keep it? Do you quit on a whim, or break your word because you get a better offer? 'In Damascus there was a disciple named Ananias. The Lord called him in a vision, &quot;Ananias!&quot; &quot;Yes, Lord,&quot; he answered.' (Acts 9:10 NIV) God knew where to find Ananias. Does He know where to find you? Pastor Eric Hulstrand was preaching one Sunday when an elderly woman, Mary, fainted and struck her head on the end of the pew. They called for an ambulance and, as they put her on the stretcher, she regained consciousness and motioned for her daughter to come near. Everyone thought she was summoning her strength to convey what would be her final words. Her daughter leaned over until her ear was at Mary's mouth. 'My offering is in my purse,' she whispered. God's work shouldn't go lacking because you've gone on holiday and taken your tithes and offerings with you. 'Honour the Lord with your wealth and with the best part of everything you produce.' (Proverbs 3:9 NLT) Your faithfulness shouldn't be contingent upon economic conditions, but upon your commitment to Christ. Remember the US Marine Corps motto, '<em>Semper Fidelis</em>', the Latin for '<em>Always Faithful</em>'.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezek 22-23, Mk 13:12-23, Ps 132:1-10, Prov 15:1-4 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61846&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...A hot-tempered person commits all kinds of sin.' Proverbs 29:22 NLT<br /><br /><p>Righteous indignation is the capacity to get aroused when it matters. When you see people mistreated and don't feel concerned, you're either in denial or lacking compassion. God designed anger to move us to action. The Bible says, '...God is angry with the wicked every day' (Psalm 7:11 NKJV); it motivates His actions against man's wickedness. When Jesus saw His Father's house being desecrated His anger drove Him to make a whip, overthrow the money tables and chase out the loan sharks. His '...passion for God's house [consumed Him].' (John 2:17 NLT) He couldn't remain passive or be part of compromise. The world needs people who'll take action when the weak and vulnerable are 'used and abused'. Hot temper, however, isn't the fruit of godly motivation. It's driven by our lower nature. Like Balaam who got angry when he was challenged by the truth, our pride gets hurt (Numbers 22:29). Or like Cain, who was jealous because his brother's gift was accepted and his wasn't, we get resentful when someone else seems blessed more than us (Genesis 4:3-7). Like Haman, who was enraged that Mordecai wouldn't bow before him, we selfishly desire to have our way (Esther 3:1-6). Like King Saul, who was envious over David's popularity, we get jealous when someone else has accomplished more than us (1 Samuel 18:8). Like King Ahab, who was confronted with the truth he'd rather not hear, we refuse to face our sinful ways and failures (1 Kings 22:15-27). The Bible cautions us: 'If you are angry, be sure it is not a sinful anger...don't give the devil that sort of foothold.' (Ephesians 4:26-27 PHPS)</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezek 24:1-27:24, Mk 13:24-37, Ps 132:11-18, Prov 15:5-7 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61847&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ 'Saul looked at David with suspicion from that day on.' 1 Samuel 18:9 NAS<br /><br /><p>A hot temper: (1) <em>drives a wedge between you and your loved ones</em>. Esau resented his brother Jacob so much that he wanted him dead. When his mother Rebekah heard this, she sent Jacob away to live in Haran (Genesis 27:41-43). As a result, the family was separated and they suffered. Angry people intimidate others and rob them of their sense of security and peace of mind. Psychologists say anger is a leading cause of divorce, child abuse and addiction. What a terrible price to pay! (2) <em>undermines a life that pleases God</em>. 'Understand this...[be] slow to get angry. Human anger does not produce the righteousness God desires.' (James 1:19-20 NLT) Your anger isn't just 'your own business', it's God's business, too, because it hinders your ability to live the life He intended. You can't be right with God until you are right with others. (3) <em>blinds you to reality</em>. Looking through the lens of misguided anger, you see only what you choose to see. It causes you to focus on options like revenge and retribution. Saul saw David as a threat, someone who planned to take his kingdom and throne. So he 'looked at David with suspicion from that day on.' His anger made him see David as someone who deserved to die because he was God's choice to succeed him as Israel's next king. Sadly, it also kept him from seeing that David was actually his best friend. Don't let that happen to you.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezek 27:25-30:26, Mk 14:1-11, Ps 143, Prov 15:8-10 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61848&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...Be...slow to speak and slow to become angry.' James 1:19 NIV<br /><br /><p>Here's how to control your anger: (1) <em>think before you react</em>. Our reactions are often based more on feelings than facts. Someone says or does something and we suddenly feel angry and assume they 'made' us feel that way. No, you made yourself angry by telling yourself, 'Who do they think they are?' 'I don't have to take that.' 'I'll show them who's in charge!' Your self-talk triggered your anger. 'Be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to become angry.' To break anger's negative cycle, practise saying to yourself, 'Stop!' Then don't react until you ask the person to clarify their words or actions. Say, 'I want to understand. Please explain what you meant by...' By stopping and listening to understand, you interrupt your anger build-up and gain self-control. (2) <em>don't 'speak your mind' when you're angry</em>. An old Irish poem says, 'We're constantly hearing O'Flannagan say, &quot;I gave him a piece of my mind.&quot; And it isn't surprising with so much gone, that so little remains behind!' The Bible says, '...The tongue is a small thing, but what enormous damage it can do.' (James 3:5 TLB) You won't find a receptive audience when you're enraged; people will just resist or discount your accusations and get angry in response. 'A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.' (Proverbs 15:1 NIV) Take a breather and try a gentle response when you're calm. (3) <em>avoid angry people</em>. Like a bad virus, they infect you, especially if you have a problem with anger. 'Do not make friends with a hot-tempered man, do not associate with one easily angered, or you may learn his ways...' (Proverbs 22:24-25 NIV)</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Ezek 31-33, Mk 14:12-26, Ps 80:1-11, Prov 15:11-14 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61849&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...He rose up and went into the city.' Acts 14:20 NKJV<br /><br /><p>If you're going through a hard time, read these words: 'Then Jews...came there; and having persuaded the multitudes, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing him to be dead. However, when the disciples gathered around him, he rose up and went into the city.' (Acts 14:19-20 NKJV) Notice two phrases: 'supposing him to be dead' and 'he rose up.' Paul was stoned but not silenced; beaten but not defeated. 'We are hard-pressed on every side, yet not crushed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed.' (2 Corinthians 4:8-9 NKJV) Imagine Satan standing over Paul like a referee standing over a boxer who's on the canvas. On the count of nine Paul gets up and says, 'I may be down, but I'm not out!' He was a defiant optimist, a self-encourager who knew how to lift himself and those around him. One day in the heat of battle, Lord Nelson's enemies flashed him a signal to surrender. Picking up his telescope and placing it to his blind eye, he announced, 'I can't see any sign of surrender!' During World War II, Churchill warned the French that, if necessary, Britain would fight on alone. Their generals sent him a telegram saying, 'In three weeks, England will have her neck wrung like a chicken.' Undeterred, Churchill took to the airwaves and announced, 'We shall never, never surrender!' He lifted Britain up by its bootstraps! After the war, Churchill addressed the Canadian Parliament. Wearing his hallmark, bulldog expression and waving the telegram, he announced, 'Huh! Some chicken, and some neck!' The word for you today is - get back up, God is on your side.</p>

<br /><br />http://www.rhema.co.nz/images/audio/twft/2014/05/UK05092014.mp3<br /><br /><br />
<p>Paul prayed for the believers at Ephesus that they might know what God called them to do and understand the 'riches' He had invested in them. Think about this: (1) God knows what He's invested in you. He doesn't redeem you one day and take you to Heaven the next. He calls and equips you to fulfil a certain purpose in this world. Christ taught that some of us are five-talent people, some are two-talent people and some are one-talent people (Matthew 25:15). That's why it's a mistake to draw comparisons. It's not what you have that determines your reward, but what you do with what you have. It's when you bury your talent because you're afraid to risk and fail, that you get into trouble with God. (2) God protects what He's invested in you. Do we sometimes disobey God? Yes. Does He discipline us? Yes. And your response to Him can either lengthen or shorten your season of discipline. But does God abandon us? Never! '...God's gifts and his call can never be withdrawn.' (Romans 11:29 NLT) (3) God expects a return on what He's invested in you. When you get to the end of your life, what will you have to show for it? God gave you time, talent, and treasure. Are you using them selfishly or are you using them to serve Him and bless others? '...We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive...according to what he has done, whether good or bad.' (2 Corinthians 5:10 NKJV) The songwriter put it this way: 'Only one life, 'twill soon be past. Only what's done for Christ will last.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[ 'Keep your tongue from evil...' Psalm 34:13 NIV<br /><br /><p>Did you hear about the three women who decided to confess their weaknesses to each other? The first confessed to drinking too much. The second confessed to being jealous of a friend's good looks. The third said nothing, so the other two pressed her and asked, 'Ok, what's your weakness?' Finally she answered, 'It's gossip, and I can't wait to get out of here and talk about you two!' Now let's get serious. The Bible has strong words when it comes to the subject of gossip: 'He who guards his lips guards his life, but he who speaks rashly will come to ruin.' (Proverbs 13:3 NIV) 'If anyone considers himself religious and yet does not keep a tight rein on his tongue, he deceives himself and his religion is worthless.' (James 1:26 NIV) 'Whoever would love life and see good days must keep his tongue from evil.' (1 Peter 3:10 NIV) Gossip is like mud thrown against a wall - it may not stick, but it leaves a dirty mark. And that mark can last a lifetime! So before you take aim, check your target. Ask yourself how much damage you'll inflict and how you'll feel about it afterwards. Solomon said, 'The tongue has the power of life and death and those who love it will eat its fruit.' (Proverbs 18:21 NIV) Did you get that? You will 'eat your words'. You'll reap the harvest you sow, good or bad. Bottom line: if you're looking for faults, look in the mirror. When you work on your own shortcomings, you'll have no time left to gossip about anybody else's.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[ 'Then their eyes were opened and they knew Him...' Luke 24:31 NKJV<br /><br /><p>He was a militant non-believer, who summed up his worldview with a verse from Lucretius: 'Had God designed the world, it would not be a world so frail and faulty as we see.' So Jack turned his attention to academia, excelling in each field he studied. Soon the dons of Oxford took him in as a respected peer and he began to write and teach. Yet, far beneath the surface, his doubts were taking their toll. He described his mental state with words like 'misery and hopelessness'. He said, 'I maintained God did not exist. I was also angry with God for not existing.' Then two friends, also Oxford dons, JRR Tolkien and HVD Dyson, both devout followers of Christ, urged him to do something he'd surprisingly never done: read the Bible. So he did. Jack began to wrestle with the claims Christ made, concluding that He was either deluded, deceptive, or the very One He claimed to be: the Son of God. On the evening of 19 September 1931, Jack and his two friends took a long walk through the Oxford campus. They talked late into the night. And Jack, C S 'Jack' Lewis, would later recall a rush of wind that caused the first leaf to fall - a sudden breeze, which possibly came to symbolise for him the Holy Spirit. Soon after that night, Lewis became a believer. The change revolutionised his world and consequently the worlds of millions of readers. Could it be this simple? Could the chasm between doubt and faith be spanned with Scripture and Christian fellowship? Why don't you come to Christ and find out for yourself?</p>

<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span class=&quot;2dropcap&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext; mso-ansi-language: EN-AU;&quot;>T</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext; mso-ansi-language: EN-AU;&quot;>he Bible says: ‘As Jesus was teaching in a synagogue, He saw a woman who had been …bent double for eighteen years and was unable to stand up straight… He called her over and said, “Dear woman, you are healed”…Then He touched her, and instantly she could stand straight. How she praised God! But the leader in charge of the synagogue was indignant that Jesus had healed her on the Sabbath day.’ (Luke 13:10–14 NLT)</span></p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext; mso-ansi-language: EN-AU;&quot;>Notice three things about this woman: (<span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-ansi-font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext; mso-ansi-language: EN-AU;&quot;>1) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>She had a long–term problem</em>.</span></span> It was a visible condition everyone could see. But many of the people we meet have problems within: situations they’ve wrestled with for years; issues so painful that it causes them to ‘act out’ what’s going on inside them. They need to be handled with care and compassion. (<span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-ansi-font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext; mso-ansi-language: EN-AU;&quot;>2) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>No matter how hard she tried, she couldn’t straighten up</em>.</span></span> She had a burden that nobody but Jesus could lift, and she would never be free until He did so. Can you relate? Are you trying to medicate your pain through tireless work, wrong relationships or mood–altering substances? Have you become so used to your problem that even when you’ve a chance to be delivered, you won’t let it go; it’s like your security blanket? Jesus will set you free if you turn to Him!

The pastor actually condemned Jesus for healing her on the Sabbath. Away with powerless religion that has no answers! Today turn to Jesus, by Whose stripes we are healed, within and without.</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 24-26, Mark 2:23-28, Ps 94:1-11, Pro 11:14-15<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=59271&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span class=&quot;2dropcap&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext; mso-ansi-language: EN-AU;&quot;>J</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext; mso-ansi-language: EN-AU;&quot;>esus said the Holy Spirit is the greatest Teacher of all. Here’s why: (<span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-ansi-font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext; mso-ansi-language: EN-AU;&quot;>1) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Because He will interact with you.</em></span></span> When you are interested enough to ask questions, the learning process has really begun. Your questions don’t bother God if they come from a hungry heart. Jesus said, ‘Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find…’ (Matthew 7:7 NKJV) It’s ok to be inquisitive. God doesn’t want you to be passive and just accept everything that comes into your life. He wants you to question Him so that you can find clarity and direction. (<span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-ansi-font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext; mso-ansi-language: EN-AU;&quot;>2) <em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;>Because He wants to teach you how to live.</em></span></span> That means showing up every day for class, and not just every once in a while. It means listening intently, taking notes, and doing the reading assignments you’re given. It means trusting that the Teacher knows what He’s talking about, and that the knowledge you’re receiving will equip you to go out and succeed in life.</span></p>

Perhaps you’re only interested in passing the test, graduating, and getting out of school. No, passing tests only proves you’ve a good memory, not that you’ve really learned!</span></p>

He wants you to turn to His Word for insight; to find divine solutions to the human problems confronting you day in and day out. He wants you to stand on His Word instead of lying down and saying, ‘I guess this is just the way it’s got to be.’ Your Bible is a road map that will never steer you the wrong way. It’s a sword you can fight with, and win every time. ‘…Meditate in it day and night…do according to all that is written in it. For then you will… have good success.’ (Joshua 1:8 NKJV)</span></p>

In Jesus’ day, disciples not only learned from the teacher’s lectures, but also by observing and experiencing every aspect of the teacher’s life. That’s how Jesus trained His twelve disciples.

That was not because He loved them more, but that He had a particular plan in mind for them. What’s God’s plan for you? That’s what the battle in your life is about. Satan will do all he can to put distance between you and God.

Yet Paul would later reflect that “Christ…forgave us all our sins, having cancelled the written code…that was against us… He took it away, nailing it to the cross. And having disarmed the powers and authorities, He made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.” On one level I think of individuals in our own time who disarmed the powers. Racist sheriffs who imprisoned Martin Luther King Jr… the Soviets who deported Solzhenitsyn… the authorities who imprisoned Nelson Mandela… all thought they were solving a problem. Instead they ended up unmasking their own violence and injustice… When Jesus died, even a gruff Roman soldier was moved to exclaim, “…Surely He was the Son of God.” (Matthew 27:54 NIV) He saw the contrast between his brutish colleagues and their victim Who forgave them in His dying gasp. The pale figure nailed to a crossbeam revealed the ruling powers as false gods who broke their own lofty promises of piety and justice. <span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-ansi-font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext; mso-ansi-language: EN-AU;&quot;>Religion, not irreligion, accused Jesus; the law, not lawlessness, had him executed.</span></span> By their rigged trials…scourging…and violent opposition to Jesus, the political and religious authorities exposed themselves for what they were… Each assault…laid bare their illegitimacy, yet in the end—He won!’</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood Easter Sunday: 1 Cor 15, Matt 28:1-10, Luke 24:1-12<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=59262&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['The Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us...' John 1:14 NIV<br /><br /><p> </p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span class=&quot;2dropcap&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext; mso-ansi-language: EN-AU;&quot;>H</span></span><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext; mso-ansi-language: EN-AU;&quot;>ow hell must have celebrated the day Jesus was crucified! ‘The Word became flesh and dwelt among us…the only begotten of the Father…’ (John 1:14 NKJV) Yet He had just died on a cross. But Satan’s big party ended abruptly!</span></p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext; mso-ansi-language: EN-AU;&quot;>Philip Yancey writes: ‘In the most ironic twist of all history, what Satan meant for evil, God meant for good. Jesus’ death bridged the gap between a perfect God and a fatally–flawed humanity. On Good Friday God defeated sin, routed death, triumphed over Satan, and got His family back… He took the worst deed of history and turned it into the greatest victory. No wonder Jesus commanded that we never forget. Because of the cross we have hope. It’s through the Servant’s wondrous wounds, not His miracles, that we are healed (Isaiah 53:5). And if God can wrest such triumph from the jaws of apparent defeat…what might He do with the apparent failures and hardships of our lives? Nothing—not even the murder of His Son—can end the relationship between God and human beings. In the alchemy [transformation] of redemption, the most villainous crime becomes our healing strength. The fatally–wounded healer came back on Easter, the day that gives us a sneak preview of how all history will look from the vantage point of eternity, when every scar…hurt and disappointment will be seen in a different light. Faith begins where it might have seemed to end. Between the cross and the empty tomb hovers the promise of history: hope for the world, and hope for each of us who lives in it.’</span></p><br /><br />SoulFood: Acts 10-11, Matt 28:11-20, Ps 103:1-12, Pro 10:27-29<br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=59263&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

So I said: “Woe is me, for I am undone! Because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King”…Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a live coal…from the altar. And he touched my mouth with it, and said: “Behold, this has touched your lips; your iniquity is taken away, and your sin purged.” Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying: “Whom shall I send, and who will go for Us?” Then I said, “Here am I. Send me!” And He said, “Go, and tell this people”…’ (Isaiah 6:1–9 NKJV)</span></p>

You’re not the first person to struggle with the idea of waiting, and you won’t be the last. Furthermore, when you get what you’re waiting for now, you’ll begin waiting for something else.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext; mso-ansi-language: EN-AU;&quot;>If there’s one word that defines Christian living, it’s—<span class=&quot;1textitalic&quot;><em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;mso-ansi-font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext; mso-ansi-language: EN-AU;&quot;>waiting</span></em></span>. God said to the prophet Habakkuk, ‘The revelation awaits an appointed time…and will not prove false. Though it linger, wait for it; it will certainly come and will not delay.’ (Habakkuk 2:3 NIV) Why did God say that? Because He was answering the prophet’s question, ‘How long, O Lord, must I call for help, but You do not listen?’ Look at the patriarch Job. Covered in boils and totally bankrupt, he says, ‘If a man dies, shall he live again? All the days of my hard service I will wait, ’til my change comes.’ (Job 14:14 NKJV) Waiting for things to change is not easy. So what should you do while you’re waiting? Pour yourself into the job at hand; otherwise you’ll shortchange your own future. James writes, ‘Be patient…See how the farmer waits for the land to yield its valuable crop, patiently waiting for the autumn and spring rains. You too, be patient and stand firm…’ (James 5:7–8 NIV)</span></p>

If you try to rush God’s purpose and process in your life, you’ll produce something deformed, something that can’t get off the ground and fly. Perhaps you’re thinking, ‘I can’t wait for this to be over.’ That’s understandable. Job couldn’t either. He said, ‘All the days of my hard service I will wait, ’til my change comes.’ But by God’s grace he survived, and ended up with twice as much as he lost.</span></p>
<p class=&quot;4paragraph1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm; line-height: normal;&quot;><span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; color: windowtext; mso-ansi-language: EN-AU;&quot;>So hold on, your change is coming! God won’t give up on you, so don’t give up on Him! There’s a work going on in you right now. Something is dying that has to die, so that something better can be brought to life. Let it happen. Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego told a king, ‘We will not bow down to your gods’ (Daniel 3:18). Don’t bow to temptation, or to manipulation, or to ungodly persuasion. Don’t try to keep up with the Joneses, or surrender to selfish ambition and self–promotion. Don’t bow to the spirit of anxiousness and impatience. Continue to walk by faith and not by sight, knowing that ‘…[God] is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all we are able to ask or think…’ (Ephesians 3:20 KJV)</span></p>

What’s the point? Simply this: sometimes you need to change your location in order to succeed in what God’s called you to do. Look at the life of Elijah. ‘The word of the Lord came to him, saying, “Get away from here and turn eastward, and hide by the Brook Cherith, which flows into the Jordan. And it will be that you shall drink from the brook, and I have commanded the ravens to feed you there.”’ (1 Kings 17:2–4 NKJV) Ravens normally don’t deliver food, they eat it. But when you do what God tells you and go where He sends you, you move from the natural realm to the supernatural one.</span></p>

Indeed, He will go ahead of you and rearrange circumstances to your advantage. He did it for Abraham. ‘By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going.’ (Hebrews 11:8 NIV)</span></p>

The door is locked for the night, and [we] are all in bed. I can’t help you.” But I tell you this—though he won’t do it for friendship’s sake, if you keep knocking long enough, he will get up and give you whatever you need because of your shameless persistence.’ (Luke 11:5–8 NLT) Why will God answer your prayer? To protect His reputation as One who makes covenants and keeps them. (2) ‘There was a judge in a certain city… A widow of that city came to him repeatedly, saying, “Give me justice”…The judge ignored her for a while, but finally he said… “I don’t fear God or care about people, but this woman is driving me crazy. I’m going to see that she gets justice, because she is wearing me out with her constant requests!” Then the Lord said, “Learn a lesson from this unjust judge. Even he rendered a just decision in the end. So don’t you think God will surely give justice to His chosen people who cry out to Him day and night? Will He keep putting them off? I tell you, He will grant justice to them quickly!”…’ (Luke 18:2–8 NLT)</span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA[ 'The high priest then asked Jesus about His disciples and His doctrine.' John 18:19 NKJV<br /><br /><p>If Jesus 'can be touched with the feelings of our infirmities,' (Hebrews 4:15 KJV) can He be embarrassed by our actions? How embarrassing when Mary and Joseph interrupted Him as a 12-year-old boy, sitting in the temple confounding its best scholars. They took Him away, saying, 'Why have you done this to us? Your father and I have been terribly worried trying to find you.' (Luke 2:48 GNT) How embarrassing to stand up in your home church, announce you're the Messiah, then have people you grew up with march you out of town to throw you off a cliff. (Luke 4:29) How embarrassing when He told Jairus his dead daughter was merely sleeping and those in the house 'laughed him to scorn.' (Matthew 9:24 KJV) Now think about this. When the high priest asked Jesus about His doctrine, He replied, 'Why do you ask Me? Ask those who have heard Me...' (John 18:21 NKJV) So one of the officers slapped Him in the face. How embarrassing! But the supreme embarrassment in the life of Jesus may well have been when the high priest asked Him not about His doctrine, but about His disciples. Where were they? Judas betrayed Him, Peter denied Him, and the rest ran for cover. What could He say? So here's the question: Are your character, your conduct and your commitment to Christ a source of joy to Him, or an embarrassment? Gandhi said, 'If Christians would really live according to the teachings of Christ, all of India would be Christian today.' When it comes to doctrine, you may stand tall. But when it comes to discipleship, where do you stand?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...do it all in the name of the Lord...' Colossians 3:17 NIV<br /><br /><p>Observe: (1) You can have more, as long as you don't want it all for yourself. In a generation whose motto is 'Look out for number one,' we need to be reminded that 'Christ did not please himself.' (Romans 15:3 NIV) He didn't live to enrich Himself, but to enrich others. You won't find a speck of selfishness in Him. He's worthy to be called 'Master', because He first mastered Himself by denying Himself and living for others. (2) You can get almost anything done, as long as you don't care who gets the credit. 'Whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus.' Pride brought Satan down and it will bring you down, too. Ivan O Miller quoted, 'Humility is such a frail and delicate thing that he who dares to think that he has it, proves by that single thought that he has it not.' When you succeed and the accolades start coming your way, enjoy them briefly. Then pass them on to the true source of all your accomplishments - God. (3) You can hasten the answer, as long as you don't despise the source. Naaman the leper discovered that you can have what God offers, but on God's terms, not yours (2 Kings 5:1-14). And God's terms are 'faith' and 'obedience'. Faith is like electricity: you don't have to analyse or understand it to enjoy its benefits. All you have to do is plug in! What has God told you to do? Obey Him! Stop wavering, stop procrastinating, stop arguing with Him and do what He tells you. You'll love the results.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Deut 3-4, Mk 3:23-35, Ps 2, Prov 11:22-23 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=60126&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['<br /><br /><p>Author Charles Swindoll writes: 'If ever there was a deathbed conversion, that was it. The thief lived his entire life a sinner, a hoodlum... in no way did he prove himself worthy... so what had he done to receive eternal life? What did Jesus accept? Faith - simple, unadulterated, unproved faith in Christ. That's all God requires and all we can offer. The snapshot of Jesus' life the thief saw convinced him He was the Son of God.</p>
<p>'Their dialogue teaches us three important truths: (1) <em>No one is ever too far gone</em>. Think of someone you've written off... 'Oh, they'll never come to know Christ. I've tried everything...he's never going to respond.' When you're tempted to think anyone is beyond the reach of grace, remember the criminal on the cross. (2) <em>Your real message is your life</em>. Socrates once called words 'stupid things'. When your life draws the attention of lost people, you have sufficient proof to back up the words you use. When you let God do the work in their lives, and yours, you'll be amazed how He brings the appropriate words. (3) <em>All God requires and accepts is simple faith</em>. If you're working hard to earn your way into the Kingdom...you're on the wrong path. Think about it - how many works will be enough? When salvation is by faith, all the work and all the glory are God's. Never doubt your acceptance into His family when you come His way. The thief didn't doubt...He didn't have to make any promises. He believed with all his heart, and was saved.' You can be too!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[ 'I will bless the Lord at all times.' Psalm 34:1 NKJV<br /><br /><p>If you shout your lungs out at a ball game on Saturday, but sit silent and subdued when it's time to worship God on Sunday, maybe you're more excited about sports than spiritual matters. <em>Ouch!</em> A great definition of worship is 'worth-ship'. What worth do you place on God and on your relationship with Him? You say, 'But sometimes I don't feel like praising God.' Feelings have little to do with it! A good relationship isn't based on emotion but on commitment. The Bible says, '...Let us continually offer the sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to His name.' (Hebrews 13:15 NKJV) Note the words 'continually' and 'sacrifice'. With God, the praise that costs is the praise that counts! King David wanted to build an altar to God on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite. Araunah offered David the land, oxen and wood needed for building the altar free of charge. But David's response was: 'I will not sacrifice to the Lord my God burnt offerings that cost me nothing.' (2 Samuel 24:24 NIV) The Psalmist said, 'From the rising of the sun unto its going down, the Lord's name is to be praised.' (Psalm 113:3 NKJV) This Psalmist scheduled praisebreaks throughout his day: 'Seven times a day I praise You.' (Psalm 119:164 NKJV) We have tea and coffee breaks; he had praisebreaks! If you want to change your environment and your attitude, start praising God throughout the day. Not only will you bless the Lord, will bless you in a hundred and one different ways. Don't take anybody else's word for it - try it and see!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Gal 5:22, Lk 6:27-36, Ex 23:1-9, Rom 12:14-21 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61187&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[ '...We have a good conscience, in all things...' Hebrews 13:18 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Fire alarms have an internal switch, triggered by a beam of light. As long as the light is received unbroken by the photosensitive receiver, the detector is quiet. But if smoke, moisture, or an insect obstructs the beam for even a split second, the alarm sounds. Paying attention to that alarm can make the difference between life and death. And your conscience works on the same principle. When sin obstructs the connection between you and God, your conscience signals that something's wrong. At that moment you should thank God for helping you to feel good about feeling bad. Only a fool would turn off the alarm or develop the ability to sleep through it. While certain things aren't 'wrong' in themselves, they may be wrong for you because of the future God has in mind. That means there are things others can do that you can't. So instead of being stubborn, rejoice in the knowledge that God has great things in store for you. A French proverb says, 'There is no pillow so soft as a clear conscience.' Listening to your conscience will keep you from going the wrong way. And if you decide to plough on regardless, your conscience will keep you from being at ease with your decision. Always ask yourself this question and you'll make the right decision: 'How will doing this affect my confidence towards God?' The Bible says, '...If our heart does not condemn us, then we have confidence towards God. And whatever we ask we receive from Him, because we...do those things that are pleasing in His sight.' (1 John 3:21-22 NKJV)</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Deut 14-17, Mk 5:1-10, Ps 37:25-31, Prov 12:1-3 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61690&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

The Bible says, ‘Don’t be concerned about the outward beauty of fancy hairstyles, expensive jewellery, or beautiful clothes. You should clothe yourself instead with the beauty that comes from within…’ (1 Peter 3:3–4 NLT) When your self–worth comes from God instead of people, you can wear a $10 outfit from a charity shop or a $1000 one from an up–market boutique. You are fine either way, because you recognise that your outer appearance doesn’t define who you are, or determine your worth in God’s eyes.</span></p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I am the Lord who heals you.' Exodus15:26 NKJV<br /><br /><p><em>I</em><em>nstrument rated for sickness.</em> Many a healthy person has been cut down in the prime of life by cancer, heart attack, stroke or some other debilitating disease. But there's a way to be ready for this storm, a way not paved with fear, a way that has so prepared you that you can hear the diagnosis of your doctor and still have a sense of God's peace in your heart. You know what your instrument panel, the Bible, says about it. You know what to do, how to act, and what to say. You've been prepared for this moment.</p>
<p>Now, if a pilot hasn't faithfully maintained his aircraft, then it will go down in the storm no matter what his instrument panel tells him. So if you have taken good care of your body, which is the temple of the Holy Spirit, then you can go to God with confidence, standing on His Word and asking Him to heal you. Eventually we will all die of something, but you don't have to die before your time. God has promised us 'long life' (Psalm 91:16). The Bible says, 'He... healed all who were sick, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying: &quot;...He Himself took our infirmities and bore our sicknesses.&quot;' (Matthew 8:16-17 NKJV)</p>
<p>You say, 'I know some good Christians who prayed for healing, and didn't get it.' That's true. And the most spiritually mature among us can't explain why. God stamps some things: 'Will explain later!' But as long as you're living, you must stand on the Word of God, which says, 'I am the Lord who heals you.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['The blessing of the Lord makes one rich...' Proverbs 10:22 NKJV<br /><br /><p><em>I</em><em>nstrument rated for finances.</em> Just when you get ahead a little bit, your car breaks down, your house needs a new roof, and your boiler gives up the ghost. We all experience it. But the instrument rated believer can fly through financial storms because he has absolute confidence in his gauges and radio. If he looks at them and doubts their accuracy, he's in serious difficulty. This must all be settled on the ground while he is going through the checklist. He must not take off into the storm if all is not in good order.</p>
<p>When it comes to money matters, check your craft. Do you know what the Bible really says about your finances? To fly through or above a financial storm, you must practise Biblical stewardship, know what God has promised to you, and stand on it in faith. 'Give, and it will be given to you.' (Luke 6:38 NKJV) Giving is an act of obedience. It honours God. But there are some things God will not do. He will not be generous with you if you have been stingy with Him or others. The Bible says, 'The blessing of the Lord makes one rich.' You ask, 'How rich does God want me to be?' That depends on four things: your spiritual maturity, your God-given assignment in life, your willingness to put God in first place when it comes to finances, and exercising your faith.</p>
<p>Giving is like sowing (2 Corinthians 9:6). When a seed is sown it produces a harvest. But the farmer has to go and get that harvest. Similarly, faith, plus obedience, draws the harvest of God's blessing into your life.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA[ 'Let everything that has breath praise the Lord.' Psalm 150:6 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Solomon says there's '...a time to keep silence and a time to speak.' (Ecclesiastes 3:7 NKJV) Now, you shouldn't interrupt the church service and draw attention to yourself, but when it's time to praise God you should give it 100 percent: 'I will praise You, O Lord, with my whole heart.' (Psalm 9:1 NKJV) The story's told of an old man named Joe, who'd been a drunk and a derelict most of his life and, as a result, he could barely make ends meet. During a Sunday morning service he gave his life to Christ and the transformation was so radical that everybody in the congregation noticed it. Joe had a problem, however; he was so thrilled with Jesus that he sang louder than everybody else. And when the pastor made a point that touched his heart, he'd jump up and shout, 'Hallelujah!' Concerned that the dignity and decorum of the church were at risk, the pastor said, 'Joe, you've got to be quiet. As a matter of fact, if you'll just sit in church next Sunday and say nothing, I'll buy you a new pair of boots.' Joe needed the boots, so he said he'd try. But after restraining himself through several high points in the sermon, he couldn't stand it anymore. He jumped up and shouted, 'Boots or no boots, I'm gonna praise the Lord!' You say, 'But I'm the quiet, reserved type.' Sorry, there are no exceptions based on personality types. 'Let everything that has breath praise the Lord!' In other words, unless you're dead, you're supposed to praise the Lord!</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Deut 8-10, Mk 4:13-25, Ps 37: 8-15, Prov 11:27-29 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61188&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...We walk by faith, not by sight.' 2 Corinthians 5:7 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Your eyes can deceive you! Joseph's brothers sold him into slavery, dipped his coat in goat's blood and told their father he'd been torn to pieces by a wild beast. As a result, the old man said, '...I shall go down into the grave to my son in mourning.' (Genesis 37:35 NKJV) In reality, not only was Joseph alive, he'd soon become prime minister of Egypt and save his family during the time of famine. But his father lived all those years grieving because of something he saw: a coat. Sometimes there's a difference between facts and truth. The facts may confirm that the economy is bad, but the truth is, '...God shall supply all your needs according to His riches...' (Philippians 4:19 KJV) One day Elisha and his servant woke up in the town of Dothan to discover they were surrounded by an enemy army. When the servant saw this, he panicked. But Elisha said, 'Do not fear, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them. And Elisha prayed... Lord...open his eyes that he may see. Then the Lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw. And behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.' (2 Kings 6:16-17 NKJV) God wants you to look to Him and know that in your darkest moment, you don't have to be afraid. What you have going for you is so much greater than anything that comes against you. So rise up in faith and say with the Psalmist, 'My help comes from the Lord.' (Psalm 121:2 NKJV) Then act like you believe it!</p>

<title><![CDATA[Hooked on Urgency]]></title>
<alias><![CDATA[hooked-on-urgency]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[ 'There is a time for everything.' Ecclesiastes 3:1 NIV<br /><br /><p>Urgency is stressful. It's also addictive and, if you find yourself habitually reacting to outside demands, you may be 'hooked'. Like any addiction, urgency temporarily meets your need to feel needed. It creates a sense of 'getting things done', falsely enhances your self-esteem, yet tends to make problems worse because mostly 'haste makes waste'. If you're hooked on urgency, here are two things to consider: (1) <em>in today's society, busyness equals status</em>. People expect you to be in demand. But while constantly abandoning your goals to help others accomplish theirs may make you feel appreciated, it can sidetrack you from your real purpose and create in you a false sense of importance. The Bible says, 'God gives ability to all for their particular service.' (1 Corinthians 12:6 GNT) The lion's share of your time should be spent doing what God called you to do, not fulfilling the demands and expectations of others. (2) <em>identifying your response pattern can help set you free</em>. Sometimes it's hard to say 'no' because as a Christian you feel obligated. But not every 'need' is a directive from God to jump in and meet it! Try to be discerning. Your decision to get involved should come from God, so before you react, pray for wisdom and guidance. The Bible says, 'In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths.' (Proverbs 3:6 NKJV) If you're a 'fixer' you probably enjoy solving problems, meeting needs, and influencing behaviour as well as outcomes. That's not necessarily a bad thing. You just need to recognise you're vulnerable to the urgent, and become more priority-minded.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Deut 5-7, Mk 4:1-12, Ps 37:1-7, Prov 11:24-26 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=60128&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA[ '...The most precious treasure a man can find.' Proverbs 31:10 CEV<br /><br /><p>Erma Bombeck wrote: 'When God was creating mothers, on His sixth day of overtime the angel said, &quot;You're fiddling around a lot on this one.&quot; God replied, &quot;Have you seen the specs on this order? She's to have 18,000 replaceable moving parts, run on black coffee and leftovers, have a kiss that cures anything from broken legs to disappointed love affairs...and six pairs of hands!&quot; &quot;Six pairs of hands? No way!&quot; the angel said. God said, &quot;And the challenging bit is the three pairs of eyes mothers need. One pair that sees through doors, another in back of her head that sees what she shouldn't be able to see, another in front for looking at a child who's goofed and saying, 'I understand, and I love you', without speaking.&quot; The angel said, &quot;Lord, take a break. Tomorrow...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can't,&quot; God said. &quot;I'm close to creating something so like Myself. Already she can heal herself when she's sick, feed a family on a pound of minced beef, and get a nine year-old to stand under a shower!&quot; Touching her, the angel said, &quot;She's too soft!&quot; &quot;But so tough!&quot; God replied. &quot;You can't imagine what this mother can endure.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can it think?&quot; asked the angel. &quot;Not only think, it reasons and compromises,&quot; God said. Running his finger across the mother's cheek, the angel said, &quot;There's a leak!&quot; &quot;It's not a leak,&quot; God said. &quot;It's a tear.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's it for?&quot; asked the angel. &quot;It's for joy, sadness, pain, disappointment, loneliness and pride.&quot; The angel declared, &quot;Lord, You're a Genius!&quot;' Just a columnist's fictional story, but well worth pondering.

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA[ '...Lord, teach us to pray...' Luke 11:1 NKJV<br /><br /><p>Overhearing Jesus pray moved one of His disciples to say, 'Lord, teach us to pray.' It's unlikely Jesus intended to teach them a rote prayer since He'd just said, 'When you pray, don't babble on and on as people of other religions do. They think their prayers are answered merely by repeating their words again and again.' (Matthew 6:7 NLT) His answer was more than a sample formula-prayer. He was teaching them powerful, effective principles for praying. Let's see how we can benefit from them. William Barclay said, 'The Lord's Prayer has two major parts: the first for God's benefit, the second for ours. Honour the first part, and the second is guaranteed.' Part one begins with 'Our Father'. It's intended for His family, collectively as well as individually. He used the plural words 'our...us...we' to indicate prayer is a co-operative exercise, where we pray with and for each other, not just for and by ourselves. It also teaches us the power of agreeing together in prayer (Matthew 18:19 KJV). Before asking for anything, we're to acknowledge God's fatherhood, because prayer is: (a) <em>a matter of relationship</em>. It's the Father and His children in session; those who are redeemed through faith in the blood of His only begotten Son. That's the welcome mat under your feet when you pray. It's also: (b) <em>a matter of submission</em>. Jesus' disciples understood that fatherhood meant headship and authority. Prayer isn't an attempt to get God to agree with your will, it's aligning yourself with His Word and will. He's a promise-keeper, not an indulgent parent.</p><br /><br />SoulFood: Deut 28-29, Mk 6:1-13, Ps 44:17-26, Prov 12:12-14 <br /><br /><small><i>The Word for Today</i> is authored by Bob and Debby Gass and published under licence from UCB International Copyright  2014</small><img src='http://word.ucbmedia.com/includes/track/track.php?b=3&amp;track=61694&amp;www=blog' height='0' width='0' alt=''>]]></introtext>

<introtext><![CDATA['...You received His message... And this word continues to work in you who believe.' 1 Thessalonians 2:13 NLT<br /><br /><p>In the Bible you will find a solution for just about every problem you face in life. How often have you gone for help to a pastor or counsellor or friend, only to have them direct you back to the Scriptures? When you get sick enough, you won't argue with the doctor, you'll just take the medicine! Paul writes, 'When you received His message from us, you didn't think of our words as mere human ideas. You accepted what we said as the very Word of God - which, of course, it is. And this Word continues to work in you who believe.'</p>
<p>God's Word works - when you work it! But it only 'continues to work in you who believe.' So don't read it and then go out and say something different; get into agreement with God. Let His Word on the issue be word on it too! The Amplified Bible says, '...The Word of God, which is effectually at work in you who believe [exercising its superhuman power in those who adhere to and trust in and rely on it].' (1 Thessalonians 2:13 AMP) One day an atheist said to a believer that it was quite impossible to believe in any book whose author was unknown. The believer asked him if the compiler of the multiplication table was known. 'No,' he answered. 'Then, of course, you don't accept it?' the believer asked. The skeptic replied, 'Oh, yes, I believe in it because it works well.' The believer replied, 'So does the Bible.'</p>
<p>The greatest investment you can make in yourself is reading your Bible.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['Your promises have been thoroughly tested, and Your servant loves them.' Psalm 119:140 NIV<br /><br /><p>Can you imagine how honoured you'd feel to have a personal audience with a president or prime minister? What are the chances you'd say, 'Sorry, I'm too busy. I can't come'? No, you'd approach them with profound respect, observe every protocol and hang on every word. Well, you can have a personal audience each day with the King of Kings and He will speak to you personally through His Word. When you're in love with someone, you want to spend every possible moment with them, delighting in what they have to say and responding to them from your heart. David said, 'The law from Your mouth is more precious to me than thousands of pieces of silver and gold.' (Psalm 119:72 NIV) Again he said, 'Your promises have been thoroughly tested, and Your servant loves them.' (Psalm 119:140 NIV)</p>
<p>An unknown poet wrote: '<em>Though the cover is worn and the pages are torn, and though places bear traces of tears, yet more precious than gold is this book worn and old, that can shatter and scatter my fears. When I prayerfully look in this precious old book, as my eyes scan the pages I see; many tokens of love from the Father above, Who is nearest and dearest to me. This old book is my guide, 'tis a friend by my side, it will lighten and brighten my way. And each promise I find soothes and gladdens my mind, as I read it and heed it today.</em>'</p>
<p>Whatever you have to sacrifice, whatever priorities you have to rearrange, read your Bible every day.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...God...calls those things which do not exist as though they did.' Romans 4:17 NKJV<br /><br /><p>You must believe what God says about you, over what everyone else says! Stop listening to those who claim you'll never amount to anything. You might've had a bad childhood, or a failed marriage or career. '...Forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before [you].' (Philippians 3:13 KJV) The Bible doesn't say that <em>we</em> call those things which are not as though they are. Nor does it say <em>others</em> have the power to speak things which are not as though they are over your life. No, <em>it is </em><em>God</em>, through His Word, Who speaks into existence His will for your life. And you should be glad about that. You wouldn't want anybody else to have power to determine your destiny.</p>
<p>Our responsibility is to line up our will with God's will. When we do, He empowers us to accomplish what normally would be humanly impossible. The Bible says, '...The just shall live by faith.' (Romans 1:17 KJV) Your faith is more important than your performance. Yes, when God decrees something, we get to participate in it. But in every case, it's God who performs it. The thing you're worried about performing, God says will be done through His power. Will you experience delays and disappointments? Yes, but ultimately you won't be denied, for God has decreed it.</p>
<p>You say, 'But what about all my unanswered questions or all the loose ends that need to be tied up?' It's 'a done deal' as far as God's concerned. 'All things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose.' (Romans 8:28 NKJV) Relax; God is working it out for you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Let's go off by ourselves to a quiet place and rest awhile...' Mark 6:31 NLT<br /><br /><p>Mark records, 'Jesus said, &quot;Let's go off by ourselves to a quiet place and rest awhile.&quot; He said this because there were so many people coming and going that Jesus and His apostles didn't even have time to eat.' No one had a greater assignment than Jesus, and no one was busier: not even you! But He knew the importance of relaxation. He understood the balance between work and rest, which is why He was able to accomplish so much in so little time.</p>
<p>The more successful you are, the greater the demands on your time and energy will be. People are wonderful, but they can be draining. As your career and your calling grow, this will only become more so. Renewing yourself will require constant attention. If you don't do this, you can be sure those around you won't. Work hard, but play just as enthusiastically. Schedule it. Take one day a week off and totally relax. Focus on something other than your job. If you do that your mind will be clearer, you'll make better decisions, you'll see life through different eyes, and you'll accomplish far more.</p>
<p>Stop and answer these questions: How often do you actually schedule time for rest and relaxation? What do you do to rest your mind at work? At home? If you had one full day all to yourself, what would you do? If you struggle to answer those questions then you need to pray, 'Lord, teach me how to rest. Show me how I can turn towards You and be restored and renewed.'</p>

Luke 5:9 NIV<br /><br /><p>'...He said to Simon, &quot;Put out into deep water, and let down the nets for a catch.&quot; Simon answered, &quot;Master, we've worked hard all night and haven't caught anything. But because You say so, I will let down the nets.&quot; When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break. So they signalled their partners in the other boat to come and help them, and they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink. When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus' knees and said, &quot;Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man!&quot; For he and all his companions were astonished at the catch... Then Jesus said to Simon, &quot;Don't be afraid; from now on you will catch men.&quot; So they...left everything and followed Him.' (Luke 5:4-11 NIV)</p>
<p>Here are seven life-changing truths you need to learn: (1) Jesus will come to where you work and help you; (2) When what you are doing is not working, He will show you a better way; (3) Even though it may not make sense at the moment, do what He tells you; (4) The success He has in mind for you is greater than anything you can envision for yourself; (5) Your existing systems may not be able to handle what He has in mind, so be willing to change how you do things; (6) When you experience His goodness, you'll fall at His feet and acknowledge Him as your Lord; (7) When you realise what He has in mind for you, you'll leave everything and follow Him.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...The Lord forgave you, so you must forgive others.' Colossians 3:13 NLT<br /><br /><p>By washing the dirt from His disciples' feet, Jesus demonstrated His willingness to forgive their sin before they even committed it. This takes love to its highest level. You say, 'I am not the guilty party here.' Neither was Jesus. Of the men in that room, only One was worthy of having His feet washed. And He was the One who washed the feet. The genius of Jesus' example is that the burden of bridge-building falls on the strong one, not the weak one. And do you know what happens? More often than not, if the one in the right volunteers to wash the feet of the one in the wrong, both parties get on their knees. Don't we all think we are right? Hence we wash each other's feet.</p>
<p>Understand this: relationships don't thrive because the guilty are punished, but because the innocent are merciful. The mercy of Christ preceded His disciples' mistakes, and our mercy must precede the mistakes of others too. Those in the circle of Christ had no doubt of His love, and those in our circles should have no doubt about ours either. Paul writes, 'Be kind and loving to each other, and forgive each other just as God forgave you in Christ.' (Ephesians 4:32 NCV) Because Christ has forgiven us, we can forgive others. Because He has a forgiving heart, we can have a forgiving heart. When Christ truly lives within us, we have no better alternative. There is incredible power in the words, 'I forgive you; I love you; let's move on.'</p>
<p>Are there any sitting around your table today who need to be assured of your forgiveness?</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Search, and you will find...' Matthew 7:7 NCV<br /><br /><p>To hear from God you need: () <em>A regular time and place</em>. Some prefer morning. '...In the morning my prayer comes before You.' (Psalm 88:13 NIV) Others prefer evening. 'Let my ...praise [be] like the evening sacrifice.' (Psalm 141:2 NCV) Others prefer encounters throughout the day. 'Evening, morning and noon I cry out...' (Psalm 55:17 NIV) Just find a time and place that's right for you. 'How much time should I take?' As much as you need. Your time with God should last long enough for you to say what you want, and for God to say what He wants.</p>
<p>(2) <em>An open Bible</em>. Before reading the Bible, pray. Don't go to Scripture looking for your own idea, go searching for God's. '...Hunt for it like hidden treasure. Then you will understand...and you will find that you know God.' (Proverbs 2:4-5 NCV) God seems to send us messages as He did manna: one day's portion at a time. He gives us: '...A command here, a command there. A rule here, a rule there. A little lesson here, a little lesson there.' (Isaiah 28:13 NCV) Choose depth over length. Read until a verse 'hits' you, then stop and meditate on it. Understanding comes a little at a time, over a lifetime.</p>
<p>(3) <em>A listening heart</em>. James writes, 'The man who looks into the perfect mirror of God's law...and makes a habit of so doing, is not the man who sees and forgets. He puts that law into practice and he wins true happiness.' (James 1:25 PHPS) We know we are listening to God when what we read in the Bible is what others see in our lives.</p>

<alias><![CDATA[if-you-want-to-succeed-reach-out]]></alias>
<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...By love serve one another.' Galatians 5:13 KJV<br /><br /><p>You won't succeed in life unless you are connected to the right people. And those who enable you to succeed won't always come to you; usually you must go to them. Success won't come knocking on your door; you've got to go and find it. Jesus didn't set up a throne in the middle of each town and say, 'This is the only place you can meet with Me.' No, He went to the marketplace, to the boats of fishermen, to the synagogue, to the homes of people. He '...went through the towns, preaching the Gospel, and healing everywhere.' (Luke 9:6 KJV)</p>
<p>What is keeping you from reaching out to others? Fear of rejection? Until your dream becomes more important to you than your fear of rejection, you will never succeed. Successful people dread rejection too; the difference is that they believe their goals are worth it. There are two kinds of people in your life: those who already know you have something they need, and those who don't know it yet. So start a 'people list'. The law of relationship says that every person is only four people away from the person they need. This simply means that you know Bill, who knows Judy, who knows Charles, who knows the person you want to get to. You are already networked. Follow the dots and you'll get to your destiny.</p>
<p>Success always begins somewhere, at some , with someone. The secret is, you must reach out.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['We know that all things work together for good...' Romans 8:28 NKJV<br /><br /><p>When you know God's plan for your life, you won't permit things that are contrary to it. You won't be quick to get discouraged when situations bring conflict and disorder. You won't become frustrated or overwhelmed by those things you can't pray away, confess away, or speak away. Why? Because you know that if it's in your life, and it's not caused by disobedience, God has allowed it and He wants to use it to produce in you the nature of Jesus. <em>All</em> things, not things, work together for good to those who love the Lord.</p>
<p>You say, 'But I can't see any real purpose in it.' Hold on, you will! God is building a foundation under you. He's equipping you to handle a level of success you can't cope with right now. Out of this pressure will come the power to do what He, not others, desires in your life. He's teaching you in the wilderness so that when you get to the Promised Land and people become unco-operative, resentful or jealous, you won't be afraid to cut those unhealthy ties. He wants you to know that your help comes from the Lord, not people. Do you understand that? If you don't, you'd better ask somebody! But don't ask just anybody, ask the Lord. His Word says, 'Call to Me, and I will answer you, and show you great and mighty things, which you do not know.' (Jeremiah 33:3 NKJV)</p>
<p>Don't be afraid to ask God, 'Why?' Men and women in the Scripture asked that question often. But be ready when God answers, 'It's for a purpose!'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Everything I have is yours.' Luke 15:31 NIV<br /><br /><p>The older brother couldn't rejoice about his younger brother's homecoming because he resented it. He said to his father, 'You threw a party for him, but you've never thrown one for me! I served you faithfully for years and you never once acknowledged my service or celebrated my accomplishments.' (Luke 15:29-30)</p>
<p>We learn three things from the older brother. The first is about <em>attitudes</em>. Even though he was invited to the party, his anger kept him away. Why are you angry? You won't talk to anybody, or forgive anybody. You're afraid to love anybody, or reach out to anybody, or learn from anybody. You've blamed everybody for everything; now you're blaming God. Don't let anger lock you out, rob you of blessing, poison your spirit, and destroy your joy. Forgive, celebrate your brother, and walk in fellowship with your Heavenly Father. The second is about <em>abundance</em>. '...My son...everything I have is yours.' (Luke 15:31 NIV) Note the word '<em>every</em>thing'. God is a God of abundance, and if He blesses your brother and sister, He will bless you too. Indeed, when He blesses them, He still has more than enough left to bless you. The third is about <em>access to your Father</em>. As a redeemed child of God, you can approach Him at any time, ask for what you need and be confident that He will respond to you. 'Let us then approach God's throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.' (Hebrews 4:16 NIV) You say, 'When will God answer my prayer?' He replies, 'In your time of need.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Encourage and help each other...' 1 Thessalonians 5:11 CEV<br /><br /><p>Micca Monda Campbell writes: 'Have you ever secretly compared your spouse to another man or woman...or wished they were more thoughtful...more spiritual...a better dresser? If you have, let me reassure you the grass isn't greener on the other side. That man doesn't clip his toenails either...and that woman doesn't rub her husband's feet while feeding him grapes! Our spouses are the people we fell in love with, and often they just need a little encouragement. Instead of comparing and complaining...nurture your mate in the areas they need it most...I heard about a good-looking millionaire who married a plain-looking woman. It was the talk of the town. Why did he marry her? She's not up to his standard. It won't last! When they came back from an extended honeymoon, it looked like the millionaire was with another woman...one glowing with confidence and poise. Now that's the kind of wife he deserves, declared the town loud-mouth. Then she noticed something interesting: it was the same woman - completely transformed! Her new husband had taken her away, encouraged her...and built up her self-confidence till she started to see in herself what he'd always seen. So instead of walking around on your neighbour's grass, fertilise your own by looking for the good in your spouse. Speak encouraging words...acknowledge their efforts to improve...become their cheerleader. The Bible says, &quot;<em>Love...protects...trusts...hopes...perseveres.</em>&quot; (1 Corinthians 13:4;7 NIV) Instead of making comparisons, ask God to help you see your partner like you once did.'</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...Get ready to cross the Jordan River into the land I am about to give...' Joshua 1:2 NIV<br /><br /><p>God said to Joshua: 'Moses my servant is dead. Now then...get ready to cross the Jordan River into the land I am about to give [you]...I will give you every place where you set your foot, as I promised Moses. Your territory will extend from the desert to Lebanon, and from the great river, the Euphrates...to the Great Sea on the west. No one will be able to stand up against you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will never leave you nor forsake you. Be strong and courageous, because you will lead these people to inherit the land I swore to their forefathers to give them.' (Joshua 1:2-6 NIV) Are you standing today at the crossroads of change, contemplating a new season or assignment, and feeling anxious about it? If so, observe two things in this story: (1) <em>When his time came to lead, Joshua was ready</em>. Until then, he faithfully served Moses and found fulfilment in the number-two slot. He didn't push and he didn't play politics; he just prepared himself. And when he was ready, God promoted him. (2) <em>He went further than his mentor did</em>. Moses' leadership ended where the Promised Land began. Under Joshua's leadership, Israel would move into it and become a great nation. Every day he had spent in the wilderness equipped him for this moment. God never wastes experience. Everything you've been through, including the things you didn't understand, are preparation for what God has in store for you.</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['He...shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.' Psalm 91:1 NKJV<br /><br /><p>What is 'the shadow of the Almighty'? In the wilderness where Israel wandered for forty years, temperatures could get up to 50 or 55 degrees Celsius. There was no shade except what was provided by the tents in which the people lived. So they understood this powerful metaphor, 'under the shadow of the Almighty'. If you were lost in the desert, the children of Israel would have been required by the law of hospitality to satisfy your need for food, water, protection from an enemy, and shade from the blistering sun. It worked like this: first you had to find out the chief shepherd's name. Then you would take hold of the cord on his tent and cry out for help. When you did that, the law of hospitality required him to take you into the safety of his tent. Indeed, that same law said he had to protect you with his very life.</p>
<p>Are you getting the idea? God's name, El Shaddai, describes two wonderful aspects of His character. 'El' speaks of His power and strength. 'Shaddai' literally means <em>strong-breasted-one</em>, which refers to the gentleness of a nursing mother. Some days you have to go to God for the strength needed to withstand the enemy's attack; other days you just need to go to Him and let Him hold you in His arms and comfort you.</p>
<p>John Shairp wrote, 'Let me no more my comfort draw, from my frail grasp on Thee; in this alone rejoice with awe - Thy mighty grasp of me.' When things get too 'hot' for you, run to 'the shadow of the Almighty'.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['Faith is the substance of things hoped for...' Hebrews 11:1 NKJV<br /><br /><p>You don't need faith unless you're hoping for something. Hope establishes the goal; faith is the bridge that gets you to it. There's no need to build a bridge if you're not going anywhere. But if you're going after something you can't reach on your own, you need the bridge of faith to get you there. '...This is the victory that has overcome the world - our faith.' (1 John 5:4 NKJV)</p>
<p>Never has it been more important to teach moral standards. But unless we also teach people how to stand in faith in God's Word, they'll end up using willpower and discipline to fight the devil, and they'll lose. Jesus told Peter, 'I have prayed for you, that your faith should not fail...' (Luke 22:32 NKJV) When you're up to your neck in problems and don't know which way to turn, speak to yourself and say, 'Faith, don't fail me now!' The Bible says, 'Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.' (Romans 10:17 NKJV) It's in hearing yourself declare God's Word that your faith grows. And here's another Scripture: '...But the word which they heard did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard it.' (Hebrews 4:2 NKJV)</p>
<p>You can have an expression of faith, yet not enjoy the of faith. You can get excited about a sermon in church, yet nothing changes in your life. You've got to get the 'mix' right. You've got to take what you hear and mix it with what you think, say and do. Faith is not an emotion, it's a decision to stand on God's Word.</p>

<title_alias><![CDATA[]]></title_alias>
<introtext><![CDATA['...He has commanded us to love one another...' 2 John 1:6 NLT<br /><br /><p>Because the very essence and nature of God is love, it's in loving others that we are most like Him. Paul writes, 'And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor<em>,</em>and though I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profits me nothing.' (1 Corinthians 13:3 NKJV) And love cannot be learned or practised in isolation. You have to be around people-irritating, imperfect, demanding, frustrating people.</p>
<p>Sometimes we act as if relationships are something to be squeezed into our schedule. We talk about finding time, or about time for others. Jesus summarised what matters most in two statements: 'Love God' and 'Love people' (Matthew 22:37-40). Relationships, not things, are what really matter in life. So why do we keep allowing our relationships to get shortchanged? Because when our lives become overloaded we start skimming relationally, cutting back on the time, energy and attention good relationships require. We become too preoccupied with making a living, paying bills, and accomplishing goals, as if these were the point of life. They're not!</p>
<p>The point of life is learning to love - God and people. Life minus love equals zero! Mother Teresa said, 'It's not what you do, but how much love you put into it that matters.' Love is the secret of a great legacy. In our final moments we all realise that relationships are what life is all about. Wisdom is learning that truth sooner, rather than later. Don't wait until it's too late to figure that out!</p>

<introtext><![CDATA['...I focus on this one thing...' Philippians 3:13 NLT<br /><br /><p>Professor Howard Hendricks mentored hundreds of pastors and leaders. He writes: 'As a young leader, my biggest mistake was allowing my time to be eaten up with things outside my core competencies. I wanted to set the pace for others, to demonstrate that nothing was beneath me, so I devoted an inordinate amount of time to things I wasn't good at - things I'd never be good at. At the same time I invested little energy into developing my strengths... Finally I realised that my true value lay within the context of my giftedness - not the number of hours I worked. There were some balls I'd no business juggling. When I finally got the courage to let them fall to the floor, I began to excel in juggling the two or three balls I was created to keep in the air in the first place. And the amazing thing is, people came along and picked up the other balls. What I couldn't relinquish were the opportunities they'd been waiting for.'</p>
<p>Answer this: of the two or three things that define success for you, which of them are in line with your core competencies? That is where you must focus your energies. is where you'll excel. Within that narrowed context you will make your greatest contribution. And best of all, you will what you do!</p>
<p>You say, 'But I can't afford to focus all my energies on one or two things.' Maybe not yet, but that should be your goal. It's something you should be working towards if you want to succeed where it matters most.</p>
