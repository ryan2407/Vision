<quote> ‘He got into one of the boats…belonging to Simon…’ Luke 5:3 NIV</quote>
<title>When Jesus Comes on Board</title>
<btext>One day Jesus ‘…saw at the water’s edge two boats, left there by the fishermen, who were washing their nets. He got into one of the boats…belonging to Simon, and asked him to put out a little from shore. Then He sat down and taught the people from the boat. When He had finished speaking, He said to Simon, “Put out into deep water, and let down the nets for a catch.” Simon answered, “Master, we’ve worked hard all night and haven’t caught anything. But because You say so, I will let down the nets.” When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break.’ (Luke 5:2–6 NIV) Are you sitting today where Peter sat? Your outlook is bleak, your nets are empty, you’ve tried everything you know and you’re ready to give up? It happens; you get to the place where you simply stop expecting anything good. You’ve experienced too many disappointments and you’re afraid to dream, reach, stretch or broaden your horizons. Jesus knows how hard you’ve tried and today He’s inviting you to try again—this time with Him. Even though you’re wrestling with depression and tormenting memories, unemployment, addiction, financial failure or sickness, the Lord of new beginnings wants to come on board. If you listen to Him, He will show you what to do. Now, what He says may not initially make sense to you. But if you’re willing to respond like Peter—‘Because You say so, I will’—you’re on the threshold of a miracle. Today, listen and obey the words of Jesus and watch how your situation changes.</btext>

<quote>‘…you will be able to discern what is best…’ Philippians 1:10 NIV</quote>
<title>Don’t Go by Your Feelings</title>
<btext>God gave you feelings, and you should never be ashamed of them. They can alert you to danger and give you insight into various situations. God actually uses our feelings to draw us closer to Him and highlight areas in our lives that need to be submitted to His Holy Spirit. But feelings are subjective; you can’t always trust them. Jon Walker says: ‘When old feelings creep back in we feel fearful, ashamed, hopeless, not good enough, unlovable, victimised, helpless and resentful… An event can trigger these reactions…ending a relationship, stress, problems at work and at home, times of change or illness…and sometimes these feelings return for no reason.’ So you must test your feelings, otherwise you’ll end up allowing ‘…your feelings [to] get out of control.’ (Colossians 3:5 NIV) It can be disastrous to act on what you see, hear and feel. Instead of reacting to feelings, you must learn to act on what God’s Word says. That’s the gold standard, and it never changes! For instance, even if you feel like you can walk on water, you can only do it if God has called you to step out of the boat. Paul says, ‘…my prayer [is] that [you]…abound…in knowledge and…insight…that you may be able to discern what is best…’ (Philippians 1:9–10 NIV) Bottom line: don’t rely on your feelings, rely on the knowledge and truth of God’s Word. You may feel worthless, but God says, ‘…You are precious to Me …I love you.’ (Isaiah 43:4 NLT) You may feel like a failure, but God says, ‘There is…no condemnation for those…in Christ.’ (Romans 8:1 NIV) </btext>
