21800,Home Group - Tipping The Scales In Their Favour,"&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tipping The Scales In Their Favour&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Imagine this series of experiences happening to you; you're getting ready for church and when you arrive at church, someone asks you some pointed questions about a recent situation in your life you'd shared with them and their questions leave you thinking they're questioning whether your account is correct. While you're greeting people, you reach to shake the hand of a new person but they don't respond and leave you standing with your hand suspended in space as though you have leprosy and then when you're driving home, someone cuts you off and you have to swerve madly to avoid a collision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The normal response to these kinds of irritations - for that's all they really are, irritations - is to simply judge the person critiquing your version of events as to the situation you'd been involved in as ignorant and offensive, that the person who refused to shake your hand in greeting as patently rude and offensive; and the lunatic driver who cut you off is irresponsible and dangerous and should lose their license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;One of the biggest areas of controversy in the church today is the area of righteous judgment. We live in a world that celebrates and encourages some of the most heinous and wicked sins imaginable and this same world that denies the existence of God, denies the authority of God's Word and despises those who love and believe in God and His Word, is the same world that quotes Yeshua's words, &quot;Do not judge&quot; when we believers speak out against their sin and wickedness. They quote those words in a bid to shut us up, but what exactly did Yeshua mean when He spoke those words?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When it comes to 'judging others' there are generally 3 opinions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;1. We have no right to make any kind of judgment on other people because hey...we all sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;2. We have no right to say that the deeds of others is sin, to some people what they're doing is normal, we live in the 21st century and we have to get with the times. Live and let live!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;3. We need to call a spade a spade and call sin out...no compromise allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;But there are many different kinds of judgment in the Bible, and they are;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Judgment by God against unrepentant sinners &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Heb 9:27; Rev 20:11-15)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Judgment by God against fallen angelic beings &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Rev 20:7-10)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Judgment by church leadership over sin within the body &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Matt 18:15-20; 1 Pet 4:17; 1 Cor 5:12-13)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Judgment upon nations for their national sins &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Rom 1:18-32)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Judgment upon Yeshua on behalf of sinners &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(1 Pet 2:21-24)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Judgment upon leaders within the church &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Jam 3:1; 1 Pet 4:17; 2 Pet 2:3)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Judgment by individual believers for their own sins &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(1 Cor 11:28, 31; 1 Jn 5:16-17)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Judgment of individual believer's by Yeshua at the Bema Seat &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(1 Cor 3:12-15; 2 Cor 5:10)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Judgment by way of consequences &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Rom 1)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Then there's a general kind of judgment that we engage in throughout our day and that's what we're going to look at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Daily circumstances really do ruffle our feathers and we can be very critically minded about the motivations of what other people say and do and this is where Yeshua's command to not judge comes into play and this is seen very clearly in the context of &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;John 7&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;John 7:24, 'Do not judge according to appearance, but judge with righteous judgment.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The subject of judging or not judging has caused more angst and frustration within the church than possibly any other subject but that's mostly because we've not clearly understood that there are different kinds of judgment for different kinds of things. Yeshua never taught us to turn a blind eye to sin so therefore, calling sin what it is - which is making a judgment on a particular thing or behaviour - isn't in and of itself a sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The real problem with making righteous judgments comes from the motivations of our own heart and because we're talking about judgment in the little daily moments of our lives that's where we'll focus our study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Because we like to study Scripture through a Hebrew lens, it's well worth the effort to take a look at this kind of 'judging' from a Jewish perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;About 120 years before Yeshua was born, there was a rabbi whose name was Yehoshua ben Perachia and he said, &lt;i&gt;“Judge each person with the scales weighted in their favour.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If you lived in ancient times you'd have seen shoppers in the marketplace buying produce with the use of scales. One one side of the scale was a weight that was worth a certain amount of money, and on the other side of the scale, the object being purchased was place..say a bag of grain. A decent and friendly shopkeeper might put a little bit extra into the bag allowing the scale to tip past the balance point to make sure you really did get all you were paying for. He might allow the scale to tip in your favour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The point of rabbi Perachia is that when it comes to judging other people's actions, we should let the scales tip in their favour...in other words, give them the benefit of the doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yeshua was also a rabbi, He was very learned - much to the surprise of the other religious leaders He interacted with - and He was no stranger to the teaching of rabbi's before Him. So when He taught about righteous judging, it was very much according to earlier rabbinic teachings though vastly different from much of the teaching from His contemporaries which is why His words were so refreshing and new by comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Listen to His words in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Luke 6:37-38, &quot;Do not judge and you will not be judged; and do not condemn and you will not be condemned; pardon and you will be pardoned. Give and it will be given to you. They will pour into your lap a good measure - pressed down, shaken together, and running over. For by your standard of measure it will be measured to you in return.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The context of this verse is not money as many have tried to make it, rather it's about righteous judgment of other people. It's about not being judgmental or critical, it's about not being nitpicky and spiteful. If you read the verses beforehand, you'll see that the context is about treating others kindly, not being vengeful, about being grateful and merciful to others in the same way the Lord has been toward us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Here's an ancient rabbinic parable to illustrate the point.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;A man worked on a farm for three months. On the eve of the Day of Atonement, he went to his employer and asked for his wages to take home to his wife and children. The farm owner said to him, “I have no money to give you.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The farm hand protested, “Well, give me some of the crops I’ve helped grow.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The farmer replied, “I have none!”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The worker cried, “Well then, give me some of the sheep that I’ve helped to raise!”&amp;nbsp;The farmer shrugged and said that he had nothing he could give him.&amp;nbsp;So the farm hand gathered up his belongings and went home with a sorrowful heart.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;After the holidays, the employer came to the farmhand’s house with all of his wages, along with three carts full of extra gifts. They had dinner together, and as they ate, the farm owner asked, “When I told you I had no money, what did you suspect?”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;“I thought you had seen a bargain and used all your cash to buy it,” the worker replied.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;“And what did you think when I said that I had no crops?”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;“I thought perhaps they were all leased to others.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;“And what did you think when I said I had no animals?”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;“I thought that you may have dedicated them to the Temple.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The farmer answered him, “It was just this way. My son wouldn’t study the Scriptures, and the day you came to me, I had rashly dedicated all my possessions to God. But, just a couple days ago, I was absolved of my vow so that now I can pay you. And as for you, just as you have judged me favorably, may the Lord judge you favorably!”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In the parable, rather than the farm hand thinking the worst of the farm owner, he immediately gave him the benefit of the doubt as to why he had acted the way he did. This is what it means to weigh the scales in his favour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The last line in the parable is almost the same as the words of Yeshua; the parable says, &quot;You have judged me favourably, may the Lord judge you favourably,&quot; and Yeshua's words say, &quot;For by your standard of measure it will be measured to you in return.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This isn't really earth-shattering, but it's important for believer's to grasp and here's why...the natural response of the unsaved is to judge poorly. If someone cuts them off in traffic, the usual response is to respond with an expletive or hand gesture. If someone doesn't shake their hand, they might respond with a verbal insult or judge them as thinking they're too good to touch them and are 'racist' or 'bigoted'. If someone questions them over some particular circumstances they found themselves in, they might think the other person is automatically blaming them for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This is not the way believer's should automatically respond, if we have God the Holy Spirit living within us, then we're supposed to respond more like Yeshua would respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If we re-look at those normal, daily scenarios and tip the weight scales in the other person's favour we might respond like this...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Perhaps the person whose seeking more information about our particular circumstance has some practical assistance they can provide to us but needs more detail in order to be sure. They might just want to be better informed in order to lend a hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Maybe the person who refused to shake hands is really shy about meeting new people, or maybe they suffer with OCD and really struggle to come in contact with other people or maybe they have a skin condition that is embarrassing and they don't want anyone else to see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Maybe the person who was thoughtless in traffic was rushing to get to the hospital to see a friend or family member who was in an accident or perhaps his wife was rushed to hospital in labour and he didn't want to miss the birth of his baby. Perhaps he was desperate to simply get to the bathroom!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It's not actually important what the other person's motives are, what's important is ours!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We sometimes have days where we're busy and unintentionally treat other people a little carelessly. Some days we can be so concerned with the struggles of our own life and families that we might cut other's off in traffic but we don't do it deliberately. Perhaps we're self conscious for various reasons and withdraw from people not because we don't like them, but they might not know that. If we want others to give us the benefit of the doubt in our normal daily lives, shouldn't we extend the same grace to them? This is what it means to weight the scales in the other persons favour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This is something we can work on every day...some days it'll be easy, some days we'll forget and have to ask the Lord to forgive us and help us do better next time but it's a mindset we need to cultivate and when we do, we'll look more and more like our Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When Yeshua talked to His audiences about&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“judging favorably,” that is, assuming the best about other’s intentions rather than jumping to an unsavoury conclusion right off the bat, He was teaching in complete accord with the teachings of other rabbis who'd lived long before Him, but His ideas on judging have a slightly different slant. When we judge others favorably, we're assuming that a person is basically good, however, Yeshua's understanding of humanity was a lot less optimistic. He had already said that there are none good but God &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Luke 18:19)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, rather, His words about judging are based on knowing that your neighbour is a sinner and giving them the benefit of the doubt anyway because you know that you're also a sinner just like them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If we extend condemnation and judgment on them, we are bringing condemnation and judgment on ourselves as well. We know how much we need mercy, grace and forgiveness for our own sins, weaknesses and failings and as such, we need to extend mercy, grace and forgiveness to others as well. The motivations of another person's heart is really only known and understood by two people, God and the person themselves. Likewise, the only people who know and understand the motivations of our own heart is ourselves and God and that's more than enough to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Mandy&lt;/p&gt;

21798,Home Group - The Real Treasure On Mt Sinai,"&lt;p&gt;July 22, 2015&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;The Real Treasure On Mt Sinai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;If we were sitting in a room together and we found out we were going to begin a study of the book of Leviticus, we'd probably hear a collective groan ripple around the room and the reason would be because Leviticus is a pretty tough-to-read book let alone understand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It's a book loaded with restrictions, consequences and detail after detail about sacrifices that, let's be honest, are pretty repellent to us in our day and culture. It's true to say that most modern teachers use Leviticus as an example of how tough life used to be and therefore we should be thrilled and appreciative that we live under the New Covenant that saw all the Mosaic Law fulfilled in Messiah and is now no longer active as it used to be. Leviticus is a tough going read for Christians today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, if we were living in the days of the ancient Hebrews and were standing beside Mt Sinai, how would we have understood the Laws communicated by Moses? Would we have considered them ridiculous, irrational and unreasonable?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many of the rules detailed in Leviticus sound weird and even repellent to us but to the ancient ears of the Israelites, they weren't a surprise at all. All ancient cultures - and even modern cultures - had rules concerning food, rituals concerning relationships, festivals and celebrations, standards concerning purity and immorality and of course a criminal code for those who broke the laws. All cultures throughout the world had and continue to have them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The real shocker with regard to the Law that God gave to Moses on Mt Sinai however, was found in the ethics of the Torah that God demanded His people live by. Today, we simply don't understand or appreciate how revolutionary the Torah was in comparison to all other cultures and civil codes at that time in human history, or how absolutely fundamental the precepts of the Torah are to our own laws.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;All throughout the Torah, it demands fairness and concern for all humanity and that was revolutionary in the ancient world. Other cultural or national codes had no ethic of equal treatment in regard to rich and poor and that meant that if a crime was committed against a person of high class, the punishment was far greater than if the crime had been committed against someone of lower class. Cheating an average person got you into trouble but cheating a nobleman carried the death penalty in some cultures. Murdering a peasant incurred a fine but murdering someone of standing or wealth would also result in a death sentence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This was not the case in Israel under the law of Torah, all citizens be they rich or poor, of high standing or low, all were treated the same under Torah. This is a standard that continued into the teaching of the New Covenant as well, which is not separate from the Torah, but simply the completion of it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;James 2:2-3, 'If a man comes into your assembly with a gold ring and dressed in fine clothes, and there also comes in a poor man in dirty clothes, and you pay special attention to the one who is wearing the fine clothes, and say, &quot;You sit here in a good place,&quot; and you say to the poor man, &quot;You stand over there or sit down by my footstool,&quot; have you not made distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil motives.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yeshua Himself taught those who listened to Him to treat all people with respect and dignity too. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Luke 14:12-14, 'He (Yeshua) also went on to say to the one who had invited Him, &quot;When you give a luncheon or a dinner, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbours, otherwise they may also invite you in return and that will be your repayment. But when you give a reception, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, and you will be blessed, since they do not have the means to repay you; for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.&quot;'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;When it came to criminal acts in ancient Israel, if someone was accused of committing a crime, guilt could only be established with two or more witnesses and it mattered not who the accused was or who the witnesses were; they were all treated as equals under the law. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Deut 17:6, 19:15)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In dealing with criminal acts, the Torah was far more humane and fair when compared with other codes. In other countries, punishments for even minor offenses could be brutal and way out of proportion and they included floggings, amputations and even torture. In the Torah, fines were common but physical punishments were actually very rare which many would find surprising. In fact, physical punishments were reserved for only the most severe and serious offenses against the nation or against God Himself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;But you might respond by saying, &quot;What about God's command of 'an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth'?&quot; Well, that particular statement has been greatly misunderstood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth' was more of an idiom than a literal command. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Exodus 21&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; lists a string of crimes and the corresponding punishments; when you get to verses &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;24 &amp;amp; 25&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; it says, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;'eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This leaves you thinking that if someone pokes another person's eye out, the &lt;i&gt;poker&lt;/i&gt; should have his own eye poked out to match the &lt;i&gt;pokee&lt;/i&gt;, but that's not the case at all. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Verses 26 &amp;amp; 27&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; explain more clearly. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;'If a man strikes the eye of his male or female slave, and destroys it, he shall let him go free on account of his eye. And if he knocks out a tooth of his male or female slave, he shall let him go free on account of his tooth.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This was revolutionary and shocking in the ancient world and reveals something about God and how He views all people. Firstly, a slave according to the Torah had rights and was to be treated respectfully and with dignity, they were not to be harmed or abused and if a man blinded a slave - male OR female - that slave was to be granted their freedom. Notice that the law didn't say that the slave owner had to be blinded in one of his eyes. No, the punishment had to be righteous and commensurate with the offense - in other words...eye for an eye, not a harsh rebuke for an eye...the consequence had to be of 'equal value.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;You blind your slave, the slave goes free. You knock out a slaves tooth, the slave goes free. You commit a capital crime you incur a capital punishment. The intention of the idiom was to ensure that a punishment for any particular crime would not be more that the injury itself and neither would it be a slap on the wrist for something serious. We would say that the punishment had to fit the crime and it prevented vigilante justice by family and friends of the injured person and so prevented feuds between families and tribes. In fact, most scholars believe that in ancient Israel, monetary fines were required for injuries instead of physical retribution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As for protecting and defending citizens, especially the poor, the weak, the disenfranchised and the foreigner, the Torah was completely different to other codes who mainly focused on protecting the assets and well-being of the wealthy by threatening lower classes with severe punishments for theft or destruction of property. But the Torah is uniquely focused on protection for the most vulnerable in society, vulnerable widows, orphans, the poor, foreigners and the disenfranchised. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Deut 18:29, Lev 23:22)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In fact, the Torah commanded Israel to love the vulnerable members of their society as they loved themselves. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Lev 19:34)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A very large amount of the Torah is specifically focused on protecting the weakest members of society.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are a great many people around the world who condemn the Bible as being a book that endorses slavery; mostly this view comes from a lack of true understanding of God's Word, God's character and the historic culture and context.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Firstly, slavery was a standard practice in all the ancient world. Many people were enslaved by conquering nations who enslaved those they conquered. In Israel however, this wasn't the case.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the ancient world, and in many nations of the world today, there was no such thing as social security. If a person became impoverished, he couldn't pop down to the local Israeli Centre Link and register for benefits, housing, food vouchers and a tax payer funded vehicle. Rather, an impoverished person or family might live in abject beggary living on the good will of others, doing odd jobs here and there for a few shekels or food as well as eating according to the Hebrew law of gleaning that God instituted to allow the poor to make their way through the crop fields after the first harvest to collect what was missed. This was a kind of 'social security' with regard to food but it wasn't via a government department, it was a standard of provision enacted by every citizen of the nation as a way of assisting the vulnerable and needy according to God's requirement of them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;For those who didn't want to live that way, an impoverished person could indenture himself and or his family to the service of another person or family for an agreed upon period of time in order to earn money or pay off a debt. The 'owner' was required to pay for every single need of his slave and his family (if he had one). The 'owner' was not allowed to abuse or mistreat his 'slaves' and he had to pay his 'slave' his proper wages.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In other cultures, not only did slaves have no rights, their lives were literally in their master's hands, hanging on the whims of their owners and they never received a day off for rest or for their own personal time, unless their owners allowed it, but certainly no law required it. According to Torah however, everyone - including slaves - were to enjoy the Sabbath as a day of rest. As mentioned above, if a slave was permanently injured by his owner, he was to be immediately granted his freedom. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Ex 21:27)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Hebrew slaves had to be freed in six years and given a substantial gift, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Deut 15:14)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and if a slave ran away he was not to be returned, but was to be allowed to live free anywhere in Israel. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Deut 23:15-16)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In all other codes - even that of pre-Civil War America and also in England - the penalty for a runaway slave was death.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In fact, in Israel, God repeatedly reminded His people to treat slaves and foreigners well, who lived among them and to never forget that they too were once slaves and foreigners in Egypt where they were treated appallingly. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Deut 5:14-15; 15:7-15; 16:10-12; 24:14-22)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yes, God instituted a penal code that seems to us to be quite extreme but that penal code - the Law - was given so that we would understand just how high and holy our God is. His ways and the expectations He had of His people is not only high, but it's beyond our ability to keep it. Does that seem unfair? It's not. If we didn't have the Law, we would never know just how far short we've fallen from attaining God's standard and we'd never realise that we were constantly offending and insulting Him. We'd never realise why we so desperately need a Saviour because we wouldn't realise how wicked we are.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Romans 7:7-12, 'What shall we say then? Is the Law sin? May it never be! On the contrary, I would not have come to know sin except through the Law; for I would not have known about coveting if the Law had not said, &quot;You shall not covet&quot;...So then the Law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;God expects us to not only obey Him but also to treat others well. Human beings, regardless of their class, social standing, lineage, position, wealth, skin colour, creed or nationality are all created in the image and likeness of God and we are to treat them as such. Unfortunately, because we're all law breakers, there will always be those who will take advantage of the vulnerable, who will wrought the system, who will be corrupt and abuse their position and their fellow citizens. This is why the world is in the mess it's in today, not because God gave too harsh a Law. The Law reveals our sinful nature and that without God's help, we'll never meet His standards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Galatians 3:23-24, 'But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the Law, being shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed. Therefore the Law has become our tutor to lead us to Messiah, so that we may be justified by faith.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Torah reveals some unique things about God that are completely absent in other so-called gods; He is fair and just and He expects His people to also be fair and just at all levels and strata of society; He is extremely compassionate and demands that all people, especially the weak and vulnerable, be treated with grace, care and mercy and He deems human life to be sacred.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As faith in the God of the Bible spread throughout the world, the cultures that embraced His Word were transformed by these same basic principles and ethics. We can see within the cultures of the West which have a Judeo-Christian heritage, that when leaders and citizens reject God and His word, the culture and society disintegrates and the most adversely affected within our societies are the weak and vulnerable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The more you learn and understand the Old Covenant and books like Leviticus in their ancient Hebrew context and culture, the more you'll understand the full scope of the New Covenant. People see Yeshua as a 'different' kind of God to the God of the Old Covenant, but Yeshua was simply returning the focus and attention of His people back to the original standards, ethics and expectations that God revealed through Moses to them on Mt Sinai, because they'd moved so far away from it. As Yeshua said to His own disciples, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;If you've seen Me, you've seen the Father.&quot; (John 14:9)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Those who follow Yeshua don't just follow the example He set, but also the example the Father set for His people after He delivered them from slavery in Egypt so that when they entered the Promised Land, they would reflect His nature and character to the rest of the world. They were to be a light to the nations and so are we. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Isa 42:6, 49:6, 60:3; Matt 5:14)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mandy &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Our Sins...How Can God Forget Them?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing is impossible for God right? Then how is it possible for God to forget our sins after He's forgiven them? It's sounds like a complete contradiction?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Isaiah 43:25, &quot;I, even I, am the one who wipes out your transgressions for My own sake, and I will not remember your sins.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This is a remarkable statement by God to His people Israel after He goes into detail in all the preceding verses about how they've been sent into exile because of their sin and how they rebelled against Him and forgot Him, yet God promises to bring them back from the north, south, east and west - even though they were only going into the Babylonian captivity at that time (God knew there would be another dispersion in their future into the entire world) - and that when He would bring them back, wipe out their transgressions and not remember their sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hebrews 8:10-12, &quot;For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will put My laws into their minds and I will write them on their hearts and I will be their God, and they shall be My people. And they shall not teach everyone His fellow citizen and everyone his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord,' for all will know Me, from the least to the greatest of them. For I will be merciful to their iniquities and I will remember their sins no more.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This is God's promise to His people that when He establishes His New Covenant with them, He will be merciful toward them and forgive their sin and indeed, He won't remember their sin anymore!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hebrews 10:14-17, 'For by one offering He has perfected for all time those who are sanctified. And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us; for after saying, &quot;This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days,&quot; says the Lord: &quot;I will put My laws upon their heart and on their mind I will write them,&quot; He then says, &quot;And their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more.&quot;'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Again, God promised to establish a New Covenant with His people and His promise included all their sins being forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Psalm 103:10-13, 'He has not dealt with us according to our sins, nor rewarded us according to our iniquities. For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is His lovingkindness toward those who fear him. As far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from us. Just as a father has compassion on his children, so the Lord has compassion on those who fear Him.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;How can God forget something when He knows everything? Sometimes there are Bible passages that make you scratch your head trying to understand them. Again, how can God, in His infinite intelligence and knowledge, forget anything, let alone the entire accumulation of the sins of all His children?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The other side of this subject is that the Lord said that we are to forgive the sins of others in the same way He's forgiven us our sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Does God really expect us to forgive and to forget the sins of others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;I heard a story about a young woman who had been raped by a babysitter when she was only 10 years old and over many years she tried very hard to forgive her attacker however she was most distressed by the fact that she couldn't forget the horror of what happened to her. What concerned her most was that if she couldn't forget, perhaps she hadn't really forgiven and therefore, God wouldn't forgive her either. How could anyone possibly forget such a crime?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Did you know that the English language consists of about 100,000 words? By comparison the Hebrew language has about 4,000 words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In English, when we use the word 'remember' it's entirely focused on the idea of memory recollection and bringing those recollections into our thoughts. To 'forget' in English simply means we've failed to bring a certain memory to mind. Both these English words - 'remember' and 'forget' describe a mental activity whether there is material or information to the specific memory present or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;By contrast, the Hebrew word for 'remember' is the &lt;i&gt;verb&lt;/i&gt; 'zakhar' and its meaning is much wider; it not only means the mental activity of remembering something, but it also means the actions that are taken because of remembering something. It also can imply a person doing a favour for someone, helping them or being faithful to a promise or covenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When Noah built the ark and God sent the rain and the flood covered the whole earth, Noah, his family and the animals survived on board but after a period of time God remembered Noah and all the animals on the ark with him, and as a result, God caused a wind to pass over the earth and the water subsided and they were all able to leave the ark. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Gen 8:1)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God didn't just suddenly wake up one morning, slap His forehead and remember that Noah and all the animals were still floating aimlessly on the waters and therefore quickly sent a great wind to help dry up the water! Not at all, what the passage is actually telling us is that God acted upon His promise that He'd already given to Noah; it was an action according to the promise God had made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another example is when God remembered Rachel whose womb God had closed because Jacob had treated Leah so unlovingly; He remembered Rachel, He listened to her and opened her womb. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Gen 30:22)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This act of remembrance was more than a mere mental activity as though one day God suddenly remembered that Rachel was unable to fall pregnant, rather God actually responded to Rachel's prayer and her desire to have a child and He did something about it; He intervened and opened her womb. It was more than mere mental exercise.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;With regard to the word 'forget', the Hebrew words are 'shakach' and 'nashah' and are also very broad in their meaning. Quite often they mean to ignore or neglect, sometimes to forsake or disregard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;An example of this can be found in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Deuteronomy 4:23&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; when God warned His people not to 'forget' the covenant they'd made with the Lord by making idols for themselves which would result in God's judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God wasn't saying that they might literally forget that they'd made a covenant with God and have it completely erased from their memory banks; no, God was warning them not to intentionally ignore their covenant with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God also threatened His people that if they don't stop their sin, He might even forget them and cast them away from Him. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Jer 23:39)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But how is that possible, God knows everything and if He created an entire people who are living on His earth, how can He not know who they are?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The emphasis in this passage just like the previous one is on an action, not a mental activity. God was warning His people that His action would be to turn from them, not wipe them from His memory. We need to re-understand or re-define the words 'remember' and 'forget' with a Hebrew understanding rather than an English understanding - they're action words and they make understanding God's intention much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;David said in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Psalm 13:1, 'How long, O Lord will You forget me forever? How long will You hide Your face from me?'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; When you understand that David didn't believe that God had wiped him from His memory, rather David was asking God how long it would be before He took action on his behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our original question is now much easier to understand...how can God forget our sins when He knows everything? God doesn't forget anything!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God was telling His people that when He restores them to Himself, He will forgive them and not take action against them for all the wickedness that they've done. He's not saying He'll wipe all remembrance of them or their sins from His memory so that He has no idea of what they did, rather He promised to not give them what they actually deserved for all that they've done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If this is God's promise then there are serious implications? For example, if God simply ignores a person's sins (or an entire nations) then He's guilty of 2 things: 1) He's unjust in turning a blind eye to sin and 2) He's guilty of favouritism in letting some people off scott free while judging others for the same thing. How can that be? Well, it's not like that at all; God is never unjust and God gives grace and opportunity to all men no matter who they are, where they live or what their lineage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When God made His promises about not remembering the sins of His people, it was in conjunction with what He Himself called the New Covenant that would be embedded in their heart not merely inscribed on parchment. The New Covenant was written and purchased by the blood of Yeshua the Messiah and the day is yet to come when Israel - a national people - will indeed come to faith in Yeshua their Messiah and the New Covenant will be written in their hearts and God will not take action against them for all their sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;For the past 2,000 years approximately, the Gentile world has had the light of God's Word and the understanding of Yeshua the Messiah and an incredible opportunity to be grafted into the New Covenant whereas the Jewish people have been living under judicial blindness all this time. The wonderful news of course is that more and more are coming to faith today and it would seem that the judicial blindness is lifting slowly but surely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How then should we as believer's live according to the Hebrew understanding of remembering and forgetting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we've committed sins or have had sins committed against us, we can't wipe them from our memory banks, that's simply beyond our ability. Rather, God wants us to imitate Him so that we forgive others for what they've done and then not take action against them for what they did, in the same way that God forgives us and doesn't take action against us for all that we've done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Genesis 1:27, 'God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Genesis 2:7, 'Then the Lord God formed man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;These 2 verses in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Genesis 1 &amp;amp; 2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; present us with a bit of a paradox in that God created human beings in His own image and then describes how He created them from the dirt on the ground...we're frail carbon based life here on planet earth, and yet in our frailty we reflect the glory of God almighty. Though we are but dust we carry the image and likeness of God. How can we be mere dust and yet reflect the image and likeness of God...it's a paradox!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Adam was the first man and some Bible dictionaries say his name means 'red' but more indepth study reveals that the name Adam means 'acre man' which is a man who produces agricultural crops. Interestingly, the Hebrew word adamah&amp;nbsp;is the Hebrew word of “ground” and Adam was created from the adamah and his task was to work the&amp;nbsp;adamah and when he died his physical body was returned to the&amp;nbsp;adamah. Adam was the very first 'earthling' and yet there was nothing ordinary about him because when God formed Adam from the adamah, He then breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and Adam became a 'living being'. This act by God Himself breathing His breath into Adam set him apart from the rest of His creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;An 18th century rabbi said,&lt;i&gt; “A person should always carry two slips of paper, one in each pocket. On one it should be written ‘The world was created for my sake,’ and on the other it should say ‘I am but dust and ashes.’” [i]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#_edn1&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;On days when we feel discouraged and worthless, we should read the first note. On days when we’re consumed with pride and our own self-importance, we should read the other note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;C.S. Lewis wrote a book called 'The Weight Of Glory' and in it he stresses the point that by understanding the eternal significance of every person we meet, it should alter the way we treat them. [ii]&lt;a href=&quot;#_edn1&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Every person has the possibility of becoming someone of great renown; a politician, an artist, a musician, an author, a spokesman, an inventor; and along with that 'great renown' comes the possibility that other human beings could treat them as being more than human, like little gods or goddesses, deified and given adulation and worship. This is not a far-fetched statement because we see this happening all around us all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Consider the adoration and worship of musicians and politicians like Obama or the way the German people revered Hitler and even the way royalty has been revered throughout millennia; artists, sports men and women, authors who are treated as though they're the messiah and have all the answers for humanity's woes. And yet...these same human gods and goddesses can fall from favour in the blink of an eye and can become despised, ostracised and ridiculed and the video's of it will go globally viral in a matter of hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We live in a day and age that is positively obsessed with 'self' and 'self' permeates our entire lives, consider these very common terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The problem we have in our society is that we elevate humanity so much that we deify man falsely making humanity far more than we really are; in effect making ourselves the centre of the universe but in so doing, we humanise God bringing Him down to our human level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;How many times have we heard someone say that the reason God created us was because He was lonely? God...the Creator of the universe, the First Person of the Godhead, who was, always has and always will be in perfect union and fellowship with the God the Son and God the Holy Spirit was lonely and the only way He could overcome that loneliness was to create people??? Really?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;That is absolutely not taught anywhere in Scripture and it's not even inferred anywhere in Scripture. God doesn't need human beings to overcome loneliness and He doesn't need us for Him to be complete...He is ALL sufficient and complete and is in perfect fellowship and harmony within the Godhead. He created us for His glory and for our benefit...not for His benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Isaiah 43:7, 'Everyone who is called by My name, and &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;whom I have created for My glory&lt;/span&gt;, whom I have formed, even whom I have made.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Man was created in God's image so that we would stand out from the rest of His creation allowing us to have fellowship with Him, again for our benefit, however our form comes from Him, our living soul comes from Him, our creativity comes from Him, our intelligence comes from Him, not from within or by our own selves and therefore, we must always remember that we are but dust. The incredible nature of each human being however, is a direct result of Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Keeping our perception of ourselves in balance and in accordance with God's Word is incredibly important. Human beings are the pinnacle of God's creation; listen to what David says in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Psalm 139&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Psalm 139:1-18, 'O Lord, You have searched me and known me. You know when I sit down and when I rise up; You understand my thought from afar. You scrutinise my path and my lying down, and are intimately acquainted with all my ways. Even before there is a word on my tongue, behold, O Lord, You know it all. You have enclosed me behind and before, and laid Your hand upon me. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is too high, I cannot attain to it. Where can I go from Your Spirit? Or where can I flee from Your presence? If I ascend to heaven, You are there; if I make my bed in Sheol, behold, You are there. If I take the wings of the dawn, if I dwell in the remotest part of the sea, even there Your hand will lead me, and Your right hand will lay hold of me. If I say, &quot;Surely the darkness will overwhelm me, and the light around me will be night.&quot; Even the darkness is not dark to You, and the night is as bright as the day. Darkness and light are alike to You. &amp;nbsp;For You formed my inward parts; You wove me in my mother's womb. I will give thanks to You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; wonderful are Your works, and my soul knows it very well. My frame was not hidden from You, when I was made in secret, and skillfully wrought in the depths of the earth; Your eyes have seen my unformed substance; and in Your book were all written the days that were ordained for me, when as yet there was not one of them. &amp;nbsp;How precious are Your thoughts to me, O God! How vast is the sum of them! If I should count them, they would outnumber the sand. When I awake, I am still with You.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The object of absolute focus and awe of the psalmist in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Psalm 139&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is God...in fact, the psalmist expresses just how overwhelmed he is at how powerful and amazing God is when he says that the knowledge and intimate understanding that God has of him no matter where he is or what he's doing is &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;too wonderful for me; it's too high and I cannot attain to it.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The most striking thing that the psalmist expresses is great humility because he realises that while God is &amp;nbsp;intimately aware of him as an individual - which is wonderful and marvelous and beyond comprehension - &amp;nbsp;he realises how unbelievably small he is in comparison to His Maker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Back to our self-driven society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Because we're so self-focused and self-obsessed we elevate ourselves to the point where man has deified himself. On the flip-side, we have made God so casual, so approachable, so friendly and so indulgent that we've pulled Him down to our level and humanised Him. So man has deified himself and humanised God making the gap so small that there's not that much difference. This is very dangerous and totally anti-Biblical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Isaiah 55:8-9, '&quot;For My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways My ways,&quot; declares the Lord. &quot;For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways and My thoughts than your thoughts.&quot;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In truth, the gap between God and His human creation is so wide it's beyond measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Because we've elevated ourselves so much, we're experiencing an very peculiar phenomenon in that the more our society drives home the importance of 'self', the more dissatisfied we are and the more personal crisis' our society experiences. People are more unhappy and dissatisfied with who they are than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Men wanting to be women, women wanting to be men, white people wanting to be black and black people wanting to be white, tall people wanting to be short and short people wanting to be tall. Rich people wanting more and poor people wanting what the rich have. There are people who are now associating themselves as being dragons, dogs, cats and wolves and still others are marrying their pets and some people have even been known to marry buildings, walls and bridges and that's not a joke!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The more man elevates himself the further he falls. Elevating self isn't working! The struggle really comes from knowing or understanding our worth, we all want to be valuable to someone for something, we strive for worth and value through competition, pride, and tearing others down but this doesn't prove worth and value, it in fact proves the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Conversely, we might think that humility is about seeing ourselves as useless, untalented, and insignificant. That's not humility, it's false humility. What constitute's true humility?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Proverbs 15:33, 'The fear of the Lord is the instruction for wisdom, and before honour comes humility.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Proverbs 18:12, 'Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, but humility goes before honour.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Bible's view of humility isn't one of self-actualisation, self-esteem, self-promotion and self-satisfaction, rather the Bible's view of humility is inseparably entwined with healthy, reverential fear of God and the destruction of a heart full of haughty pride. Humility then is about self-denial, self-discipline and self-critique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This seems to fly in the face of pop-psychology that has invaded and permeates our culture so thoroughly. It's very true that there are a lot of people dealing with a lot of issues, there are a great many people experiencing extreme emotional and this is usually the result of behaviours either of the individual or other individuals in their lives. Things they've done themselves or things done to them by others and the pain is real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;However, because all of humanity is broken and in pain as a result of sin, we're all in exactly the same predicament. It's not a new predicament, it's an ancient one and we don't need self-esteem and self-confidence, we need to understand that we are but dust, clay vessels that are in fact broken, who need forgiveness and restoration from the Master Potter who formed and created us in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Understand that our greatest need is for forgiveness and restoration - just like every other cracked, broken clay human pot reveals just how valued we are to our Maker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;First, He created us and the fact that He created us in the first place proves that He wants us to be part of Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Second, before He created us He knew that we would sin and become broken and cracked and damaged so He set His plan of redemption in motion and went ahead and created us. Why? Because He loves and values His creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Third, His plan of redemption required that God would take on human form, becoming one of us, in order to die in our place for our sin so that we could be healed, restored and become His children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Fourth, understanding the extreme depth of God's love, compassion and commitment to save cracked, broken clay humanity should result in our exaltation of His goodness and grace, and our own grateful humility. Grateful that God would go to such extreme lengths to rescue us and humility because we know all too well just how broken, cracked and weak we really are - He rescued damaged goods!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Back to the paradox...yes, we are but dust; physical human creations with bodies that are marvelous and wondrously created, but clay vessels that have been cracked and broken by sin and the consequences of sin, but our great value and worth doesn't come from us but from that fact that we have been created in the image and likeness of God Himself - we're not divine, we're reflecting the divine One who created, rescued and restored us. Both the saint and sinner reflect the image and likeness of God and that's where the value of humanity lies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Jewish community have been ridiculed since their community began because of their distinctiveness not only in how they dress but in their cultural and religious traditions. Some of their traditions needed to be criticised because they were violating the Word of God and Yeshua called the religious leaders out about them, but not all their traditions are bad or contravene Scripture. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Matt 15)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But not all Jewish traditions are bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;One of the distinct things about Judaism is it's literal understand of God's Word; for example when God commanded His people to be diligent in teaching and obeying His commands, He said they were to study and teach them both day and night and to bind them on their hand and before their eyes and to put them on their doorposts and their gates. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Deut 6:7-9)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;To this day, religious Jews are committed to studying and teaching Torah day and night, even while they're working or spending time with their family and friends, just going about their daily lives...no matter what they're doing, they make the Word of God the ever-present action in all they do. Orthodox and religious Jews wear phylacteries containing the Word of God on their forehead and on the inside of their left arm in order to be obedient to God's command and they also place the Word of God on the doors of them homes and some even on the gates of their properties. Why? Because God commanded them to keep His Word before their eyes all the time so they wouldn't forget it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Wearing the Tsit-Tsit (tassels) on their clothing is quite a humbling thing because in other nations of the world, this distinct markers make them a target for aggression and persecution. Another thing they often wear is a kippah, the small disc-like piece of cloth on their heads, and it also makes them a target, especially if they live anywhere but in Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The kippah is not mandated in the Bible, but traditionally it began with a particularly pious rabbi who began wearing it as a mark of humility. When a man prays to God he covers his head in a show of humility because as a sinful, fallen man he cannot stand upright and uncovered before God, but when a man finishes praying, his prayer shawl (tallit) is folded carefully and put away and he goes about his daily work. This particular rabbi believed that no matter where he was, God was there because God is omnipresent, so he began wearing the small kippah to ensure he expressed humility in God's presence no matter where he was or what he was doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Our value and worth should be expressed through genuine humility and our example of godly humility can be seen in the life of Yeshua, he exemplified humility and we are called to imitate Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Philippians 2:3-11, 'Don't do anything from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves; don't merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others. Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Yeshua Messiah, who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men. Being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. For this reason also, God highly exalted Him, and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name, so that at the name of Yeshua, every knee will bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and that every tongue will confess that Yeshua Messiah is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mandy &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

20709,Home Group - If Your Eye Causes You To Sin,"&lt;p&gt;17 June, 2015&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;If Your Eye Causes You To Sin&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;em style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Matthew 18:8-9, Yeshua taught, &quot;If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it from you; it's better for you to enter life crippled or lame, than to have two hands or two feet and be cast into the eternal fire. If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it from you. It's better for you to enter life with one eye, than to have two eyes and be cast into the fiery hell.'&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There are some things that Yeshua said during His ministry years that are really difficult to understand, they sound like literal commands but does He really want us to cut off our hands or feet if we use them in committing a sin? If we look at something we shouldn't and it leads us to sin, does the Lord really want us to pluck out our eyes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What about this verse?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Matthew 18:6, &quot;Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it would be better for him to have a heavy millstone hung around his neck, and to be drowned in the depth of the sea.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Wow...that's really graphic! Some of the things Yeshua said are really harsh and over the centuries there have been no small number of individuals who actually did believe these 'commands' were to be interpreted and enacted literally. How should we read, interpret and apply them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;I've mentioned this many times before but it needs to be repeated constantly and it's the fact that we in the western church are living with the consequences of having expelled every element or hint of 'Jewishness' from the Word of God and Yeshua our Messiah seriously limiting our ability to understand and interpret Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;However, difficult passages such as the these can be understood more clearly and without concern or confusion if we understand ancient rabbinic culture and teaching methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Mishnah, which is a book containing the oral law or tradition believed to be handed down from Moses which provides insight and understanding on how to live out and apply the written Law - the Torah - given to Moses on Mt Sinai. It's NOT inspired Scripture so we don't treat it as being flawless and infallible, but it is incredibly helpful and insightful to understand ancient Jewish culture and religious practices and how they understood and interpreted God's Word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Extreme examples were very much a part of ancient rabbinic methodology that were used to emphasise the importance of what they were teaching their disciples. An example of this can be found in the Mishnah itself where it says, &quot;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;When three eat at one table and words of Torah are not spoken there, it is as if they ate at the altars of the dead… But when three eat at one table and bring up words of Torah, it is as if they ate from the table of God!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;(Mishnah, Avot 3.2-3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The lesson expressed in this passage of the Mishnah is that eating food is a daily occurrence and it's necessary for life, but the Torah, the Word of God is even more essential for life and if we go about our daily grind and neglect to make the Word of God central in all we do, we're really no different from pagans who worship at the altars of dead, false idols, because we've neglected the very essence of our life and existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This extreme example is used to emphasise as strongly as possible how essential the Word of God is to our life and that God's Word should not be relegated to certain times of the day or week, but should permeate even the ordinary, mundane elements that make up our days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yeshua said during His time of temptation in the wilderness in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Matthew 4:4, ...&quot;It is written, 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.&quot;'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Here's another example of rabbinic teaching using extreme language and description to emphasise an important point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;The pain of humiliation is more bitter than death. Therefore, one should rather fling himself into a fiery furnace than humiliate someone in public.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(Talmud, Bava Metzia 59a)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This particular example is akin to the words of Yeshua about plucking out our eyes or cutting off our hands or feet if they've caused us to sin. However, the point of this teaching is that humiliating a person in a public manner is unbelievably damaging and destructive to them; the consequences and repercussions on them can impact their entire lives and cause them untold grief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Talmud is absolutely NOT instructing people to self-immolate if they're ever tempted to castigate someone publically, rather, it's an instruction to reject the notion of doing something so destructive to another person and if need be, to remove themselves from the environment that would allow them to do it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In June 2013, a young man in Idaho in the US committed suicide after a local sheriff's office humiliated him when they wrote a sarcastic post on his facebook page about him being wanted for arrest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;A police officer committed suicide after being falsely accused of rape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;A civil servant was accused of racism online and then committed suicide. He left a note saying he had never been racist, and had actually established a multi-faith group to promote equality for minority groups. However, he knew that once someone was branded as racist, they'd be stuck with it for the rest of their life and he couldn't live with the humiliation of being thought of that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;A 13 year old girl committed suicide after her father posted a humiliating video clip online of him shaming her for bad behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Teenagers who bully their peers in public forums, humiliating them in dreadful ways that leads them to the point where they feel they can't go to school or out in public, have caused some to kill themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Humiliating other people, especially in a public forum is unconscionable and the passage from the Talmud tries to teach this by using such an extreme example so that the lesson will be understood:&amp;nbsp; humiliating others can have extreme and catastrophic consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Here's another example of something Yeshua said that really confuses and confounds people when they read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Luke 14:26, &quot;If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be My disciple.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What? Is the Lord really saying that anyone who wants to be His disciple has to hate everyone in his entire family and even himself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In the Sermon on the Mount Yeshua said, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbour and hate your enemy.' But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.&quot; (Matt 5:43-44)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If you put these verses together you come away thinking that the Lord wants us to hate every member of our family - people whom we love and are very close to, but we're supposed to love our enemies and do good things for them...it's confusing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Apostle John adds more confusion to this dilemma by saying, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;'Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer; and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.' (1 John 3:15)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; He also said, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;'If someone says,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;I love God,&quot; and hates his brother, he is a liar; for the one who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen.' (1 John 4:20)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Which is it? Should I hate my family or should I love my family?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Actually, the Lord wasn't presenting His disciples with an expectation for them to hate anybody at all, to do so would have been completely opposite of all He had taught them and would continue to teach them during the remainder of His earthly ministry. The point He was making to them was that being His disciple comes at a cost and sometimes the cost can be extreme. Being devoted to Him can cost us even our closest relationships and our love and commitment to Him must be so strong that not one person and not one thing will ever cause us to turn away from Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This has been the experience of believers from the days of Yeshua to the present. They hear the Gospel, they come to faith and begin following Him and their family and friends become irritated and then hostile giving an ultimatum...&lt;i&gt;if you don't stop being a religious fanatic or a 'Jesus Freak' then we want nothing to do with you...make your choice...it's Him or us!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Many believers over the centuries, who have refused to forsake their love and faith in Yeshua have been ostracised and even murdered for their faith, even at the hands of their own families, and it's still happening today. The extreme example Yeshua used was communicating to His disciples the extreme cost that comes to those who follow Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;All these examples show us how important it is to understand these rabbinic teaching methods to demonstrate the importance of the point they were trying to make. This was culturally understood and those listening knew very well that they were overstatements used only to reinforce and emphasis the point of the lesson. Extreme examples pointed to immensely important lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In fact, this method of teaching; using extreme examples to communicate important truths and life lessons isn't as foreign to us as we might think because we use them ourselves in various settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;For example, a mother might raise her voice to her son or daughter who has just done something really, really naughty and say something like, &quot;Wait until your father sees what you've done, he's going to go through the roof when he gets home!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The father isn't going to literally go through the roof with explosive anger, but the mother is conveying to her child that their father is going to be furious when he discovers their misdemeanor...he'll be absolutely livid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Or what about a parent who confronts their teenager over dangerous or foolish behaviour that could result in death or ending up in a wheelchair for the rest of their life? The teen responds by saying that it's no big deal and all their friends do it so the parent might retort back and say, &quot;If your friends told you to jump off a cliff would you do it?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Of course they would never do something so obviously dangerous and both the parent and the teenager are equally aware of how ludicrous the question is and that the answer is obviously 'No', but the parent uses this extreme example in a bid to emphasise to their teenager the gravity of and potential for disaster that could come from their behaviour because they blindly follow the foolish example of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Our Messiah never used careless or frivolous words, in fact ever word He spoke was perfect and righteous and absolutely true, and as such, we must be very careful to never minimize some of the hard things He said. What He said is critically important, but it's incumbent upon us to dig a little deeper than the surface and place His words and statements back in their context and their cultural setting so that we understand clearly His intention and the message He was communicating to His disciples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;When we make that effort, we not only grow in our understanding of His Word and how we are supposed to live out our faith, but we also become more educated and informed enabling us to give a defense of our faith to those who would mock and ridicule what we believe when they use examples such as the ones we've looked at, accusing our Saviour of being a hypocrite or a charlatan who demands that His followers mutilate themselves or commit suicide or hate people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shalom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

20534,Home Group - Shavuot (Pentecost),"&lt;p&gt;June 10, 2015&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Feast of Shavuot (Weeks/Pentecost)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;Deuteronomy 23:15-17, 'You shall also count for yourselves from the day after the sabbath, from the day when you brought in the sheaf of the wave offering; there shall be seven complete sabbaths. You shall count fifty days to the day after the seventh sabbath; then you shall present a new grain offering to the Lord. You shall bring in from your dwelling places two loaves of bread for a wave offering, made of two-tenths of an ephah; they shall be of a fine flour, baked with leaven as first fruits to the Lord.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In traditional Judaism, the festival of Shavuot (weeks) marks the culmination of the experience of redemption, sometimes called Atzaret Pesach, the Conclusion of the Passover. Since the great exodus from Egypt was intended to lead to the revelation of Sinai, the goal of Passover is the giving of the Torah to the Jewish people. God took the Jews our of Egypt so that they would be His own treasured people, holy and separated from the pagan cultures around them. Indeed, all of the mo'edim (appointed times) are connected with this event, including the fall festivals of Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur and Sukkot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;According to the sages: 'The new moon of Nisan marks the start of sacred time, Passover remembers the sacrifice of the Passover Lamb, the first day of Unleavened Bread remembers the Exodus from Egypt, the seventh day of Unleavened Bread remembers the crossing of the Red Sea, the counting of the Omer recalls the days before the giving of the Torah at Sinai, and Shavuot remembers the giving of the Torah exactly seven weeks after the Exodus (on Sivan 6). Indeed, Shavuot at Mt Sinai is sometimes considered the day on which Judaism was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The background to Shavuot is found through the book of Exodus when God sent Moses to deliver his people from Egyptian slavery, and after many signs, wonders, miracles and much death and destruction because of the pride and stubbornness of Pharaoh's heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It's been calculated by Jewish sages that from the deliverance of the Jewish people after Passover to the day God gave Moses the Law on Mt Sinai was fifty days. When you read the passages giving the description of the Feast of Shavuot and what they were celebrating you see that it's very much an agricultural celebration. It takes place fifty days after the first meal of Passover; God instructed them to count seven weeks and then on the fiftieth day they were to celebrate Shavuot, which actually means, the 'Feast of Weeks'. The counting of the fifty days is known as the Counting of the Omer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;As soon as a Jewish farmer saw the first sign of ripening fruit among his crops, he would tie something around it and designate it to be his offering to the Lord and later when he would harvest it, it would be placed in a basket woven of gold and silver (the poor used baskets of peeled willow branches) and they would take it to the Temple for the celebration of Shavuot. Often there'd be a lot of singing and joyful praise because all the people would be travelling together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The unusual thing about the feast of Shavuot is that part of the offering that had to be presented at the Temple was two loaves of LEAVENED bread, made from the first fruits of their harvest...it's the only time God permitted the bread offerings to contain leaven. When the loaves were presented they had to be presented as a wave offering before Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;After the destruction of the Temple, the Jews were no longer able to bring the first fruits into the Temple as offerings because the Temple was gone, so the Jewish religious leaders recognised that because the Torah was given on Mt Sinai fifty days after Passover, the means of celebrating Shavuot would be focused on celebrating the giving of the Torah, the Law of Moses. Interestingly, the Word of God is described as spiritual food. Yeshua is the Word of God come down from Heaven and is also known as the Bread of Life. Yeshua, the Bread come down from heaven was born in Bethlehem which means the House of Bread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Today, when Jews celebrate Shavuot, the anniversary of the giving of the Law of Moses, they often stay up all night to read and study the Torah, they read portions of the Torah and in particular the read the story of Ruth. In Jewish thought, Ruth is read because the story took place during the time of the Spring harvest and therefore has an agricultural theme and it's also a picture of Ruth who willingly accepted the people and God of the Jewish people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Ruth was a Moabitess who remained with her mother-in-law Naomi, a Jewess, both of whom were widows and Ruth converted to Judaism, confirming that Naomi's people would be her people and Naomi's God would be her God. Naomi's family line was that of King David and Ruth was redeemed by one of Naomi's distant relatives, a man named Boaz who filled the role of 'kinsmen redeemer', he married Ruth and maintained Naomi's family line and not only that, but Boaz and Ruth were the great, great grandparents of king David and from king David came Yeshua the Messiah. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Ruth 1-4)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Ruth's story is that of a Gentile bride embracing the God of the Jewish people and being accepted into the Jewish nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acts 2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; begins on the Day of Pentecost, the word 'Pentecost' is the Greek word that simply means 'the fiftieth day'. After Yeshua rose from the dead, after He was crucified on Passover, He told His disciples to wait in Jerusalem for the promised gift from the Father that would come to them. Fifty days after Passover they gathered together in Jerusalem, it was the Feast of Shavuot and just like God visited His people on Mt Sinai and gave them His Torah, His Law, written on stone tablets by the finger of God Himself; God visited His people gathered together in the upper room and the Holy Spirit was poured out on each one of them and the fulfillment of the giving of the New Covenant began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jeremiah 31:31-34&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the Lord promised that the day would come when He would make a new covenant that would involve His law being imprinted on the hearts of His people rather than on tablets of stone. He would fill and empower His people to live out His law from their innermost desires of the heart, not just out of perfunctory duty, they would obey His law out of love for Him and it would come from within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It's amazing that on the very day that Jews from around the world gathered in Jerusalem to reaffirm their commitment to the covenant of Moses, the Holy Spirit descended upon Israel with the promised New Covenant to all who would believe. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Acts 2:1-42)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Again, this new covenant makes the Law - the Torah - a matter of the heart, written there by God the Holy Spirit, so that those who believe yield a life that is fruitful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 8pt;&quot;&gt;Yeshua was the Passover Lamb in the Feast of Passover&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 8pt;&quot;&gt;Yeshua was the sinless Unleavened Bread in the Feast of Unleavened Bread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 8pt;&quot;&gt;Yeshua was the First Fruit, the first to rise from the dead&amp;nbsp; in the Feast of First Fruits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 8pt;&quot;&gt;Yeshua birthed the 'Church', implementing the New Covenant poured out on the Jews by the Holy Spirit in the Feast of Shavuot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Interestingly, the two loaves of bread are symbolic of both the Jewish people who believe in Yeshua and the Gentiles who believe in Yeshua and are grafted into the commonwealth of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We know that leaven is representative of sin and that the Jewish people were to separate themselves from the Gentile world so as not to be seduced by their sin and the inclusion of leaven in this particular feast shows that the Gentiles are now welcomed into God's people. Two loaves of bread - Jews and Gentiles - whom Paul describes as 'one new man.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The feast of Shavuot is the celebration of God's giving of His Law both at Sinai on tablets of stone on the day that Judaism was born, and again on the day that the New Covenant was established when God gave His law through the pouring out and into the hearts of the believers by the Holy Spirit on the day the church was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ephesians 2:14-18, 'For He Himself is our peace, who made both groups into one and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall, by abolishing in His flesh the enmity, which is the Law of commandments contained in ordinances, so that in Himself He might make the two into one new man, thus establishing peace, and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, by it having put to death the enmity. And He came and preached peace to you who were far away, and peace to those who were near, for through Him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The account of God giving His Law on Mt Sinai and His presence physically descending on the mountain in fire, smoke, thunder and lightenings, absolutely terrified the Israelites. They'd seen His power on display in momentous ways in Egypt and there He was, demonstrating His power again right in front of them on the mountain. They were terrified and wanted Moses to be their mediator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;On the fiftieth day after Passover, after God led His people out of slavery, God gave Moses the Law on Mt Sinai and there is a curious Jewish tradition that is very ancient - it's NOT IN SCRIPTURE - but it's an ancient tradition from a book called 'Legends of the Jews' that says that when God came down on Mt Sinai, angels brought &lt;i style=&quot;font-size: 8pt;&quot;&gt;'crowns of fire'&lt;/i&gt; for every Israelite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;'And when God spoke, &quot;The Divine voice divided itself into the seventy tongues of men, so that all might understand it... All heard indeed the same words, but the same voice, corresponding to the individuality of each, was God's way of speaking with them. And as the same voice sounded differently to each one, so did the Divine vision appear differently to each.&quot;'&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;(Legends of the Jews, Louis Ginsberg)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Again, this isn't a Biblical account, I'm not even implying that it's historical, it's just a legend, but the Jews were all very familiar with it and it's interesting that this is how God visited the Jewish believer's in Jerusalem on the Feast of Shavuot (Pentecost) on the very day the Church was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God rested on each one in the form of a tongue of fire and gave them the ability to speak in foreign human languages so that the international Jewish community who were in Jerusalem at that time to celebrate Shavuot, would be able to hear the Word of God regarding Yeshua and His Gospel clearly in their own languages.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There are other interesting passages of Scripture that reference wind and fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ezekiel 1:4, 13, 'As I looked, behold, a storm wind was coming from the north, a great cloud with fire flashing forth continually and a bright light around it, and in its midst something like glowing metal in the midst of the fire.'...'In the midst of the living beings there was something that looked like burning coals of fire, like torches daring back and forth among the living beings. The fire was bright and lightnigh was flashing from the fire.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Isaiah 6:6, 'Then one of the seraphim flew to me with a burning coal in his hand, which he had taken from the altar with tongs. He touched my mouth with it and said, &quot;Behold, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away and your sin is forgiven.&quot;'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If you read both these passages in their full context you see very clearly that God was specifically calling both Ezekiel and Isaiah to speak His words, His message not only to the people of Israel, but to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In Exodus, God commissioned Israel to represent Him as His people and He gave them His Law so they would reflect His holiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In Ezekiel and Isaiah, God commissioned His prophets to proclaim His Word to His wayward people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In Acts, we see God possibly replaying scenes from Israel's history, commissioning His people who believed in His Son, Yeshua, to take the message of His Gospel to the world, bring Jew and Gentile together as 'one new man.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Leviticus 23:5-8, 'In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at twilight is the Lord's Passover. Then on the fifteenth day of the same month there is the Feast of Unleavened Bread to the Lord; for seven days you shall eat unleavened bread. On the first day you shall have a holy convocation; you shall not do any laborious work. But for seven days you shall present an offering by fire to the Lord. On the seventh day is a holy convocation; you shall not do any laborious work.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Historically, the Feast of Unleavened Bread is a remembrance of God bringing the Hebrews out of Egypt. It begins at sunset of Nisan 15. In ancient Israel, days were counted from evening to evening, therefore sunset of Nisan 14 begins a new day and sunset of the following day closes Nisan 14 and begins Nisan 15. The Feast of Unleavened Bread continues for seven days until Nisan 21 and during this period only unleavened bread is to be eaten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The first meal, eaten on the evening of the 15th, is special. After the Hebrews sacrificed the Passover lamb, they were to roast and eat all the flesh of the lamb together with bitter herbs and unleavened bread. No bone of the lamb was to be broken &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Exodus 12:46)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We learned about the Passover over the past 2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yeshua, the Bread of Life fulfils the Feast of Unleavened Bread&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;John 6:35&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, Yeshua said &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;“I am the bread of life...”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Feast of Unleavened Bread is symbolic of Yeshua’s perfect sinless life and the fact that He as the Messiah of the Jewish people, offered Himself as the atoning sacrifice in their place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The angel of death passed over them on the night of Passover, but as the lamb slain on their behalf, He had to be perfect...without spot or blemish, so Yeshua our Passover Lamb was Himself, perfect and sinless, without defect or flaw of any kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Remember that for the first 3 days of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, Yeshua was dead and in the tomb...it was after 3 days that Messiah defeated death and rose to life. Not only could death not hold Him, but corruption could not touch Him!!! &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;For seven days from Passover, only unleavened bread - symbolically 'sinless, perfect' bread that is both pierced and striped during the preparation and cooking process is eaten.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;No Bones Broken&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Though it was a common and Roman practice to break the legs of the crucified to hasten their death, this particular practice wasn't done on Yeshua; none of Yeshua’s bones were broken, just as the Passover lamb is to have no bone broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;John 19:32-33, 'So the soldiers came, and broke the legs of the first man and of the other who was crucified with Him; but come to Yeshua, when they saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Sometimes, people could last for days hanging in excruciating pain on crosses, but because Shabbat was looming, the bodies needed to be removed and buried before Shabbat officially began, so to hasten their deaths, the legs of the crucified were broken to prevent them from raising themselves up to gasp for air. Once their legs were broken, suffocation resulted rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;However, Yeshua not only determined the moment of His arrest and crucifixion, He also determined the exact moment of His death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;John 19:30, 'Therefore when Yeshua had received the sour wine, He said, &quot;It is finished!&quot; And He bowed His head and gave up His spirit.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When breaking the bread at His last meal, Yeshua said to His disciples, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;“Take and eat; this is my body.” — Matthew 26:26.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In summary, leaven represents sin, thus unleavened bread is a good representation of our sinless Messiah, the Bread of Life. Yeshua bore stripes from Roman beatings; the unleavened bread is marked with stripes. Yeshua was pierced in His hands and feet and in His side when He was crucified; the unleavened bread has holes pierced throughout for cooking. Yeshua was born in the town of Bethlehem, which translates from Hebrew: “House of Bread”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Like the father during the Passover seder who wraps the unleavened bread in linen, hides (buries) it and later redeems it, Yeshua was wrapped in linen, buried and He paid the price of our redemption with His perfect sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;The Feast of First Fruits (Yom HaBikkurim)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Leviticus 23:9-14, 'Then the Lord spoke to Moses saying, &quot;Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, 'When you enter the land which I am going to give to you and reap its harvest, then you shall bring in the sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest to the priest. He shall wave the sheaf before the Lord for you to be accepted; on the day after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it. Now on the day when you wave the sheaf, you shall offer a male lamb one year old without defect for a burnt offering to the Lord. It's grain offering shall then be two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil, an offering by fire to the Lord for a soothing aroma, with its drink offering, a fourth of a hin of wine. Until this dame say, until you have brought in the offering of your God, you shall eat neither bread nor roasted grain nor new growth. It is to be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwelling places.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Historically, the Feast of First Fruits was the day that the Hebrew slaves went down into the Red Sea and emerged alive on the other side, while Pharaoh was swallowed up by the Red Sea. This set the Israelites free as the First Fruits from Egyptian bondage. The Feast of First Fruits falls on the day after the Sabbath, during the week of the Feast of Unleavened Bread. This is the first Sunday after the fifteenth of Nisan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When God brought the children of Israel into the Promised Land, they were to bring the best first fruits of their harvest and present them to the Lord. Josephus records that the people did not partake of the harvest until the first fruits were presented &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 8pt;&quot;&gt;(Antiquities of the Jews 3.10.5)&lt;/span&gt;. It's unfortunate that modern Christianity has come to call this feast Easter, whose name is derived from the Babylonian Goddess Ishtar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yeshua, who is Himself the First Fruits Fulfils the Feast of First Fruits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;1 Corinthians 15:20-23, 'But now Yeshua Messiah has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who are asleep. For since by a man came death, by a man also came the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, so also in Yeshua Messiah all will be made alive. But each in His own order: Messiah the first fruits, after that those who are Yeshua's at His coming.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yeshua is the First Fruits. Yeshua is first in order and pre-eminence, just as the offering of fruits is to be the first and the “best portion”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;He was resurrected on the Feast of First Fruits...the first day after the Sabbath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Matthew 28:1-7, 'Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary, came to look at the grave. And behold, a severe earthquake had occurred, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled away the stone and sat upon it. And his appearance was like lightning and his clothing as white as snow. The guards shook for fear of him and became like dead men. The angel said to the women, &quot;Do not be afraid; for I know that you are looking for Yeshua who has been crucified. He is not here, for He has risen, just as He said. Come, see the place where he was lying. Go quickly and tell His disciples that He has risen from the dead...'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yeshua also being The High Priest and always one to observe the Feasts of Israel, gave a first fruits offering of people...Himself...the first of many, among whom we who love Him will be counted!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;James 1:18, 'In the exercise of his will He brought us forth by the word of truth, so that we would be a kind of first fruits among His creatures.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Who were the first fruits among the brethren after Yeshua's resurrection?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Matthew 27:50-53, 'And Yeshua cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded up His spirit. And behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom; and the earth shook and the rocks were split. The tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised; and coming out of the tombs after His resurrection they entered the holy city and appeared to many.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Death holds no fear for us, death has lost its sting because the perfect lamb of God shed His blood, He allowed His body to be broken...but not his bones! Because He rose from the dead on the Feast of First Fruits we see very clearly that Yeshua the Messiah is the direct and absolute fulfilment of Passover, the Feast of Unleavened Bread and the Feast of First Fruits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;They are pictures and pre-figures of Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Later we'll look at the other four mandatory feasts and see how Messiah is presented in them. Next to come is the Feast of Weeks, also known as Shavuot or more commonly known to us as the Feast of Pentecost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8 April, 2015&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Passover&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Leviticus 23:4-5, 'These are the appointed times of the Lord, holy convocation which you shall proclaim at the times appointed them. In the first month on the fourteenth day of the month at twilight is the Lord's Passover.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The celebration of Easter is really the Jewish feast of Passover which was instituted by God in the Bible and it was to commemorate the deliverance by God of His people from Egyptian slavery. The account of their slavery can be found in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Exodus 1-15&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the specifics of Passover are detailed in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Exodus 11-13&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There are no references to Easter in the Bible or in the Apostolic first church, it was introduced after the death of the Apostle John by some Gentile churches that had spread outside of Asia Minor and Polycarp, who was directly discipled by the Apostle contested the alternate dates for celebrating the death and resurrection of Christ but all parties agreed it was not really something they should all break fellowship over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Those who maintained the celebration falling on 14 Nisan according to the Bible and the Jewish calendar came to be known as the Quartodecimans, which is just a fancy latin word for fourteen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;By the 3rd &amp;amp; 4th centuries, anti-Semitism was becoming dangerously common place within the official church and in 325 at the Council of Nicea, the First Ecumenical Council declared that 'Easter' was never allowed to fall on the same date as the Jewish Feast of Passover, on the 14th of Nisan, but had to fall on the first Sunday afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The result was the excommunication of individual and whole church communities, specifically isolating any Jewish believers that were still part of the Christian community, some Quartodecimans were executed because they wanted to remain faithful to the dates laid out in Scripture and for not falling in with church dogma and official policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Emperor Constantine said that all those in attendance had decided to adopt a uniform date, because the eastern orthodox church celebrated Easter on a different date but primarily, this decision was made in order to sever any semblance of Jewish connection, blaming them for Yeshua's death. Following is an excerpt...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;It was resolved by the united judgment of all present, that this feast ought to be kept by all and in every place on one and the same day. For what can be more becoming or honourable to us that that this feast, from which we date our hopes of immortality, should be observed unfailingly by all alike, according to one ascertained order and arrangement?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;And first of all, it appeared an unworthy thing that in the celebration of this most holy feast we should follow the practice of the Jews, who have impiously defiled their hands with enormous sin, and are, therefore, deservedly afflicted with blindness of soul. For we have it in our power, if we abandon their custom, to prolong the due observance of this ordnance to future ages, by a truer order, which we have preserved from the very day of the passion until the present time.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Let us then have nothing in common with the detestable Jewish crowd; for we have received from our Saviour a different way. A course at once legitimate and honourable lies upon to our most holy religion. Beloved brethren, let us with one consent, adopt this course, and withdraw ourselves from all participation in their baseness...being altogether ignorant of the true adjustment of this question, they sometimes celebrate Easter twice in the same year. Why then should we follow those who are confessedly in grievous error?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Surely we shall never consent to keep this feast a second time in the same year...and let your holinesses sagacity reflect how grievous and scandalous it is that on the self-same days some should be engaged in fasting, others in festive enjoyment; and again, that after the days of Easter, some should be present at banquets and amusements, while others are fulfilling the appointed fasts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is then, Divine providence (as I suppose you all clearly see), that this usage should receive fitting correction, and be reduced to one uniform rule.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Over the past 50 years however, there has been a concerted effort by Christians to learn about the Jewish foundations of the Christian faith and this has brought considerable understanding and significance to all that we believe and all that Yeshua did for us, amplifying and explaining the prophetic implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Basically, the story of Passover is that God brought 10 plagues upon the Egyptians for refusing to let the Hebrews go free, and the final plague was absolutely the most tragic of all. The plague would result in the death of every firstborn male of every family throughout the land of Egypt from Pharaoh's own household to the poorest household, even the firstborn of the animals died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In order for the Hebrews to escape this plague, they were required to take a first born male lamb from their flocks, it had to be flawless...perfect and without blemish of any kind. At a specific time they were to kill the lamb and drain all the blood from its body and paint the blood on the doorpost and top beam of the doorframe of their homes so that when the angel of death made its way through the land, it would see the blood and 'pass over' that home leaving everyone inside alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;They had to remove every trace of leaven from their homes, they had to roast the lamb and leave none of it till morning, they were to eat unleavened bread and bitter herbs along with the lamb and they were to eat it in haste, with their travelling clothes on, their shoes on their feet as though they were in a hurry to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There is a great deal more to the story but that is a basic overview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Every year, Jewish families around the world celebrate the feast of Passover because Scripture commands them to. God said that the Feasts of the Lord, of which there are seven, Passover being the first, are compulsory celebrations and are 'appointed' times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The way the Passover is celebrated today is very different from Bible times because they no longer have a Temple and for the past 2,000 years, the Jews have been living in the Diaspora in very hostile situations much of the time. The Passover celebration has undergone a lot of change but the elements are still incredibly significant. In traditional Jewish homes there are 15 steps in the Passover feast, however in Messianic homes, there are usually a few less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;1. Removal of all leaven from the home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;All Jewish homes use the preceding days to thoroughly clean their homes and remove all forms of leaven because during Passover, leaven symbolises sin and its removal symbolises repentant hearts that are determined to expel anything sinful or displeasing to God from their lives. Typically, small leavened pieces of bread are hidden in obvious places in the home and the children or the youngest members of the family are commissioned to find them and dispose of them. It's a bit of a 'hide and seek' type game with is meant to be fun.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;1 Corinthians 5:6-7, 'Clean out the old leaven so that you may be a new lump, just as you are in fact unleavened. For Messiah our Passover also has been sacrificed. Therefore, let us celebrate the feast, not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;2. Lighting the Passover candles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is typically done by the woman or mother of the family, just as she is the one to light the Shabbat candles each week as well. The lighting of the candles during Passover is a serious part of the celebration because they symbolise the presence of God among them and that in and of itself is both serious and sacred. As believers in Yeshua, we recognise that He is the Light of the World come to bring light and life to those living in darkness. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;John 8:12, 9:5, 'Then Yeshua again spoke to them, saying, &quot;I am the Light of the world; he who follows Me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the Light of life.&quot;.....&quot;While I am in the world, I am the Light of the world.&quot;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;3. The First Cup: The cup of Sanctification&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The four cups during Passover come from &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Exodus 6:6-7, 'Say therefore to the sons of Israel, &quot;I am the Lord and I will bring you out from under the burden of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from their bondage. I will also redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments. Then I will take you for My people, and I will be your God; and you shall know that I am the Lord your God, who brought you out from under the burden of the Egyptians.&quot; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 1 - I will bring you out from under the burden of the Egyptians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 2 - I will deliver you from their bondage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 3 - I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 4 - I will take you for My people and I will be your God.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The first cup is called the cup of Sanctification in which God makes His people holy unto Himself. In Yeshua we recognise that His sacrifice is what makes us holy, it's His sacrifice that washes us clean from the filth and depravity of our sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;4. Hand Washing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is not about hygiene, it's a symbolic hand washing that because of what God has done we are made clean. Again, we see Yeshua doing this with His own disciples but He showed incredible humility by washing their feet, something only the lowest of slaves would do. Being washed by Him makes us clean. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Hebrews 10:19-22, 'Therefore brethren, since we have confidence to enter the holy place by the blood of Yeshua, by a new and living way which He inaugurated for us through the veil, that is His flesh, and since we have a great High Priest over the&amp;nbsp; house of God, let us draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;5. Karpas - the green vegetable (parsley)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The parsley is dipped into salt water; the parsley represents the bitter herbs the Hebrews were required to eat and the salt represents tears; bitterness for all the bitter slavery they endured for hundreds of years and salt representing their tears shed while waiting for redemption. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This portion of the Seder is also taken from the Song of Solomon which is typically a song between the man and a woman but in various places in the Old Covenant, God referred to Israel as His wife and he as her Husband. God wanted to see His relationship restored to His people and He wanted their love for Him to be rekindled. Yeshua is called the Bridegroom and those who believe in Him are His bride. The typology is stunning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;6. The breaking of the Matza Bread (Afikomen)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Three pieces of Matza bread are placed into a special bag, this is called the Afikomen which is a Greek word and it means 'That which comes after' or 'That which is coming'. The middle piece of Matza is removed and broken in half; one half is returned to the bag and the other half is wrapped and hidden in the house somewhere. many Jews think that the second Matza symbolises their affliction in Egypt but cannot explain why the second piece is selected. Some believe they represent Abraham, Isaac and Jacob but have no explanation for why the second piece - Isaac - has to be broken because even though Abraham was willing to sacrifice him according to God's word, Isaac wasn't in fact harmed in any way. For believer's in Yeshua, we see these Matza as being the Trinity: Father, Son and Holy Spirit with the second - the Son - being broken on our behalf, with His body being buried (hidden away) and risen (found). The fact that Afikomen actually means 'That which is coming' could also refer to His second coming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;7. The story of Passover&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is the part of the Seder where the story is relayed and four questions are asked:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 1. Why is this night different than all other nights?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 2. Why on all other nights do we eat bread with leaven, but on this nig we only eat leavened bread?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 3. Why on all other nights do we eat of all kinds of herbs, but on this night we eat bitter herbs?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 4. Why on all other nights do we eat in the normal way, but on this night we eat with special ceremony?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;As all four questions are answered the story of Passover is recalled; they were slaves to harsh Egyptian slave masters who make their lives miserable with unbearable burdens; they eat unleavened bread to remove sin from their lives and have repentant hearts before God and they seek His mercy; they eat only bitter herbs so they remember the bitterness of their slavery so they never forget; and they eat this meal with great ceremony because God provided for them incredible miracles of deliverance from their oppressive enemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Again, we see the parallel is striking: we were slaves to sin bearing unbearable burdens that we could not free ourselves from; we are to come before God with repentant hearts with true remorse for our sin seeking His forgiveness and cleansing; we remember through our communion ceremony the price Yeshua paid for our redemption, we remember because he is worthy to be honoured and adored for His sacrificial love toward us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;8. The second cup: the Cup of Deliverance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This cup is drunk in celebration of the deliverance as the people were lead out of Egypt, finally free of their slavery. We celebrate for the same reason as just answered in the four questions - deliverance was given because God granted it in His mercy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;9. The meal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is where the full meal is eaten, but all the elements on the Seder plate are systematically gone through. The full meal is served and everyone enjoys their food and each other's company. This is a meal of joy and great celebration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;10. The third cup: The Cup of Redemption&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;At the Passover Seder a place is always set that remains empty, it is set for the prophet Elijah beccause &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Malachi 4:50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; brings the expectation that Elijah the prophet will be the forerunner of Messiah and of course Messiah is the One who will bring about ultimate redemption. Typically it's at this point in the Seder that the children are sent to find the hidden Afikomen and the third cup of redemption is drunk. The Jews celebrate their redemption from Egyptian slavery but they are also earnestly waiting for their Messiah to come with their ultimate redemption and therefore, the sooner Elijah comes the sooner Messiah comes and it's for this reason Elijah has been incorporated into the Passover celebration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We know that John the Baptist came in the spirit of Elijah and was the forerunner of Messiah, a voice in the wilderness making the way straight for Yeshua when He came on the scene. When the children find the Afikomen there is great rejoicing because 'that which is coming' has finally come. Everyone takes a piece of the Afikomen and proceeds to eat it along with drinking the cup of redemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Often the youngest child will run to the door and open it in the hope that Elijah is waiting there ready to be welcomed in by the family in anticipation of the imminent arrival of Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;During the 'Last Supper' Yeshua instituted this part of the Seder to be about remembering His sacrifice of shed blood and broken body requiring His disciples (all of us included) to eat and drink as often as we come together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Matthew 26:26-28, 'While they were eating, Yeshua took some bread, and after a blessing, He broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, &quot;Take, eat; this is My body.&quot; And when He had taken a cup and given thanks, He gave it to them, saying, &quot;Drink from it, all of you; for this is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for forgiveness of sins.&quot;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;11. The fouth cup: the Cup of Thanksgiving and Hope&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This cup closes the Seder stating that the Seder is complete just as our redemption is complete even though we are still awaiting the Messiah. It's a cup of thanksgiving and hope, knowing that what God has promised He will do, He will most assuredly do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It's believed that it was this last cup of the Passover Seder that Yeshua did not drink, and He said he would not drink it again until He drinks it in His Father's kingdom which will be when He returns and is welcomed by His own people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Matthew 26:29, &quot;But I say to you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in My Father's kingdom.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We as believers can be absolutely assured that our redemption is complete, we cannot add a single thing to it and we don't need to, Yeshua's work on the cross was absolutely complete. It's in this knowledge that we should demonstrate intense gratitude and thankfulness to Him for what He has done and knowing that our hope is not in vain; we don't waste our hope when we put our faith and trust in Him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Because Messiah hasn't come by the end of the Seder, everybody says together...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&quot;Next year in Jerusalem!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This has been the cry of every Jewish heart since the Diaspora of the Jewish people around the world and they've repeated this every year for the past 2,000 years and it carries the hope not only of restoration for the people and their nation, but also for the coming of Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We as believers long also for the return of Yeshua our Messiah, that He would come and right all things and establish His kingdom in His righteousness and His throne will be in Jerusalem, the throne of His father David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Gabriel said to Mary in Luke 1:31-32, &quot;Behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a Son, and you shall name Him Yeshua. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;At this point in the Seder, the candles are extinguished and the Seder is complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The elements of the Seder plate are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Maror and chazeret: bitter herbs symbolising the bitterness and harshness of slaver in Egypt. Sometimes horseradish or romaine lettuce is used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Charoset: a sweet brown mixture representing the mortar used by the Hebrew slaves to build for the Egyptians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Karpas: Generally parsley which is used for dipping in the salt water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Salt Water: this symbolises the tears shed by the Hebrews during their years of slavery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Seroah: the shankbone of a lamb to represent the lamb that was sacrificed, who's blood assured the Hebrews that the angel of death would 'passover' them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Beitzah: a hardboiled egg which symbolises the korban chagigah, which was a festival sacrifice that was offered in the Temple in Jerusalem. The egg symbolises mourning and is the first food served to mourners after a funeral in Hebrew culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Matza bread: unleavened bread symbolising the bread of life completely without sin. Today, it's the representation of the lamb itself that assures them of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Orphans&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;em style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;James 1:26-27, &quot;If anyone thinks himself to be religious, and yet does not bridle his tongue but deceives his own heart, this man's religion is worthless. Pure and undefiled religion in the sight of our God and Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their distress, and to keep oneself unstained by the world.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Aristotle the philosopher; Cyrus the Great; President Andrew Jackson; Nelson Mandela activist and former president of South Africa; First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt; Malcolm X; John Keats the poet; writers Edgar Allen Poe, Leo Tolstoy and JRR Tolkien; musicians Louis Armstrong, Johann Sebastian Bach, Ray Charles, Ella Fitzgerald, Faith Hill, John Lennon and Tina Turner; entertainers Ingrid Bergman and Carol Burnett; Samuel Goldwyn the movie mogul; Lee Majors, Marilyn Monroe and Orson Welles; Babe Ruth the baseball player; Bertrand Russell the philosopher; Johannes Kepler the scientist; Apple founder Steve Jobs and Vidal Sasson the beauty products magnate; fictional characters Frodo Baggins, Tom Sawyer, Oliver Twist, Cinderella, Jane Eyre, Huckleberry Finn, Pollyanna and Anne of Green Gables. Luke Skywalker of Star Wars, Mowgli of Jungle Book, Snow White, Superman, Tarzan and Wolverine...and my mother!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What do all these characters have in common? They were all orphans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Hebrew word for orphan is&amp;nbsp;'&lt;em&gt;yatom'&lt;/em&gt;, and it means “fatherless.” During Biblical times if a child had a mother but no father, the child was considered to be an orphan because during that time period, single-parent families were predominantly impoverished because the men were the breadwinners and not many women worked. Without the breadwinner, single mothers and their children were at the mercy of other people's generosity. So those who were 'fatherless' were considered orphans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Today, especially in our western nations, there are greater provisions for single parent families, and children with only one parent are not considered orphans at all, despite the fact that 'fatherless' children are becoming incredibly common...unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;How does God regard orphans?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;All through the Old Covenant Scriptures God warned His people not to oppress or afflict orphans and widows; these most vulnerable members of society were supposed to be defended and protected against corruption and malice and were to be protected against those who would target them to rip them off and manipulate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Exodus 22:22, 'You shall not afflict any widow or orphan.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Deuteronomy 10:18, 'He (God) executes justice for the orphan and the widow, and shows His love for the alien by giving him food and clothing.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Deuteronomy 24:20-21, 'When you beat your olive tree, you shall not go over the boughs again; it shall be for the alien, for the orphan and for the widow. When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, you shall not go over it again; it shall be for the alien, for the orphan and for the widow.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Deuteronomy 27:19, 'Cursed is he who distorts the justice due an alien, orphan and widow. And all the people shall say, &quot;Amen&quot;.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Hebrew view of the orphan then was one of care, compassion and protection. There was no 'social security' during the Biblical era in any nation of region of the world but in Israel, under God's instruction, widows, orphans and foreigners (aliens) were to be treated with respect, their rights and physical well being was to be protected, defended and championed and anyone taking advantage of them would in fact be 'cursed' as &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Deut 27:19&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Not only that, but when harvest time came, God instructed His people to only make their way through their crops once...anything else that was left behind had to be made available for widows, orphans and foreigners to access so they would have food and provisions enough to survive. No other society that I know of has ever had such a system or law in place to protect the weak, poor and vulnerable of their societies. Only Ancient Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If you read the book of Ruth, you see this law of provision, known as the 'law of gleaning' come to in to play when Ruth went into the fields of Boaz to glean after the harvest had taken place. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Ruth 2)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Psalm 68:5, God is...'A Father to the fatherless and a Judge for the widows, is God in His holy habitation.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Psalm 146:9, 'The Lord protects the strangers; He supports the fatherless and the widow, but He thwarts the way of the wicked.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When Adam and Eve sinned, we know that the relationship, the fellowship between them and God was broken. No longer could they be in God's presence the way they originally did, only through sacrifice and death could they hear from Him and always at a distance. As the centuries progressed, God revealed more and more detail about the processes of sacrifice and ritual that were required for man to gain right standing before Him and always, those processes and rituals were only temporary fixes. They were constant and ongoing, and innocent animal was always offered up as the sacrifice to bring about cleansing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The arrival of sin brought with it the fatherlessness of the human race. God was now distant and unapproachable without a priestly mediator and the shedding of innocent blood. Then came Yeshua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yeshua became our prophet declaring truth and the coming of the Kingdom of God. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Deut 18:14-22)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yeshua became our King, the Son of David, the promised Mashiach / Messiah who would set all things right and rule over us and eventually, one day the entire world. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Psalm 2)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yeshua became our Great High Priest, who would not only become our Mediator bridging the gap between us and God because of our sin, but offering Himself as the sacrifice that would once and for all, permanently cleanse us of our sin and wash it away forever. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Psalm 110)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We would no longer be fatherless...we would finally be reconciled to our Father, in fact Scripture says we become 'adopted'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Romans 8:15, 'For you have not received a spirit of slavery leading to fear again, but you have received a spirit of adoption as sons by which we cry out, &quot;Abba Father!&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ephesians 1:3-6, 'Blessed by the God and Father of our Lord Yeshua, Messiah, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Messiah, just as he chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him. In love He predestined us to adoption as sons through Yeshua our Messiah to Himself, according to the kind intentions of His will, to the praise of the glory of His grace, which he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you realise that Paul wrote these passages during the rule of the Ancient Roman Empire and it was common knowledge and understanding of what adoption meant under Roman law. Here's an excerpt from sermon by Dr John Macarthur about the laws of adoption in Ancient Rome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 28.55pt 0.0001pt 1cm; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;There were two steps. The first one was called&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;mansupoteo from which we get the word emancipation. And&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;mansupoteo was carried out about a symbolic sort of sale. If the father would agree to let his son be adopted by another man there was this symbolic sale they went to; they had some scales and some copper and they used this symbolism to carry out sort of a transaction like I'm selling this young man to you. They did it three times. Twice the father symbolically sold the son and twice he bought him back and then the third time he didn't buy him back and the Potrea Protestus was broken.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And when all this was complete the&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;adoption&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;was done. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The adopted person lost all rights in his own (natural) family and gained all rights in his new family. He gained all the rights of a fully legitimate son in his new family. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

If he had any debts they were cancelled, if he had any record of crime it was abolished. They wiped out all the records as if that person had never existed, as if they had never been born. And the adopted person was regarded as a new person entering a new life with no past. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Is that not remarkable! This is a natural picture of the exact process that takes place in our relationship with God when we come to saving faith in Yeshua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We are adopted into God's family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We are bought with a price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We are legally, in every sense of the word, a son and heir of our adoptive Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Our past is gone, completely wiped away and forgotten, as though our past life and existence never happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We are 100% sons and daughters of our Father in heaven, with full rights and privileges that come with being a member of this family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We are no longer orphans. God completes the circle that began in Eden. We went from being 100% sons and daughters of God in perfect fellowship and full rights and heirs, to being expelled, estranged and separated through sin; we became orphans and strangers in the world, living under the slavery of sin serving a harsh task-master - Satan - until Yeshua our Prophet, Priest and King came and died in our place. He purchased us with His own blood so that we could be saved. Our ransom was paid, our debts cancelled and we were adopted and are restored in our relationship with our Father once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mandy&lt;/p&gt;

19030,Home Group - On Being Sheep,"&lt;p&gt;4 March, 2015&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;On Being Sheep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Psalm 100, 'Shout joyfully to the Lord, all the earth. Serve the Lord with gladness; come before Him with joyful singing. Know that the Lord Himself if God; it is He who has made us, and not we ourselves; we are His people and the sheep of His pasture. Enter His gates with thanksgiving and His courts with praise. Give thanks to Him, bless His name. For the Lord is good; His lovingkindness is everlasting and His faithfulness to all generations.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In our western mindset...or our Greek philosophical mindset, Yeshua's command to &quot;make disciples&quot; can simply mean teaching people certain beliefs about God, helping them believe and accept Yeshua as their Lord and then educating them in doctrinal truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Are all these things true and important? Absolutely they are, without question, but this can very easily become little more than a mental exercise and the person with the most amount of knowledge is seen as the most mature Christian and a better disciple. Unfortunately, this just makes Christians competitive with each other. It always leads to power grabs and political machinations within church bodies and arguments over who's right and who's wrong and this doesn't necessarily lead to transformed lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;However, an eastern view of discipleship is much more synonymous with the Gospel. The eastern view not only emphasises the understanding that Yeshua died for our sins and that belonging to Him requires repentance and faith in Him alone, and holding to sound doctrine and teaching, but it also emphasises that Yeshua lived transparently before His disciples so that He could demonstrate to them how they should live. Then Yeshua's disciples were able to make disciples which required them to not only understand the fundamental technicalities of the Gospel &amp;nbsp;and doctrine, but they also were to live their lives transparently so as to teach them how to live out their faith in Yeshua practically every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It's not just about a transfer of information and knowledge but also a transfer and example of transformation. It's not one or the other...it's both! This is definitely not a &quot;Do as I say&quot; method of discipleship, it's a &quot;Do as I do&quot; method of discipleship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God never wanted to simply fill the world with people who all believed the right things...yes...God does want us to believe rightly according to His Word...but He wants to fill the world with people who will literally, physically live their lives so that they reflect Yeshua in every moment of every day. This is what &lt;i&gt;'Walking in the dust of our Rabbi'&lt;/i&gt; is all about. Learning from Yeshua our Rabbi, what He taught AND emulating Him so that our physical conduct, behaviour and conversation reflect Him accurately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It's no accident that the Bible uses shepherding to describe the relationship between God and His people, in fact the picture is a beautiful metaphor for God's kind of discipleship. In so many countries of the world sheep are kept in fenced-in pastures where a shepherd or farmer isn't required most of the time and the sheep are left to themselves. With that understanding, it's easy for a Christian in the west to simply think that the great commission is to just get as many sheep into the pen as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;However, this is not the case in Israel...grass isn't that plentiful, the soil is arid and pasture has to be found and that means that flocks are pretty much on the move a lot of the time. While in Israel, I've seen shepherds move their flocks around local neighbourhoods, out on the hillsides...I've even seen shepherds move their flocks through the city of Jerusalem along the main road out the front of the Garden of Gethsemane along the side of the Kidron Valley! The sheep are only kept in pens or enclosures at night or in winter but during the day the shepherd is with them and he moves them about from pasture to pasture. Shepherding in Israel is a very active vocation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;A lady by the name of Judith Fain who is a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Durham spends several months each year in Israel and one day while walking on a road near Bethlehem, she watched three shepherds converge with their separate flocks of sheep. The three shepherds knew each other and stopped to talk and while they were chatting, their sheep intermingled to form one big flock. She was wondering how these shepherds would be able to separate their sheep and was amazed when each of the shepherds called out to his sheep and at the sound of their voices, the sheep separated from each other and simply followed their respective shepherds. It would appear that some things in Israel haven’t changed for thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What's makes us - Yeshua's disciples - different from all others is not the 'pen' we live in but the Shepherd we follow. When I was in New Zealand last week we saw a farmer herding his sheep with his amazing sheep dogs and then we watched him sheer a sheep. The sheep didn't want to be shorn but when the farmer grabbed the sheep, the sheep just submitted and didn't try to move or escape...she just laid there against the farmer trusting him completely while the farmer dragged her around lifting her legs and turning her around until she was all neatly shorn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Sheep will always follow a shepherd but they must be sure they're following the Good Shepherd and not a false or deceitful shepherd...the Bible calls them hirelings. They're in 'the game' for what they can get personally, not because they care about the sheep! Wandering sheep who follow wandering shepherds get lost and dirty, they hurt themselves, they wander into dangerous places where they're vulnerable to attacks from predators and also to being stolen and deceived by other false shepherds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Out Good Shepherd leads His sheep out into the world and He's always on the move. Our Good Shepherd (our Rabbi) expects us - His sheep (His disciples) to follow Him even to the ends of the earth if need be, but to do so, we have to learn to recognise His voice, follow where He leads and imitate Him so we can show the world around us who we belong to and who we emulate and what His Good News is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Psalm 23, 'A Psalm of David. The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside the quiet waters. He restores my soul; He guides me in paths of righteousness for His name's sake. Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil, for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me. You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; You have anointed my head with oil; my cup overflows. Surely goodness and lovingkindness will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Did you notice something really important in the psalm? This wonderful Shepherd doesn't keep His sheep in a pen or a fenced paddock and leave them to their own devices. This wonderful Shepherd remains with His sheep all the time. He's with the sheep when they sleep, He leads them in quiet peaceful places, He's with them walking through dangerous and dark places, He ensures they have all their basic needs met be it food, water, rest or shelter. When they're unwell or hurt He anoints them with oil and soothes their bodies with healing and when they're surrounded by their enemies, this Shepherd prepares a table of plenty for them despite the threats the sheep are living under. This Shepherd disciplines His sheep with His rod and staff and this brings His sheep great comfort. Under the protection and provision of this Shepherd, these sheep know His goodness and lovingkindness...in all these diverse circumstances and settings. What is the end result for the sheep of this Shepherd...dwelling with the Lord forever!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;These sheep know the voice of this Shepherd and no matter where He leads them, they follow...completely trusting Him, and emulating Him and both the world and their enemies see it all. There is no question as to whom these sheep belong or whom they love...they love their Shepherd. He is no hireling, this Shepherd has given His entire life for the benefit and care of His sheep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;John 10:9-15, Yeshua said, &quot;I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture. The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I came that they may have life, and have it abundantly. I am the Good Shepherd; the Good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep. He who is a hired hand and not a shepherd, who is not the owner of the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf snatches them and scatters them. He flees because he is a hired hand and is not concerned about the sheep. I am the Good Shepherd, and I know My own and My own know Me, even as the Father knows Me and I know the Father; and I lay down My life for the sheep.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Parallel this passage with &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Psalm 23&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and you see the same Good Shepherd who leads His sheep in and out to find pasture; out where there are false shepherds (hired hands), wolves and predators, the Good Shepherd protects them from these enemies. He not only cares for the needs of the sheep but He even lays down His own life to protect and save them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;That's our Good Shepherd and we're supposed to emulate Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;As disciples of Yeshua, it's not enough to be counted among His flock and spend our life milling about munching on grass within the safety of the pen, we have to follow our Shepherd, listen to His voice and learn from Him, trust Him and emulate Him. The closer we follow Him the more our discipleship grows and living our lives transparently before the world as a witness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What if the people we live among aren't interested in Yeshua or are even openly hostile to Him and those who love Him? Well, nowhere does Scripture say that we should only follow our Shepherd when it's safe and pleasant to do so...on the contrary, we're to follow our Shepherd and emulate Him in all circumstances and that the world will in fact hate us because we follow and emulate our Shepherd, but follow and emulate Him we must.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The world may hate our Shepherd and because of our connection to Him, hate us as well...but maybe...just maybe...if they see our transparent lives and our growing lifestyle of living like Him, they may also desire to join the flock and follow Him alongside us. That's when they become a disciple that we can help grow in their faith and mentor with the doctrine and teaching that has been so important and instrumental in our own development and maturity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;As disciples of our Rabbi...we are not only required to share about Him with others and open the gate to let them in, but we're also required to help other believers become more effective disciples and this continues our own discipleship in Yeshua. The key in all this is living a transparent life before Yeshua and our communities as we daily follow our Shepherd and Rabbi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

19029,Home Group - Such A Curse: A Messianic Look At Purim,"&lt;p&gt;25 February, 2015&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Such a Curse: A Messianic Look At Purim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 9pt;&quot;&gt;Adapted from an article by Mark Stover&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Esther 2:8-10, 'It came about when the command and decree of the king were heard and many young ladies were gathered to the citadel of Susa into the custody of Hegai, that Esther was taken to the king's palace into the custody of Hegai, who was in charge of the women. Now the young lady pleased him and found favour with him. So he quickly provided her with her cosmetics and food, gave her seven choice maids from the king's palace and transferred her and her maids to the best place in the harem. Esther did not make known her people or her kindred, for Mordecai had instructed her that she should not make them known.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Purim is the Jewish holiday which is most carnival-like. Children drown out Haman's name with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;'boos', y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;oung Jewish girls participate in Queen Esther beauty pageants, plays are enacted called&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Purimspiels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. People eat festive food and a great deal of fancy dress parties are attended...this is how the celebration of Purim has developed over the centuries. Yet, behind the feasting and drinking and partying lies a somber message: the near destruction of the Jewish people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It reminds us that Jewish survival hangs by a thread of circumstance—but the weight on the matter is in God's hand. The account in the book of Esther takes place in fifth century Persia and the events and characters of Purim (court intrigue, dramatic confrontations, heroes, and villains) are no joking matter. They could be elements in a melodrama plot: Esther, a beautiful Jewish teenager, becomes queen of Persia. Haman, an ambitious and arrogant bureaucrat, turns his envy of the Jew, Mordecai, into a vendetta against the entire Jewish population of Persia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Esther 4:13-14, 'Then Mordecai told them to reply to Esther, &quot;Do not imagine that you in the king's palace can escape any more than all the Jews. For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from another place and you and your father's house will perish. And who knows whether you have not attained royalty for such a time as this?&quot;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Mordecai, who is Esther's cousin, appeals to her for help and she cautiously agrees to approach the king, however, she has kept her religious and ethnic identity a secret for obvious reasons. After hosting two banquets for the king and Haman, Esther reveals her Jewish identity, and in the presence of the king she tells of Haman's treachery to slaughter her and all her people. His plot to destroy the Jewish people is exposed and Haman and his sons are taken away and executed. Mordecai then becomes Prime Minister and is honored; Esther remains queen and the Jewish people are spared from extermination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Esther 7:3-8, 'Queen Esther replied, &quot;If I have found favour in your sight O King, and if it pleases the king, let my life be given me as my petition, and my people as my request; for we have been sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be killed and to be annihilated. Now if we had only been sold as slaves, men and women, I would have remained silent, for the trouble would not be commensurate with the annoyance to the king.&quot; Then King Ahasuerus asked Queen Esther, &quot;Who is he, and where is he, who would presume to do thus?&quot; Esther said, &quot;A foe and an enemy is this wicked Haman!&quot; Then Haman became terrified before the king and queen. The king arose in his anger from drinking wine and went into the palace garden, but Haman stayed to beg for his life from Queen Esther, for he saw that harm had been determined against him by the king. Now when the king returned from the palace garden into the place where they were drinking wine, Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was. Then the king said, &quot;Will he even assault the queen with me in the house?&quot; As the word went out of the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Purim holiday commemorates this deliverance and the name Purim comes from the fact that Haman had thrown lots (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;purim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;) to determine when he should commence the execution of his plot of genocide against the Jewish people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;A Minor Holiday?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Purim is classified as one of the minor holidays for the Jewish people, yet that's not the assessment of the ancient rabbis and many believed the book of Esther was intended to illustrate that God is at work behind the scenes on behalf of His people which makes sense in light of the fact that Esther, a biblical text, doesn't mention the name of God, the concept of religion or even the ritual of prayer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#endnote1&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 8pt; color: windowtext;&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The book of Esther doesn't mention God at all, yet God is seen invisibly throughout the entire unfolding of that particular period of Jewish history. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;More than one Jewish sage has compared Purim to the major holiday of Yom Kippur.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#endnote2&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Hasidim interpreted Purim as a classic case of Kiddush Ha-Shem (the Sanctification of the Name) where individual Jews were willing to die rather than forsake their faith.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#endnote3&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0cm;&quot; data-mce-mark=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The preservation of the Jewish people under severe hardship and genocidal threats is a theme woven throughout Jewish history, at Purim, Haman is a metaphor of evil like Pharaoh, or Antiochus Epiphanes of the Seleucid Empire, or Chmielnicki (who conducted the pogroms in Russia), or even Adolf Hitler and his attempted genocide of the Jewish people. In a speech in 1944, Hitler said, that if the Nazis were defeated, the Jewish people could celebrate &quot;a second triumphant Purim.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#endnote4&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0cm;&quot; data-mce-mark=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yet the rabbinical interpretation of Purim that lies at the heart of the book of Esther is the Amalekite curse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#endnote5&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0cm;&quot; data-mce-mark=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Curse of Amalek&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the book of Esther, Haman is referred to as an Agagite, a descendant of Agag, King of Amalek. The first encounter with the Amalekites is recorded in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Exodus 17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#endnote6&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 8pt; color: windowtext;&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Israelites were wandering in the wilderness prior to settling in the promised land and the Amalekite people made the grievous mistake of becoming the first of the Canaanite nations to attack them after the Exodus. For this act of arrogance, the Amalekites were punished with the ultimate ignominy in the ancient Near East: the blotting out of their name.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Exodus 17:14-16, 'The Lord said to Moses, &quot;Write this in a book as a memorial and recite it to Joshua, that I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven.&quot; Moses built an altar and named it The Lord is My Banner; and he said, &quot;The Lord has sworn; the Lord will have war against Amalek from generation to generation.&quot;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The disgraced Gentile prophet Balaam referred to Amalek's demise in Numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Numbers 24:20, 'and he looked at Amalek and took up his discourse and said, &quot;Amalek was the first of the nations, but his end shall be destruction.&quot;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The shame of the Amalekites is memorialized when Moses makes his farewell speech to the people of Israel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Deuteronomy 25:17-19, &quot;Remember what Amalek did to you along the way when you came out from Egypt, how he met you along the way and attacked among you all the stragglers at your rear when you were faint and weary and he did not fear God. Therefore it shall come about when the Lord your God has given you rest from all your surrounding enemies, in the land which the Lord your God gives you as an inheritance to possess, you shall blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven: you must not forget.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The idea of blotting out the memory of the name of the Amalekite descendant Haman took many forms. In ancient Persia and Babylon an effigy of Haman was burned. (Those who remember fire cracker night will remember burning an effigy of Guy Falks) In the 1800s in Eastern Europe, Jews would write the name of Haman on the soles of their shoes and when his name was spoken, they would stamp their feet, erasing the writing into the ground. Modern customs include the use of noisemakers, cap pistols and the like to drown out the name of Haman whenever it's read during the recounting of the book of Esther during Purim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The theme of cursing or blotting out the names of evil men is found throughout the Torah, the Prophets, and the Writings. The Hebrew verb that is most often used in this context is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;'makhah'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which means 'to blot out' or 'to obliterate.' It occurs in the Hebrew Scriptures 35 times in various forms, often describing the actions of God to 'blot out' the name or the memory of particular individuals or nations. Sometimes it refers to the 'blotting out' of sin. It is the word used in the Torah for God's promise to blot out the name of Amalek, but it is also used several times in reference to God's anger toward the people of Israel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What's in a Name?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-mce-mark=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Names were much more meaningful in ancient times. They symbolized who a person was and not just what he was called by others. A striking example of this is found in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Exodus 33&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, when Moses asks God to reveal himself in a more personal way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Exodus 33:18-19, 'Then Moses said, &quot;I pray You, show me Your glory!&quot; And He (God) said, &quot;I Myself will make all My goodness pass before you, and will proclaim the name of the Lord before you; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show compassion on whom I will show compassion.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In other words, to have an illuminated knowledge of God, Moses is told he will hear God's name proclaimed in his presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;People are given names to illuminate or illustrate their character. A name could invoke honour, respect, fear, pity, scorn or ridicule. For example, when Jacob's name was changed to Israel, he went from being known as the supplanter (the one who took his brother's birthright) to being the one who strives with God, because he had wrestled with God and prevailed. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Genesis 32)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;One of the most important aspects of life was to pass one's good name on to one's descendants. A good name would endure through many generations. It meant honour even after death, but, shame if a name was forgotten or blotted out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When it comes to honour for God's name, Jewish tradition requires us to avoid the pronunciation of the tetragrammaton (the name of God). The reason given is that we might disgrace God's name by mispronouncing it or speaking it in vain. We bury Torah scrolls when they are no longer usable because they contain the written name of God, which must be revered and never obliterated. Many observant Jews avoid writing even the Hebrew letters which make up God's name, since words on a chalkboard will eventually be erased and words on scraps of paper might accidentally be thrown away or burned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Against such a background, one can see the severity of God's curse on the Amalekites, consigning their name and memory to oblivion so that the only mention of them is one of public shame and disgrace in the Bible. Yet, despite the attempts by Israel to forget about this arrogant nation, the name of Amalek came back to haunt them several hundred years after the Exodus 17 encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Agag, King of Amalek&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The problem with the Amalekites was aggravated when Saul was the first king of Israel. He was accepted by God when the people demanded they have a &quot;king to rule over them.&quot; Saul had severe character flaws which eventually destroyed the monarchy he established. One such flaw was his tendency to disregard complete obedience of God.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Saul ignored God's word to destroy the entire city of Amalek. Those who lived there were the biological and spiritual descendants of the nation God had cursed in the wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Saul and his army won the battle, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;…but Saul and the army spared Agag and the best of the sheep and cattle, the fat calves and lambs —everything that was good.&quot; (&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/I%20Samuel%2015.8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;I Samuel 15:8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Saul's refusal to carry out the judgment of God on Agag not only cost him his throne, but also brought grief to a future generation of Israel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Haman the Agagite&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Not only was Haman an Agagite, but we are also told in the Book of Esther that Mordecai was from the tribe of Benjamin and a descendant of Kish. King Saul was also a Benjaminite, and his father's name was Kish. Can you see that the enmity between Mordecai and Haman was the dramatic climax of a battle that had lasted almost one thousand years?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Moses and Amalek, Saul and Agag, and now Mordecai and Haman. The curse of Amalek and the obliteration of his name repeat again in the Scroll of Esther. It is at Purim that we are able, along with all of Israel, to join Mordecai in blotting out the name of Haman, and by transference, the names of Agag and Amalek. It is no coincidence that we make noise and try to drown out the reader each time Haman's name is mentioned during the reading of the account of Esther.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Like those who follow the ancient tradition of writing the name of Haman on the soles of their shoes, we are obliterating the name that God has cursed and judged each time we stamp our feet, boo and hiss, and make loud noises. The name of Haman is shameful, and should be blotted out, if only symbolically, for it stands for evil, hatred, and rebellion against the God of Israel. In contrast, the names of Esther and Mordecai bring joyful remembrance, and are to be honoured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the book of Esther, Haman ended on the very gallows he had constructed for Mordecai. Hanging on gallows conjures up the image of a man's limp body suspended by a rope with a noose around his neck. However, according to the Greek historian Herodotus,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#endnote7&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;hanging was a much more painful form of execution. In ancient Persia, Haman did not hang from a noose, but instead was impaled on a stake and lifted up in the air; it was an early form of crucifixion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Haman's crime and punishment was horrendous and incredibly shameful. It's reminiscent of the passage in Deuteronomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Deuteronomy%2021.23&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Deuteronomy 21:22-23&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;, 'IF a man has committed a sin worthy of death and he is put to death and you hang him on a tree (hang not impale), his body shall not hang all night on the tree, but you shall surely bury him on the same day (for he who is hanged is accursed of God), so that you do not defile your land which the Lord your God gives you as an inheritance.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Good and Evil&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The rejoicing at Purim reminds us of the faithfulness of God and the quintessential triumph of a righteous victim over an evil oppressor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yet there are those today who see the meaning of Purim in terms of our good deeds overpowering the Haman's of this world. But reality tells us that despite our many good and noble efforts to work within social and political frameworks, there are too many Haman's for the Esther's and the Mordecai's to handle. As simplistic as it may sound, could it be that the only way to rebuild the world is for it to be turned upside down once again…and that if it were to be turned upside down, it would finally be…right side up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What if the innocent willingly took the place of the guilty. Would the weight of such a sacrifice be enough to swing the world back to an upright position—a position where people could face God and ask forgiveness? Instead of an evil Haman hanging from the gallows, what if an innocent one, made this sacrifice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Would the innocent one's name be blotted out, forever cursed? Or would such a name become the name that brings life and salvation, a name that is above all other names, a name before which someday all will &quot;bend the knee and bow down.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#endnote8&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This Purim, as we follow tradition and blot out the name of Amalek, Haman and their ilk, we might also consider the claims of the Yeshua whose very name actually means 'salvation.' He offers life and peace to all, both Jews and Gentiles, who trust in His name. And all who follow Yeshua, according to the New Covenant, will have their own names written in the book of life, where they can never be blotted out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#endnote9&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-mce-mark=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Cursed be Haman and his kind! Blessed be Mordecai and Esther, and all those who are faithful to the God of Israel!&lt;/p&gt;

19028,Home Group - Korban...Huh?,"&lt;p&gt;25 February, 2015&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;Korban....Huh?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;You may or may not be a fan of the sitcom 'Seinfeld', I personally have never been a fan...the supposed 'funniest show on television' didn't ever make me laugh but I heard about an episode where Jerry and his friends discovered a great soup restaurant that was owned by a really short-tempered man. People would line up down the block to dine at this man's restaurant or buy it to take away but if for some reason the owner got annoyed at a customer, he would apparently yell....&quot;No soup for you!&quot; and would send them away empty-handed. Jerry's friends nicknamed him the 'Soup Nazi'. Not a PC name but his nickname none-the-less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This particular Seinfeld episode was actually based on a real restaurant in New York City owned by an Iranian man who was apparently quite a grumpy individual in real life and was the inspiration for the character in this episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Home Group is not about Seinfeld episodes but the interesting thing about the restaurant owner is that his attitude is very much a 'Middle Eastern' mannerism that dates all the way back to Bible times. When people get annoyed or cranky, they immediately forbid them from something. If he's a soup cook, he might rashly burst out with a restriction of no soup for today...or for a year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It was a common way of venting or expressing disgust in ancient time...people would explode and rashly respond with 'Corban what I would eat with you!&quot; or &quot;Corban by my legs that would walk with you!&quot;, or &quot;Corban be my mouth that speaks with you!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The word corban means 'dedicated' or something sacred offered to God and it implied that something would be committed, dedicated or offered as a gift or offering to God usually via the Temple service. Now it didn't literally mean that the item would be given, just that it was prohibited for whatever purpose that was named. In other words, if something was declared to be 'corban' (an offering to God) it could no longer be used for its original purpose or it would be as though a person was reneging on their vow to God which was expressly forbidden under the Law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;So if someone said, 'Corban what I would eat with you!&quot; what they were in fact saying is that my food is now an offering to God so the meal I was going to eat with you I can no longer eat with you as it belongs to God. To violate an oath is considered to be a sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Are there examples of making rash vows in the Bible? There sure are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Judges 11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; tells the story of Jephthah a leader in Israel during the time of the Judges who went to war against the sons of Ammon. God used him mightily but Jephthat made a very rash vow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Judges 11:30-31, 'Jephthah made a vow to the Lord and said, &quot;If You will indeed give the sons of Ammon into my hand, then is shall be that whatever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the sons of Ammon, it shall be the Lord's, and I will offer it up as a burnt offering.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Lord did give him victory and when he returned home his daughter walked out of his front door and with a sad heart he sacrificed his daughter to the Lord. Was this a legitimate vow, something the Lord was pleased with? Absolutely no, the Lord is against human/child sacrifice, He never required or sanctioned it and what's more, the Lord had made provision for those who made rash vows to get out of them. Whey didn't Jephthah take that option? What on earth did Jephthah think was going to come out of his house upon his return? How could he have thought a member of his own household would not possibly come out of his house to greet him? Jephthah's vow was in fact a vow that resulted in God's Law being contravened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Another example is from the life of Joshua leading the children of Israel into the Promised Land. In &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Joshua 9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, the Gibeonites heard what happened to Jericho and Ai, they sent a delegation to meet with Joshua to seek an oath that they would be safe from harm and to convince Joshua, they pretended they were from a very far country even though they were one of the tribal peoples living in Canaan at the time. They deceived Joshua into making an oath, a vow, to never fight against them. Later in chapter 9, Joshua realises he was conned. Joshua didn't seek the Lord before making his vow to the Gibeonites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Making his rash vow/oath caused him to disobey God's commands regarding the people who were living in that area...perhaps he should have sought the Lord about whether the oath he made was valid considering it was made through deceit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Throughout the centuries there has been lengthy debate and discussion between rabbis about vows and what was considered binding or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Numbers 30:2, 'If a man makes a vow to the Lord, or takes an oath to bind himself with a binding obligation, he shall not violate his word; he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The rabbis take the obligations of vows very, very seriously and discussed whether a person was always bound by it...what about when it’s obviously rash or will cause them to sin in some way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Again, the extreme example we can refer back to is that of Jephthah offering his daughter as a burnt offering because of his rash vow to the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yeshua also weighed in on this subject...the word 'cor&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;ban' was used at a time when He &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;scolded some of His opponents for their ruling on this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Mark 7:5-13, 'The Pharisees and the Scribes asked Him, &quot;Why do Your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with impure hands?&quot; And He said to them, &quot;Rightly did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written: 'This people honours Me with their lips but their heart is far away from Me. But in vain do they worship Me, teaching as doctrines the precepts of men.' Neglecting the commandment of God, you hold to the tradition of men.&quot; He was also saying to them, &quot;You are experts at setting aside the commandments of God in order to keep your tradition. For Moses said, 'Honour your father and your mother,&quot; and &quot;He who speaks evil of father or mother is to be put to death,&quot; but you say, &quot;if a man says to his father or his mother, whatever I have that would help you is corban (that is to say, given to God),&quot; you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or his mother; thus invalidating the Word of God by your tradition which you have handed down; and you do many things such as that.&quot;'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Some interpreters have read this passage as if the Jewish leadership was encouraging people to vow their possessions to the Temple so that they could profit by it, leaving impoverished families behind. But much more likely, a hot-headed young man was arguing with his parents and shouted, “&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Corban&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;what I would give you when you are old!” The lawyers were debating whether the man was obligated to keep the terrible oath he made, and apparently some thought he was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Many have assumed that all the Jewish leadership held the position that any man making such a claim was obligated by the law of vows but that's not the case, the debate had long been had that no tradition was to ever undermine God's laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;However, during Yeshua's earthly ministry and for about 400 years prior to His arrival back to the time of Micah, the religious leadership - especially the ruling priesthood in the Temple - had become very corrupt and they were ripping the people off and therefore, any man who rashly claimed that his money was now corban - that is dedicated to God - had to be given to the Temple (them) even if it meant that the man's parent became destitute and impoverished. An action that was diametrically opposed to God's higher law of honouring mother and father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Everything we do must be measured by God's laws, God's standards, God's heart for life, family, forgiveness and righteousness. No vow or oath that undermines God's laws and statutes has legitimacy in His eyes, and we are never to make oaths of vows or covenants with anyone or any group or organisation because by doing so we obligate ourselves to human traditions and bylaws which are intrinsically flawed because of their human origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Listen to what Yeshua said on this subject...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Matthew 5:33-37, &quot;You have heard that the ancients were told, 'You shall not make false vows, but shall fulfill your vows to the Lord.' But I say to you, make no oath at all, either by heaven for it is the throne of God, or by the earth, for it is the footstool of His feet, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King, nor shall you make an oath by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black. But let your statement be, 'yes, yes' or 'no no'; anything beyond these is of evil.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Every decision or position we make or hold to must be 100% aligned with God's Word not with the words, traditions or good ideas of men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mandy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;~~~~~~~&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Apostle John said at the end of his Gospel account of the life and ministry of Yeshua the following words...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;John 20:30-31, &quot;Therefore many other signs Yeshua also performed in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book; but these have been written so that you may believe that Yeshua is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing you may have life in His name.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Do you remember what we talked about the last couple of weeks on Home Group? We talked about Christ being the 'Anointed One', the 'Mashiach', the 'Messiah'...the KING!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What did our Messiah come to do? He came to earth as one of us...a human being, He came to die in our place for our sin so that we might be saved and made right with the Father and have eternal life with Him. He came that we would be made righteous and clean before Him, whole, holy and transformed by the power of God the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Our allegiance however is not to a peasant even though Christ's earthly life was a poor one, and our allegiance is not to a zealot or rebel leader even though He preached a message unheard of in Israel at that time in Israel's history. Our allegiance is to a King...in fact the King of Kings - God manifest in the flesh!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What should our response be when we're confronted with this truth? We should believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Believe what? Believe how? What do we need to believe to be saved?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Someone commented on a post I put on Facebook about the Old Covenant Scriptures being just as important as the New Covenant Scriptures and while they agreed, they asked a question about why certain books are included and why certain books are not. Many people have asked this question wondering whether mistakes have been made over both inclusions and exclusions. This uncertainty then leads people to conclude that the Bible isn't infallible and likely has a lot of errors and therefore isn't trustworthy and the ultimate result of this view is that no one can really know for sure what truth is so we don't really know what we should believe. If you come to this conclusion you end up in a big mess of doubt and fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;People have tied themselves up in knots over this very thing, but the truth is, there's a very simple answer to this non-dilemma but you may not have considered this before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The writers of the New Covenant Scripture wrote that it was necessary for individuals to &lt;i&gt;'believe in Christ'&lt;/i&gt; and it's possible that we've missed what they actually meant if we don't understand the context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Let me say right at the outset that it is important to understand the technicalities and trustworthy nature of Scripture and how we came to have the specific books of the Bible the way they are. It's important to understand the supernatural structure and message and interconnectivity of the Scripture and the detail and harmony of all 66 books. We absolutely need to understand sound doctrine and to equip ourselves so that we can give an account of our faith...but all this comes after salvation and belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;But what does believing really mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Apostle John in His Gospel account talks more about 'believing' than anyone else and the key is found right at the end of &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;John 20.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;John 20:30-31, &quot;Therefore many other signs Yeshua also performed in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book; but these have been written so that you may believe that Yeshua is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing you may have life in His name.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;You may not have noticed this but the first thing John does is dismiss the idea that you and I need to know every single thing about Yeshua's life. John himself was aware of a myriad of things Yeshua did and said...in fact there were so many other things that the Lord did that the world wouldn't be big enough to contain the books that would be required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;John 21:25, &quot;And there are also many other things which Yeshua did, which if they were written in detail, I supposed that even the world itself would not contain the books that would be written.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The most important thing that John wanted to stress wasn't the deeds and miracles Yeshua performed but who He really is...He is the Christ. That is the single most important thing for us to believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Again, as we learned last week, the Christ is the Anointed One, the Mashiach, the Messiah...the KING!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What Yeshua did...and what Yeshua said all confirmed one thing...who He IS and if He is King then we are His subjects and we bow to His authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Believing in Christ is all about authority&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This means that all of humanity is ultimately answerable to Him even if at this point most ignore Him or even deny Him but for those of us who claim to belong to Him, we are to surrender to His reign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When we refer to people “accepting Christ” or “receiving the Lord” we're saying that people are becoming Christians and while we say the words we don't always understand what the really, really means and because of this lack of understanding, many 'Christians' wander aimlessly through their faith journey without any real comprehension of what it means to surrender to the rule of another and in our modern era, it's even worse because many modern churches have made the Christian the centre of the universe with Christ existing to fulfill the dreams, aspirations and desires of the believer instead of the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;John talks about 'believing in Christ' while the Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke talk about 'entering the Kingdom of God'...and when you put that together you see that when we believe in Yeshua as Christ the King we then 'enter the Kingdom of God' as His servile subjects. Yeshua doesn't enter our kingdom to be our subject and do our bidding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Believing implies that the believer who has entered into the Kingdom of God is bound to following the orders of the King, in other words, i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;f we believe in Christ’s ultimate authority as King and Sovereign, it also means that we aspire to follow His commands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;John 3:35-36, &quot;The Father loves the Son and has given all things into His hand. He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;'Believing' is a verb but it means a whole lot more than mental ascent, rather it's parallel in meaning to that of obedience which sounds a little bizarre to a western mindset because so much of what we're taught is mental whereas the Hebrew mindset is always practical with a physical, literal response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In case you're still a bit puzzled about this, here is what Yeshua Himself said...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Matthew 7:21, &quot;Not everyone who says to Me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father who is in heaven will enter.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This is a scary scenario because it's pointing to a group of people who have mentally acknowledges Yeshua and profess to be doing all manner of spiritual things in His name but in actual fact, they're building a reputation and name for themselves alone. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Verse 23&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Yeshua went on to say...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Matthew 7:23, &quot;Then I will declare to them (those who gave mental ascent to Him and did lots of works in His name), 'I never knew you; depart from me, you who practice lawlessness.'&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Wow! What things did Yeshua list as lawlessness? Prophesying in His name, casting out demons in His name, performing many miracles in His name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Does that mean those things are wrong? No, because they're the things Yeshua and the Apostles did during the course of their ministries, but the warning here is that these people are not obeying the commands of the King that governed His kingdom; they were lawless; they were living according to their own laws...they were a law unto themselves doing their own thing while building their own little empire, all done in His name but without any authority of backing of the King Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Have you ever heard the of the word 'euaggelion'? It's the announcement of a king or as we more commonly know it, the Gospel or the Good News and it's primarily proclaimed through a messenger, envoy or ambassador.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Paul was absolutely obsessed with preaching the announcement of the King - the Gospel - it was the official announcement that the King had come to power. God anointed Yeshua as His King and sent His ambassador Paul to the Gentile world so that we would believe in Him as our King and enter the Kingdom of God and be subject to His Laws, His standards, His commands, His plans and His rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What saves us?&amp;nbsp; Belief in Christ as our King through faith in His completed work on the cross. Sound doctrine comes after as we submit ourselves to His commands so that we learn to be obedient subjects yielding to the authority of our Sovereign and King.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

17575,Home Group - What Does 'Christ' Actually Mean?,"&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;What Does 'Christ' Actually Mean?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When we use the name &lt;i&gt;Jesus Christ&lt;/i&gt; we know exactly who we're referring to; we're referring to the Son of God who's life and exploits are detailed in the Gospel accounts of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, but there are many people who don't actually know what the word &lt;i&gt;Christ&lt;/i&gt; means. Many Christians have grown up believing that Jesus is His first name and Christ is His surname. For some that sounds ridiculous but it's absolutely true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;So just what does the word &lt;i&gt;Christ&lt;/i&gt; mean and why do we use it in relation to Yeshua?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The word &lt;i&gt;Christ&lt;/i&gt; is in fact one of the most important and fundamental words in the vocabulary of every Christian or it should be, but to truly understand its significance you have to delve into the ancient context of the Bible and when you do, it's amazing what you discover. &amp;nbsp;The word &lt;i&gt;Christ&lt;/i&gt; comes from the Greek word &lt;i&gt;Christos&lt;/i&gt; and it means 'anointed.' The Hebrew equivalent is the word &lt;i&gt;mashiach&lt;/i&gt; which in English translates to &lt;i&gt;Messiah&lt;/i&gt;. So, someone who is the Christ is the Messiah, the anointed One of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Many believers will already know this and they'll be wondering why we're looking at this because we understand that Yeshua is the &lt;i&gt;Christ&lt;/i&gt; , the &lt;i&gt;Messiah&lt;/i&gt; so...here endeth the lesson!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;But what does &lt;i&gt;Jesus Christ, &lt;/i&gt;or&lt;i&gt; Yeshua Messiah &lt;/i&gt;actually &lt;i&gt;mean&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;For a person to be anointed literally means to have sacred oil poured on their head, and this signifies that God has chosen them for a special task. Priests and kings and on rare occasions prophets, were anointed this way and it signified to everyone in the nation that they had been selected, chosen by God to fulfill a particular role and purpose. In Israel, during the coronation of the king, they didn't receive a crown, rather they were crowned with anointed oil in sight of the people. A crown may have been worn later during official functions or celebrations, but not at their coronation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Prophets and priests were anointed but the phrase &lt;i&gt;anointed one&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;the Lord's anointed&lt;/i&gt; was usually used to identify a king and this can be seen in a situation that occurred between David and Saul. Saul was the sitting king over Israel but God had rejected him because of his repeated rebellion and sin so God sent Samuel the prophet to anoint David as king. Saul felt threatened by David and attempted to kill him, in spite of David's faithfulness to him, so David fled from Saul and lived in hiding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;During one of Saul's many hunting expeditions of David, David and his men were hiding in a cave that Saul had entered to relieve himself and David crept near him and cut a portion from the hem of Saul's robe. David's men encouraged him to kill Saul because they believed God had delivered Saul into his hands and if Saul was dead, David could easily assume the throne, after all, he'd been anointed by Israel's prophet Samuel to be Israel's king and God had obviously rejected Saul outright. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;However, after cutting Saul's robe David felt enormous remorse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;1 Samuel 24:6, 'So he said to his men, &quot;Far be it from me because of the Lord that I should do this thing to my lord, the Lord's anointed (mashiach), to stretch out my hand against him, since he is the Lord's anointed (mashiach).&quot;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Over and over again, the Biblical imagery for &lt;i&gt;anointed one&lt;/i&gt; (mashiach) is that of a king. Yes, there are&amp;nbsp; a few occasions when it refers to a priest, but the overwhelming majority of references are of God choosing a king. He would speak to one of His prophets instructing him to anoint someone and proclaim him to be king and the act of anointing with sacred oil indicated that it was a divine appointment, that God had personally selected a specific man who would be anointed and ordained with His authority to act as His representative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Think about that for moment. God would choose a man to be king over His people, imbued with God's authority to act as His representative!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Now for most Christians, describing Yeshua's identity usually leads to the following titles: Son of God, Suffering Servant, Bridegroom, the Good Shepherd, Alpha and Omega, Beginning and End, Emmanuel - God with us, the Holy One, Lamb of God, Saviour, Lord God Almighty, Prince of Peace, Son of Man, Rabbi, Redeemer, Son of David, Wonderful Counsellor, and these are all absolutely true. Some might say 'King of Kings and Lord of Lords' but never really stop to consider that Yeshua is a king...He is royalty, a direct descendant of King David and the legitimate heir to the throne of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;So Yeshua is our coming King...is this a literal kingdom with a literal throne or is a spiritual kingdom with a spiritual throne?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Looking at the theme of Messiah - a coming king - is actually a dominant theme throughout the Bible, the Old Covenant indicates that God would send a great king to rule over Israel. When Jacob was close to dying he called his 12 sons to his bedside and blessed each one of them and to his son Judah he said...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Genesis 49:10, &quot;The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, until Shiloh comes, and to Him shall be the obedience of the peoples.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Jewish religious leaders and the general populace at the time of Yeshua's earthly ministry, and during the preceding centuries had an expectation that their expected Messiah would be a king who would overthrow the despotic rule of the occupying Romans and bring the nation to physical redemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;So the passage in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genesis 49&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, was the first hint that they were expecting a great king to arise out of Israel who would be king over the whole earth. There is a very clear prophesy about a future messianic King that was given during the lifetime of king David. David desperately wanted to build a temple for the Lord and while this pleased God, God would not permit David to build it because he was a warrior who had spilled the blood of those he warred with. The man who was permitted to build the temple was David's son Solomon who was not a soldier, he was a man of peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God went on to promise that He - God - would build a 'house' for David that would never end. Now David already lived in a splendid house, so God was not referring to a new physical building but rather to a family lineage, a house of descendants that would never end but would culminate with a specific king who would ultimately rule over an everlasting kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 Chronicles 17:11-14, &quot;When your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers, that I will set up one of your descendants after you, who will be of your sons; and I will establish his kingdom. He shall build for Me a house, and I will establish his throne forever. I will be his Father and he shall be My son; and I will not take My lovingkindness away from him, as I took it from him who was before you. But I will settle him in My house and in My kingdom forever, and his throne shall be established forever.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We know that this prophecy has dual application because Solomon, David's son, succeeded him and he did in fact build a magnificent temple for the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;However, Solomon was a mere human being and a very sinful one at that. He disobeyed the Lord's instructions in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Deuteronomy 17:16-17&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that stated kings were not to accumulate excess wealth for themselves, excess horses, (personal military power), and they were not to accumulate many wives otherwise those wives would turn the kings hearts away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;King Solomon, blessed to phenomenal levels by God, broke each of those instructions. Solomon is world famous for his unprecedented personal wealth, for his famed 'Solomon's Stables', his own private army; but mostly, Solomon is famous for his many foreign wives. Solomon had 700 wives and 300 concubines, most of them were foreign wives whom he married for political expediency and those wives - just as God said they would - held to their own pagan practices, and to please and appease them, Solomon not only allowed them to practice paganism, he actually sanctioned and established those false religions throughout his nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When Solomon was an old man, his foreign wives turned his heart away from the Lord and he embraced the pagan worship and practices of their religions. He pursued the worship of Ashtoreth and Milcom, he built high places for pagan worship for Chemosh and Molech and he burned sacrifices and made offerings to these pagan gods. What sacrifice did Molech require? The lives of first born sons! Solomon sacrificed his children to this vile god. He committed great evil and God became very angry with him; and considering the level of wisdom that God endowed him with, what excuse did Solomon have to reject and deny God? God had in fact appeared to Solomon twice and warned him explicitly not to follow after false gods. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(1 Kings 11:4-10)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;So we know that Solomon's kingdom didn't last forever, in fact when Solomon's son Rehoboam took the throne after Solomon's death, the kingdom split in two, 10 tribes became part of what became Israel, the Northern Kingdom, and Judah and Benjamin from Jerusalem to the southern border became known as Judah, the Southern Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Northern Kingdom lasted about 210 years and the Southern Kingdom lasted about 350 years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Next week we'll continue on this theme looking at the presentation of Yeshua the &lt;em&gt;Christ/Messiah&lt;/em&gt; through a New Covenant lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

17574,Home Group - It's All About Context ,"&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;It's All About Context&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the English language is just so frustrating!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What do you think of when I say the word, 'crane'? Do you think of a bird? What about a huge machine that is used to lift heavy objects? Or perhaps you're thinking of someone who is stretching, 'craning' their neck to see something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;You could only know what kind of 'crane' I'm referring to by knowing the context or setting that it's being used? Here are some other words that have dual meanings...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Date can refer to a fruit, a particular day in the calendar or a young couple going out on a 'date'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Engaged is what a couple become when they've agreed marry, then they become engaged in the preparations of the wedding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;What about the word function...it describes the process that a machine or item is designed for and it also describes a group gathering for a particular reason such as a business function or social function.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Foil is a metallic food wrap but a foil is also what someone does to thwart someone else's plans or efforts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Leaves grow on the branches of trees...but it also refers to the action of a person who leaves the house to go to work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;You would be right to turn right at the next green light.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you can type, you have acquired a useful skill, but what type of keyboard should you use? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, the point I'm trying to make has nothing whatsoever to do with the point of a pen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Actually, the point I'm trying to make is that the process of understanding the true meaning of words that have multiple meanings is the context in which they're set and when it comes to the Bible, it's incredibly important that we understand correctly the meaning of words because just like the examples of English we've just looked at, the meanings can be poles apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There are some Hebrew words that are really difficult to translate into English, and one such word is&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;pakad&lt;/i&gt;, but just because it's difficult to translate doesn't mean it's not really fascinating. &lt;i&gt;Pakad&lt;/i&gt; can be both a wonderful word or it can be a really terrible word, it all depends on the context. Go back a few years to your childhood and remember a time when your mother said something like, &lt;i&gt;&quot;Just wait until your father gets home!&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What did she mean by that? Well, you really have to know the context. Perhaps it was your birthday and you were waiting for your present but your father was bringing it home with him and so therefore, your mum had to calm your frustration by saying, &quot;Just wait until your father gets home!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Perhaps you were all packed and ready to go on holiday but you couldn't leave until your dad returned with some last minute bits and pieces and your mum reminded you to settle down and &quot;just wait until your father gets home.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;But what if your mum received a letter from your school informing her of a serious misdemeanor you'd committed and she simply didn't feel equipped to deal with it and after telling you about the contents of the letter, she said, &quot;Just wait until your father gets home!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;That's what the word '&lt;i&gt;pakad&lt;/i&gt;' is like. It can refer to something wonderful or dreadful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Some Bible translations translate '&lt;i&gt;pakad&lt;/i&gt;' as 'visit', however, it's not really a full understanding because 'visit' leaves the reader thinking that God calls in to see His people once in a while and then is mostly separate from them and that's not correct. '&lt;i&gt;Pakad'&lt;/i&gt; has been translated in various different ways to try to convey it's meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Psalm 8:4, 'What is man that You take thought of him, and the son of man that You 'care' for him?'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In this case it's translated as 'care', but it's also in the book of Ruth and translated as 'visited'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ruth 1:6, 'Then she arose with her daughters-in-law that she might return from the land of Moab, for she had heard in the land of Moab that the Lord had 'visited' His people giving them food.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Also, 1 Samuel uses the word &lt;i&gt;'pakad'&lt;/i&gt; to refer to God 'visiting' Hannah by answering her prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;1 Samuel 2:21, 'The Lord 'visited' Hannah; and she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. And the boy Samuel grew before the Lord.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In reality, the Lord both cared for and visited His people in the examples above, but even more than that, He gave His attention to their needs, He responded with compassion to their needs and grief, He blessed and provided for them, and in very real measure, He watched over and visited &lt;i&gt;upon&lt;/i&gt; them. English translators have to settle on the best word from the English language to convey the message of the original and as you can see, it's not an easy task at all. But what about when the context is other than one of care, compassion or paying attention to grief or restoration? Here is another place where &lt;i&gt;'pakad'&lt;/i&gt; is used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Exodus 32:34, &quot;But go now, lead the people where I told you. Behold, My angel shall go before you; nevertheless in the day when I 'punish', I will 'punish' them for their sin.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The word '&lt;i&gt;pakad&lt;/i&gt;' is used twice and is translated as 'punish', some translations use the word 'visit'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This is a negative rendering of '&lt;i&gt;pakad&lt;/i&gt;' from God. Just like God responded to Hannah's prayer, in this instance, God responds to the sins of His people and not with blessing but with discipline and judgment. &amp;nbsp;This particular situation in Exodus was during the sin of the golden calf while Moses was receiving instruction from the Lord, and God did 'visit' His people and many of them died that day. But when Moses wrote down all God told Him, this message became very much like the mother's warning of, &quot;Just wait until your father gets home!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In all the instances that '&lt;i&gt;pakad&lt;/i&gt;' is used, it relays the idea or the intention that God is and will pay attention to the needs of His people regardless of whether or not it's for positive or negative reasons in just the same way parents will respond to the needs of their children, be it when their children are good and deserve reward, when they're sad and heartbroken and need comfort, care and protection, or when they've done wrong and are in need of discipline or punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Jeremiah understood the dual application of the word '&lt;i&gt;pakad&lt;/i&gt;' as well and he even used both meanings in the very same line. God had a message for the leaders of His people who were leading them in error and it was a message that should have had them shaking in their boots.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jeremiah 23:2, 'Therefore thus says the Lord God of Israel concerning the shepherds who are tending My people: &quot;You have scattered My flock and driven them away, and have not 'attended' to them; behold I am about to 'attend' to you for the evil of your deeds,&quot; declares the Lord.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In this verse the word &lt;i&gt;'pakad'&lt;/i&gt; is translated as &lt;i&gt;'attended'&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;'attend'&lt;/i&gt;. Some translations say, &lt;i&gt;'...not bestowed care on them, I will bestow punishment on you...'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Jeremiah was issuing a warning from the Lord that God was going to focus His attention upon the bad shepherds who were committing evil against His people and when His attention focused on them the consequences would be devastating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yeshua also used this word, when He announced God's visitation in the New Covenant, the translation is of the Greek equivalent - episkope, which means, 'that act by which God looks into and searches out the ways, deeds and character of men, in order to adjudge them their lot accordingly, whether joyous or sad.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Luke 19:41-44, 'When He approached Jerusalem, He saw the city and wept over it, saying, &quot;If you had known in this day, even you, the things which make for peace! But now they have been hidden from your eyes. For the days with come upon you when your enemies will throw up a barricade against you, and surround you and hem you in on every side, and they will level you to the ground and your children within you, and they will not leave in you one stone upon another, because you did not recognise the time of your visitation.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The interesting thing about this passage is that Yeshua was saying that the day of their visitation had happened...it was the day of His arrival, His blessing, His ministry and His redemption...but because they didn't believe Him, He described for them a 'visitation' yet to come of their enemies that would be the exact opposite of what He had offered them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yeshua was Himself the very strongest meaning of &lt;i&gt;'pakad'&lt;/i&gt; in its Hebraic context...He is the very expression of care, of visiting compassion, mercy and blessing on His people, loving them and through His own sacrifice, providing forgiveness, restoration and eternal life to those who would repent and believe in Him. And conversely, to those who ignore Him, who reject and despise Him, who mock Him and His sacrifice on their behalf...they will also experience a visitation, but it will not be wonderful, it will be terrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Fortunately, our God is gracious and every morning we wake to a new day, it's a day of mercy and grace, a gift from the Father that provides all men everywhere another opportunity to respond to His gift of eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Mandy&lt;/p&gt;

17348,Home Group - Our Undefinable God,"&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Our Undefinable God&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Psalm 145:3 'Great is the Lord and highly to be praised, and His greatness is unsearchable.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We finished out last year by looking at the differing views and outlook of both the Jewish / Eastern mindset and the Greek / Western mindset and how the positional outcomes can and often are poles apart. In our modern setting we could change the 'Greek' view to the 'intellectual view of reason'. The mindset hasn't really changed, the god of science has replaced the ancient mythical gods of the ancient world but the viewpoint is basically still the same.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;To the Greek mind, human reason was the final source and arbiter of truth and today's reasoning intellectuals hold to the exact same position. Higher criticism gets so angry and frustrated with the Bible because it fails to answer the demand of the philosophical questions of the intelligentsia, questions like...why doesn't the Bible provide proof that God really does exist? Since everything has an origin, what is the origin of God? Why doesn't the Bible define God thoroughly?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why does the Bible portray God with a million and one characteristics and then declare Him to be unsearchable? He's presented through His actions but so much about Him that human beings want to know is left unsaid.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;What the Bible does describe are the deep inner emotion feelings and turmoil of Israel's day by day relationship with God, sometimes close and intimate, sometimes distant and fragmented, sometimes resembling that of a parent and child, sometimes resembling and husband and wife and sometimes resembling a tempestuous family feud or even that of enemies. Israel is seen going from one extreme to the other...experiencing peace and exaltation and then despair and oppression and back again repeatedly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Karl Bath said this about God...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 28.55pt 0.0001pt 1cm; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;No attempt is made in the Bible to define God—that is, to grasp God in our concepts…The Bible tells the story of God; it narrates His deeds and the history of this God as it takes place on earth in the human sphere…The Bible is not a&amp;nbsp;philosophical&amp;nbsp;book, but a history book,&amp;nbsp;the book of God’s mighty acts, in which God becomes knowable to us.&quot; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;(1)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Knowing and understanding God comes through how He has chosen to reveal Himself through His Word and by His interactions with His creation and what He does among them, not through intellectual reasoning. Israel has had interaction and relationship with God more than any other people group on the planet and all that He has done in, for and through them is unparalleled and honestly, is beyond any kind of human explanation. And this explains why the Jewish people really haven't expended much energy of trying to philosophise and analyse God and then pigeon-hole Him into some kind of grid or or system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Abraham Heschel wrote...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 28.55pt 0.0001pt 1cm; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Speculation starts with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;concepts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, Biblical religion starts with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;events&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;… To the Jewish mind, the understanding of God is not achieved by referring in a Greek way to timeless qualities of a supreme being, to ideas of goodness or perfection, but rather by sensing the living acts of His concern, to His dynamic attentiveness to man…God’s goodness is not a cosmic force but a specific act of compassion. We do not know it as it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;but as it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;happens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&quot; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;(2)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I Will Be Known By What I Do&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Jews have never tried to reduce God to a definition; once He's defined He's no longer limitless and unsearchable and becomes like all the other false man-made gods of the nations who were made to satisfy their own desires and aspirations. God, unlike the gods of the ancient world, revealed Himself to the Hebrews for relationship not merely for their personal benefit and unlike the gods of the ancient world, the God of the Bible is presented as a Father, a Husband, a Protector...a PERSON...not merely an entity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Remember when Moses stood in God's presence at the burning bush and he asked God His name? How did God respond?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Exodus 3:14, 'God said to Moses, &quot;I AM WHO I AM...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the Hebrew He said, &lt;i&gt;&quot;eyeh asher eyeh&quot;&lt;/i&gt; and quite honestly, that's undefinable! Moses must have been stopped short by God's reply...what kind of a name is that! How is God supposed to be known and understood when His name was utterly incomprehensible and confusing&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Names were very, very important in ancient cultures, they were given for reasons and in very large part defined the individual. This is another stark difference between the gods of the ancient world and that of our God. The gods of the ancient world had names that humanised them, names like Ares which means to make war. His personality, demeanor and character was thus defined...Ares was a god of war!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pagan gods had names that likened them to human rulers, like Hera which means 'queen', or Molech which means 'king', Artemis which means a huntress, Athena which means intelligence and the list goes on. God's name given to Him by Himself is unlike any other god and reveals to humanity that He is incomprehensible and completely indescribable. He is NOTHING like the gods of the nations, He is incomparable to anyone else and He has determined that He will not be know through philosophical reasoning, but rather through what He has done and will yet do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;God hasn't proved Himself through scientific rationale and philosophical argument, rather God has revealed who He is be redeeming His people from slavery; by feeding them miraculously with manna from heaven; by protecting them from their enemies; by parting the waters; by driving out the enemies in the promised land; by judging and disciplining His people when they sinned and rebelled; by dispersing them among the nations and bringing them home again...against all odds; by taking on human form and living among His people and dying in their place for their sin; by rising from the dead and crushing sin and death once and for all; by ascending into heaven and sending His Spirit to reside in the hearts of all who put their faith and trust in Him; by leading, guiding and directing His children through the ages and sustaining and strengthening them in the face of persecution enabling them to be His witnesses throughout the entire world. By again bringing home His people Israel and re-establishing them in their own land that He gave them after 2000 years in exile and by slowly but surely removing the blindness from their eyes as more and more of them come to faith in their Messiah Yeshua.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;God can't be defined and understood by philosophical argument? Not a chance! There is no philosophy or argument grand enough to contain Him. &amp;nbsp;He is &lt;i&gt;&quot;I AM THAT I AM&quot;&lt;/i&gt; The Apostle John described the worship of God by the four living creatures in heaven like this...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Revelation 4:8, 'And the four living creatures, each one of them having six wings, are full of eyes around and within; and day and night they do not cease to say, &quot;HOLY, HOLY, HOLY, IS THE LORD GOD, THE ALMIGHTY, WHO WAS AND WHO IS AND WHO IS TO COME!&quot;'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is no greater explanation (limited as it is) than this because our God is undefinable - He was and He is and He is to come!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Does God know His own power, majesty and hugeness? Of course He does. &amp;nbsp;Does God know that our finite minds could never imagine let alone comprehend or understand His power, majesty and hugeness? Again, of course He does.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our finiteness is why God has chosen to reveal Himself through His actions and interactions with His creation so that in at least a limited fashion we can learn and know something about Him according to what He has revealed to us, without us reducing Him to a philosophy or rational scientific explanation to satisfy our own pseudo-intellectual view of ourselves, or into a human form of personage as the ancients did. Our God is a personal God, He interacts personally with His creation. God visited and covenanted with God, Moses was known as the friend of God, Jacob wrestled with God, Joshua bowed His face to the ground when confronted by God, the prophets were given direct messages from God, and then...wonder of wonders, our God left His glory and His limitless hugeness and became a baby to live among us. Yes, our God is personal...and yet He is so much more!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;So what can we know about God through His actions?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;His creation reveals that He is complex, creative, imaginative, harmonious, consistent, majestic, powerful, huge and detailed and He loves life and peace.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;His judgments reveal that He is pure, perfect, holy, righteous, and also that He is just and therefore must judge sin. His judgment of sin reveals just how much He hates sin and the violence and wickedness of man. His constant warnings throughout history, sometimes providing hundreds of years for men to repent, reveal His patience and long-suffering and the fact that He has no desire or joy in bringing judgment. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Because He loves life we know He hates murder and violence; because He loves families and marriage we know He hates divorce and family breakdown; because He loves children we know He hates abortion and abuse; because He loves purity we know He hates infidelity and faithlessness and pornography; because He loves respect and honour we know He hates rebellion and anarchy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We know that the love He bears for His human creation is matchless because He was willing to die for our sins, and by this we know that sin is destructive and deadly and He will not tolerate it and He knew that without His intervention all mankind would be lost.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;While all these description are what some would term as a partial definition of God, it's still entirely inadequate. Our God is undefinable and His undefinability is what actually proves that He truly is God. If we could define God and set Him squarely within the parameters of that definition, then we have set limits around Him and therefore, He's really not God at all! no...our God is undefinable!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Revelation 4:9-11, 'And when the living creatures give glory and honour and thanks to Him who sits on the throne, to Him who lives forever and ever, the twenty-four elders will fall down before Him who sits on the throne, and will worship Him who lives forever and ever, and will cast their crowns before the throne, saying, &quot;Worthy are You, our Lord and our God, to receive glory and honour and power; for You created all things, and because of Your will they existed, and were created.&quot;'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Amen and Shalom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

16926,Home Group - Hanukkah - The Feast Of Dedication,"&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanukkah - The Feast Of Dedication&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Each year, around the time we prepare to celebrate Christmas, our Jewish friends celebrate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hanukkah. This year it began yesterday at sundown, Dec 16 and will finish on Dec 24, Christmas eve.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It's interesting that this particular Jewish festival is mentioned in the New Covenant in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;John 10&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and it's called the Feast of Dedication. Funnily enough, we're about to celebrate Christmas which isn't mentioned in the New Covenant anywhere, of course it wouldn't be mentioned in the Gospels as they're the historical accounts of the life of Yeshua, but in all the epistles of the New Covenant there is no mention of celebrating the birth of our Messiah.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;John 10:22-23, 'At that time the Feast of Dedication took place at Jerusalem; it was winter and Jesus was walking in the Temple in the Portico of Solomon.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Strong's concordance explains the Feast of Dedication this way; &lt;i&gt;'In particular the annual feast celebrated eight days beginning on the 25th of Kislev (middle of our December), instituted by Judas Maccabaeus (164 BC) in memory of the cleansing of the temple from the pollution of Antiochus Epiphanes.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hanukkah isn't one of the mandatory 'Feasts of the Lord' of which there are seven;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. Feast of Passover - Pesach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. Feast of Unleavened Bread - Khag Hamotzi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. Feast of First Fruits - Yom Habikkurim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;4. Feast of Weeks - Shavuot (Pentecost)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;5. Feast of Trumpets - Yom Teru'ah&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;6. Day of Atonement - Yom Kippur&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;7. Feast of Tabernacles - Sukkot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The really fascinating thing about Hanukkah however is that this holiday points to a past historical event&amp;nbsp; in Jewish history and it's very, very important because it also enables us to look forward to a future historical event in Jewish future history just prior to the return of Messiah.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;John 10&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is the place where Yeshua described Himself as the Good Shepherd and then out of the blue so to speak, the Scripture then says that it was the Feast of Dedication and it was winter. We know that at this time of the year in Israel...that is right now...it's winter time and flocks and herds are cared for overnight in protected shelters as was the case 2000 years ago. This is just one of numerous reasons we know Yeshua wasn't really born at this time of year, rather He was probably born around late September, early October when it was still warm and shepherds kept their flocks out in the open fields at night and they themselves protected them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why did the Holy Spirit want us to know that it was the Feast of Dedication and that it was winter in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John 10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;? We need to understand that there are no accidents and no superfluous information in the Bible, but every word of it was breathed by God the Holy Spirit and is important for our learning and understanding. When something pops up in Scripture and we don't know what it means, that's when we're supposed to start digging to find out what it's referring to and what we need to learn from it, that's when we make incredible discoveries. So what was the Feast of Dedication all about?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;The Feast of Dedication&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In Israel's history there has only ever been two Temples. When the Jews were wandering in the wilderness and afterward conquered the land God promised them, they had a mobile Tabernacle and once they entered the land, the Tabernacle, also known as the 'Tent of Meeting' was established at Shiloh where it remained for approximately 300 years but David wanted to honour God by building a permanent and glorious Temple. Solomon his son was tasked with the job and Solomon built a staggeringly magnificent Temple which lasted about 400 years until it was destroyed by the Babylonians.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;After the Jews returned from their captivity in Babylon, they began rebuilding the temple under Nehemiah's leadership and the result was quite a humble building, so humble in fact that many wept and grieved because they remembered the glory of Solomon's temple. However, when King Herod the Great came to power under the Romans he embarked on a very extensive makeover which was basically a complete rebuild and the 2nd Temple took 46 years to complete and it was magnificent. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Neh, Jn 2:20)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Both the first and second temples were dedicated at different times; Solomon's Temple was dedicated in the month of Tishri which is in Autumn and Nehemiah's Temple was dedicated in the month of Adar which is in the Spring, but the Feast of Dedication was in the winter...so what particular temple dedication was it referring to?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the year 168 BC, the Seleucid Empire controlled the region and Antiochus IV, Epiphanes was on the throne. He came to the throne through murder and intrigue and he was a particularly nasty piece of work; he was cruel and barbaric and after some failed military campaigns his already simmering hatred of the Jews took a brutal turn and he determined to eradicated Judaism and replace it with Greek paganism instead. He passed laws that forbade the Jews from observing their laws and in particular, the laws pertaining to the Sabbath and circumcision, and disobedience resulted in death. Monthly searches were conducted and if anyone was discovered to be hiding a copy of the Torah, or had circumcised their baby boys or were seen to be observing the laws of the Sabbath they were executed and executed in unbelievably cruel ways.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Antiochus ransacked Jerusalem, took 10,000 inhabitants captive, stole all the treasures from the Temple, he built an altar in the Temple on the Great Altar of Burnt Sacrifices defiling it, then on the 25th of Kislev, which just happened to be Antiochus' birthday, he bought a sacrifice to the Temple - a pig - and sacrificed it on the altar and ordered a pig to be offered as a sacrifice in every village! To complete his blasphemy and offenses to the Jewish people, he also had an idol to Zeus placed in the Holy of Holies. This act of desecration was given a name, it was known as &lt;i&gt;'The abomination of desolation.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This sparked the Maccabean Revolt and after about 3 years of fighting, the Jewish fighters defeated the Syrian armies of Antiochus and when the fighting was over the Temple was cleaned out and purified and worship was re-established, then on 3rd anniversary of the defiling of the Temple - the 25th of Kislev in 164 BC - the Temple was rededicated. Re-establishing the function of the Temple required pure olive oil - produced under very strict guidelines - for the lighting of the Menorah candelabra which has seven branches; the centre branch is called the servant and it's from this branch that all the other branches were lit one by one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The miracle of the rededication of the Temple was that there was only enough oil to last one day and it would take at least a week to produce more oil however, that one day's portion of oil lasted for eight days straight until more oil was ready.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today, the Feast of Dedication is known as Hanukkah or the Festival of Lights, it's an eight day holiday and it's celebrated with a slightly modified Menorah, which has nine branches instead of seven because the oil lasted for eight days. On day one the servant branch is lit and that candle is then used to light the first branch. On day two, the servant branch is lit and is used to light the first and second branches and so on until the eighth day when the servant branch lights all the branches of the Menorah.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;An Important Technical Term&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is a great story but why is it important for us?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Jewish people had been celebrating the Feast of Dedication for more than 180 years when it was mentioned in John and they knew exactly what it was all about and what led up to the rededication; they knew who Antiochus was and the vile cruelty he'd meted out on their forebears and the blasphemy he'd committed in their Temple. So when Yeshua was asked by His disciples in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Matthew 24&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; what signs would take place before His return, amongst other things He said this to them:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Matthew 24:14-15, &quot;This Gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come. Therefore when you see the 'Abomination of Desolation' which was spoken of through Daniel the Prophet, standing in the Holy Place let the reader understand...&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Understand what? That an event that had taken place in their history that they knew about very, very well and that they remembered annually in a special festival holiday, would happen again at the end of all things just prior to His return. The 'Abomination of Desolation' was a description given for the placement of a blasphemous false god installed in the Holy Place in the Temple of God, and that pre-supposes that there will be another Temple built in Jerusalem and that another despotic dictator akin to Antiochus IV Epiphanes, will desecrate it in the same way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We also know that Yeshua wasn't saying that Herod's Temple would be the temple to be defiled because He prophesied that temple would be destroyed without one stone being left upon another, by invading armies that would lay siege to Jerusalem and that's exactly what happened in 70 AD by Titus Vespasian. So Yeshua was in fact pointing to another temple...the third Temple that has yet to be built. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Luke 21, Mar 13, Matt 24)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;When will this take place? We have no idea and today the Temple Mount is the most contentiously fought over piece of real estate on planet earth, but since we know God's Word has never and will never fail, we simply watch and wait while recognising that we are 2000 years closer to this coming to pass.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Temple Institute in Israel has already produced all the necessary furniture for the next Temple as well as all the vessels, clothing and instruments required for worship and most recently, they've begun production of the olive oil necessary for lighting the Menorah. Only God knows when these things will take place and our confidence is not in a temple or a building or in the production of olive oil, rather it's in God's Word that is the final authority not only on our lives but over history past, history present and history future. These things simply prove to us that God's Word is true.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shalom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

16826,Home Group - The Time Of Messiah's Coming,"&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Time Of Messiah's Coming&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Isaiah 7:14, 'Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, a virgin will be with child and bear a son, and she will call His name Immanuel.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;A very notable characteristic of the Jewish people is the fact that the Mashiach - Messiah - has always been central in their life and religion, over the centuries their understanding of Messiah has varied but it's always been there. We know this because from the fall of Eve and God's judgment on satan in the garden, God promised that the seed of the woman would one day destroy the seed of the serpent. That was the very first indication that God would send Messiah. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Gen 3:15)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This first prophecy about Messiah was vague and certainly gave no indication as to when He would bruise satan's head, and over time as more prophecy was given, the vague picture became clearer and more defined. Some prophecies were a little confusing because some talked about a Messiah who would be like a mighty warrior and deliverer to His people and other prophecies described Messiah as One who would suffer greater on behalf of His people. It's for this reason that the Jewish people who believe in their Messiah actually believe there will be two Messiah's...one who will suffer for his people and another who will deliver them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;How about this for a confusing prophecy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Isaiah 9:6-7, 'For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us; and the government will rest on His shoulders; and His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace. There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace, on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness from then on and forevermore. The Zeal of the Lord of Hosts will accomplish this.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This prophecy says that the child who would be born to &quot;us&quot;, that is born and given to Israel, would be all of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A human born child given for the people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He will rule a government from the political throne of David and over that kingdom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His name will be Wonderful Counselor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His name will be Mighty God&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His name will be Eternal Father&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His name will be Prince of Peace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His government will last forever&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The peace His government institutes will last forever&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His government will be characterised by justice and righteousness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Zeal of God Himself will ensure all this comes to pass&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;These 2 verses clearly reveal the Trinity - the triune Godhead. We see Yeshua as the child/human being born as God the Son ruling an earthly kingdom that was originally ruled by king David; we see the attributes of God the Holy Spirit in Him as Wonderful Counselor; we see God the Father named equally with the Son as Mighty God and Eternal Father and the fact that it's the zeal of God that will ensure this prophecy will be fulfilled in its entirety means God approves of and is orchestrating it all. God is ZEALOUS about this particular prophecy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Here's another prophecy that we rarely think of in relation to Yeshua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Haggai 2:6-9, 'For thus says the Lord of Hosts, &quot;Once more in a little while, I am going to shake the heavens and the earth, the sea also and the dry land. I will shake all the nations; and they will come with the desire of all nations, and I will fill this house with glory,&quot; says the Lord of Hosts. &quot;The silver is Mine and the gold is Mine,&quot; declares the Lord of Hosts. &quot;The latter glory of this house will be greater than the former&quot;, says the Lord of Hosts, &quot;and in this place I will give peace,&quot; declares the Lord of Hosts.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This passage some very interesting points as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The nations of the world will come to the 'desire of all nations' (this is an idiom for Messiah)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God would fill the 2nd temple with glory - which He did when Yeshua entered it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The glory of the 2nd temple would be greater than the first - some would argue that Herod's temple wasn't as glorious as Solomon's and some would argue that it was but what really made the glory of the 2nd temple was the entry of the Messiah - He is the glory of God Himself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Here's another obscure Messianic prophecy that doesn't usually get listed among the more well-known prophecies. Jacob was old and knew he was about to die and he called his 12 sons to his bedside and he told them what would befall them and he prophesied over each one. To some of his sons he said things that were not so encouraging but some things he said were really good. This is part of what Jacob said to his son Judah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Genesis 49:10, &quot;The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, until Shiloh comes, and to him shall be the obedience of the peoples.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;A scepter was understood to mean a tribal identity, authority, like a staff or a rod of authority. To the Jews, this meant that they believed they had the right from the law of Moses to enforce the law and when necessary to call a judgment of authority over matters where the law had been broken, the pinnacle of that authority was seen in cases of capital punishment and this was the foundation of their system of government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The 'scepter' was the promised authority that was given by God to the Jewish people that was instituted when the Law was given to them by Moses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Also, with regard to who 'Shiloh' was, there is a very long standing connection in ancient Jewish writings and teachings that 'Shiloh' is referring to Messiah - it's an undisputed understanding and therefore, this prophecy by Jacob to Judah was basically stating that the Jewish right to govern and even adjudicate the Law would not cease until the arrival of Messiah and the assumption is that Messiah would come through the line of Judah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Mark Eastman re-words the prophecy of Jacob to make it a little easier to understand and he wrote it like this;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;The [national identity of Judah, which includes the right to enforce Mosaic law, including the right to administer capital punishment upon the people, as called for in the Torah] shall not depart from [the Southern Kingdom of] Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh [the Messiah] comes; and to Him shall be the obedience of the people.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;A very interesting thing happened in 6-7 AD in Judea; the Jews were of course under the domination of the Roman Empire and Rome was the occupying force in their land. King Herod's son and successor, Herod Archelaus, was dethroned and exiled to Vienna, a city in Gaul and Rome didn't replace him with another Jewish or pseudo-Jewish puppet king such as the various Herod's were, instead they appointed a Roman procurator named Caponius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Why is this a big deal? Well, when Caponius took the seat of power of Judea, the authority over capital cases was given over to him by Caesar and Josephus recorded this taking place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;And now Archelaus' part of Judea was reduced to a province, and Caponius, one of the Equestrian order of the Romans, was sent as a procurator, having the power of life and death put into his hands by Caesar.&quot; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;(War of the Jews, Bk 2, ch 8)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Ancient Jewish rabbis have long believed that since God made the world in six days and then rested on the seventh day, that the world would last for seven thousand years, and Rabbi Elias who lived 200 years prior to Yeshua said, &lt;i&gt;&quot;The world endures 6000 years: two thousand before the Law, two thousand with the Law and two thousand with the Messiah.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Because there was an expectation that the Messiah was supposed to arrive around the four thousand year mark of history explains a little more why there was an increased expectation around the time of the first century because it was in fact the four thousand year mark in the history of the world from creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;So when Caponius took power and the right over capital offenses was taken from the Jewish people the reaction of the Sanhedrin was one of utter devastation. The Talmud records their reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;They put on sackcloth and ashes, a sign of repentance and intense grief and moaned through the streets of Jerusalem saying, &lt;i&gt;&quot;Woe unto us for the scepter has departed from Judah and the Messiah has not come!&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The unthinkable, impossible, unimaginable had happened...the Torah...the Word of God...had been broken!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;They were half right because the scepter had indeed departed from Judah; they had lost the right to adjudicate their Law including capital crime offenses, but they were also half wrong. Yeshua was born in approximately 4 BC and Caponius took the seat of procurator in 6-7 AD which means that when the scepter departed from Judah, Yeshua was around 10 years of age and He was living with His earthly family in Nazareth and Joseph, His step-father would have already been teaching Him carpentry skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;So yes, the scepter had departed from Judah, but Shiloh had most definitely come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There's a lesson in this for everyone and it's this: no matter what you &lt;i&gt;don't&lt;/i&gt; see happening around you, you can trust that God will always honour His Word and see that it is fulfilled right down to the tiniest detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Sanhedrin in Jerusalem at the time Caponius appointment couldn't 'see' Messiah, they couldn't 'see' that God had indeed kept His promise to send Shiloh before the scepter departed Judah...but He did!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God is obligated only to Himself to fulfill His Word and we as His children are obligated to trust Him to fulfill it in His way and in His time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In His revealing His calling and message to Jeremiah the prophet, God said this...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jeremiah 1:12, 'Then the Lord said to me, &quot;You have seen well, for I am watching over My Word to perform it.&quot;'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When God says something, He not only guards it, but He promises to perform it and that means every word of Scripture is trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;As a point of interest only, if the ancient rabbis are correct (and I'm not saying they are) that human history is supposed to last seven thousand years for God's plan of redemption for, and that the first two thousand years were without the Law, the next two thousand years were with the Law and the next two thousand years were with Messiah...then we're almost at the end of the six thousandth year and the seven thousandth year - the Millennium year of rest and peace - is almost upon us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It's just speculation, but it's a nice thing to speculate!&lt;/p&gt;

The Lord tests the righteous and the wicked, and the one who loves violence His soul hates.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Proverbs 3:31-32, 'Do not envy a man of violence and do not choose any of his ways. For the devious are an abomination to the Lord; but He is intimate with the upright.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Proverbs 6:16-19, 'There are six thing which the Lord hates, yes, seven which are an abomination to Him: haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that run rapidly to evil, a false witness who utters lies, and one who spreads strife among brothers.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Psalm 94:20-21, 'Can a throne of destruction be allied with you, one which devises mischief by decree? They band themselves together against the life of the righteous and condemn the innocent to death.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Isaiah 59:7-8, 'Their feet run to evil, and they hasten to shed innocent blood; their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity, devastation and destruction are in their highways. They do not know the way of peace, and there is no justice in their tracks; they have made their paths crooked, whoever treads on them does not know peace.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Joel 3:19, 'Egypt will become a waste, and Edom will become a desolate wilderness, because of the violence done to the sons of Judah, in whose land they have shed innocent blood.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acknowledgement: The following article is taken from the website of Lois Tverberg called 'Our Rabbi Jesus' and is primarily the work of Stuart Dauermann.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Most of us have been stunned and horrified by the brutality of Islamic State, the Muslim extremist group. The grisly and revolting beheading of the news reporter, James Foley and so many others is too horrifying for words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Stuart Dauermann wrote an article titled '&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.interfaithfulness.org/2014/08/29/isis-something-wicked-this-way-comes/&quot; title=&quot;ISIS: Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot;&gt;ISIS: Something Wicked This Way Comes.&lt;/a&gt;' In it he points out that this nightmarish wave of violence is very reminiscent of the appalling history of the Assyrians who once lived in the exact same region where Islamic State is committing it's atrocities today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Dauermann says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Terrorism is not an Islamic invention. In the region, it is&amp;nbsp;thousands of years old. By terrorism I mean the use of gruesome violence upon one’s enemies as a means of terrifying and subjugating those who survive. It is horrifying in the extreme, and it is meant to be so.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Assyrians were reviled for their cruelty by surrounding nations and there are numerous accounts of Assyrian torture&amp;nbsp;found in the archaeological records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Still today you can see the monumental carvings from King Sennacherib’s palace in Nineveh that depict captives being flayed alive or impaled alive on spikes so when God sent the prophet Jonah to tell Nineveh to repent of its wickedness, it's really not all that surprising that the prophet ran the other way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Ancient Assyria was truly breathtaking but the people were savage and brutal but the Assyrians were not the only people who were notoriously brutal, believe it or not, you also find horrific scenes decorating the palaces and tombs of Egypt; scenes of piles of human heads, penises and tongues were laid before Pharaoh to celebrate the subjugation of his enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It’s tempting to think that gory depictions in archaeological discoveries were just legendary fictions but in recent years, researchers have been concluding that violence was far from uncommon in the ancient world. When human remains have been examined, they find a shockingly high rate of evidence of death by homicide and in some tribal societies the chance of dying a violent death was 1 in 6. (1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This finding has been a great shock to the humanities, which has for a very long time believed in the idea of the “noble savage”, the idea that humans once lived at harmony with each other and nature right up until they were corrupted by European conquerors and modern institutions. Rather, the Bible gives us a far more accurate presentation of humanity in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genesis 6:11-12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; which says;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Genesis 6:11-12, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now the earth was corrupt in the sight of God and the earth was filled with violence. And God looked on the earth, and behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth.'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Keeping ancient violence in mind helps us see the context of the early history of Israel, which is full of war and violence and certainly some societies were more peaceful than others but when we see atrocities like we’ve seen on the news over recent months, we start to realize why God could have grieved the fact that He even created humankind in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;A Radical Idea in the Torah&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;As a whole, life was incredibly cheap in ancient times and Near Eastern law codes reflected this fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Imagine this scenario: A man is leading his ox across a river when he is attacked and murdered by another man, who steals his ox. What’s the penalty? Among the Hittites, the murderer would be expected to join the victims clan and do the work the victim was doing. The actual loss of life meant nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Similarly, in the ancient world, murder was considered a debt between two clans that could be paid off with a sum of money or, in some law codes, the murderer could give one of the people they “owned” like a wife, a son, or a slave in exchange, if not a person then perhaps a few camels, sheep or cows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;According to the renowned scholar Moshe Greenberg, this is where the laws of Israel fundamentally diverge from those of other nations because in Israel, murder was seen as&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;an offense against God Himself.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;Humans beings were created in the image of God, we bear immense value to Him and we are the pinnacle of His creation. No amount of money could be exchanged for a life, because nothing could compensate for murder except the life of the murderer himself. Many of Israel’s laws were based on the peculiar and supreme value that God placed on human life. (2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Notice, though, that capital punishment is not murder in Biblical thinking. Murder is wanton, malicious violence, the other (capital punishment) is a penalty demanded by God for a heinous crime and while humanity is precious to God, life is not so supreme that even justice cannot demand it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The idea that human life is uniquely precious to God was radical and unparalleled and while to us it is second nature, this was a shocking idea in the ancient world. Notably, the place that God first makes this declaration is immediately after the judgment of Noah’s exceedingly violent generation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Genesis 9:5-6, 'Surely I will require your lifeblood; from every beast I will require it. And from every man, from every man's brother I will require the life of man. Whoever sheds man's blood, by man his blood shall be shed, for in the image of God He made man.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;They Do not Know the Name of Humanity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;I was reminded of all these things just a couple days ago, when the king of Saudi Arabia warned that Islamic State would soon threaten America and Europe if this dangerous movement was not stopped. (3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Look at the wording of the king’s statement: &lt;i&gt;&quot;These terrorists do not know the name of humanity and you have witnessed them severing heads and giving them to children to walk with in the street.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The terrorists &lt;i&gt;“&lt;/i&gt;&lt;em&gt;do not know the name of humanity&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;The king used the word &lt;i&gt;“name”&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp; metaphorically (in the same way Hebrew often does) to mean &lt;i&gt;“renown, honor, dignity”&lt;/i&gt; and he was declaring that the terrorists &lt;em&gt;have no regard for the preciousness of life; t&lt;/em&gt;hey’re filled with the violence that grieves God to His very core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Jews, Christians and moderate Muslims all know this fundamental principle that is the very heart of the Torah. God was speaking truth into a very harsh world, and the Torah’s laws were addressing the situation of the time and it still speaks to us today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Our Tender Hearts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The sanctity of human life is such a part of the bedrock of our thinking that we can hardly imagine a world without it, our society and our laws have been utterly transformed by it. In America, (and in Australia) we live in a peaceful society that puts tremendous value on our lives and as a result, many of us have become so tenderhearted that we recoil at any mention of violence in the Scriptures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Ironically, some even suspect that the God of the Torah evolved out of primitive, pagan beliefs in warlike gods, and that over time our concept of God “matured” into the loving God of the New Testament. (4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;But look at the news footage of Islamic State and imagine the brutal reality of the ancient world. Could the anger of the God that we see in the Scriptures actually be out love for His precious children who bear his image?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ourrabbijesus.com/articles/isis-ancient-violence-and-the-torahs-radical-response/&quot;&gt;http://ourrabbijesus.com/articles/isis-ancient-violence-and-the-torahs-radical-response/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Additional commentary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It is my (Mandy) belief that people see the God of the Bible as a bloodthirsty, brutal tyrant simply because they have no understanding of the realities of life in ancient civilisations and cultures as well as the fact that those of us who live in the West pride ourselves on being tolerant, peaceful, civilised and refined, rejecting violence and brutality as something only unintelligent prehistoric man wallowed in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Since the year 1900, there has been 263 wars in earth, the highest estimate of battle deaths may be over 116 million people...&lt;b&gt;that's 116 MILLION PEOPLE dead from war in the last 114 years alone! &lt;/b&gt;(a)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Australia has been involved in 7 of those wars, China has been involved in 34 wars, France 27 wars, India 14 wars, UK 30 wars, USA 24 wars, Soviet Union/Russia 20 wars just to name a few. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Why is it that '&lt;i&gt;peace protesters' &lt;/i&gt;very often use violence to make their point? We in the civilised West are nothing like Islamic State, of that we are agreed, but violence is an inherent tendency in all human beings and it's the Judeo/Christian values and foundations that have governed us that have kept us civil, but the more those Judeo-Christian values erode, our civil society erodes with it and life becomes more and more disposable and expendable and I make my point by mentioning abortion, euthanasia and even the recent case of a mother throwing her newborn baby away into a drain by way of example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Germany was a leading light in Europe of Western 'Christian' civilisation, they led the modern world in &amp;nbsp;industry, arts and culture, technology, medicine, architecture and the sciences; Germany was a product of the enlightenment and when the Nazi's came to power most Germans (but certainly not all) didn't &amp;nbsp;batter an eyelid when he set his plan in motion to exterminate the Jewish people from Europe with the ultimate goal of wiping them from the four corners of the planet, or when the Nazi's began to systematically kill the mentally disabled, the physically disabled, the aged and infirmed. Some surely did protest and were sent to work camps and most of those lost their lives, but most Germans remained silent and many became complicit in such atrocities, and Germany was considered a leader in the Western civilised world!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It's also my opinion that because we in the West dismiss the very notion and concept of sin, we don't believe we have any kind of accountability before God for our actions, we would rather hold tenaciously to the theories of pop-psychology that for the most part finds a way to pass the blame onto someone else for our behaviours and actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God didn't institute severe penalties for murder and the reckless killing of human beings because He Himself is a bloodthirsty tyrant who craves the blood of His devotees like the myriad of pagan deities that demand blood sacrifices. Remember, God instituted a sacrificial system to teach His people that sin is grievous and must be atoned for in order to be clean and made righteous before Him, but He demonstrated His overwhelming love for His human creation by putting Himself in the place of sacrifice, paying the penalty and making atonement for us...shedding His own blood rather than ours!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God instituted severe penalties for murder and reckless killing in order to teach His people just how sacred life really is and that we are not to be casual or flippant when it comes to protecting human beings, especially the unborn, the weak, the orphan, the widow, the poor and the oppressed. All life is sacred because God created it, and human life is especially sacred because humanity has been created in His image and likeness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Any ideology that celebrates or sanctions slaughter, bloodshed, violence, intimidation, hatred, malice and barbarity and which generally elevates death and destruction of life and decimates peace, is not representative of God at all, rather it's representative of and aligned to satan who comes only to steal, kill and destroy. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Jn 10:10)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Deuteronomy 30:19-20, &quot;I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse. So choose life in order that you may live, you and your descendants, by loving the Lord your God, by obeying His voice, and by holding fast to Him; for this is your life and the length of your days, that you may live in the land which the Lord swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, to give them.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

He writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The idea that humans are peaceable by nature and corrupted by modern institutions pops up frequently in the writing of public intellectuals… But, now that social scientists have started to count bodies in different historical periods, they have discovered that the romantic theory gets it backward: Far from causing us to become more violent, something in modernity and its cultural institutions has made us nobler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;I would argue that the thing that has made us nobler was the Gospel going out into the world, and with it a realization of the preciousness of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;(4) This is what is called the “history of religions” theory, which assumes that the God we find in the Bible emerged out of the human imagination, gradually evolving from Israel’s angry primitive tribal deity into the peaceful, loving God of the New Testament. (Or, perhaps the Holy Spirit was inspiring a gradual “reimagining” of God over time.) This is Rob Bell’s message in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/dp/0310290740/?tag=engedrescen-20&quot; title=&quot;The Gods Aren't Angry&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The God’s Aren’t Angry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and his latest book,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://robbellcom.tumblr.com/post/66107373947/what-is-the-bible&quot; title=&quot;Rob Bell What is the Bible&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is the Bible&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Jewish scholars protest against the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcionism&quot; title=&quot;Marcionism&quot;&gt;Marcionism&lt;/a&gt; inherent in this approach. But more importantly, they point out that this thinking fails to consider the depravity of human evil. It does not grasp how God’s passionate love for mankind is expressed in his grief at human violence and his outrage at oppression and suffering. See Abraham Heschel’s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/dp/0060936991/?tag=engedrescen-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Abraham Heschel  Prophets&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Prophets&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, pages 354-390.

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;1 Corinthians 1:20-29, ‘Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not come to know God, God was well-pleased through the foolishness of the message preached to save those who believe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;For indeed Jews ask for signs and Greeks search for wisdom; but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block and to Gentiles foolishness, but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men. For consider your calling, brethren, that there were not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble; but God has chosen the foolish things of the world to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to shame the things which are strong, and the base things of the world and the despised God has chosen, the things that are not, so that He may nullify the thing that are, so that no man may boast before God.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;Last week we began looking at how we as westerners can miss important messages in Scripture or even dismiss the Bible altogether because we strain it through the sieve of western thought and while we think we're ahead of the rest of the world, we are in fact the 'weirdo's of the global neighbourhood' because we are in the minority when it comes to our views.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;Most of the rest of the world has far greater capacity to understand the message in Scripture because they're NOT western and the message presented isn't confusing or backward simply because the rest of the world already has a similar mindset.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Industrialized:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;ur lives have been so utterly transformed by our modern world that it doesn’t even remotely connect to generations past. We don’t sustain ourselves on the land by working alongside family through successive seasons of planting and harvest and therefore, Yeshua’s frequent parables about fisherman and farmers don’t evoke a visceral, or emotional response that comes about from a personal understanding of the context, as they would in the rest of the world that is heavily agricultural even to this day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Rather, our experience in the West is instant entertainment, instant water, instant food, auto-washing machines, auto-mobiles, instant phone connection, internet, we don’t have to wait for anything. We can even fly around the world in 24hrs, travel through space and walk on the moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We can plot, scheme, contrive and manipulate others and circumstances, world governments say one thing and do another while jostling for power and control and therefore, we don’t feel we need God and that God is nothing more than an invention of needy people who don’t have the intellect or technology to be the source of their every need. They don’t see God as being the very power behind the food that grows that we need to survive, rather they see themselves the source of their existence and a secure future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Remember what happened at Babel in the land of Shinar…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Genesis 11:1-9, ‘NOW the whole earth used the same language and the same words. It came about as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there. They said to one another, “Come, let us make bricks and burn them thoroughly.” And they used brick for stone and they used tar for mortar. They said, “Come, let us build for ourselves a city, and a tower whose top will reach into heaven, and let us make for ourselves a name, otherwise we will be scattered abroad over the face of the whole earth.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;The Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the sons of men had built. The Lord said, “Behold, they are one people, and they all have the same language. And this is what they began to do, and now nothing which they purpose to do will be impossible for them. Come, let us go down and there confuse their language, so that they will not understand one another’s speech.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;So the Lord scattered them abroad from there over the face of the whole earth; and they stopped building the city. Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the Lord confused the language of the whole earth; and from there the Lord scattered them abroad over the face of the whole earth.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Just because men plot and scheme so that they can elevate themselves above God and their need of Him, doesn’t mean they will succeed. Mankind needs to understand that to stand opposite God and ‘oppose’ Him puts them in a very serious place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Psalm 2:1-12, ‘Why are the nations in an uproar and the peoples devising a vain thing? The kings of the earth take their stand and the rulers take counsel together against the Lord and against His Anointed, saying, “Let us tear their fetters apart and cast away their cords from us!” He who sits in the heavens laughs, the Lord scoffs at them. Then He will speak to them in His anger and terrify them in His fury saying, “But as for Me, I have installed My King upon Zion, My holy mountain.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;I will surely tell of the decree of the Lord: He said to Me, “You are My Son, today I have begotten You. Ask of Me and I will surely give the nations as Your inheritance, and the very ends of the earth as Your possession. You shall break them with a rod of iron, You shall shatter them like earthenware.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Now therefore, O kings, show discernment; take warning O judges of the earth. Worship the Lord with reverence and rejoice with trembling. Do homage to the Son, that He not become angry and you perish in the way, for His wrath may soon be kindled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;How blessed are all who take refuge in Him!’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Rich:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I know that there are those among us who are less fortunate than the majority of people living in the West, but when compared to the rest of the world, we are rich. This is why so many people try to live in the West both by legal and illegal means. The overwhelming majority of Westerners have easy access to food, housing and medical care and even in our most desperate circumstances, we can rely on social services for assistance. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The daily concerns of people throughout history are simply non-issues for most of us living in the West.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We have good or reasonably good cars, good homes, nice clothes, DVD’s, computers, iPads, smart phones, trendy shoes, hairstyles, jewellery, nice perfumes, deodorant etc&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;50% or approximately 3 billion people live on LESS than $2.50 per day. 80% of people live on LESS than $10 per day. The highest standards of living are all nations deemed to be ‘western’…not necessarily ‘rich’ because there are some obscenely rich oil nations in the world who’s populations still live in primitive and deplorable conditions because of corruption and the rule of despotic regimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Bible however doesn’t equate wealth with blessing or prosperity or God’s favour and approval. Having wealth and possessions isn’t a sin but without doubt, they can become both a distraction and the object of idolatry if not kept in check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Bible warns about the love of money &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(1 Tim 3:3, 6:10; Heb 13:5)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;; it warns rich men about impending judgment because of their love for riches and greed that leads to oppressing others &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Jam 5:1; Mk 10:17-27; Lk 12:15; Pro 23:4)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Again, acquiring wealth is sinful in and of itself, but wealth can be incredibly seductive if uncontrolled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Church of Laodicea in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Revelation 3:14-22&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was very rich, so rich in fact they had no need for anything, of that church Yeshua was outside it not part of it and He had nothing good or encouraging to say about it. Yeshua went so far as to say that while they thought themselves rich and without any needs, He declared them to be wretched, miserable, poor, blind and naked!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;However in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Matthew 5&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Yeshua taught the people that real blessing came from being poor in spirit, mourning, gentle, hungering and thirsting for righteousness, merciful, pure in heart, peace making, persecuted, reviled and falsely accused and hated by the world because of love for Him! What a contrast to a western mindset!!! What we think equals blessing doesn’t and what we don’t think equals blessing actually is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Democratic:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Our system of government is primarily at the whim of the people…we vote and determine who our leaders will be, we have the power and our leaders are there to do our bidding…and if they don’t, we give them the boot. We demand our rights, we have high expectations, we revel in our freedoms to do and say virtually as we please, but this system of government is contrary to the Bible. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Western societies in large part are motivated by selfish greed….the ‘What’s in it for me’ attitude rules our voting choices and this is why politicians spend their campaigns making promises to woo the voting public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In our minds, ‘I – Me’ am at the centre of the world. What matters above all else is my rights, my needs, my wants, dreams and my aspirations…if it feels good, do it, I deserve it, the world owes me, why shouldn’t I have it, why should rich people have more than me…we are a ‘gimme’ generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Most Westerners find the idea that Yeshua is a King who will one day return to earth to rule the nations with a rod of iron! Rod of iron? That sounds positively despotic! Where’s the freedom in that!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Here’s the crux of the whole point…we are to conform to His Word not the other way around and in order to conform to His Word we have to know not just what it says but what it means and to know what it means it’s important that we learn what the context and setting was at the time God the Holy Spirit breathed it and revealed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Then we conform our cynical, selfish, Western heart and motivations to it so that we become transformed into His image rather than Him conforming to the image we want Him to be according to our preferences. This isn’t&amp;nbsp; easy to do but thankfully, He is patient, gracious and is committed to our spiritual growth and maturity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;His Word is the means by which we are transformed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;Hebrews 4:12, ‘For the Word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;His commitment to making us more and more like Him is equally comforting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Philippians 1:6, ‘For I am confident of this very thing, that He who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shalom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;1 Corinthians 1:20-29, ‘Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not come to know God, God was well-pleased through the foolishness of the message preached to save those who believe.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;For indeed Jews ask for signs and Greeks search for wisdom; but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block and to Gentiles foolishness, but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men. For consider your calling, brethren, that there were not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble; but God has chosen the foolish things of the world to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to shame the things which are strong, and the base things of the world and the despised God has chosen, the things that are not, so that He may nullify the thing that are, so that no man may boast before God.’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There are many things in the Bible that baffle and mystify we who live in the West and this is primarily a result of cultural differences and an ignorance of the culture from which the Bible was penned; from simple details to important differences in worldview. It’s not surprising then that after thousands of years of time, cultural and civilisation changes that have separated us from that time in history, that we really don’t understand such a lot of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Recently, a paper was published in the psychology world that may reveal why the Bible is so puzzling to so many in the West.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;After comparing diverse cultural attitudes from all around the world, researchers have come to the conclusion that the modern western worldview is not normal at all, in fact it’s unique in its difference when compared to those others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Westerners think very analytically. Our culture is also very secular and places a strong emphasis on individual rights and freedoms. Much of the world is far less secular and sees people principally as members of groups as in families, tribes, clans and nations and with this comes very strong claims to loyalty. Our society is very much akin to the Greek mindset which is quite individualistic, philosophical and analytical, whereas the rest of the world is more social, communal and practical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Is it possible that our culture, that is Western culture, that has this “uniqueness” is also a barrier to relating to the Biblical worldview? Listen to this statement from Eugene Nida, a Bible translation expert who has worked in cultures all around the globe:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;“If one were to make a comparison of the culture traits of the Bible with those of all the existing cultures of today…one would find that in certain respects the Bible is surprisingly closer to many of them than to the technological culture of the western world. It is this “western” culture that is the aberrant one in the world. And it is precisely in the western world, and in the growing number of persons in other parts of the world, that the Scriptures have seemingly the least ready acceptance.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Eugene Nida appears to agree with the social scientists in that it’s not that the Bible is culturally “odd,” but rather &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;in the West are culturally odd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Psychologists have coined the acronym “WEIRD” for the aspects of our culture (particularly in the university world) that separate it most from the rest of humanity, particularly in voting countries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;W&lt;/strong&gt;estern&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;ducated&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;ndustrialized&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;ich&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;emocratic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It’s particularly interesting then, that these cultural traits of the West often set us apart from the Biblical world and to demonstrate what I mean let me contrast the West’s WEIRD worldview against the Biblical worldview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Western and Educated: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We’ve learned to formulate ideas according to the influence of ancient Greek culture rather than the Hebraic Biblical view of Yeshua’s world and heritage in that we tend to think abstractly with the goal of finding proof-based, logical arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We who consider ourselves as the ‘children of the Enlightenment’, the ‘educated Westerners’ have developed the power of human reason as victory over the physical world, and are convinced that human reason and rationality is the measure of all things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Science is the final proof of truth, in our Western, analytical thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Evolutionary process is hailed as the answer for man’s existence, worship of a deity considered the height of stupidity while worship is the central core attitude and behaviour of the evolutionist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The denial of absolute truth is expounded vehemently while rational understanding that belief in this absolute is antithetical to their held view of no absolute truths. Circular reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Decry judgmental attitudes of those who believe in a God who will one day judge, yet they sit in vehement judgment of those who hold this view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;They scream of hypocrisy at those who denounce or disagree with lifestyle choices while condemning any and every fault or failing of those who believe in God while excusing the same behaviours in their own lives as acceptable because there are no absolute truths or standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Paul said in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Romans 1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, that those who deny God consider themselves to be wise when in fact they’re fools…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Romans 1:22, “Professing to be wise, they became fools.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We’ll continue to look at some more W.E.I.R.D. views next week.&lt;/p&gt;

15802,Home Group - Letting Our Tassels Show,"&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Letting Our Tassels Show&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Most of the Old Covenant laws seem arbitrary, unreasonable and even somewhat senseless or pointless to us; one command in particular appears to be a bit odd and it’s the commandment to wear tassels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Numbers 15:37-39, ‘The Lord spoke to Moses saying, “Speak to the sons of Israel, and tell them that they shall make for themselves tassels on the corners of their garments throughout their generations, and that they shall put on the tassel of each corner a cord of blue. It shall be a tassel for you to look at and remember all the commandments of the Lord, so as to do them and not follow after your own heart and your own eyes, after which you played the harlot.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Today, many orthodox and observant Jewish men obey this commandment of wearing tassels (&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;tzitzit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, ZEET-zeet) attached to a garment under their shirts, the tassels remain on the outside visibly hanging down over the trousers. An important thing to note about Jewish understanding of their own Scriptures is that they hold very much to a literal understanding rather than a symbolic or allegorical understanding, as many Christians do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Unless Scripture indicates what is being said is &lt;i&gt;‘like’&lt;/i&gt; something or &lt;i&gt;‘symbolic’&lt;/i&gt; of something, it will be interpreted in a literal context.&amp;nbsp; Examples of &lt;i&gt;‘like’&lt;/i&gt; would be God using the stars and sand to describe how numerous Abraham’s future offspring were going to become, and an example of something ‘&lt;i&gt;symbolic’&lt;/i&gt; would be Joseph’s dream of the sun, moon and stars bowing down before him which were symbolic of his parents and brothers bowing before him at some future time to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;So with regard to tassels, this strange commandment to always wear tassels on the outside of their clothes is taken very seriously by religious Jews; the command is explicit for all generations of Jews, not just that generation to whom the command was given. They take it so seriously in fact, that the text of the command is repeated as part of their daily prayers. Scripture doesn’t place this command on women, but there’s a possibility that they may have attached tassels to their garments in ancient times as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There are other religious Jews today who don’t wear tassels all the time, but for prayer, Bible reading and study, worship and religious ceremony and some special events such as weddings and the like, will wear a prayer shawl (&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;tallit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) to which&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;tzitzit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;(tassels) &lt;/span&gt;are attached at the four corners. Those that wear them all the time must ensure they hang visibly and not tucked in, because the Scripture says that you have them look at them, they’re to be obvious to everyone around. The tassels serve a real purpose and it’s not decoration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The practice may appear to Christians to be a strange form of legalism and subservience under the oppressive and now, obsolete Law, but it doesn’t take much to understand just how important and practical the tassels were and are for the Jews and perhaps there’s something we can learn too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Significance In The Tzitzit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;To our western mind, tzitzit or tassel wearing is ridiculous and in our culture it would be really embarrassing as well. But in the culture of the ancient Hebrews, (and other ancient cultures as well) garments were very much an indication of a person’s identity, social status and standing, as well as their authority and position within society. For example, the hem of the garment was symbolic of its owners identity and authority, the corner of the hem could be used for legal transactions when it was pressed into a clay seal to leave an impression, kind of like a signature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Authority&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;One of the reasons David was so remorseful after he cut a portion of Saul’s robe was because it was in effect an undermining of Saul’s authority as king of Israel a little like pushing him off his throne or knocking the crown off his head and Saul’s kingship came about because God had personally selected him. In spite of the fact that David has also been anointed to be Israel’s next king, he couldn’t usurp Saul’s authority while he was still officially the king; to do so was to violate God’s order and undermine the man God placed in authority to rule the nation. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(1 Sam 24:4)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Another example took place before David was anointed; it was when Saul disobeyed God’s instructions regarding the Amalekites and the offering of sacrifices. Samuel informed him that because he rejected God’s instructions God was going to reject him from being Israel’s king, when Samuel turned to leave, Saul grabbed the edge of his robe and it tore, this was an instant prophetic symbol that Samuel announced saying that God would tear Saul’s authority as king away from him and give it to another. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(1 Sam 15:1-28)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Royalty &amp;amp; Nobility&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Not only did the hem represent authority but in ancient cultures hems were decorated for kings and princes, such garments were fitting for those of royal and noble blood. So when God’s people wore tassels on their garments they were in a manner, wearing royal robes signifying them as people chosen by God, with a holy purpose, separate and distinct from other peoples – not better than other peoples but appointed for authority, purpose and position by God for a specific reason. Their tassels were a statement to those around them who understood perfectly the regal design of their garments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;So &lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;tzitzit were attached to the hem or fringe or edge or wings of a person’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;garment&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; and they were to be a visual reminder of one of the most important promises that God made on Mt. Sinai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Exodus 19:6-7, “Now then, if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant, then you shall be My own possession among all the peoples, for all the earth is Mine; and you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Priestly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The tassel’s themselves had to have a blue thread woven through them; blue was the colour of the High Priests robes, they used a very expensive dye which only came from a rare sea snail and it was as if every Israelite wore a piece of the High Priest’s blue robe at all times to remind them that just as the priests were set apart for a specific role in service to God in Temple services and sacrifices, they too were set apart for service to God before the nations. Today, the blue dye is prohibitively expensive and therefore, is no longer used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The tassels during the Bible age were made of linen except for the blue strand which was wool, which is strange because of the prohibition of mixing wool and linen in clothing on a normal basis; the reason this command was ignored in the case of the tassels however, was to remind the general population of their national priestly status of being ‘priests’ before God in the sight of the nations. The tassels were woven and knotted in a specific pattern to remind the wearer of God’s commandments; and while this particular practice began after first century, all the preceding centuries from the time God commanded the wearing of tassels was clearly understood, and in Yeshua’s time tassels were still worn to remind a person to be continually obedient to God. Wearing&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;tzitzit &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;reminded every Jew of his unique relationship with God and his obligation to serve Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;One of the most wonderful things about the tzitzit, is that all Israel was to wear them; they were not only for a select group of special, elite individuals, they were for national leaders, the royal family,&amp;nbsp; rabbis, scholars, lawyers, teachers, physician, politicians, as well as farmers, shepherds, musicians, masons, financiers, shop owners, tradesmen and peasants. The tzitzit was like a distinctive ‘uniform’ of sorts for the national people of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Why A Uniform?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Tzitzit served several purposes; they unified Israel as a distinct national people with both a royal and priestly calling, tassels served to remind them daily in everything they did that God’s commands were to be kept; they demonstrated to other nations they interacted with that nationally that they were a people completely and utterly committed to their God throughout every level of Israel’s social strata from the throne to the farmer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;They were a chosen people, a noble nation of priests chosen to be a light to the nations, whose calling was to display His righteousness, holiness and goodness before the world, to be a witness for Him. Remember, that God’s plan from before the very foundations of the world was to redeem all mankind and He chose the Jewish people to be the human means to do it. Historically, Israel failed repeatedly, but through them we have the Scriptures, the kings, the prophets, most importantly we have Yeshua our Messiah and all He achieved on the cross, all of which has spread throughout the nations of the world century after century after century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yeshua also wore &lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;tzitzit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Mark 5:25-34, Matthew 9:20-22, Luke 8:43-48)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; There are a number of Bible teachers who believe that this event is a fulfillment of &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Malachi 4:2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; that says the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its wings. As indictated throughout this article, the Hebrew word for tassel is tzitzit which means, fringe, tassel or lock, and it comes from the word ‘tsiyts’ which means feather or wing. So when the women with the issue of blood crept forward to touch the &lt;i&gt;‘hem’&lt;/i&gt; of Yeshua’s garment touching the blue threaded &lt;i&gt;‘tassels’&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;‘fringes’&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;‘wings’&lt;/i&gt; that identified Him as King and Priest under the very commandments of God they were reminders of, (of which He was author) she found healing in its wings…healing in its hem…healing it its tassels. There was no magic in the tassels themselves, rather she was healed because of the authority of the One wearing the tassels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When Yeshua rebuked the religious leaders for their making their own tassels extra long, and their phylacteries extra large, He wasn’t telling them not to wear them at all, after all, they were commanded to wear them, but by accentuating them they were doing several things; remember all Jews were required to wear tassels, but the religious leaders didn’t want to be equated with the common folk, they wanted to be elite among the people. Also, they wanted to stress that they were in fact more pious, devout or spiritually devoted to God. They weren’t of course, they were in fact incredibly proud and they wanted to flaunt their position to gain the accolades and approval of men; they wore exaggerated religious paraphernalia for personal gain.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Our Challenge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;How is this important for believers? The Jews were commanded to wear tassels on the garments throughout their generations but no such obligation was made to the Gentiles and there’s no such obligation made to believing Gentiles in the New Covenant either. The tassels were a specific mark of identity for Israel before other people and if everyone started wearing tassels, how would the Jew, the Israelite people be distinct in their role and calling among all the nations of the world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Well, it’s very interesting that Peter taught that Gentile believers actually have the same calling as their Jewish brethren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;1 Peter 2:9-10 says, “But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God’s own possession, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light; for you once were not a people, but now you are the people of God; you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Because we’ve been grafted into the commonwealth of Israel, adopted into the family though not ‘Jewish’ by ethnicity, we are partakers of the covenants too. We are to be a light to the nations, Yeshua said in His Sermon on the Mount in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Matthew 5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, that we are salt and light in the world. As partakers of the covenants through our adoption as sons, we are part of His holy nation and royal priesthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;So does this mean we should wear tassels on the corners of our clothes? No, not at all. But in the same way that the tzitzit or tassels are blatantly obvious on religious Jews, our faith and relationship with Yeshua should be just as obvious to those who see us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What do others see in us as we go about our daily lives? Do we express our love for Christ to others? Does our conversation honour Him? What is our dress code saying to those we come in contact with? What about our behaviour…do we indulge in gossip of others or crass jokes and innuendos? What about the entertainment we consume, is it wholesome or is it offensive to God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This could easily be seen as judgmental and it’s not meant to be; rather this is a call to self-examination in the light of God’s Word to see where we’re at and there isn’t a believer on the planet who doesn’t have the need for improvement and refining, because we’re all on the same journey. If we’re believer’s in Yeshua, then this isn’t about salvation, it’s about ambassadorship and we’re supposed to be representing and reflecting our King.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Our faith in Yeshua is supposed to be obvious just like the tassels worn by Jews are obvious so that people know and observe who we love and model our lives on…our Rabbi and Messiah Yeshua, the One in whose dust we are walking. We’ve been clothed in the robe of His righteousness, let’s make sure it’s visible, not for our glory, but for His.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Isaiah 61:10-11, “I will rejoice greatly in the Lord, My soul will exult in my God; for He has clothed me with garments of salvation, He has wrapped me with a robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decks himself with a garland, and a bride adorns herself with jewels. For as the earth brings forth its sprouts, and as a garden causes the things sown in it to spring up, so the Lord God will cause righteousness and praise to spring up before all the nations.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 8pt;&quot;&gt;Shalom&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yeshua taught from the Old Covenant Scriptures and He used techniques that were common practice by Rabbis and teachers for hundreds of years. One of those techniques was called &lt;i&gt;‘Gezerah Shevah’&lt;/i&gt; or ‘Comparison of Equals’ which basically means that a passage of Scripture can expand on another passage of Scripture if they share the same word. In other words, Scripture interprets Scripture. Chuck Missler has referred to this as &lt;i&gt;‘expositional constancy’&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;So as part of their study practice, Rabbis would look for places in the Bible where the same words were used and then see if and how they might be connected. They must never contradict each other or undermine the plain meaning of the text because God would never undermine His own Word. The connection is from the Hebrew rather than the English rendering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This is seen in the parables such as the sower, the birds mentioned in this parable represent satan and his workers who snatch away the word that was sown. In &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Mark 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; when the disciples asked Yeshua to explain the parable He said to them in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;verse 13, “Do you not understand this parable? How will you understand all the parables?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; In other words, the understanding of the parable of the sower is the key to understanding all the parables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If the birds in the parable of the sower represent the satan and his workers, then the birds in the parable of the mustard tree &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Luke 13)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; with the birds nesting in its branches also represents satan and his workers. Can this be seen throughout Scripture? Yes it can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In Old Covenant, God’s Temple service and the priesthood became corrupted with evil wicked men who polluted His house and twisted His Word and Judaism became corrupted by those who looked righteous but were in fact evil. Always, there was a remnant of true believers. In the New Covenant there is the parable of the wheat and the tares that look exactly the same as they grow together until they ripen and the farmer harvests them separately by collecting the tares &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Matt 13)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to be burned and destroyed and then the wheat which is collected and taken into the barn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Paul warned the Ephesian elders in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Acts 20:29-31&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, that after he would leave them, false teachers would arise from among their own group who would devour the flock of God with false doctrine and prophets which would wreak havoc on the church. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Jude&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; warned of the same thing in his letter, that false teachers and prophets would sneak into the church family ‘unawares’ bringing with them destructive heresies to destroy the faith of some so they can gather followers for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There are other examples too of the emissaries of the evil one who are determined to corrupt God’s church and claw people away from God’s Word and its truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When Yeshua was asked by a young Pharisee which was the greatest commandment in the Torah, He responded by saying &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;“Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: Love your neighbour as yourself.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt; &lt;i&gt;(Matt 22:36-39)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The first part comes from &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Deut 6:5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; which is part of the Shema, a prayer said by Jews both morning and evening to this day and is placed inside a mezuzah on the door post of their home. The second part comes from &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Lev 19:18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Both passages have the word &lt;i&gt;‘veh ah’hahv’tah’&lt;/i&gt; which means &lt;i&gt;‘and you shall love’&lt;/i&gt; and because of this phrase, both passages – though from different sections of the Torah – can be linked together. Scripture interprets Scripture and more often than not, we don’t look deep enough to find the connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God Himself was &lt;i&gt;‘stringing pearls’&lt;/i&gt; on the day Yeshua was baptised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Matthew 3:16-17, ‘After being baptised Jesus came up immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened, and He saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove and lighting on Him, and behold, a voice out of the heavens said, “This is My beloved Son, (whom I love) in whom I am well-pleased.”’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God Himself is quoting HIS OWN SCRIPTURES and putting small phrases together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;‘You are My son’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; comes from &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Psalm 2:7, “I will surely tell of the decree of the Lord: He said to Me, You are My Son, today I have begotten You.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;‘Whom I love’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; comes from &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Genesis 22:2, ‘He said, “Take now your son, your only son, ‘whom you love, Isaac, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I will tell you.”’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;‘In You I am well-pleased’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; comes from &lt;i&gt;Isaiah 42:1, &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;“Behold My Servant, whom I uphold; My chosen one in whom My soul delights. I have put My Spirit upon Him; He will bring forth justice to the nations.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Both &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Psalm 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Isaiah 42&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; have always been understood and accepted to be referring to the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Psalm 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is God proclaiming that His Son is a royal king who will rule over the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Isaiah 42&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is God is calling the Messiah His Servant whom God has placed His Spirit upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;As Yeshua came up out of the water, God the Father said, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;“You are My beloved Son, in You I am well-pleased”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; as the Spirit was in fact descending on Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Genesis 22&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is the most critical event in the Old Covenant. Abraham was about to sacrifice His son Isaac, a son Abraham waited 100 years to get who was more precious to him than his own life. This foreshadowed God the Father’s own feelings for His own Son, whom He would sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When Yeshua was baptised the Father was in effect saying, &lt;i&gt;“Here is My precious Son, MY Isaac,”&lt;/i&gt; prophetically hinting at the sacrifice Yeshua would make in a few short years from that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In three short quotes from His own Scriptures, God spoke of Yeshua as being a King, a Servant and a Son willing to sacrifice Himself. This one sentence reveals Yeshua as Prophet, Priest and King encapsulating the Gospel of our Redemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Our communion each week is the celebration we share, when we remember the price paid for us. And while Yeshua’s sacrifice on the cross is more than enough to demand our gratitude, God has placed His Spirit within us to lead and guide and comfort us and of course He has left for us His Word. We long to hear the voice of God…and yet God is speaking louder than ever if only we would open His Word and read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;2 Peter 1:3, ‘His divine power has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness through the true knowledge of Him who called us by His own glory and excellence. For by these He has granted to us His precious and magnificent promises, so that by them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world by lust.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We become like Him – purified and refined, developing His ‘Divine Nature’ through the transforming work of His Word…&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt; “…&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;so that by them&lt;/span&gt; you may become partakers of the divine nature…” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;The attaining of a life of godliness comes through the process of the Word working in us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;2 Peter 3:14-18, ‘Therefore beloved, since you look for these things, be diligent to be found by Him in peace, spotless and blameless, and regard the patience of our Lord as salvation; just as also our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given him, wrote to you, as also in all his letters, speaking in them of these things, in which are some things hard to understand, which the untaught and unstable distort, as they do also the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction. You therefore, beloved, knowing this beforehand, be on your guard so that you are not carried away by the error of unprincipled men and fall from your own steadfastness, but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory, both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God’s Word is so incredibly powerful, in fact many believers are ignorant of just how powerful God’s Word is and as a result they seek experiences, signs, wonders and fresh words and new revelations and excitement from men because they’re bored with the Word of God. It’s a tragedy that churches and believers world-wide don’t understand how important Scripture is for their spiritual health, if only they would read, study and love the Word of God, because in it…not in other things…but in IT is the wisdom, counsel, correction, comfort, warning, direction, light, discipline and purification necessary for every aspect and element of the Christian walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Hebrews 4:12, ‘For the Word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;All Scripture points to Yeshua as He is pre-eminent in all creation. Yeshua said to the Pharisees during one of their discussions;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;John 5:39; “You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; it is these that testify about Me.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp; - If you want to know Yeshua, know His Word. Genesis to Revelation is God’s revelation of Himself to us and His plan – in detail – to rescue us from the power and destruction of sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;And all this has been provided freely to us because of the completed work of Christ on the cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Dig into His Word; study the Hebrew words and search for the various places they’re used to see if and how they’re connected. Ensure that the straight meaning of the text is never compromised and see what lessons you learn; what strings of pearls of beautiful adornment can you discover in God’s amazing Word?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

15607,Home Group - Clean From Unclean,"&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Clean From Unclean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When God speaks and it doesn’t make sense to us, that doesn’t mean it doesn’t make sense. The problem isn’t with the teacher but rather with the student.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;For instance, how could God declare someone who was unclean to be clean simply by sprinkling them with the ashes of the red heifer? What does that even mean? How can the ashes of a cow that has a red hide purify anyone of anything?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Job 14:4, ‘Who can make the clean out of the unclean? No one!’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Humanly speaking, no human being can make another human being clean. But there is Someone who can make a human being clean and that’s God Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Consider this…the blue cord that was woven into the tassels of the garments worn by the teachers of the Law and the Rabbis…how was the colour produced? The dye itself comes from a sea mollusk – a mollusk is a shell fish and shell fish are not Kosher; they’re unclean for food. Yet this mollusk produces a substance that is used to dye the tassels (tek e’leth) of the garments that were to remind the Hebrews of God’s Commandments, His holy Law. So God uses something that is unclean and from it He makes something clean and holy; used for holy purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;An oyster, as food, is unclean. It’s also a mollusk, a shell fish. The most widely known function of the oyster is that they filter the water, they’re considered to be the vacuum cleaners of the water ways making them cleaner and healthier for other species. This is possibly why God didn’t want His people eating them; they are little water purifiers sucking in the nasties, filtering the water and then spitting out clean filtered water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;But from the oyster we get pearls. Pearls are produced when a small piece of grit, dirt, sand or some other tiny irritant enters the oyster and to deal with the offending invader, the oyster secretes a substance that covers the speck and it builds up over a long period of time and it becomes a pearl. Pearls are valued as highly prized items for jewelry and adornment. Yeshua said that pearls can be of great value or of great price. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Matt 13:46)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Matthew 7:6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, Yeshua even alludes to the fact that pearls may be considered as holy because He tells His followers not to cast their pearls before pigs. The word for pearls – a highly valuable item that should be treasured and protected and cared for, would not simply be tossed into a pig pen where it would be trampled and ruined and disrespected and discarded and in the same way, we are not to take His Word, His message, His Gospel, His Sacrifice and toss it before those who hate and despise Him and all He is and all He has done, only to have them mock, ridicule, disparage, blaspheme and corrupt it. The pearl in this allegory is pure, holy, precious and valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What are the gates of the New Jerusalem made of?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Revelation 21:21, ‘And the twelve gates, were twelve pearls; each one of the gates was a single pearl…’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The gates of the New Jerusalem, the very avenues that would prevent anything unclean from entering that which is clean and holy are actually made of something that is clean that has come from something that is unclean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Every single believer in Yeshua who has repented of their sin, who has confessed their guilt and expressed their sorrow and remorse for their sin, and who has put their faith and trust in Yeshua alone for their salvation is evidence of how He takes something that is unclean – us – and makes it holy and clean and pure; just as He takes a pearl – something clean – out of something unclean – the oyster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The process of growing a pearl takes many years, it’s not an overnight event. Pearls begin as a tiny irritant, an invading foreigner to the oyster and through a painstaking process, the pearl grows and develops from something ugly and foreign into something beautiful, adorning, useful and valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;So here’s a thought to ponder…finish this question…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If the world is His oyster, unclean and polluted and corrupt; tainted and defiled, can anything clean come forth out of it? If the answer is yes, what do the pearls represent?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Believer’s who have surrendered their lives, who are foreigners, irritants in a hostile environment that over a period of years are pressured, impacted, and refined, and transformed, and renewed until they’re finally taken from the oyster – the world – and have become beautiful vessels, beautiful adornments of great value, prized by the One who harvested, redeemed, saved, cleansed and then used for His service and glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If you take a map of the earth and lay it out flat, which country is basically at the centre? Israel is situated right in the centre, in the midst of the nations of the earth. It’s a tiny speck on the globe but its right at the heart of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The neighbourhood where Israel lives is a very, VERY hostile neighbourhood…who picked this particular location for Israel to live? God Himself! He placed them there, like a tiny irritant, to grow and develop – not among their friends and family, but rather among their enemies and adversaries. The Mediterranean Sea is their western border, and the name Mediterranean means, ‘Middle Earth’ or ‘Middle of the earth’, and when Jacob blessed Ephraim and Manasseh (Ephraim is interchangeably used in the OC as a name for Israel) he said that they would grow into a multitude and dwell in the midst of the nations. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Gen 48)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;David said very prophetically of Yeshua and of Israel His people in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Psalm 23:5, “You (God) prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies…”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;While as individual believers we grow and mature over a period of many years, so has the people of Israel. She has endured more pressure, more animosity, more tribulation and hardship, more persecution and hatred from the nations of the earth than any other people on the planet and God has kept His promise to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;He brought her back to her land after 2000 years of dispersion, persecution, near extermination, vitriolic malice and intent and established her borders, strengthened her government, prospered all the works of her hands and made her renowned among the nations. Through the trial and the struggle, God has developed, transformed and used Israel as a light to the nations for His glory, for her benefit and for the nations to see, believe and esteem Him as King of Kings and Lord of Lords, God over every other God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Israel His chosen people is His pearl of great price, developed and beautified among the tribulation and hardship of the world; we believers in an individual context are His pearls of great price, developed and beautified as a result of the tribulation and hardship of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What was the great price paid for these valuable pearls?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The sacrificial death of Yeshua Himself. The greatest, most costly price in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Matthew 13:45-46, ‘The kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking fine pearls, and upon finding the one pearl of great value, he went and sold all that he had and bought it.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Now this parable can certainly mean that when a person hears the Gospel message and realises it’s eternal value, he’s prepared to give up his entire life…family, fortune, job, position, reputation…absolutely everything in order to claim that precious pearl of eternal life and forgiveness of sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;But when you look at the fact that the pearl comes from something non-Kosher – unclean; you can understand this parable differently when you consider the Jewish context of what is known to be unclean and clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Who is the Merchant? Yeshua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What is the Merchant seeking? Pearls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What are pearls? Irritations from an unclean creature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What does the Merchant pay? Everything He has…even His very life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

15606,Home Group - The Richness Of Jewish Prayer,"&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Hebrew Roots Of Our Faith - The Richness Of Jewish Prayer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Over the past months we've looked at how important it is to understand the culture and setting of the Scripture in order to understand the intention and specific meaning and definition of what was said and why. Understanding customs also helps us understand what was said and taught as well, and it's been to the detriment of the church universally, that we have neglected and considered Jewish custom and culture to be insignificant and completely unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;But it's good to have a taste of Jesus’ customs and culture, but not to become more Jewish, but rather to become more like Yeshua. However, not all customs or practices or traditions are bad, and there's one Jewish practice that all Christians would benefit from, not necessarily to copy or mimic, but to adopt and adapt into their lives and it's in the area of prayer, and Jews have prayed this way for thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;I've studied the 'Lord's Prayer' numerous times before and I understand that Yeshua wasn't telling us to pray that particular prayer 'parrot fashion' by just simply repeating those specific words, rather He said when you pray, pray 'like this'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Matt 6:9, Yeshua said, &quot;Pray then in this way: Our Father who is in heaven, Hallowed be Your name...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The passage goes on as we know, but because I've always struggled with prayer and never found it to be a discipline that's come easy to me, I've tried to model my prayer after this one. So when I begin my prayer times I always begin by giving honour to God, honouring His name and blessing Him because of His greatness and goodness. I’m learning to 'hallow His name'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;So what is this wonderful Jewish pattern of prayer? It is the habit of “blessing” the Lord. It's an attitude of continual thankfulness toward God that expresses itself through brief prayers that acknowledge Him as the source of every good thing and it ultimately comes from the Scriptures, when Moses instructed his people not to forget the Lord:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Deut 8:10-11, 'When you have eaten and are satisfied, you shall bless the LORD your God for the good land which He has given you. Beware that you do not forget the LORD your God by not keeping His commandments and His ordinances and His statutes which I am commanding you today.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It can be easy to stay focused on God, tenaciously trusting Him when life is hard and we're facing struggles but it's not so easy when life is good; this is a pattern we saw repeatedly with the people of Israel - God blessed them and they prospered but in their prosperity they grew casual and blasé toward God and His commands and they quickly fell into sin and idolatry. God warned them to repent or He would have to send judgment, then judgment fell and suffering came and THEN the people repented and returned to The Lord. So with that in mind the rabbis developed a method of constantly reminding themselves of God’s care by saying short prayers of thanks for just about everything in their daily lives and they began those short prayers with “bless the Lord.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This kind of prayer habit is quite invasive and the goal of such prayer habits was to keep God and His presence and love continually on their minds. This was the normal, usual practice in Yeshua's day and the probability that He held to these practices is incredibly high and it may have been what Paul was referring to when he said &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;“Be joyful always; pray continually; give thanks in all circumstances” in 1 Thes 5:16-18.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; This understanding certainly makes this verse easier to understand and obey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Long before Yeshua came the Jews had already developed a range of short blessings to be said for certain occasion that were in addition to their longer prayers each morning and evening and some of them are still prayed in daily synagogue services but the modern custom begins all of them by saying, “Blessed are you, oh Lord our God, King of the Universe.” Interestingly, they begin each prayer by 'hallowing God's Name' and I can't help but wonder if this is a result of Yeshua's instructions to His disciples? That's just a curious thought of my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It's really important to understand that this practice is NOT to bless objects and people which is very much a Christian practice, instead this manner of prayer is to bless the Lord, understanding that the focus is on God the blessing Giver, not on the blessing itself. The word for bless, &lt;i&gt;'barak'&lt;/i&gt; also means “to kneel,” so when we bless God verbally, we mentally and spiritually bow in worship before Him. In Yeshua's day the first line of these short prayers was probably &lt;i&gt;“Blessed is He,”&lt;/i&gt; but over time the rabbis felt it was important to be remind themselves always that God is also King and He is Creator of everything so they added the rest of the line later. So in these short prayers of thanks are mental acknowledgement that God is our Creator, He is our King and He is the source of every single thing that comes to us each and every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Luke 24:30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, it says that Yeshua &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;“took the bread and blessed it”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; but the inclusion of the word “it” is incorrect, it was not the habit of the Jews in prayer to bless the item that God was being thanked for, rather it was God who was being blessed for being the provider of the item. The idea of blessing the Lord is to thank Him for His provision of the food, not to confer holiness or blessing on the food itself, this is a Christian tradition and is very common at meal times, prayers such as, &lt;i&gt;&quot;Thank you Father for this food, we ask that You bless it to us....&quot; or &quot;Lord we bless this food...&quot; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;Christians have lots of habits and traditions too. :-) &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When Yeshua took the bread, it's more likely that He prayed something like this, &lt;i&gt;“Blessed is He who brings forth bread from the earth,”&lt;/i&gt; because that's the prayer that all Jewish men prayed before they ate bread and especially so on Shabbat and absolutely so when celebrating Pesach (Passover). &amp;nbsp;When Yeshua did miracles, the people “glorified God,” and possibly said things like, “Blessed is He who has performed a miracle in this place!” It was customary to pray this blessing at a site where a miracle occurred. So when Yeshua healed ten lepers and only one came back and loudly blessed God, Yeshua wondered why the other nine hadn’t returned to do the same thing. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Luke 17:12 -19)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Psalm 24:1 says, “The earth is the Lord’s and all it contains, the world and those who dwell in it,”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and with this in mind, the rabbis of Yeshua's day and earlier decided that everything that we enjoy in life should cause us to bless God. In the Mishnah, (not inspired Scripture) the record of rabbinic thought from before Yeshua's time until about 200 AD, the first book is devoted entirely to blessings. In the most ordinary things they found ways of praising God, and these blessings have God at their centre. They contain no personal pronouns whatsoever — they're focused entirely on Him, and not on the person praying. Simply put, they're statements that praise God for His goodness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;A person was supposed to devote his first thoughts upon waking to praising God once again for each part of his body that was functioning. The very first thing that would have woken them up was probably a rooster’s crow. So in the first century they would have said, &lt;i&gt;“Blessed is He who has given to the rooster understanding to distinguish between day and night!”&lt;/i&gt; When they opened their eyes they said, &lt;i&gt;“Blessed is He who opens the eyes of the blind!”&lt;/i&gt; When they dressed they said, &lt;i&gt;“Blessed is He who clothes the naked!”&lt;/i&gt; They also said this when they put on a new piece of clothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In their experience of nature they also blessed God. When the first flowers were seen on the trees in the spring, they said, &lt;i&gt;“Blessed is He who did not omit anything from the world, and created within it good creations and good trees for people to enjoy!”&lt;/i&gt; Don't we love to see the daffodils after winter letting us know that the warmer summer months are not too far away? When they heard thunder or an earthquake that inspired fear, they also blessed God by saying, &lt;i&gt;“Blessed is He whose strength and power fill the world!”&lt;/i&gt; Next time there's a storm, remind yourself of God’s amazing power. When it rained, they said, &lt;i&gt;“Blessed is he who is good, and gives good things!“&lt;/i&gt; We usually complain when it rains, but in Israel where water is greatly needed, rain is source of joy and the reality is, our abundant food here is utterly dependent on the rain that we always complain about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;They had blessings for the highs and lows in life as well. When they went through a long, difficult time and finally had relief, or celebrated a happy event they'd been waiting for, they said, &lt;i&gt;“Blessed is He who has allowed us to live, and sustained us and enabled us to reach this day.”&lt;/i&gt; When a son returned home from war, or when a baby was born, or some other wonderful thing, they uttered this prayer to praise God for bringing them to that point in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Even in times of grief, when someone died or they heard tragic news, they blessed God. They said, &lt;i&gt;“Blessed is He who is the true Judge.”&lt;/i&gt; It was a reminder that God was still good, even when they heard about tragic events, and that He will ultimately bring justice even where justice doesn't appear to be seen at all. This is a particularly important reminder to us considering what's taking place around the world and more specifically in places like Syria and Iraq and the unbalanced judgment and condemnation Israel is experiencing at the moment in its war with Hamas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It’s easy to start worrying that God is not in control, and not remember His continual faithfulness that sustains every minute of the day. Nothing occurs in our lives personally or in the world generally that hasn't already been sovereignly approved of by God who orders and holds all things together by the power of His will. David shared wrote the recipe for keeping God's loving care in the forefront of our mind in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Psalm 103&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Psalm 103:1-11 says,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;'Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless His holy name!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget none of His benefits,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Who pardons all your iniquities, who heals all your diseases;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Who redeems your life from the pit, who crowns you with lovingkindness and compassion;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Who satisfies your years with good things so that your youth is renewed like the eagle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;The Lord performs righteous deeds and judgments for all who are oppressed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;He made known His ways to Moses, His acts to the sons of Israel. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;The Lord is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in lovingkindness. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;He will not always strive with us, nor will He keep His anger forever. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;He has not dealt with us according to our sins, nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is His lovingkindness toward those who fear Him.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

15605,Home Group - The Saga &amp; Drama Of Genesis,"&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;The Saga &amp;amp; Drama Of Genesis?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Those who believe that the Bible, particularly the Old Covenant portion, is the Word of God, sometimes have difficulty in explaining how God could condone and even use some of the people who are listed in it as being ‘God’s people’! There are many things that are just too hard to explain but that task does actually become easier when our understanding of culture and purpose is clearer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;One of the really difficult things for believers to wrap their head around is how God could use the men He chose to represent Him especially when they committed really terrible crimes! If believers can’t wrap their brain around such things, how can they possibly explain them to unbelievers? Why on earth would God choose such wicked people to be His chosen people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What people am I referring to and what kind of things did they do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Genesis 12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, Abram allowed Pharaoh to believe that Sarai wasn’t his wife, only his sister, in a bid to save his own skin! Abraham actually allowed his own wife to be taken by Pharaoh, king of Egypt, whose intention was to include her in his harem of many wives, and he did that so he wouldn’t be in personal danger. When God warned Pharaoh in a dream, Abraham simply excused himself by saying in effect that he wasn’t really lying because she was his half sister. Poor Sarai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Genesis 26&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, Isaac did the same thing to Rebecca but to Abimelech of the Philistines. Husbands are supposed to protect and guard their wives, not allow them to be taken by other men as a means of self-preservation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Jacob, while a peaceful man, was a multi-offending deceiver, Simeon and Levi deceived the Hivite men after Shechem the Hivite prince raped their sister Dinah. Shechem wanted to marry Dinah after the assault, but her brothers would only agree to the marriage if all the Hivite men agreed to circumcision and after they agreed and were recovering and in great pain, Simeon and Levi slaughtered all the men of that community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Reuben, Jacob’s first born son, actually slept with one of his father’s concubines in a bid to seize the role of authority from his father, utterly disgracing him. Judah willingly used the services of a prostitute – who in fact turned out to be his daughter-in-law Tamar; who pretended to be a prostitute to force Judah into doing the right thing according to the custom of what later became known as the law of levirate marriage – and Judah was actually going to burn Tamar to death for prostitution after he himself had used her!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What about poor Joseph? He was almost murdered by his own brothers because of their hatred and jealousy toward him because he was their father’s favourite son. Joseph didn’t force his father to be an irresponsible parent by playing favourites with his children! But they collectively threw him in a pit in order to kill him but had a small prick of conscience and decided to sell him into slavery to a band of slave traders heading to Egypt…after all, he was their brother…it was the least they could do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Isn’t the Genesis account supposed to provide us with moral, historical life accounts that are examples for us to live by? Actually, that’s not the point at all. Genesis is the historical documentation of God’s blessing throughout the family of Abraham and how God shows His power and purpose in who He chooses to carry on His commission to succeeding generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When you read Genesis next take special note of the twists in each story plot…who will be chosen for the next step in the unfolding of God’s blessing on Abraham’s line?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Abraham had two sons; Ishmael was the oldest but Isaac was the son of promise and He received the blessing not Ishmael.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Isaac had twin sons, Jacob and Esau. Esau was the eldest and according to custom and cultural tradition, he should have received the blessing and the birthright, but it Jacob instead. Yes, Jacob used deceit to get them, but before the twins were born, God revealed to Rebecca that the younger would rule the older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In both these cases, God’s choice was counter cultural; the blessing went to the less likely person. There are numerous accounts in Genesis about the twelve sons of Jacob; each was the father of one of the twelve tribes of Israel. Which of them should have received God’s blessing for the express purpose of carrying it to the world? Well, the entire people known as the Jewish people, or Israel or the Hebrews were called to be a light to the Gentile world, but there was to be a specific line from which the greatest light of all was to come…that light of course being Yeshua the Messiah…which of Jacob’s sons should have received that blessing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Naturally, it would be assumed that the eldest…the first born should have been given that privilege. Reuben was the firstborn but he dishonored his father by sleeping with his concubine so he was disqualified. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Gen 35:22, Gen. 49:3)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Simeon and Levi were next in age but they because of their murder of the Hivite men, they too were overlooked. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Gen. 34:25, Gen. 49:5-7)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In Genesis 49, at the end of Jacob’s life he prophesied about the distant future of each of his son’s families, and he reminded Reuben, Simeon and Levi of their past sins and then withheld from them his greatest blessings. Instead, Jacob decided that the blessing of the firstborn would be given to Joseph, his favourite son from his favourite wife. It seems Jacob hadn’t learned that favouritism is always bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Jacob adopted Joseph’s sons, Ephraim and Manasseh as his own so that they would be included within the nation of Israel…Jacob’s descendants. They were included in the nation and became 2 of the 12 tribes with land allotments for their generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;But what did God think of Jacob’s choice? Not much really because without realising it, the prophecy Jacob gave to Judah did in fact place the blessing of the firstborn on him. God is the One who chose the line of Judah to bring forth the Messiah, the light to the nations…even in spite of Judah’s appalling sin against his daughter-in-law Tamar!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Genesis 49:8-10 says, “Judah, your brothers shall praise you; Your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies; Your father’s sons shall bow down to you. Judah is a lions whelp; From the pray my son, you have gone up. He couches, he lies down as a lion, and as a lion, who dares rouse him up? The scepter will not depart from Judah, nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet, until Shiloh comes, and to him shall be the obedience of the nations.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Judah was the fourth-born son of Leah, the unloved wife, who became the instrument of God’s redemptive plan. He was the one who would ultimately bring forth the Messiah, Yeshua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Why would God use such a reprobate like Judah? Aren’t all human beings reprobate? Aren’t all human beings sinful?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If God has determined that reaching humanity with His Gospel plan of redemption requires using human beings, He has to use sinners because there aren’t any other kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Genesis includes these ugly stories for a reason, it demonstrates that there are consequences for actions but more than that, God chose the unlikely ones, He chose the ones that went against the cultural norms, the predictable ones, the usual ones or the likely ones. Just like He chose David, the youngest son in his family and the least ‘kingly’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God chooses the weak, the lowly, the broken, the dysfunctional, the rejected, the confused and even the most sinful. When God’s purposes come to pass through these kind of social, mental, emotional and spiritual misfits, He and only He can receive the glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;He takes the most unlikely human beings, He transforms them, He empowers and equips them and He achieves the most extraordinary things through them, and we have to simply sit back with our mouths agape in awe and wonder at what He alone has done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It reminds me of the verse in the book of &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Mark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;; Yeshua – the descendant of Abraham through the line of Judah and the royal line of David – who ministered to the people, He delivered them from evil spirits, He miraculously fed thousands of them, He opened blind eyes and ears, He made the mute to speak, He made cripples walk and He even raised the dead back to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If you’ve seen Yeshua, you’ve seen the Father; He only ever did what He saw His Father do…and when you look back over human history through the lens of the Bible, it seems perfectly fitting to repeat &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Mark 7:37&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; which says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;“They were utterly astonished, saying “…He has done all things well...” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 8pt;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 8pt;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

15604,Home Group - Jewish Logic 'Measure For Measure',"&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jewish Logic – Measure For Measure&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Matthew 7:1-2, “Don’t judge, so that you won’t be judged. For the way you judge is how you will be judged – the measure with which you measure out will be used to measure to you.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Right at the outset, it needs to be made clear that there are various kinds of judgment spoken of in the Bible and the instructions regarding ‘judging’ can appear to be contradictory if you don’t understand the context or the focus or the outcome of the judgment. There are times when we’re called to judge and then there are times we’re not to judge and its incumbent upon us to understand what those differences are so that we learn to judge the right things and not judge the wrong things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Home Group tonight is about judging individuals on a personal level over their personal sin and determining their what their consequences should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When Yeshua used the words the “measure with which you measure,” He was using a classic rabbinic idea called&amp;nbsp;‘&lt;em&gt;midah keneged midah’&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(mee-dah kah-NEG-ed mee-dah), which literally means, &lt;i&gt;‘measure corresponding to measure.’&lt;/i&gt; Paul used this style of reasoning as well and knowing more about the interesting logic behind this expression can provide us with wisdom and compassion for us to live by today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Measure for Measure’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The rabbis recognised a pattern throughout the Bible as they read and studied it; what they noticed was that the consequences of a sin often fit the crime, ‘Measure for Measure’, and there are several places where God explicitly said so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;Exodus 4:22-23, God said to Moses, “&lt;/i&gt;&lt;em&gt;Say to Pharaoh, ‘This is what the LORD says: Israel is My firstborn son, and I told you, “Let My son go, so he may worship Me.” But you refused to let him go; so I will kill your firstborn son.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Exodus 22:22-24, again God said, &lt;/i&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Do not take advantage of a widow or an orphan. If you do and they cry out to Me, I will certainly hear their cry. My anger will be aroused, and I will kill you with the sword; your wives will become widows and your children fatherless.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If you look a little more intentionally into the lives of some characters in the Bible, you’ll actually find this ‘Measure for Measure’ kind of attitude or pattern woven subtly into the story in various places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;• Jacob substituted himself for his brother Esau to gain his birthright, taking advantage of his father’s blindness to achieve it. Later the wool was pulled over his own eyes when Leah was substituted for her sister on his wedding night, and he was forced to marry her! &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Genesis 27; 29:23-25)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;• Pharaoh commanded his people to drown every Hebrew baby boy in the waters of the Nile River and later, his own army perished by drowning in the Red Sea when they pursued the Israelites. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Exodus 1:22; 14:28)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;• Haman was so incensed with Mordechai for not bowing down to him that he built a gallows to have him hanged on but in the end, Haman was forced to lead Mordechai on a horse to honor him, and was subsequently hanged on his own gallows! &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Esther 5:9,14; 6:11, 7:10)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We might view this as ‘poetic justice,’ and it might even be, we might believe that events aren’t random but rather, that God is in fact in control and orchestrates these things and we’d be right. God is sovereign and in absolute control of our lives down to the tiniest detail. In the story of Jacob, it’s clear that God didn’t condone his deceitfulness, He let him suffer and experience the consequences of a sin that was exactly like the sin he committed against his brother. Jacob became a different man in his later life than in his early life because he learned what it was like to be deceived and he learned to trust God through those struggles and injustices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Paul taught that we’ll endure the consequences of the choices we make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In&lt;em&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Galatians 6:7-8 Paul said, “Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. The one who sows to please his sinful nature, from that nature will reap destruction; the one who sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We use the phrase, &lt;i&gt;‘What goes around comes around’&lt;/i&gt; and some use the word &lt;i&gt;‘Karma’&lt;/i&gt; to express the idea that if you treat someone badly, the time will come when you will be treated badly too and then justice will be done. If we’re honest, we’d agree that most of the time, this is true…liars get caught out in their lies eventually and the time eventually comes when they are the recipient of a lie themselves; people who are vitriolic and hateful are usually hated by others in return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Not&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;to Use ‘Measure-for-Measure’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Can we assume then that all our problems come from&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;midah keneged midah – ‘Measure for Measure?’ Is &lt;/em&gt;God giving us our just deserts for the sins of our past? Both the Old and New Covenants would disagree with that viewpoint. In &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Job 42:8&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Job’s friends used that logic and concluded that all Job’s suffering must be punishment for some sin he’d committed, but when God finally entered Job’s situation and the discussion he was having with his so-called learned friends, He declared that they had not spoken rightly of Him and He dealt with them harshly for misrepresenting Him. &amp;nbsp;So we shouldn’t use this logic on each other to look for reasons for why others suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There are times when the Bible actually flips the idea of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;midah keneged midah&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;on its head, threatening to use the ‘Measure for Measure’ approach against people who use it against others! If a needy person comes to you for help, you might be tempted to ignore them because their bad choices got them into that mess in the first place. But if you do that, God would then be completely within His right to ignore&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;problems, ‘Measure for Measure’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;Proverbs 21:13 says, ‘H&lt;/i&gt;&lt;em&gt;e who shuts his ear to the cry of the poor&lt;/em&gt; w&lt;em&gt;ill also cry himself and not be answered.’&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;An 18th century rabbi put it this way, &lt;i&gt;“When a poor man asks you for aid, do not use his faults as an excuse for not helping him. For then God will look at your offenses, and He is sure to find many.”*&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;That quote should be both a warning and a reminder to us of why we shouldn’t be hard-hearted to those who are suffering, even if it’s the fault of their own sin or foolishness. We’re all sinners, and for the most part, God doesn’t deal with us as we deserve. He restrains judgment and supplies our needs whether we deserve it or not, He causes the sun to rise on the evil and the good, sending rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Matt 5:45)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; We should help those who don’t deserve it &lt;b&gt;BECAUSE&lt;/b&gt; God helps&amp;nbsp;us&amp;nbsp;when we don’t deserve it.** If we do that, we are actually reflecting God’s nature and character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Jesus pointed this out when He was asked about the murder of some Jews in the Temple by Pilate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;Luke 13:2-5, &lt;/i&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered this way? I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish. Or those eighteen who died when the tower in Siloam fell on them, do you think they were more guilty than all the others living in Jerusalem? I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish.”&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Jesus confirmed that the Galileans who were murdered were sinners, but they were no worse than the rest of us - we are just like them. None of us is in a position to judge another person for his personal sin, that’s entirely God’s domain and God is showing mercy to all of us constantly, day after day, and He will continue to until the final day of judgment. Rather than looking for ways to blame those who struggle and fail with sin, we should understand how easy it is for us to fall into sin and examine ourselves regularly, because enduring hardship and trials and consequences for wrong doing or experiencing blessing and trouble free seasons in our lives, aren’t necessarily evidences of God’s approval or disapproval; they’re simply the ebbs and flows of life that God uses to mould us and draw us to Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Now I realise there are exceptions to this rule, especially when we’ve repeatedly tried to help someone who abuses and takes advantage of our help with every intention of continuing in their sinful behaviour and there does come a point when we have to say “No” to more assistance. That’s when it’s the loving thing to do to say “No” as a means of motivating them and to bring pressure to bear so that they actually initiate change that stops the cycle. But as a general rule, our response should be that of mercy &amp;nbsp;and understanding because that is the response we ourselves have received from God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being Merciful, ‘Measure-for-Measure’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;So how should we respond, ‘Measure for Measure?’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Well, there is another way that this logic can be used. You could think that God would tell Israel that after their slavery in Egypt, they should respond ‘Measure for Measure’, by being cruel to the Egyptians in the future; that they should treat the Egyptians the way the Egyptians had treated them but He doesn’t, God actually tells His people to do the very opposite. Since they knew what it was like to be helpless foreigners and abused and oppressed slaves in Egypt, they should empathise with foreigners who would enter their land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lev 19:33-34 says, &lt;/i&gt;“&lt;em&gt;When an alien (foreigner) lives with you in your land, do not mistreat him. The alien living with you must be treated as one of your native-born. Love him as yourself, for you were aliens in Egypt. I am the LORD your God.”&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God was pointing out that His people’s own hard and tragic past should teach them to care about others, particularly the traveler or refugee who was vulnerable to exploitation. Even if an Egyptian were to come to Israel, the people’s response was to be loving, not vengeful, when they saw him as one who is in the same situation that they once were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In the same way, when we see others’ troubles and know that it’s only by grace that we aren’t in their place, it should prompt us to come to their aid or at the very least to express empathy and compassion toward them. Rather than linking a perceived punishment to some sin they’ve committede using &lt;em&gt;midah keneged midah&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;- ‘Measure for Measure’, we should match our response to the grace God has shown us, ‘Measure for Measure’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This is ingrained in the Jewish psyche in Israel to this very day. Arabs citizens of Israel are treated as equal citizens and they have all the same rights and opportunities as Jewish citizens. They can buy homes, property, businesses and make financial investments; they can vote, travel, they all have access to education and there are no forbidden vocations – they can be politicians, doctors, lawyers, judges, teachers, builders, farmers, bankers, real estate agents, entrepreneurs, soldiers, entertainers, artists and even beauty queens; they’re on the same wage scale as Jewish citizens and they’ll experience the same punishments for breaking the law as Jewish citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This attitude was also behind Yeshua’s words about forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Luke 6:37-38 He said, &lt;/i&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Do not judge and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven. Give and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Like the Israelites, when we see the situation that we were in, and the condemnation and judgment that God has set us free from, the reasonable, expected response from us is that we extend that mercy to others who are sinners like ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Based on the writings of Lois Tverberg&lt;/p&gt;",2014-08-25 06:42:11,mworby
15603,Home Group - A King Who Suffers For His Kingdom,"&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;A King Who Suffers For His Kingdom&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;During ‘Passion Week’ each year, Christians all over the world focus on the death and resurrection of Yeshua. I don’t think there’s a more appropriate chapter on the sacrifice of Yeshua than &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Isaiah 53&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, which prophesies God’s shocking plan to send His ‘Servant’ to die for the sins of His people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Verses 6-7&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; will probably be very familiar to you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;‘All of us like sheep have gone astray, each of us has turned to his own way; but the Lord has caused the iniquity of us all to fall on Him. He was oppressed and He was afflicted, yet He did not open His mouth; like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that is silent before its shearers, so He did not open His mouth.’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This is graphic imagery of the Lamb of God who willingly suffers for the sins of the sheep who have gone astray. Just a few lines later in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;verses 11-12&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Isaiah joyously predicts Christ’s victory over death and the ultimate redemption of sinners:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;‘As a result of the anguish of His soul, He will see it and be satisfied; by His knowledge the Righteous One, My Servant, will justify the many, as He will bear their iniquities. Therefore, I will allot Him a portion with the great, and He will divide the booty with the strong; because He poured out Himself to death. And was numbered with the transgressors; Yet He Himself bore the sin of many, and interceded for the transgressors.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Isaiah 53&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is very rich, and to many of us it is very familiar but what you might not realise is a discovery with implications that result from one widely overlooked line.&amp;nbsp;It’s the first line of &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;verse 12:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;‘Therefore, I will allot Him a portion with the great and He will divide the booty with the strong’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In many English translations it can sound a little weak, almost as though God’s Servant, who has paid the ransom for sinful people with His own life, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; deserves to be AMONG the great instead of the absolute hero outstanding from them all. Also, He gets a prize for His efforts but only along with others who are equally strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There are a number of scholars who consider that this English translation doesn’t accurately communicate what the original Hebrew says. *The JPS (Jewish Publication Society) translation of the Hebrew when transliterated reads like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;‘Assuredly, I will give Him the many as His portion, He shall receive the multitude as His spoil.’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Isaiah 53&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, God is the One speaking and the ‘Servant’ He is referring to is not &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;just&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; one “among the great” He is in fact&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;given&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;the multitudes. He’s not just dividing the spoil with others who are strong, He is actually &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;given&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; the people as&amp;nbsp;His&amp;nbsp;spoils. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;He’s receives&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;the people as His reward because of His suffering on their behalf.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Is that a stunning thought? Is that something we could believe? Is that even a Biblical thought to have - that the Suffering Servant would in fact be given humanity as His possession as a result of the suffering He endured on their behalf? The Suffering Servant doesn’t just deserve mild praise; He deserves to have the ultimate supremacy with multitudes of people given to Him. Does that sound right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;You may have never even considered such a thing, how could God consider giving ‘people’ as a possession to someone as a gift!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Listen to these words in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Psalm 2:6-8&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, God is speaking…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;‘But as for Me, I have installed My King upon Zion, My holy mountain. I will surely tell of the decree of the Lord: He said to Me, “You are My Son, today I have begotten You. Ask of Me and I will surely give the nations as Your inheritance, and the very ends of the earth as Your possession.”’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Psalm 2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is a messianic prophecy in which God announces that He has anointed His true King, the Messiah and as God’s King He is appointed to reign, He is “given” the nations as a gift – an inheritance. The people aren’t merely His subjects, they are His “possession.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A King Who Suffers for His Kingdom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The victorious messiah of &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Psalm 2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; seems to be the utter opposite of the Suffering Servant in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Isaiah 53&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Some Jewish traditions split them altogether, imagining that two different messiahs must come; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;“Messiah ben Joseph”&lt;/i&gt; who suffers, and “Messiah ben David” who reigns in power. Which one will come? Well, many Jews believe that they’re the ones who will determine which Messiah comes as they believe it all depends on their behaviour…if they’re earnestly seeking God and His expected Redemption then Messiah ben David, the warrior, will come and bring deliverance and the re-establishment of the Monarchy of David. But…if they are not earnestly seeking God, if they remain rebellious and secular and seeking to please themselves, then Messiah ben Joseph will come and will have to suffer on behalf of the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If you interpret &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Isaiah 53:12&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to mean that God’s Servant will be “given the multitudes,” then both &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Isaiah 53 and the Psalm 2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; confirm each other. First the Servant suffers to redeem His people, and then He’s proclaimed God’s true King. The multitudes that He is given are the people whose sins He’s atoned for. In effect, He’s “purchased” them. It’s actually&amp;nbsp;because&amp;nbsp;of Yeshua’s suffering that He is given His kingdom! There is no place in Scripture that describes the Messiah of God as simply being accounted equal with other strong or great men; Messiah is always pre-eminent and given the highest place of honour and glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The concept of people being bought and owned by the Messiah is also in the New Covenant in places like &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acts 20:27&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, where it says that Yeshua “purchased” the church with His own blood and Paul put it this way in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;1 Corinthians 6:19-20, ‘You are not your own; for you have been bought with a price.’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The Apostles often spoke of themselves as&amp;nbsp;‘&lt;i&gt;doulos Christos’&lt;/i&gt; - “slaves of Christ.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;While modern ears hate to be called “slaves,” it sounds like Yeshua’s death on the cross did not just pay for our sins, it purchased our very lives. If we’ve come to faith in Him as our Messiah, our Redeemer and our Lord, we’ve actually been&amp;nbsp;given&amp;nbsp;to Him by the Father. We’re His and we no longer belong to ourselves. Actually, we’ve never belonged to ourselves because before coming to faith in Yeshua, we were enslaved to sin and satan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;But what does belonging to Yeshua mean for how we live?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;As Western individualists we like to read the Bible as if it was written to each one of us all by ourselves. We sing praises to Yeshua for dying for “&lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;personally,” and “paying for&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;sins” and that is absolutely true! But the Biblical thought and intention is in terms of ‘&lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt;’ – the collective - much more than just ‘&lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;’ or ‘&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;’. That’s why the Bible speaks of Yeshua purchasing an&amp;nbsp;entire kingdom&amp;nbsp;through His sacrificial death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Every time we celebrate Yeshua’s death and resurrection be it during Passion week or every time you celebrate communion, remind yourself of this glorious scene in Revelation when the “Lamb” of &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Isaiah 53&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; finally takes His throne:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Revelation 5:6, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;‘And I saw between the throne with the four living creatures and the elders, a Lamb standing as if slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent out into all the earth.’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;9-12,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;‘And they sang a new song, saying, “Worthy are You to take the book and to break its seals; for You were slain, and purchased for God with Your blood, men from every tribe and tongue and people and nation. You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to our God; and they will reign upon the earth.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Then I looked and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders; and the number of them was myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;And every created thing which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all things in them, I heard saying, ‘To Him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb, be blessing and honour and glory and dominion forever and ever.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;And the four living creatures kept saying, “Amen” and the elders fell down and worshipped.’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;That imagery isn’t the description of God’s Suffering Servant sharing honour or praise among others who are strong, rather it’s an unbelievable picture of the supremacy of the Suffering Servant who redeemed mankind and purchased them for Himself with His own blood and established His eternal Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

15602,Home Group - The Role Of Women In The Bible,"&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;The Role Of Women In The Bible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Throughout history in most cultures of the world, women always seemed to be on the lowest social status, that they lived very much at the beck and call or whims of the men in their families and societies. They didn’t typically function in the roles of politics, commerce and trade, law, teaching, governance, medicine, science or innovation. When we read our Bibles, we can typically assume that the women living in the Biblical era were equally limited in their options. Relative to men, women always got the rough end of the stick on everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Is that assumption really true?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Believe it or not, women in the Bible actually did have one &lt;i&gt;advantage&lt;/i&gt; over men, and it explains some of the unusual heroines we read about in the Old Covenant; heroines like Ruth the Moabitess and Rahab the harlot. Neither of these women were Israelites, yet these two foreign women were singled out for specific praise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In the New Covenant, this &lt;i&gt;“advantage”&lt;/i&gt; partially explains why we find so many foreign women becoming believers in the early church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The people groups of the Ancient Near East were tribal peoples; each tribe had its own particular gods that they worshipped and the gods a person served and worshipped were pre-determined by their family ancestors. Each man was obligated to serve the gods of his ancestors, but if a woman married out of her tribe, she was then expected and obligated to worship the gods of her husband’s family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In the case of Ruth, this social expectation resulted in her being one of the few people in the Old Covenant who actually had the freedom to “change” gods. Ruth was a Moabite by birth, but she married the son of Naomi, an Israelite and even though they lived in the land of Moab, they worshipped the God of the Hebrews, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. When Ruth’s husband died, everybody’s expectation was that she would return to her people (and ultimately to her family’s pagan gods), but she deliberately chose to remain with Naomi her mother-in-law and her people; she bravely put her faith in their God and such a decision meant Ruth’s love, belief and faith in Yahweh, was a genuine faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Ruth 1:16, ‘Ruth said, “Do not urge me to leave you or turn back from following you; for where you go I will go, and where you lodge I will lodge. Your people shall be my people, and your God, my God.”’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In most ancient cultures, a woman found her societal standing and respectability in her husband and in the children she bore. In almost every way, women were dependent on their husbands for their very existence because for the most part, women didn’t function in business – yes there were always exceptions but for the most part, women looked after the home and raised children. If a woman found herself without a husband and no family to care for her and no children that were old enough for her to live with, she would usually find herself destitute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Most women in ancient cultures needed husbands if they were to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We could read Ruth’s story today and assume that her actions were due to her personal affection for her mother-in-law and that is correct. But Jewish commentaries have also understood her decision was also theological. In Jewish thought, Ruth is considered to be a “practically perfect proselyte” or convert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The very fact that Ruth, as a woman, was expected to worship the god’s of her husband was what provided her with the freedom in her native society to worship the God of Israel because she was at that time married to an Israelite. However, when she became a widow, she was without income or means of an income, she was childless and therefore presented with a dismal future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;She could return to her parents home and hope to find another husband at some point in the future, this would mean that she would have to revert to worshipping the pagan god’s of her family and when she remarried, begin worshipping the god’s her husband worshipped. Alternately, she could remain with her mother-in-law; herself a widow and remain in absolute beggary – dirt poor, with no means of providing for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If Naomi had been a terrible mother-in-law, it would probably have been easy for Ruth to return to her family, but Naomi had lived through great tragedy and still remained faithful to her God and Ruth had become a genuine believer in God. By not returning to her family and seeking remarriage, she was making a decision to permanently leave the pagan god’s of her tribal ancestors. Why did she do that? What was it about the God of Israel that made her want to commit her future into His welfare when all she could see ahead of her was poverty and misery? Well, the god of Moab was Chemosh and sacrificing children was part of the required ritual practices. Perhaps Ruth abhorred the thought as much as the God of Israel did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Then there’s the account of Rahab. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Rahab was a Canaanite prostitute who also placed her faith in Israel’s God and she risked her own life by hiding Joshua and his fellow spies. In her case, she confesses that it’s because she realizes that Israel worships the true God of all creation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Joshua 2:10-11 – Rahab said, “For we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea before you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed. When we heard it, our hearts melted and no courage remained in any man and longer because of you; for the Lord your God, He is God in heaven above and on earth beneath.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It’s possible that Rahab had more freedom to make this decision simply because she was a prostitute and considered unmarriageable in the eyes of her and other tribes. In the Ancient Near East,&amp;nbsp;no man would consider marrying a woman who was a prostitute. Prostitution may have been a last resort for her if she’d been divorced or widowed, but however she came to be a prostitute, Rahab was at the very bottom of her society and it’s doubtful anyone cared what happened to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It’s quite amazing really, that women in these pagan cultures who were at the bottom of the social structure – the ones most helpless, vulnerable and desperate were the ones who deliberately chose the God of Israel!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Over time, women did gain more freedom to work but independence and autonomy was not common; if women did work it was at the consent of their husbands or fathers and with considerable restrictions. Again, there were exceptions but mostly employment for women was still quite limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In the New Testament we see something similar in that there were many God-fearing Gentile women and they made up a considerable number of Paul’s first converts. The Roman’s ruled much of the known world and they had a philosophy of allowing their subjects to worship any god they chose as long as Caesar was also considered divine. So while family and tribal traditions remained, all Roman subjects were encouraged to tolerate and even accommodate the religions of others. Women had more freedom to learn about other religious worship along with their husbands because survival under the Romans was more important to most people that fidelity to tribal deities; the only people who refused to accept the belief that all manner of gods and goddesses were legitimate and worthy of acceptance was the Jews and the Christians who actually believed in the same God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Despite the spread of so many different gods and religious belief systems, women in the ancient culture were still at the bottom of the social structure and still expected to serve men without question and in many ways, without redress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;So what was it about the God of Israel that was so attractive to women either before Yeshua came or after?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Under God’s law, the penalty for many crimes resulted in very serious consequences, but those consequences were accounted to whoever was guilty of the crime be they male or female. If a woman was found guilty of adultery, she and the man would be held accountable. You can’t commit adultery by yourself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If someone was murdered, the murderer would be held accountable regardless of whether they were male or female.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Men and women were created in the image and likeness of God and they were created equal. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Gen 1:27, 5:1-2)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Women play prominent roles in many Biblical accounts, we’ve looked at Ruth and Rahab, but Deborah was a very important and wise leader of her people. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Judges 4)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Wives are seen as venerated partners and cherished companions of their husbands, not merely slaves or property for him to treat as he chooses. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Gen 2:20-24, Prov 19:14; Ecc 9:9)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; When God gave His commandments to His people on Mt Sinai, He commanded that children were to honour both their mother and their father…not just their father! &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Exo 20:12)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God designed and ordained women the unique and invaluable role of bearing and nurturing children…is there a greater responsibility in all the world? But women have also been created physically weaker and more vulnerable than men and in need of support and protection, not because they’re weak and pathetic, but because they’re created for a crucial role and in fulfilling that role they themselves need love and care. Peter commanded men to give their wives understanding, to honour them and realise that they’re physically weaker than they are but are equal to them in the eyes of God who saves them both. In fact, Peter finishes his warning to husbands by saying that if they don’t protect and honour their wives God won’t even hear their prayers! &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(1 Pet 3:7)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Paul taught the husbands in the Ephesian church that they were to sacrificially love their wives and then he expounded that meaning by comparing the love of each husband to be the same as the love of Christ for the Church and gave His very life for her. Husbands are to love their wives to the same extent. Wives are commanded to submit to their husbands but are never commanded to give their lives for them! &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Eph 5:25-31)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Women became quite prominent in the New Covenant era and they are mentioned in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Gospels, Acts, Romans and 2 Timothy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Women like Tabitha (Dorcas), Lydia, Priscilla, Mary, Martha, Rhoda, Samaritan woman, Philip the evangelists daughter, Pheobe, Lois and Eunice. All these women are mentioned in respectful and honouring ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It was because of the Bible that Jews historically opposed prostitution and of course, Christianity also opposed prostitution and that meant women who converted out of paganism to faith in Yeshua were no longer in danger of being made temple prostitutes in pagan religions. Because Christianity teaches that women are on equal standing with God and are joint heirs with the Messiah, women became instantly elevated in society and within the family and church structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yes, there is a hierarchy within the church and the family; God has ordained that men are to be the leaders within both the physical and human family as well as the body of Christ and the local church; but every organisation on the planet operates with a hierarchy…school, government, business, banking facilities, sports clubs, social clubs, missions and ministries…hierarchy is normal and healthy and within the spiritual structure that Christians operate in, God has ordained that men hold to senior leadership positions. It’s not something to be angry about, it’s God’s prerogative to structure His people, His church, His way. Women are not inferior or less because of this structure, it’s just the way God has ordained it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If you look around the world today, you can see women abused and subjected as much if not more than even in ancient cultures. Women are demeaned through pornography, prostitution, sex slave trafficking, servitude in some countries of the Middle East. Western society demeans motherhood, likening it to slavery to both men and children which is a lie, and women have been deceived into believing that being a wife and mother is the lowest of all goals but as a wife and mother myself, I consider the role of wife and mother the highest of all callings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Another thing that only those who believe in the God of the Bible enjoyed and were blessed by was Shabbat…the Sabbath. Having a day off each week for rest and recuperation wasn’t just enjoyed by men, it was for women as well; in many cultures around the world today women never get a break, they’re simply there to serve the needs and wants of others, but our God recognises the need for all His children to get rest and time to spend with each other and Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both Old and New Covenant culture, women were loved, needed, respected, honoured and treasured and are equally blessed by God for salvation and ministry even though the roles and offices differ. &amp;nbsp;In this, the Biblical Judeo Christian faith is different from every other religion and belief system in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

I'm going to get up and go back to my father and say to him, &quot;Father, I have sinned against Heaven and against you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son; treat me like one of your hired workers.&quot; So he got up and started back to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was moved with pity. He ran and threw his arms around him and kissed him warmly. His son said to him, `Father, I have sinned against Heaven and against you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son but his father said to his slaves, “Quick, bring out a robe, the best one, and put it on him; and put a ring on his finger and shoes on his feet and bring the calf that has been fattened up, and kill it. Let's eat and have a celebration! For this son of mine was dead, but now he's alive again! He was lost, but now he has been found!' And they began celebrating. (CJB)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Mr. Spock of Star Trek fame has been a huge favourite for decades and many thought his philosophy was brilliant. He’d purged all emotions from his psyche in order to live only by cool-headed reason. No anger, sorrow or fear filled his thoughts which allowed him to be perfectly rational at all times. Of course he was missing emotions like empathy, joy, and love but how could he be wrong when he could calculate every potential outcome to the fifth decimal place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The truth is however that Mr Spock’s creators had inadvertently followed the idea in classic Greek philosophy; the pointy-eared Vulcan hero was simply following the Stoic ideal of&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;apatheia—seeking virtue by rejecting all passions, by becoming indifferent to pain or pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Many Greco-Roman philosophers also saw emotions as fleshly and evil, uncontrollable and opposed to reason. In their minds, the supreme God could not be so weak as to express emotion. God must be&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;impassible and impervious to passions like anger and sorrow, unaffected by the misery of the human condition. Aristotle’s god was the “prime mover,” but he himself was unmoved—he was pure thought and devoid of all feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The idea that emotions are irrational and unnatural arose from Greco-Roman philosophy and has influenced Western theology for thousands of years. We modern folk find God’s passions in the Old Testament a bit irrational and embarrassing, even extreme and out of control. But what if we looked at Israel’s God from a Middle Eastern perspective, which embraces His emotional reality?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Ken Bailey has discovered a wealth of insight on the parables, especially the Prodigal Son, from his study of traditional cultures of the Middle East. Throughout his travels, he’s asked his Middle Eastern subjects one question hundreds of times: “Have you ever known a son to come to his father and demand his inheritance?” The answer is always the same: it would be unthinkable. It would be an unspeakable outrage and a gross insult to one’s father and family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Bailey tells the story of one pastor whose parishioner who came to him in great anguish, exclaiming, “My son wants me to die!” The man’s son had broached the question of his inheritance. In that culture, the son’s inquiry expressed a wish for his father’s demise. The elderly man was in good health, but three months later he passed away. His wife lamented, “He died that night!” referring to the night his son asked him about his inheritance. The offense was so great that in a sense, the man died the very night his son had spoken to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Bailey’s insights on the parable of the Prodigal Son reveal a basic error in how Western Christians understand sin and God’s response. We see sin as the breaking of arbitrary rules, like accruing parking violations and speeding tickets in a heavenly court system. If we put our faith in Christ, His atoning sacrifice will pay the fine. In this scenario, God is a callous, uncaring judge – almost cold and distant and unknowable, whose concern is that the law be upheld and the penalty paid in full. This is true to a degree, but this is nowhere near a complete picture of the Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The portrayal of sin in Jesus’ parable is that of a broken relationship, a personal offense against a loving Father. The son’s actions would have been profoundly hurtful to his family as he cashed in their property for his own gain. Sin does not just “break the rules” and annoy a strict policeman; it is a direct, personal rejection of our loving heavenly Father, who cares for us deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anger in Tension with Love&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The wounded anger of a deserted father is a far cry from the aloof judgment that many of us mistakenly see in the God of the Old Covenant. Rather than God being distant and unfeeling, a more Biblical understanding is that God’s anger at sin exists&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;in tension&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;with His overwhelming love. The same passionate concern for humanity that causes God’s anger is also the source of His tenacious, everlasting love that bursts out in joy when His children finally come home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In fact, all of the prophets express God’s anguish when His children abandon Him, and how He restrains His wrath at sin out of His&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;‘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ourrabbijesus.com/2012/05/02/hesed-enduring-eternal-undeserved-love/&quot; title=&quot;Hesed: Enduring, Eternal, Undeserved Love&quot;&gt;hesed’,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;His mercy and loving kindness – His overwhelming, boundless love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This is the Old Covenant God’s answer to our angry question, “How can You be so indifferent to the evil in the world?” Our accusations are actually against the impassible (incapable of suffering or feeling pain) God that we’ve conjured up out of our own imagination!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The real God is just the opposite, because indifference to evil is in itself&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;evil. Rabbi Abraham Heschel wrote,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;“There is an evil which most of us condone and are even guilty of: indifference to evil. We remain neutral, impartial, and not easily moved by the wrongs done unto other people. All prophecy is one great exclamation; God is not indifferent to evil! He is always concerned, He is personally affected by what man does to man…This is one of the meanings of the anger of God: the end of indifference!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Man’s sense of injustice is a poor analogy to God’s sense of injustice. The exploitation of the poor is to us a misdemeanor, to God it is a disaster. Our reaction is disapproval; God’s reaction is something no language can convey. Is it a sign of cruelty that God’s anger is aroused when the rights of the poor are violated, when widows and orphans are oppressed?”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If God is not wounded by His people’s suffering or angered at their cruelty toward each other, He would be a God who cannot love. Theologian Jürgen Moltmann says this in his book&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;The Crucified God,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;“A God who cannot suffer is poorer than any human. For a God who is incapable of suffering is a being who cannot be involved. Suffering and injustice do not affect Him. And because He is so completely insensitive, He cannot be affected or shaken by anything. He cannot weep, for He has no tears. But the one who cannot suffer cannot love either. So He is also a loveless being.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God’s powerful emotions made perfect sense in a society where passions were embraced, where tears of mourning and songs of joy were a normal part of life. The Greek rejection of emotions arose out of an intellectual pride that was willing to sacrifice one’s full humanity for the sake of being in constant control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God is&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;not&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;indifferent or disinterested—He’s like an Middle Eastern father who is crushed by his son’s apparent lack of love. God is like a mother bear who roars a warning if you get too close to her cubs. God is like a jilted lover who’s beside himself when he spots his true-love on another man’s arm. Israel’s God is not less emotional than we are, He is even&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;more so. Unlike us however, He doesn’t allow His actions and motivations be governed by His emotions. This is something we do because we’re operating out of a fallen nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;A God Who is Grieved by Evil&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If you’re looking for God’s unflinching judgment, the place you’d most expect to find it is at the time of Noah. You’d expect to find God nearly exploding with fury at the wicked deeds of humanity, when humankind had filled the world with violence, when &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;“every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil all the time” (Genesis 6:5).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;But instead of wrath, the Bible says that God was&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;grieved, that God’s heart was full of pain. A murderous gangrene had infected His precious children, causing them to destroy themselves and each other. God’s anguish was so great that He even regretted making humankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In Hebrew there’s a connection between God’s pain and that of fallen humanity. Because of Eve’s sin, her sorrow (etzev,&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;ET-tsev) in bearing children will multiply, and Adam will labor in sorrow (etzev) to make the earth produce food. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Genesis 3:16-19)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; This is the same word that describes God’s sorrow when His heart is “grieved” in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Genesis 6:5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Like Eve, God’s precious children would now fill His heart with pain; and like Adam, His beautiful earth would now be cursed by human bloodshed. Adam and Eve’s sorrows were a small taste of the pain God Himself felt at His broken world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Our world today is still filled with violence—we’re no different than the generation that made God regret He had created us. When you consider the mass graves of the genocides of this past century, you realize that humans really are capable of evil&amp;nbsp;beyond the limits of the imagination. Yet, after the flood God promised, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;“Never again will I curse the ground because of man, even though every inclination of his heart is evil from childhood. And never again will I destroy all living creatures, as I have done” (Genesis 8:21).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Why was God’s response to evil different than before?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Here, in the Scripture’s first pages, is it possible to see God’s answer to that classic question, “If God is good and all powerful, why doesn’t He destroy evil?” In the flood epic, God revealed what His righteous response to human evil would be—universal judgment. God bears with corrupt humanity because the alternative is the death of every sinner on earth. The fact that a good God does not destroy evil is&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;not&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;because He’s impotent—it’s because He’s merciful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;God’s Costly Covenant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We discover God’s mercy in His very next words, when He makes a covenant in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Genesis 9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. In this very first covenant He ever made with humankind, He committed Himself to find another answer to sin rather than just to destroy sinners. In embryonic form, this covenant points toward the coming of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;For God, this decision had an enormous price. Walter Brueggemann explains, &lt;i&gt;“God resolves that He will stay with, endure, and sustain His world, notwithstanding the sorry state of humankind… It is now clear that such a commitment on God’s part is costly. The God-world relation is not simply that of strong God and needy world. Now it is a tortured relation between a grieved God and a resistant world… This is a key insight of the Gospel against every notion that God stands outside of the hurt as a judge.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Terrence Fretheim also notes, &lt;i&gt;“Given God’s decision to bear with the creation in all of its wickedness, this means for God a continuing grieving of the heart. Thus the promise to Noah and all flesh in Gen. 9:8-17 necessitates&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;divine suffering. By deciding to endure a wicked world, while continuing to open up the heart to that world, means that God has decided to take personal suffering upon God’s own self.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God opts to suffer alongside His people because He loves them in spite of their sinfulness. From the moment He made that decision, we see the passionate love that ultimately led to the cross, to bring His prodigal children back to Him. And we see His overwhelming joy when a single sinner repents and turns homeward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The more you see God’s heart, the more you see the character of Christ from the very first pages of Genesis. Our dual images of God in the Covenants start to merge together when we see that the suffering of Christ began in His Father’s heart at the dawn of creation, when we see God our Father bearing the cross for our sins. It’s only when we focus the two images into one that we gain spiritual “depth perception” and begin to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

15600,Home Group - The Wisdom Of Hebrew Words,"&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;The Wisdom Of Hebrew Words&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Hebrew words of the Bible are incredibly rich not only because of their history but also because of their meaning. Like all languages, words have meaning and are used to communicate; the Hebrew alphabet has a fascinating history and progression, originally the Hebrew characters were symbols and over the centuries they’ve changed form until they’ve resulted in the Hebrew alphabet that was used for the writing down of the Hebrew Scriptures. Modern Hebrew is only slightly varied from the ancient Hebrew which is attested by modern Hebrew speakers who can read the ancient manuscripts without an inordinate amount of difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;One of the exciting facets of Hebrew for a Bible student is the gaining of deepened understanding of the Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;A few months ago Steve Monro and I looked quite deeply at the meaning of Shema which is mostly translated to mean ‘hear’ which is true, but shema is also the same verb used to mean ‘obey.’ When you look at the phrase in &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Deut 6:4-5 that says ‘Hear O Israel, the Lord is God, the Lord is One. You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might,’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; God is not simply calling His people to ‘listen’ with their ears to hear Him speak to them, He is saying “listen to what I’m telling you and obey Me”. ‘Hear’ means ‘obey.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It’s like when you’re trying to explain something to a child and they just won’t give you their attention, so you hold them by the shoulders and look straight into their eyes and say, “Will you please listen to me!!!” – what you’re communicating to the child is for them to stop being distracted, give you their full attention and listen to your instructions because you expect them to obey you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Now the NC Scriptures were written in Greek so the Word of God could be easily assimilated throughout the known world which predominantly spoke Greek, but when you consider Jesus’ words to the seven churches in &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Revelation 2 &amp;amp; 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; where He said, &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;“He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches,”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; you realise that His intention was to call those churches to heed what He said to them and obey Him. He didn’t want them to simply hear a message of encouragement, He wanted them to act on His words be they words of rebuke and correction or words of encouragement and approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If we hear the words ‘remembering’ or ‘knowing’ we tend to think of an exercise of the mind, but the Hebrew verbs for “remembering” and “knowing” have something in common in that they encompass physical actions too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;the book &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ourrabbijesus.com/books/next-book-walking-in-the-dust-of-rabbi-jesus/&quot; title=&quot;Walking in the Dust of Rabbi Jesus&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: windowtext;&quot;&gt;Walking in the Dust of Rabbi Jesus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Lois Tverberg explains it well. She says that many verbs in Hebrew that we think of as only mental activities often encompass their expected physical result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;To “remember” can mean “to act on someone’s behalf.” For example, in &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Genesis 8:1 it says that “God remembered Noah, every living thing and all the livestock with him in the ark; so God caused a wind to pass over the earth and the water began to go down.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; God didn’t just wake up one morning and suddenly recall that an ark was out bobbing around somewhere. He “remembered” Noah by coming to his rescue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;To “know” another person is to have a relationship with them, to care about them, even to be intimate with them. When Adam “knew” Eve, she conceived Cain so in this instance, the word ‘knew’ is talking about the physical union between Adam and his wife Eve. &amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Genesis 4:1)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Hebrew verbs stress action and effect, rather than just mental activity but this isn’t only unique to Hebrew. Lorrie Anderson is a New Covenant translator in Peru who searched for months to find a word for “believe” in the Candoshi language because there was no direct equivalent that existed in Candoshi for that all-important term in Bible translation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What she finally discovered was that the word “hear” in Candoshi also means “believe” and “obey.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Lorrie Anderson said that the question, “Don’t you hear His Word?” in Candoshi means “Don’t you believe-obey His Word?” In their way of thinking, if you “hear” you believe what you hear, and if you believe, you obey. These are not separate ideas in Candoshi and Hebrew as they are in English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;She and other Bible translators have shared the same observation. They often struggle to find words for mental activities that we see as all-important, but simply don’t exist in indigenous languages where thought is tied explicitly to an expected physical or practical outcome or action of obedience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This is why it’s so incredibly important for believers in the west to dig into the Hebrew words, Hebrew culture and context so that the intended meaning and intention of the words can be understood correctly and then acted upon according to the original expection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It’s our Western perspective that blocks our understanding. Many of our Greek cultural ancestors, like Plato, considered the mental world all-important and physical reality as worthless. As a result, our culture tends to exalt our intellect as critical and discount our actions as insignificant. Some of us even see actions as “dead works” that are irrelevant and maybe even opposed to faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The logic of Hebrew realizes that an action should result from what is in our minds. If you &lt;i&gt;“remember”&lt;/i&gt; someone, you will act on their behalf. If you &lt;i&gt;“hear”&lt;/i&gt; someone, you will obey their words. If you &lt;i&gt;“know”&lt;/i&gt; someone, you will have a close and maybe even an intimate relationship with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hebrew realizes that the longest twelve inches that your faith has to move is from your head to your heart and once your faith makes that move, it naturally comes out through your hands and feet.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;How many times have we battled over the ‘faith vs works’ debate? In many ways, we’ve become so fearful that doing any kind of work is evidence that we’ve fallen under the law and away from faith. But James said that &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;‘Faith by itself, unaccompanied by actions, is dead. But someone will say that you have faith and I have actions. Show me this faith of yours without actions, and I will show you my faith BY my actions.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;I remember having a chat with an orthodox Rabbi in his little shop in the Jewish quarter of Jerusalem, we always call in to see him when we’re there, he has some of the most beautiful Scripture and Biblical artworks, and he is very open to talking and studying the Bible with Christians. He knows the NC – chapter and verse – better than the overwhelming majority of Christians, and he shared with me about how confusing he finds Paul who constantly championed ‘faith’ not works despite the fact that he himself was constantly doing things to serve God and the church body; and how much he (and other curious Jews) love James because James explains the importance of a practical outworking of faith. If there is no practical outworking of faith, then there probably isn’t any faith there at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Rabbi understood what Paul meant when he said saved by faith not by works, but couldn’t comprehend how anyone who claims faith in God can remain work-less. How can anyone looking on know of a person’s faith if there are no actions to go with it? A practical and physical response to faith in God has been the primary foundation of Judaism throughout the centuries…unfortunately an over-emphasis on works to be sure - but for the Jew, belief and trust in God is synonymous with obedient action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Now Judaism today is nothing like the Judaism given to Moses who then taught it to his people and by Yeshua’s day, Judaism had become bloated and top heavy with corrupted legalism and a myriad of man-made traditions which were and are still wrong. It’s even more-so today because without a Temple and the sacrificial system, there’s no way for religious Jew to obey the commands laid out so Judaism adapted and came up with a temple-less, sacrifice-less system works-righteousness system. So I am not endorsing Judaism at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;My emphasis is about our faith being practical and physical as much as it is spiritual. The Greek/Western mind thinks intellectually, analytically and philosophically while the Hebrew/Eastern mind thinks literally, practically, physically while at the same time stretching and expanding the intellect. Information and knowledge is gained for the purpose of living and serving and obeying not merely to become more knowledgeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;An example would be some of the different educational institutions in Australia; some courses in some institutions provide the student with an incredible amount of knowledge and information and some institutions are competency based. In other words, some courses indicate that by the end of the course the student will know all they need to know about a particular subject and will have particular degrees at the conclusion; where as other institutions indicate that the student will have knowledge of a subject and will be able to perform x, y, z tasks by the end of the course. In other words, they’ll have been taught practical hands-on skills to accompany their knowledge rather than just obtaining knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Hebrew words in our Bible are packed with depth and richness not just to provide us with knowledge and information but with a call to practical living, service and worship of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

15599,Home Group - Does God Really Want Us To Fear Him?,"&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Does God Really Want Us To Fear Him?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The word “fear” is common in the Old Covenant, and to many it sounds like we should cringe in dread of God’s presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Of course, we also find “fear” in the New Covenant too. The Gentiles who believed in God were called God-fearers, and the early church was said to be built up in the “fear of the Lord” &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Acts 9:31)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Why is there so much fear in the Bible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The key to solving this mystery is to know more about the Hebrew word that we translate as “fear.” Like many words in Hebrew, it has a much broader range of meaning than we have in English. To us, “fear” is the opposite of trust, and its synonyms are fright, dread and terror. But the Hebrew equivalent,&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;yirah&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;(YEER-ah)&lt;/i&gt; encompasses a wide range of meanings from negative (dread, terror) to positive (worship, reverence) and from mild (respect) to strong (awe).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;You may be surprised – every time you read “revere” or “reverence” in English it comes from the Hebrew word&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;yirah&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp;In &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Leviticus 19:3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, we are told to “fear/respect/revere” our mother and father using this same word and in this instance &lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;yirah&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;refers to showing them respect or reverence, not being afraid of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;An even stronger word for “fear,”&amp;nbsp;is &lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;pahad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which is often translated “dread” that can also describe jaw-dropping awe. In fact pahad means to tremble, revere, be in awe…imagine — “fear” describing spine-tingling amazement at what God has done to bless His people as is the case in Jeremiah 33:9, &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;‘Then the name of this city will bring me joy, praise and glory before all the nations of the earth that hear about all the good I am doing for them; they will be &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;OVERCOME WITH FEAR AND TREMBLING&lt;/span&gt; at all the good and peace I am securing for it.’ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Have you ever experienced what it’s like to be ‘overcome with fear and trembling’?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;How Should We “Fear the Lord”?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Often Christians interpret “the Fear of the LORD” as the fear of the punishment that God could give us for our deeds. Certainly, we will all stand before God’s judgment seat when we die. But if you know that Christ has paid for your sins, you should not have this kind of fear anymore. This is what John preaches against when he says, &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;‘There is no fear in love. On the contrary, love that has achieved its goal gets rid of fear, because fear has to do with punishment; the person who keeps fearing has not been brought to maturity in regard to love.’ 1 John 4:18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The rabbis often spoke of the “fear of the Lord” —&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yirat Adonai&lt;/i&gt;— but they always thought of it in terms of the most positive sense of the word&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;yirah&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. They defined it as&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;awe and reverence for God that motivates us to do His will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;They pointed out that fearing God’s punishment is actually an inferior understanding, because at its core it is self-centered. It doesn’t even focus on God but rather looks at God only through the lens of our own interests, by asking what will happen to &lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;us &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;because of God’s knowledge of our deeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If you have&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;yirat Adonai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; - awe and reverence for God - it fills you with a better kind of fear. An example of this kind of ‘fear’ might be that you work in a mega-corporation and one day you’re promoted to work directly under the CEO. Wouldn’t you tremble and be incredibly nervous as you report for your first assignment? When you have great respect for someone, you feel terrible knowing you’ve disappointed them and when you love another person deeply, you earnestly want their approval. How much more should this be true of how we feel and relate to God!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Understanding&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yirat Adonai&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;through a Hebrew lens shows why the “fear of the Lord” is so highly praised in the Bible:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Proverbs 9:10 says, ‘The fear of ADONAI is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of Holy One is understanding.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Proverbs 14:26-27 says, ‘In the fear of ADONAI is powerful security; for His children there will be a place of refuge. The fear of ADONAI is a fountain of life enabling one to avoid deadly traps.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The “fear of the Lord” in these passages is an awe-filled love of God that allows us to grow in intimate knowledge of Him. It teaches us how to live, and reassures us of God’s power and guidance. It gives us a reverence of His will that keeps us from getting caught in sins that will destroy our relationships and lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;A Sense of God’s Presence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;One aspect of&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yirat Adonai&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;is the idea that we should be constantly aware of the presence of God. You see a reminder of this in many synagogues. Over the ornate cabinets (ark) that hold the Torah scrolls is the phrase&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Know Before Whom You Stand&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;This means to realize that an infinitely powerful God is always close at hand. Wow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We all love to have those emotional experiences where we ‘feel the presence of God’, but the reality is that most of the time we don’t ‘feel’ anything. Does that mean that the presence of God is not longer with us? Of course not, our God has promised to never leave us or forsake us. &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Psalm 139 ask the question, “Where can I go to escape your Spirit? Where can I flee from Your PRESENCE?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The entire psalm then gives itself to explain that there is nowhere in all of God’s creation that we can flee or hide from His presence. He is always with us…our ‘feelings’ have absolutely nothing to do with it. If that’s the case, shouldn’t we live in a state of reverential awe and respect toward Him in all that we do? Shouldn’t that affect the decisions we make regarding where we go, what we do and who we do it with?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The phrase &lt;b&gt;‘Know Before Whom You Stand’&lt;/b&gt; takes on a whole new significance when you realise that every second of ever day we are standing before the God of the Universe!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Jewish thinkers point out that study of the Scriptures must always be done with&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Yirat Adonai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Academic education in Biblical studies tends to be entirely intellectual, and Christians often find it dry. What they are looking for is God’s voice speaking through the Scriptures, and to find it they need&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yirat Adonai&lt;/i&gt;. There is an enormous difference between study of the Bible that is done out of&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yirat Adonai&lt;/i&gt;, reverence for God, and a purely intellectual approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;A classic rabbinic saying is that a scholar who does not have&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yirat Adonai&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;“is like a man who owns a treasure chest and has the inner keys but not the outer keys.” 2Rich wealth is right in His hands, but he can’t get at it. To study the Bible without reverence is a dry enterprise that will never unlock its true meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Our Moral Foundation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Another thing that&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yirat Adonai&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;gives us is an inner moral foundation. When you know that God knows your thoughts, you are compelled to act not just for what other people think, but for what God thinks. This was what Paul meant in &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Colossians 3:22 when he said, ‘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Slaves, obey your human masters in everything, not serving only when they are watching you, to win their favor, but single-heartedly, fearing the Lord.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Reverence of God gives us an inward sincerity because we don’t do things just for appearances, but to please God who knows our heart and sees all we do even when others don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;A humorous story illustrates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;A great rabbi once caught a ride on a horse-drawn wagon, and as the wagon passed a field full of ripe produce, the driver stopped and said, “I’m going to get us some vegetables from that field. Call out if you see anyone coming.” As the driver was picking vegetables, the rabbi cried out, “We’re seen! We’re seen!” The frightened man ran back to the wagon, and looked and saw no one nearby. He said, “Why did you call out like that when there was nobody watching?” The rabbi pointed toward heaven and said, “God is watching! God is&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;always&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;watching.”&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;An awareness of God’s presence will motivate us to obey Him. You may still think of this as a fear of punishment, but it doesn’t have to be that way. Indeed, the “fear of the Lord” should really be a sense of Christ’s majesty that gives you an earnest longing to please Him. When you know He is always with you, it causes you to try to live as the disciple He wants you to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: red;&quot;&gt;Proverbs 18:20-21, ‘With the fruit of a man’s mouth his stomach will be satisfied; He will be satisfied with the product of his lips. Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it will eat its fruit.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macarthur Study Bible notes explain these verses like this, – &lt;i&gt;“The consequences of one’s words should produce satisfaction and fulfillment and the greatest good and the greatest harm are in the power of the tongue.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ugly words seem to be just the norm these days, look at how people speak in general conversation…foul language is accepted as the norm; criticism and even the foulest descriptions and accusations are leveled at those in the highest political offices of our nation as well as our security and law enforcement agencies. Our entertainment industry is jam-packed with obscenities and gossip and tale-bearing is celebrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;James 3:5-8, ‘So also the tongue is a small part of the body and yet it boasts of great things. See how great a forest is set aflame by such a small fire! And the tongue is a fire, the very world of iniquity; the tongue is set among our members as that which defiles the entire body, and sets on fire the course of our life, and is set on fire by hell. For every species of beasts and birds, of reptiles and creatures of the sea, is tamed and has been tamed by the human race. But no one can tame the tongue; it is a restless evil and full of deadly poison.’ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Wouldn’t it be nice to be able to leave a room knowing that no one will say anything unkind about you? Or to not need to worry that a co-worker’s coolness is because she got wind of your comments about her over lunch last week?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We can preserve a friend’s marriage with our wise counsel. Or we can shred the self-worth of a child with criticism, or incinerate a friendship with gossip. We all fail daily at being consistently Christ-like in what comes out of our lips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Is there any way to improve what comes out of our mouths?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;La’shon Hara –&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;An Evil Tongue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We all can see the wrongness of slander—telling lies about others. But believe it or not, we can also do great damage to others without lying. In Jewish thought,&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;lashon hara&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;(la-SHON ha-RAH – having an “evil tongue”) doesn’t just include telling lies about others. In fact, this phrase is more commonly used to describe the practice of telling negative&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;truths&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;about others that are unnecessary and damaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;La’shon hara&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;is recounting to your co-workers about how the boss messed up his presentation. It’s pointing out to your wife how poorly the worship leader sings. It’s complaining to your sister that your husband forgot your birthday&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;yet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;again&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Any sentence that starts with “She’s a great person, but it’s annoying when she…” is always going to end in&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;la’shon hara – an evil tongue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This habit tears down friendships, demeans others, and undermines trust. There are, of course, a few times when a person needs to relay damaging information, but outside of that, this kind of negativity is frowned upon in Jewish law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We often justify our words with, “Well…I didn’t say anything untrue!” But the Golden Rule states that you shouldn’t do to others what you wouldn’t want done to you. If you’d be hurt and embarrassed by having your own flaws revealed, you shouldn’t share those of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Sharing negative information is generally only permitted in situations where people may be adversely affected if they make a decision without it. For instance, if a friend is considering going into business with someone you know is dishonest, you should tell the friend. But even then, you should share only facts you know and not unfounded hearsay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jewish Wisdom About Our Tongues&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Jewish teachers for thousands of years focused on the promise in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Psalm 34:12-13 that says, ‘Which of you takes pleasure in living? Who wants a long life to see good things? If you do, keep your tongue from evil and your lips from deceiving talk.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Why do we gossip about others? One major reason for&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 9pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: #d1dee1;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 9pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;la’shon hara&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 9pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: #d1dee1;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;is our desire to elevate ourselves by tearing others down. Paul has a solution to this problem: &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;“Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves. Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others.” (Philippians 2:3-4)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; If we genuinely care as much about others as ourselves, we will try to protect their reputations as much as we do our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 36pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;A story is told of a habitual gossip who finally decided to repent of his sin. He knocked on the door of the village rabbi and asked, “Is there something I can do to make amends?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify; text-indent: 36pt;&quot;&gt;The rabbi stroked his beard and replied, “Go home and come back with a pillow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 36pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Relieved, the man soon completed the odd errand. Would such a simple gift be all that was needed to atone for this sin?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify; text-indent: 36pt;&quot;&gt;When he returned, the rabbi continued. “Now, slice it open.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 36pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It was a windy day, and the breeze picked up the feathers, wafting them over the housetops and into the fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify; text-indent: 36pt;&quot;&gt;“Now, go gather all of the feathers again and put them back in the pillow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify; text-indent: 36pt;&quot;&gt;“But that’s impossible!” exclaimed the man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify; text-indent: 36pt;&quot;&gt;“In the same way, it’s impossible to repair all the damage that your words have done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yeshua said in Luke 6:45, ‘The good person produces good things from the store of good in his heart, while the evil person produces evil things from the store of evil in his heart. For his mouth speaks what overflows from his heart.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In other words, if you have an evil tongue, you have an evil heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;As believer’s in Yeshua it’s our responsibility to guard our mouths – to have a kosher mouth so that what comes out of it builds up, encourages and graces both others and ourselves, to be otherwise disgraces and maligns our Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

15596,Home Group - Judging Righteously,"&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Judging Righteously&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Luke 6:35-38, ‘But love your enemies and do good and lend, expecting nothing in return; and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High; for He Himself is kind to ungrateful and evil men. Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful. Do not judge and you will not be judged; and do not condemn, and you will not be condemned; pardon, and you will be pardoned. Give, and it will be given to you. They will pour into your lap a good measure – pressed down, shaken together, and running over. For by your standard of measure it will be measured to you in return.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The subject of righteous judging has been very misunderstood, mistaught and mishandled throughout church history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There are various kinds of judgment in the Bible and they are –&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Judgment of false or aberrant teaching and teachers as well as false prophets and prophecies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Judgment of the eternal destination of either heaven or hell for individuals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divine judgment on a nation or people for their unrepentant sin and wickedness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bema Seat judgment by God of believer’s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great White Throne judgment by God of unbeliever’s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Then there’s general day to day judgment that human beings engage in without even realising they’re doing it and this is the kind of judgment we’re going to look at this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In about 120 BC, Yehoshua ben Perachia, one of the earliest Rabbinic sages said, “Judge each person with the scales weighted in their favour.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Have you ever seen old fashioned scales? Two bowls or plates hanging from a bar that is balanced on a stand; a market shopkeeper would measure out his goods onto one side and then one by one add weights to the other side to measure them out accurately so that the customer could see how much he was buying and how much it would cost. A friendly shopkeeper would add a little extra for the customer balancing the scales in the customers favour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yeshua would have been well aware of the teaching of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Perachia, to judge each person with the scales weighted in their favour so when He said, &lt;i&gt;“give and it will be given to you, they will pour into your lap a good measure – pressed down, shaken together and running over. For by your standard of measure it will be measured to you in return,”&lt;/i&gt; He wasn’t actually talking about giving money or possessions just so you could get more, the entire preceding is talking about suffering persecution and ill treatment for being a believer, this verse is talking about living a daily life that is non-judgmental, non-critical and non-selfish. It’s talking about living a daily life that is gracious and generous and merciful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;By having a generous and giving attitude to everyone we encounter – especially those who are hostile – what we ourselves need will be taken care of and those needs will be met by God because only God really knows the extent or measure of our generosity and forgiveness that we extend to others because only God knows what our inner motivations and intentions are. So the measurement we are to receive can only come from God Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There is a Jewish parable about a farmer and his farmhand who on the day before the Day of Atonement went to the farmer to ask for his wages. The farmer said he had no money, so the farmhand asked for some of the crops but the farmer said he had none and finally the farmhand asked for some of the sheep he’d helped raise but the farmer again said he had none. The farm hand went home quite depressed and empty handed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;After the holiday was over, the farmer went to the farmhand’s home with all his wages and 3 carts of extra gifts. They had dinner together and the farmer asked the farmhand what was going through his mind when he didn’t get paid his wages and got no portion of the crops or herds as payment for all his work, the farmhand responded by saying he thought the farmer had spent all his money on a bargain of some kind, or that he’d leased all his fields to other landlords and that he’d dedicated all his animals to the Temple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What had actually happened was that the farmer was so upset that his son appeared to be rejecting God that he rashly dedicated all his possessions to God as part of his plea that God would right the situation. However, now that his vow was over he was free to bring the man his wages and he gave him extra for not being judgmental and hostile at the time. He said, “As for you, just as you have judged me favourably, may the Lord judge you favourably.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It’s a nice parable but how do we allow this to influence us so that we lose our habit of passing judgment on others all the time, even when we don’t realise we’re doing it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In Jewish culture there has been an emphasis of judging favourably for thousands of years and it might sound bizarre to us, but there is a group in Jerusalem who meet regularly to train themselves to judge favourably and they discuss perceived hurts and brainstorm together to find excuses for behaviour that on the surface appear to be unkind and thoughtless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;For example, if you get overlooked for an invitation to a wedding. Rather than being offended and judging others as inconsiderate and rude over the non-invitation, you judge in their favour – perhaps the family can’t afford many guests at the wedding or perhaps they thought an invitation had already been sent or perhaps there are family or health problems in the family that make having too many people at the wedding problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What if you’re walking down the road carrying a very heavy load and a family member or neighbour passes you in their car and they don’t stop to help you out? Don’t judge them and condemn them for being completely thoughtless and ignorant, judge in their favour – perhaps they’d just got some bad news and didn’t even notice you; perhaps they already had a full car and boot and had no room for you; perhaps they were on their way to pick someone else up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What if you get cut off in traffic and you almost have an accident? Perhaps the person who cut you off had a bit of a blind spot in their car and they didn’t see you; perhaps they just had a call that a loved one had been rushed to the hospital with a suspected heart attack and they were in a bit of a panic and hurry; perhaps they’re running really late because their car battery was flat and they’d had to wait for hours for road side assistance and not they’re really distracted and worried they might lose their job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;At first thought this sounds a little silly, but in reality, we make judgments against people all time without knowing their personal circumstances. They lady in front of us at the checkout may be a little slow, but she may also be sick or in the middle of a dreadful situation with her husband or family that is wiping her out emotionally and mentally and she’s finding it hard to concentrate or maybe she’s really happy because she just found out she’s expecting a baby and she’s daydreaming about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The car in front may be going really slow and you’re frustrated and can’t get passed them. Maybe they’re trying to find the home of a sick person and they’re unsure of the address. Maybe there’s a problem with their vehicle and they have no alternative but to go slow or maybe they have a sick child of pet in the back seat and going any faster might exacerbate their physical discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;How many times have we said or heard someone say, “Wouldn’t you have thought….?” We often have much higher expectations of others than we do of ourselves and in a general day to day situation we can and should represent our Saviour by extending patience and grace and compassion on everyone…those we like and those we don’t, both our friends and our perceived enemies, because by doing so we are demonstrating the nature and character of Christ who lavished mercy, forgiveness, grace, patience and generosity on us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Wouldn’t it be nice if we developed the automatic response of thinking the best of others rather than the worst?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This doesn’t mean that we ignore sin and make excuses for sin – not at all – but what it does mean is that if we recognise our own sinful state and the incredible measure of forgiveness given to us, we can be equally gracious and forgiving toward others but by calling sin exactly what it is while encouraging repentance and giving forgiveness, mercy and grace at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;We’re not better than the sinners of the world, we’re sinners who’ve been given amazing grace and undeserved forgiveness and this should mean that in our everyday lives we are extending that same forgiveness and amazing grace to everyone we come in contact with.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

14635,Home Group - Binding &amp; Loosing,"&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The history of Banias, also known as ‘The Gates of Hell’ (in the region of Caesarea Philippi), is steeped in pagan worship, particularly to the false god Pan who was the half man/half goat, flute playing false deity of the ancient Greeks. For approximately two hundred years prior to Christ, sacrifices were cast into the cave as offerings to Pan. At that time the main spring that emerged from the large cave had both animal and human sacrifices cast into the waters where they would be pulled down by the current into the earth never to rise again.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Pan was known to be a vicious, sexually deviant oppressive god who would instil fear in those he tormented causing them great panic and chaos...hence the name ‘Pan’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Before Pan worship, it's believed that this may be the possible site of pagan Canaanite worship which is referred to in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Joshua 11:16-17&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt;which says, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;'Thus Joshua took all that land: the hill country and all the Negev, all that land of Goshen, the lowland, the Arabah, the hill country of Israel and its lowland from Mount Halak, that rises toward Seir, even as far as Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon at the foot of Mount Hermon. And he captured all their kings and struck them down and put them to death.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Israel didn't maintain control of this region for all that long particularly after the fall of the Northern Kingdom, and during the inter-testament times numerous pagan and political influences shaped the area particularly the Greeks and Egyptians, but mostly the Greeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;So a great deal of bloodshed took place here and most significantly, a great deal of human sacrifice in the ancient cavern where human souls were dispatched and swallowed by the earth and thus it became known as 'the Gates of Hades' or 'the Gates of Hell'. The inference being, that once inside the clutches of hell, you are without hope; hell is too powerful and no one has ever escaped its clutches before.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This region had always been a hot spot for pagan worship and was for this reason a very ungodly and dangerous place to go, and yet, it was to these very places that Yeshua led His disciples for the express purpose of taking the Good News to the lost. Upon hearing the Good News, these people would never need to live in fear of their false gods or the clutches of hell ever again. So the history of this particular place – known by the inhabitants of Judea (Israel), was the setting Yeshua chose when He asks them a very important question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Matthew 16:13-20&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;'Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, He was asking His disciples, &quot;Who do people say that the Son of Man is?&quot; And they said, &quot;Some say John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; but still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.&quot; He said to them, &quot;But who do you say that I am?&quot; Simon Peter answered, &quot;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.&quot; And Jesus said to him, &quot;Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jona, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but My Father who is in heaven. I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church; and the gates of Hades will not overpower it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of Heaven; and whatever you bind on earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall have been loosed in heaven.&quot; Then He warned the disciples that they should tell no one that He was the Christ.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What did Jesus mean by the terms 'Binding and Loosing'?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What did Jesus mean by the phrase 'I will build My church'?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When interpreting Scripture there are three very important rules.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;1. Context&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;2. Context&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;3. Context&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The word to bind in the Greek means &lt;i&gt;‘to bind, put under obligation of the law, duty. To forbid, prohibit, declare to be illicit.’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The word to loose in the Greek means &lt;i&gt;‘laws, as having a binding force, to annul, subvert, to do away with, to deprive of authority whether by precept or act, to declare unlawful.’&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If we don't know the context of what is being said, we won't understand the intention and explicit meaning of the text. Do the words 'binding' and 'loosing' in the ancient Hebrew context mean what 'binding' and 'loosing' mean in our 21st century western context?&amp;nbsp;No they do not.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Here’s an excerpt from the book &lt;b&gt;'Yeshua: A Guide To The Real Jesus and the Original Church'&lt;/b&gt; by Dr Ron Moseley&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The second temple is an idiom found in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Matthew 16:19&lt;/b&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; where Jesus gives Peter the keys of the kingdom and says, &quot;Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.&quot; (NKJV) For years this text has been greatly misunderstood, causing much confusion throughout Christendom. In Judaism, however, it has long been understood to be a legal designation. During the days of Jesus, these antonyms were used to describe certain religious decisions: the term 'bind' meant to forbid, and 'loose', meant to permit. There are numerous examples of this in rabbinical literature.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;To understand this, we must know that first-century rabbis were constantly called upon by their communities to interpret Scriptural commands. For example, the Bible forbids working on the Sabbath but does not define what specific activities constitute work. As a result, the rabbis ruled as to which activities were permitted on the Sabbath and which were not. They bound or prohibited certain activities and loosed or allowed others. Peter was given the 'keys', or the authority, to bind and loose concerning Scriptural questions within the early church.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;An example of this practice can be found in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Acts 15&lt;/b&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; during the controversy over whether or not Gentiles should be admitted into the fellowship without first being circumcised. After the apostles and elders convened in Jerusalem, Peter showed an example of loosing when he ruled that both Jews and Gentiles were saved by faith, since circumcision was only a part of the Jewish covenant. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;(Acts 15:9)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Then James, the pastor of the church at Jerusalem, gave an example of binding when he required the believing Gentiles were to abstain from the four characteristic practices of the pagans. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;(Acts 15:13-20)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;So the words 'binding and loosing' are not talking about authority over the spirit realm, rather they are explicitly referring to the correct interpretation and application of Scripture.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Why was Jesus giving this authority to Peter and the disciples?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Because over the centuries, Judaism had twisted and corrupted Scripture to such a point that the people were incredibly 'bound' to obeying hundreds of specific man made introduced rules and regulations that were over and above the original edicts given by God to Moses, and the people were being crushed under the weight of it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Pharisees and Scribes and teachers of the law were interpreting the Scriptures wrongly and issuing religious edicts based on their wrong interpretations. Binding the people to this or that, and loosing them from others.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Matt 15:1-9&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;'Then some Pharisees and Scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem and said, &quot;Why do Your disciples break the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.&quot; And He answered and said to them, &quot;Why do you yourselves transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition? For God said, 'Honour your father and mother', and, 'He who speaks evil of father or mother is to be put to death.' But you say, 'Whoever says to his father or mother, &quot;Whatever I have that would help you has been given to God,&quot; he is not to honour his father or his mother.' And by this you invalidated the Word of God for the sake of your tradition. You hypocrites, rightly did Isaiah prophesy of you; 'This people honours Me with their lips, but their heart is far away from Me. But in vain do they worship Me, teaching as doctrines the precepts of men.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;John 14&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Yeshua tells His disciples that He will be leaving them soon but He would send the Holy Spirit after His departure and the Holy Spirit would help them remember all that He taught them while they were together.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;John 14:25-26&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;These things I have spoken to you while abiding with you. But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I said to you.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;So the Holy Spirit was going to teach them…not something new or unheard of before, but all that Yeshua had taught them while they were together. Why? Because what Jesus taught was absolutely correct and true and didn't in anyway contradict, contravene or undermine the Word of God; rather He taught the Word of God accurately and it was in stark contrast to the teachings of the religious leaders because they had corrupted it so badly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The job Yeshua gave His disciples was to interpret and teach the Scriptures accurately - 'binding' and 'loosing' according to what He had taught them while He was with them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This is what they did, and today we have the results of all their 'binding' and 'loosing' in the form of the written Scriptures and they are meant to be understood correctly and obeyed, not reinterpreted over and over again by all other believers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;2 Peter 1:20-21&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;'But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture is a matter of one's own interpretation, for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Greek word for 'interpretation' means loosening, unloosening. (epilysis)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This is talking about 'Scripture' not the 'prophecies' of men or women today. And it's saying that NO Scripture is of a private interpretation…it means exactly what the original man of God meant when he spoke by inspiration of God the Holy Spirit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Some would say that this verse is talking about ‘prophecy’ not general Scripture, but what is prophecy? It is none other than the declared Word of God, that includes both predictive and instructive Scripture. Yeshua told the religious leaders that the ‘Scriptures’ they studied all spoke of Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;John 5:39&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;“You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; it is these that testify about Me.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Therefore, if all the Scriptures testify to Messiah, they are therefore all prophecy...both predictive and instructive. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;All Scripture is prophecy.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Scripture is relevant to every single people group in every culture throughout every century. All men are sinful and under wrath and all men need the Gospel of Christ. It's absolutely relevant and we are not to alter or reinterpret Scripture. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When the Word of God is taught and interpreted correctly, the backing of Heaven itself stands as a testimony and witness to that truth and the fruit of a life lived in submission to the Word is demonstrated on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The teaching of spiritual warfare that has surrounded this passage began in the mid 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Century and before that had never been heard of throughout the church age. Teaching on spiritual warfare often points to Daniel and the struggle of Gabriel to reach him because of spiritual opposition. However, if we look at the particular prayer Daniel was praying we see something very interesting. First read &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Daniel chapter 9&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, at the beginning you see that he was reading the scroll of the prophet Jeremiah and that the captivity of Judah in Babylon was going to last for 70 years. He realised that the 70 years was almost complete and he set his heart to pray for his people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;At no time during Daniel’s prayer does he ever engage with entities in the spirit realm. He prays to God alone, and the subject matter of his prayer is that of remorse and sorrow for the sins of his own life and grief over the destruction of Jerusalem. Daniel is mortified that God’s great name has become a reproach to the people around them because of the sin and rebellion of the people of God. Daniel’s entire prayer can be summed up in the word ‘repentance.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;chapter 10&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, we read that Daniel had committed himself to a three week fast, a fast of great mourning where he didn’t eat food or drink wine, neither did he make use of any personal products to beautify himself...this may mean he didn’t use ‘aftershave’ or the equivalent of his day. If the prayer he prayed in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;chapter 9&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is anything to go by, we can get an understanding of the reason for his grief and motivation to fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;After the three weeks of fasting, Daniel is once again honoured by a visitation by an angel. The angel reveals to Daniel that he had been in a spiritual battle and had to call on the archangel Michael to assist him and it was this battle that had prevented the angel from arriving on the very first day Daniel began to fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It’s very clear that it wasn’t Daniel’s prayer or any engagement by Daniel with the ‘Prince of Persia’ that broke the spiritual stronghold. The battle in the spirit realm is God’s domain and He knows well enough how to engage it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We know the spirit realm is real, the prophet Elisha knew as well when he asked the Lord to open the eyes of his servant to see the horses and chariots of heaven all around them to protect them from their enemy. Not because Elisha engaged the spirit realm, rather because he understood that God ordered the spirit realm. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(2 Kings 6:14-17)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Take a look at Job. Why did God allow such tragedy to occur to a man as righteous and godly as Job? We learn that all Job endured was for our learning and benefit and that bad things and tragedy are not evidence that God hates us or is angry with us. But for the sake of this topic, read &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Job chapter 1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in its entirety and you will see that Satan is not allowed to do anything without God’s express permission and all that Satan did to Job was for great purpose. If Job had the authority to ‘bind’ Satan and stop his efforts and attacks, don’t you think he would have? Job understood that everything that unfolded in his life was from God alone and he accepted it as is seen in the last verse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Job 1:22&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;‘Through all this Job did not sin nor did he blame God.’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If the new view of spiritual warfare is correct, we should see evidence of godly men in the Scriptures engaging the spirit realm but this is not the case. Yes, we do see Yeshua and His disciples commanding evil spirits to leave those they possessed, but not once do we read of the kind of interaction that has become common place in many churches today. Yeshua and His disciples would simply tell the demons to ‘leave’, ‘come out’ or ‘go’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There is another passage that has added to the confusion surrounding the current teaching of spiritual warfare which is found in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Matthew 12&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; starting at &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;verse 22&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; where Yeshua delivers a demon possessed man who was both blind and mute. The man, once delivered could both see and speak and this lead the crowds who witnessed this miracle to question whether Yeshua was their long promised Messiah; the Son of David. In their jealousy, the religious leaders declared the Yeshua was driving out demons by the power of Beelzebub, the prince of demons. Read the account and you will see that Yeshua dismantles their argument very quickly and in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;verse 32&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, He informs everyone that blaspheming against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven. To say that the work of God the Holy Spirit is actually the work of Satan himself is unquestionably blasphemous and grossly insulting to the Spirit of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The verse people get hung up on however is &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;verse 29 which says, ‘Or how can anyone enter the strong man’s house and carry off his property, unless he first binds the strong man? And then he will plunder his house.’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Remember the 3 rules of Scriptural interpretation...context...context...context. The context of this entire passage is the deliverance of a man from demon possession. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Verse 22 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;simply says that Yeshua &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;‘healed him’ &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(NASB), the account in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Luke 11:14&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; just says &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;‘He was casting out a demon...’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (NASB) and these miracles, that had never been seen or equalled in Israel’s history, was being attributed to the power of Satan. Yeshua then explains the illogical premise of their argument. How can Satan cast himself out? If that were true, then Satan would destroy his own kingdom. But if Yeshua was dismantling Satan’s power, influence and bondage over the lives of these people, then one greater and more powerful than Satan was among them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When Yeshua uses the example of the ‘strong man’, who does the strong man represent in the context of this conversation? The strong man represents Satan who is the god of this world, who holds men captive to sin and burdens them with sickness, disease, possession and all other vices to which men are enslaved. So in order to break into the strong mans (Satan’s) house and take his possessions from him (human beings), one who is stronger than Satan has to be found. Who has greater power than Satan? The Messiah, the Son of the Living God. How could they know that Yeshua was in fact the Messiah, the Son of the Living God? Because He demonstrated His greater power by healing and delivering all who came to Him that were sick, diseased, blind, lame, deaf, mute and demon possessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Satan is the strong man in the analogy, and Yeshua, the Messiah; the One who stripped the power from the strong man – Satan - and delivered those he held captive proved Himself to be the Messiah through the very miracles He performed when He set those people free of demon possession, sickness and disease, those who were blind, deaf, mute and cripple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Another passage that has added fuel to the ‘spiritual warfare’ fire is found in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Matthew 18&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. The chapter begins with Yeshua teaching His disciples about what it means to be great in the kingdom...it’s exactly opposite to the world. He stood a child in front of them and proceeded to teach them to become like a child, in other words, to be trusting and believing and humble like a child; He also gave warnings to them about causing a child to stumble, leading them into sin and rejection of God. In God’s eyes, that’s an incredibly serious offense and the consequences are so awful, that Yeshua said it would be better that a person never be born at all. Those who cause others to stumble will face horrific consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yeshua goes on to say that there will always be stumbling blocks in life...but &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Woe to the world because of its stumbling blocks!” (verse 7)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yeshua uses word pictures to demonstrate that we need to be ruthless on ourselves with regard to causing others to stumble. If our hand or our eye causes us to stumble, cut it off or pluck it out because we’re better off entering heaven with a piece of ourselves missing rather than our entire self being cast into hell. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Verse 9)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This is of course not a command to literally dismember ourselves; good old Peter slipped into hypocrisy when he was visiting the church that gathered in Antioch. He was quite happy to eat and fellowship with the Gentile believers there, but when some of the Jewish believers from Jerusalem showed up, he withdrew from the Gentile Christians because he didn’t want to offend the Jewish believers, who apparently still held strongly to Jews and Gentiles remaining separate from each other. This became such an offense, that Paul had to publically rebuke him over it. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Gal 2)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; – read whole chapter to understand the context)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Can you imagine how this hypocritical behaviour made the new Gentile converts feel? It could have been a huge stumbling block for them. But...at no time after this do we see Peter physically harming his body as a means of purging himself so he didn’t cause anyone to stumble again. What Yeshua is trying to stress in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Matthew 18&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is that we are to be absolutely vigilant to &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;not cause&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; others to stumble, especially the young...young children and young believers...after all, the whole purpose of Yeshua coming to live among us was to seek and save that which was lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;From this Yeshua then launched into the story of the man who had a hundred sheep...one of which went astray. This man left the 99 sheep safely together on the mountain and went looking for the single lost sheep. Why? Because this shepherd considered the loss of one sheep to be one too many...he wasn’t prepared to allow even one lost sheep to be acceptable on his balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Now...it’s in this context of causing offense, being offended and in a lost state that we move into a crucial portion of this chapter.&amp;nbsp; Yeshua says the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Matthew 18:15-22, ‘“If your brother sins, go and show him his fault in private; if he listens to you, you have won your brother. But if he does not listen to you, take one or two more with you, so that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every fact may be confirmed. If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector. Truly I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall have been bound in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth shall have been loosed in heaven. Again I say to you, that if two of you agree on earth about anything that they may ask, it shall be done for them by My Father who is in heaven. For where two or three have gathered together in My name, I am there in their midst.” Then Peter came and said to Him, “Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? Up to seven times?” Jesus said to him, “I do not say to you, up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven.”’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The entire context of this chapter is about personal offenses, not public false teaching. Yeshua first gave a warning to those who cause others to stumble by telling them it would have been better if they’d never been born. Great punishment awaits them. Now He turns his attention to the one who has been offended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If someone sins against you, you’re to go privately to that individual and let them know how they’ve offended you. If they recognise their sin and respond appropriately, fantastic! You’ve been reconciled and the relationship has been saved. If on the other hand he refuses to acknowledge his sin, then you’re to go to your church leadership (your pastor and/or MATURE leaders/elders) and ask them to approach the sinning brother with you in order to resolve the matter. If at this point they still refuse to acknowledge their sinful offense, then the church leadership are required to bring it before the entire church family. If repentance is still not forthcoming, the sinning brother is to be put out of the fellowship and considered to be an unbeliever. Of course the ‘offense’ must be legitimate and provable, not trivial and childish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Peter’s question of how many times is he supposed to forgive the sinful offenses of his brother is important in this situation because regardless of the response from the offender, Peter is still required to forgive him...no matter how many times the offenses come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 2pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This is talking about church discipline within the body. This is very, very important because sin that is accommodated and",2014-05-28 23:47:36,mworby
14110,Home Group - What's In A Name? ,"&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/1058605_60297588%20small.jpg&quot; width=&quot;430&quot; height=&quot;308&quot; style=&quot;margin-right: 14px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;What’s In A Name?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Why are names so incredibly important to us? Why do we put so much emphasis and effort into choosing just the right name for our children? We look at the origins of names and what they mean and we want to select the best names possible for our children…why? In some cultures choosing a name is overwhelmingly important, much more so than in our western culture. In fact, here in the west, we’ve become quite extreme in choosing positively outrageous names and celebrities are leading the way in this. Consider some of these names given by the ‘Hollywood’ set to their children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Rob Morrow called his daughter ‘Tu’ as in Tu Morrow; Gwen Stefani called her baby Zuma Nesta Rock; Penn Jillette called his daughter Moxie Crimefighter; Jason Lee called his son Pilot Inspektor; Nicolas Cage called his son Kal-El; Paula Yates and Michael Hutchence called their daughter Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily; Shannyn Sossamon called her baby Audio Science; Michael Jackson called his sons Prince Michael II and Blanket; Gwyneth Paltrow called her daughter Apple; Sylvester Stallone called his child Sage Moonblood; John Cougar Mellencamp called his son Speck Wildhorse; Jamie Oliver’s kids are Buddy Bear, Petal Blossom Rainbow; Daisy Boo and Poppy Honey; Frank Zappa called his kids Diva Thin Muffin, Moon Unit and Dweezil. The list goes on and on and on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Some people have family names that are passed down from generation to generation as part of family traditions and history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Steve’s name is from the Greek word ‘stephanos’ which means crowned with a garland or crown. My name, Mandy is Latin and is a diminutive form of Amanda which means lovable or easy to love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Our names are important and in Ancient Israel, giving the right name was essential. After God created His universe and everything in it, He named everything: day, night, heaven, earth, sea, sun, moon, stars and by doing this He was declaring His sovereignty over them. The One issuing the names is the One with the authority over them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;So when God tasked Adam to name all the animals He was literally giving him authority over them to rule them, not to destroy and abuse them, but to exercise authority and care and dominion over them for their good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Sometimes, we see God transforming people and in that process of transformation He gave them new names. Abram which means ‘exalted father’ became Abraham which means ‘father or a multitude’, Sarai which means ‘princess’ became Sarah which means ‘noblewoman’ as she lost her shame and humiliation of being barren, Jacob which means ‘supplanter or deceiver’ became Israel which means ‘God Prevails’ or ‘God’s Prince’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In Malaysia, recent legal rulings have introduced laws that state Christians and non-Muslims are not allowed to use the word allah in their preaching or in their Bibles and religious materials despite the fact that in Arabic, the generic word for ‘god’ is allah. Christians over there have used the word allah simply as the word for God because that is the language however, Muslims are objecting to this usage because they deem the word allah is ONLY to be used in relation to &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; god. As far as they’re concerned, allah is the name of the god of Islam and no one else; they don’t want to confuse the god of Islam and the God of the Bible because they’re different gods…and rightly so!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;So for us, it’s incredibly important that we use the name of our Messiah and the name of our God appropriately and not use it casually or disrespectfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What does it mean to ‘Hallow’ someone’s name? To hallow someone’s name means to make it holy but in reference to hallowing God’s name it’s referring both His actual name as well as His reputation. So when we speak about God how do we refer to Him? Are we casual or flippant when we talk of Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In the same way we treat the word ‘love’ casually in our conversations by saying things like “I love chocolate” or “I love that movie” or “I love my new car” or whatever the object of our affection might be, we often treat God and His name the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Acts 4:11-12 says, “This Yeshua, the stone rejected by you builders which has become the cornerstone. There is salvation in no one else! For there is no other NAME under heaven given to mankind by whom we must be saved!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It’s amazing how the only name under heaven and given to all mankind that can bring about their salvation is treated like a curse word and is dragged through the mud by those it was given to. Not only that, but those who claim to love Him, have discredited His name by their words and their conduct and many in church leadership have even removed the cross He hung on from their messages out of fear of offending those who don’t even know Him. There isn’t any other name – not one – that can bring a soul to salvation but Yeshua’s, and His beautiful, glorious, precious name that actually means salvation, is demeaned and ridiculed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What about God…how often do we use the exclamation ‘Oh my g___!’ or the abbreviated for of that OMG! God has become little more than an exclamation mark for us to express shock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;For the Jews, God’s name is so holy and so high and lofty, that for fallen human beings to simply say His name tarnishes its perfection. Observant Jews don’t use His name out of sheer reverence for it; instead they call Him ‘Hashem’ which literally means ‘The Name’, because it’s forbidden to say His actual name of YHVH (Yahweh). YHVH is infinite and holy and lofty and pure, so out of sheer reverence they won’t use His actual name, they call Him Hashem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When writing the word God, most Jews write it as G_d; again as a measure to esteem and honour it and not inadvertently defile it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Now this doesn’t mean that we can no longer call God ‘God’, and it doesn’t mean we can’t call our Messiah Yeshua or Jesus, but what it should do is make us stop and think about how casually we refer to God and how we use His name. Do we hallow it, do we use it respectfully and reverentially or do we treat His name with casual abandon and then us as an expression simply to describe our shock over something?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If the adage is true that there is power in the name of Yeshua/Jesus, then surely we should make sure that we use His name with great awe and respect and ensure that our conduct and conversation doesn’t disparage it either since we’re representing His name on this earth. Our Father – Abba – God – Yahweh – deserves to receive the honour and respect and worship His name demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When our children go out in public, we want them to behave well so they don’t bring disgrace on the family name and it’s the same for the Christian. God rebuked and judged ancient Israel because they profaned His name among the heathen nations where they were dispersed; they forgot whom they were supposed to be representing! &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Eze 20, 36; Jer 34; Isa 48)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Names are important but if you want to call your children something wild like Delectable Cherry Blossom or normal like John that’s fine, but when it comes to our God and His Son Yeshua, names are all-important, and if that wasn’t the case, then the Name of Yeshua would not be the only name to bring salvation to mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

14029,Home Group - Gaining A Good Eye,"&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/954634_94521374%20small.jpg&quot; width=&quot;456&quot; height=&quot;304&quot; style=&quot;margin-right: 12px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;Gaining A Good Eye&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;After spending the best part of the last five weeks looking at Shema (and still barely scratching the surface) we’re moving onto another topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Several times we’ve made the statement, &lt;i&gt;“Walking in the dust of our Rabbi”&lt;/i&gt; and explained that this means that in Ancient Israel the disciples of Rabbis endeavoured to learn from and imitate their teachers to the point that they even adopted their habits and personas; they would imitate their facial expressions and mannerisms and this was a mark of great respect for their beloved teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;To walk in the dust of a Rabbi means to walk so closely to them that the very dust of the earth that is stirred up by their walking would settle on the disciples because they wanted to walk in their very footsteps so they’d be close enough to learn every tiny detail of their teachers life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It’s our desire to be authentic disciples of our Rabbi, but we’re not Jewish and we’ve never been taught properly just what it means to be a disciple, and because we’re unaware of the context and setting of Yeshua’s discipleship training we can run the risk of missing the point He was making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Let’s face it, sometimes the things Yeshua said are just plain confusing and the reason they’re confusing is that we read them with the mind of a 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century western context instead of a 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century Jewish context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Have you ever heard idioms or figures of speech? You’ll recognise these straight away…’beat around the bush’, ‘kick the bucket’, ‘get someone’s goat’, ‘catch my drift’…these are all figures of speech whose meanings have nothing whatsoever to do running around bushes, kicking buckets, taking someone’s goat or catching a drift! They’re terms that mean something different to the explicit words being used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If you use the term ‘kick the bucket’ you need to make sure that it’s a culturally relevant term or people will think you’re strange because you want to go around kicking buckets!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Let’s look at a Jewish idiom or figure of speech from Yeshua’s day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Matthew 6:19-25, Yeshua said, “Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroy, and where thieves do not break in or steal; for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #008080;&quot;&gt;The eye is the lamp of the body; so then if your eye is clear, your whole body will be full of light. But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!&lt;/span&gt; No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and wealth. For this reason I say to you, do not be worried about your life, as to what you will eat or what you will drink; nor for your body as to what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This is a very common and well known passage from the Sermon on the Mount. The interesting thing about this passage is that it’s talking about financial and material wealth and Yeshua is stating that we shouldn’t be obsessed with financial and material wealth here on earth where it’s going to corrode and disappear, but rather we should be focusing on spiritual treasure that is stored for us in heaven by our Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The passage begins by saying don’t chase treasure here on earth because it’s transitory and passing, store spiritual treasure in heaven where it can’t be lost, destroyed or stolen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The end of the passage says that it’s not possible to serve two masters at once, in other words we will either pursue God and spiritual treasure that will last forever, or we’ll pursue financial and material wealth here on earth that will last for a little while but will then disappear, but at the end of the day we can’t serve both! It’s one or the other and we have to make a determination as to which it will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;That’s fine, that makes sense doesn’t it? But here’s where the confusion comes in…right in the middle of this passage there appears to be a section that is completely out of context and it makes no sense whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #008080;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Verses 22-23.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;“&lt;i&gt;The eye is the lamp of the body; so then if your eye is clear, your whole body will be full of light. But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What does this have to do with financial or material treasure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Some translations refer to the eye being healthy or evil, sound or unsound, good or bad…and still none of these descriptions make sense with regard to the context of treasure or wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;You could also be forgiven for thinking that Yeshua was being superstitious and warning against the evil eye, and this particular superstition is still very, very prominent in the Middle East today…but Yeshua wasn’t and never will be superstitious, so what was He trying to say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In Hebrew , an evil eye is &lt;i&gt;‘ayin ra’ah’&lt;/i&gt; and in ancient Jewish custom someone with an evil eye was stingy and selfish and a good eye in Hebrew is &lt;i&gt;‘ayin tovah’&lt;/i&gt; which means to be generous and giving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;So in the middle of this passage about not chasing and obsessing about material wealth in this life, Yeshua tells His people that their eyes…either being evil or dark or healthy or good or clear…which ever adjective is used here, will declare what the whole person is going to be like with regard to their wealth or treasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;A person with a bad or evil eye is stingy, greedy, selfish and cares nothing for other people and their needs. Stingy people look out for themselves only and their one motivation is to hog everything for themselves and their whole life demonstrates this attitude. How great is the darkness for a person with a bad eye, or a stingy mean-spirited heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;But a person with a clear or good or healthy eye, is thoughtful and generous and giving, they’re not obsessed with hogging wealth and treasure for themselves, they know God will take care of their needs, they’re not driven by material comforts and they’re happy to share what they have with others. A generous-hearted person has a life that is full of light and love and it shows!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;So Yeshua was absolutely crystal clear and His contrasting reference to a bad eye and a good eye in the context of storing up treasure in heaven rather than on earth and then going on to declare that a person cannot serve God and have a generous and giving heart, if they’re obsessed first and foremost with accumulating wealth and possessions for themselves, was perfectly appropriate and logical! &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In its original context, this entire passage makes perfect sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The difference between Israel’s God and the god’s of her ancient neighbours (and this is true today as well) is that they were terribly immoral, fickle and often cruel. The God of Israel is unique in that He has always had a heart to redeem and forgive the sinner, and compassion toward the vulnerable and needy. When God’s people wrongly believed that He was only interested in rituals He would send prophets to tell them otherwise; the rituals were not what He loved, they were a means only for connection between Him and them; what He wanted was love from His people for Himself and in turn, love, care and compassion for others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Some have wondered what difference it makes that Yeshua was Jewish. The intrinsic difference of Jewish culture and custom in the Torah (God’s Teaching and Law) and that of other peoples, is His great concern for society and the vulnerable living in it and Yeshua emphasised the same thing when He walked the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;So the more we learn about Yeshua’s Jewish cultural setting and context, the more we discover that being a follower of Yeshua our Rabbi, and walking in His dust so that we become just like Him, the more we will understand that we too need to learn to have a very good, healthy, clear eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

13951,Home Group - Love Your Neighbour As Yourself,"&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/724407_24295926%20small.jpg&quot; width=&quot;348&quot; height=&quot;261&quot; style=&quot;margin-right: 14px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'Love Your Neighbour As Yourself'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to start by telling you ‘Al’s’ story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Al hit rock bottom at the age of 22. He wrote a letter to his sister bemoaning the day he was born saying that he was nothing but a burden to his family. As a young child he was deemed to be retarded and was taken out of school several times, even the family maid nicknamed him ‘the dopey one’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;He eventually did finish school but couldn’t get into a tech school and there was no chance of him getting into college. He needed work but no one would hire him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Finally his dad’s friend – Fred Haller – gave him a probationary job at his office which was the Swiss Federal Patent Office and that’s where Fred realised that Al wasn’t as useless and clueless as everyone thought. Al was in fact a good worker, he just thought and learned differently and he went on to guide lesser minds through the intricacies of time and space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Al became so inspired by his first ever success at anything that he eventually lived up to the genius that was inside him all along…from his first job came the incomparable genius of Albert Einstein!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Now we’ve covered ‘Shema’ for the past 4 weeks and we’re not going to focus on that specifically but we will look deeper at what it means to ‘love your neighbour’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Paul repeated what Yeshua said about loving our neighbour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Galatians 5:13-14, ‘Brothers, you were called to be free. Only don’t let that freedom become an excuse for allowing your old nature to have its way. Instead, serve one another in love. For the whole of the Torah (God’s law) is summed up in this one sentence: “Love your neighbour &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;as yourself&lt;/span&gt;.”’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Peter emphasised this as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;1 Peter 4:7-8, ‘The accomplishing of the goal of all things is close at hand. Therefore, keep alert and self-controlled, so that you can pray. More than anything, &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;keep loving each other actively&lt;/span&gt;; because love covers many sins.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;John also emphasised the importance of believers loving each other righteously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;1 John 3:10-11, ‘Here is how one can distinguish clearly between God’s children and those of the Adversary: everyone who does not continue doing what is right is not from God. Likewise, anyone who fails to keep loving his brother is not from God. For this is the message which you have heard from the beginning: that we should love each other.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;James emphasises this as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;James 2:8, ‘If you truly attain the goal of Kingdom Torah (the Law of the Kingdom), in conformity with the passage that says, “Love your neighbour &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;as yourself&lt;/span&gt;”, you’re doing well.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The first church placed great emphasis on loving and caring for each other &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Acts 2:42-47)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, they not only gathered together regularly, they were also very active in the general community as well. They didn’t isolate themselves from the world and they continued to worship daily in the Temple as well. Sadly it only took a few centuries for the church to become both greedy in its pursuit of political power and material wealth as well as being isolationist in its self-imagined piety through monasticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;While it’s very true that each individual will stand before God and give an account for themselves and no one else, and that when a person comes to faith in Yeshua, it’s personal, it’s also true that when we come to faith in Yeshua, we are born again INTO God’s family; we are adopted sons and daughters and we’re no longer isolated but are in fact part of a community, a family where we are supposed to be planted and grounded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Throughout Jewish history, God always called His people to serve Him ‘together’, there was always a majority in Israel that rebelled against God, but the remnant was always called to stand together. The same was expected of the church after the resurrection and it’s that close family, the entity of the church that is described as a body that when close knit and loving, and committed to God and each other, that the testimony of Yeshua through the lives of His people are the most impacting and striking to the eyes of the watching world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This means that we’re supposed to stay in fellowship with each other. I’m not saying that you have to belong to a particular church that meets at a set location in a specific building. Not all churches are faithful to God’s Word, but we are supposed to be faithful in our fellowship with other genuine believers; that’s the focus of what it means to be in genuine community with our Christian family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Judaism in its purest form and even today is very communal, it’s never solitary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Again, we as individuals are accountable to God for our sin, no one else will ever have to answer for what you and I personally do, but you and I were never called to be Christian’s alone. It’s not ‘I’, but ‘we’ who make up the body of Yeshua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Christianity has ingrained into us when we pray that we pray in the first person, as in “Lord do this or that for me”, and “Lord I need this or that” just as an example, but how did Yeshua teach His disciples to pray?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Matthew 6:9-13 Yeshua said, “You, therefore, pray like this? ‘&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;OUR&lt;/span&gt; Father in Heaven! May Your name be kept holy. May Your kingdom come, Your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; the food we need today. Forgive &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; what we have done wrong, as &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;WE&lt;/span&gt; too have forgiven those who have wronged &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;. And do not lead &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; into hard testing, but keep &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; safe from the evil one. For kingship, power and glory are yours forever. Amen.’”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Have you noticed that many of our church songs are written in the first person as well, as in ‘I Love You Lord and I Lift My Voice’, ‘Just As I Am…’, ‘To Give My Life Away’, ‘My Only King’, ‘Jesus I Am Resting’, ‘I Belong To You’, ‘It Is Well With My Soul’, ‘I Am Chosen I Am Free’, ‘Here I Am To Worship’, ‘I Will Magnify You’, ‘I Live For Jesus’, ‘I Will Rise’, ‘You Are My Shelter’? There’s nothing wrong at all with loving God in the first person, nothing at all, but we’ve possibly gone to the extreme when it comes to our personal relationship with Yeshua, when as a body, we should be equally focused on ‘we’ and ‘us’. If we were less focused on ‘I’ and ‘Me’ we might be doing a better job of caring for and protecting each other within our own Christian family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If we’re called to love one another, how can we do that if our mindset is always predominantly singular in its focus? If we’re more focused on ‘we’ and ‘us’, we’ll have a greater understanding of what it means to love others as much as we love ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;How do we do that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Matthew 7:12, Yeshua said, “Always treat others as you would like them to treat you; that sums up the teaching of the Torah and the Prophets.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This is what has been termed as ‘The Golden Rule’. Rabbi Joseph Telushkin talked about a school teacher who asked his 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade class to compose two golden rule lists; one list was for things they would want others to do to them, and the second list was of things they would not want done to them. On their ‘Do’ list, they wrote love, respect and help but on their ‘Don’t’ list, they wrote longer and more detailed things that were more practical and included things like, don’t hit, don’t steal, don’t laugh at, don’t snub, don’t cheat. The list of don’ts was much clearer and more specific and the result was a more likely change in behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;But if we want to know how to love our neighbour, we need a ‘Do’ list that is more detailed so that loving our neighbour is not merely a subjective exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yeshua was asked &lt;i&gt;‘who is my neighbour’&lt;/i&gt; after He said we were to love our neighbour. The Hebrew word for neighbour is ‘Re’ah’, which typically means a companion, kinsmen or friend and it’s easy to love people we already know and care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Whenever we look in depth at the story of the Good Samaritan in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Luke 10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, where Yeshua teaches that the Samaritan man, who was of a despised race and intensely disliked by the Jewish people at that time, was the one who behaved with love toward the beaten man as opposed to the others who simply passed him by leaving him for dead, but that’s not the emphasis of Yeshua’s teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The real emphasis and point of Yeshua saying that we’re to love our neighbour is that we are to love them &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;the way we love ourselves&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Sadly, this has been taught to mean that we should work more on loving ourselves because if we don’t love ourselves we cannot possibly love others. That’s not what this passage says at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Human beings always put themselves first; we already love ourselves a lot. We dress ourselves in nice clothes, we like to eat good food, we wash ourselves and put on nice perfume, we wear make-up and like to make ourselves physically presentable when we meet with others. We buy ourselves nice things to make our lives easier, more comfortable and to make us happy. When we make decisions we make them with our own best interests at heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The point is, we are the centre of our own lives and we love ourselves so much already because we always want the best for ourselves. What Yeshua was saying is that we are to love others that same way, because our neighbour is just like us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If we were the man beaten and left for dead on the side of the road, we would want someone to stop and take care of us and give us the assistance we needed to get the necessary help and protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;By embracing this understanding we become just like our Rabbi, we imitate His behaviour and His love for others, putting their needs ahead of His own. He taught the people the Truth about His Word and what God really said in the Torah but He didn’t stop there; He fed them when they were hungry, He clothed them when they were naked, He healed their bodies when they were sick and diseased and He loved them when they were lost and without hope. He never compromised once, and He loved even those whom He knew would reject Him and call for His execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;That’s what it means to walk in the dust of our Rabbi…our lives are to be focused and dedicated to loving and learning all we can about God and we do that by imitating and living like Yeshua who was God in the flesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Love is not an emotion only, most of the time real love is a real, practical, decision to love and serve and give and sacrifice for the benefit of the other in a way that we would want others to love and serve and give and sacrifice for us. That’s what it means to love God and loves others as we love ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

13847,Home Group - Shema Pt 4,"&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/575231_55762839%20small.jpg&quot; width=&quot;351&quot; height=&quot;263&quot; style=&quot;margin-right: 13px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;Shema Pt 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We’ve been looking at Shema for the past 3 weeks as we dig into the Hebrew roots of our faith. Shema is found in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Deuteronomy 6:4-9 and 11:13-21 and Numbers 15:37-41&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Remember that Yeshua was approached by a religious teacher of the Torah and asked Him what was the greatest commandment and Yeshua responded with Shema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Matthew 22:37-40, ‘He (Yeshua) told him, “You are to love Adonai your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength. This is the greatest and most important mitzvah (commandment). And a second is similar to it, you are to love your neighbour as yourself. All of the Torah and the prophets are dependent on these two mitzvoth (commandments).”’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Last week we looked at the elements of ‘and you shall love’ which is far broader than simply referring to an emotional response which is very much a western thought, it’s really about expressing loving action and a solemn pledge of loyalty regardless of any feelings. We also looked at the element of ‘with all your heart’ which incorporates as well as feelings our mind and thought processes as well. It’s in fact referring to all our inner life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The next element of Shema that we’ll look at is…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;‘With all your soul’.....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In our society we often say we love something with all our heart and soul which means we love with our emotions and our deepest intentions. But what we read as ‘soul’ in the Hebrew is ‘nephesh’ and this means more than just a person’s spirit, it means will all your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This is directly opposite to the usual church mindset that says to set aside some time each day for God which leads to the conclusion that the rest of your day belongs to you. The Hebrew mindset is that all of life is for the worship and love of God. Every action, every word, every thought, every emotion in the whole of life is to be done, said, thought and felt for God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In an orthodox Jewish person’s life, they have prayers for waking up, prayers for receiving food, prayers for receiving drink, prayers before bathing, prayers when putting on their tzitzit (tassled garment), prayers for putting on the prayer shawl, prayers for putting on their phylacteries, verses are recited before entering a synagogue, morning blessings, evening blessings, there are prayers and blessings for just about everything for the observant Jew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We might think that’s just being caught up in religious dogma and I’m not suggesting that we suddenly develop a set of prayers or blessings every time we take a drink of water or go to the bathroom, but Judaism – despite the fact that it’s nothing like the Judaism that was delivered by Moses, has maintained the overwhelming focus that honour of God must pervade every moment of our daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Loving God with your nephesh means a willingness to even sacrifice your very life for Him if need be, in fact, Jews who are able to, will quote Shema on their death bed as a final commitment to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This is the kind of love Yeshua loved us with; He loved the Father supremely and even though humanity was His enemy through sin, He obeyed the Father with unwavering loyalty, and to the human race who hates Him, He loved them with His whole life. He loved them with His words, He loved them through His ministry of healings and amazing signs and He loved them through giving His entire life through torture and crucifixion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yeshua is our example and it’s not an easy one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There is a word in Hebrew to describe love that’s not in Shema but it describes completely what Shema is trying to communicate, it’s the word ‘hesed’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Hesed is a love that is so enduring and persistent that it will last long beyond the most extreme sin and the worst kind of betrayal; it can reach beyond such pain and brokenness to extend grace and mercy and forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Hesed is very often active love and is translated mercy and lovingkindness but even these words don’t really adequately explain its meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Lois Tverberg describes hesed this way, &lt;i&gt;“Hesed is a bone-weary father who drives through the night to bail is drug-addicted son out of jail. Hesed is a mum who spends day after thankless day spoon-feeding and wiping up after a disabled child. Hesed is an unsung pastor’s wife whose long-suffering, tearful prayers keep her exhausted husband from falling apart at the seams. Hesed is love that can be counted on, decade after decade. It’s not about the thrill of romance but the security of faithfulness.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;That’s the kind of love our God has for us and it’s the love we’re called to demonstrate to Him - which is His due - but because His Spirit indwells us, it’s the same kind of love we’re supposed to in turn demonstrate toward others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;‘With all your strength’....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The word used here is ‘me’od’, and it’s the Hebrew word used for ‘very’. So the line should actually read...‘With all your very’ which to our understanding doesn’t make any sense at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In Hebrew if someone asked “Mah Shlomkha?” they would be asking “How are you?” and the response would be “Tov me’od” which is very good. Tov is good, and me’od is very.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;To understand what Scripture means when Shema says to love the Lord with all your very, it’s like saying with all your oomph; to love God earnestly, zealously, enthusiastically and often our translations use the word strength or might. ‘Me’od’ can also be expressed as much-ness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There even used to be an interpretation of the word me’od to also means mamman or money which could bring another dimension to Yeshua’s words by saying to love the Lord with all your increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What this word is expressing is that we are to love the Lord with everything the Lord has blessed us with. Our physical body, our emotions, our words, the possessions we own, the resources at our disposal...our ‘very’ our ‘me’od’. It’s that complete and all encompassing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If we were to give Shema a 2014 rendering it might sound something like this;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;“Listen Israel, the Lord is your God, He and He alone! You shall love Him with every thought you think, live every hour of every day for Him, be willing to give your life for Him. Love Him with every penny in your wallet and with everything you’ve got. And love others the same way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;That’s a big ask of any frail human being. But God has placed His Spirit within us and He equips us so that we can in fact obey Him and His command to love Him supremely which means it’s not the impossible task it is at first read. Without Him we cannot love Him this way and we certainly can’t loves others either, but with His Word as our guide and His Spirit indwelling and empowering us, we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

13758,Home Group - Shema Pt 3,"&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/1058605_60297588%20small.jpg&quot; width=&quot;394&quot; height=&quot;282&quot; style=&quot;margin-right: 14px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;Shema Pt 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We’ve been looking at Shema for the past 2 weeks, Shema is the #1 item that Jewish people learn from the moment they’re born. What is shema? ‘Shema Israel, Adonai Elohenu, Adonai echad.’ - ‘Hear O Israel, the Lord is God, the Lord is one.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;To quickly go over what we’ve learned so far about Shema, it’s from &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Deuteronomy 6:4-9, 11:13-21, Numbers 15:37-41.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yeshua’s encounter with a teacher of Torah lead Him to answer a question about what was the greatest commandment and Yeshua answered with Shema and then expanded on it to include not only love of God but love of others also and that Shema was something you did, not merely something you knew; it had to have a practical outworking rather than being an item of intellectual knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Last week we looked at the Hebrew word ‘echad’ which is commonly translated to mean ‘one’ as in a singular item, but in Hebrew it has a much broader meaning than that; it includes ‘unified’, ‘only’, ‘alone’ and is used even to describe a unified whole, as in ‘there was the morning and the evening, the first day.’ There are 2 elements that make up one day and because there are no vowels in the Hebrew alphabet, there can be the possibility of shema meaning that Adonai is the only God, or God alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When Yeshua went on to include the importance of loving God with heart, mind, soul and strength and to love neighbour as self, He was summarising all of Torah with those words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This week we’re going to look at what is meant by loving God with those elements of ‘heart, soul, mind and strength.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Vicktor Frankl was an Austrian neurologist and psychologist, the founder of logotherapy as well a Jewish prisoner for 3 years in the Auschwitz Nazi death camp. Upon arrival he was separated from his wife and he was unaware that she was transferred to the Bergen-Belsen death camp where she was murdered, his mother was murdered in the Auschwitz gas chambers and his brother died during slave labor in Auschwitz. Unaware of his loss, he was hoping that his wife was faring better than he was. One of the inmates whispered to him one day that he was glad their wives couldn’t see the conditions they were enduring and said he hoped they were treated better to which Viktor agreed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;However, this sparked the memory of his wife and in his minds eye he would see her face and the beauty of her smile and they way she used to squint when she laughed. He said that memory sparked a powerful wave of love that overwhelmed him and moved him from the danger and horror of his existence in the death camp. He said,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;“I understood how a man who has nothing left in this world still may know bliss, be it only for a brief moment, in the contemplation of his beloved...for the first time in my life I was able to understand the meaning of the words, ‘The angels are lost in perpetual contemplation of an infinite glory.’”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In the worst moments of his life, Viktor’s love for his wife filled him with such joy that he understood why the angels would spend all eternity in worshipping and loving God supremely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shema first of all embraces love of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Matthew 22:37-40, ‘He (Yeshua) told him, “You are to love Adonai your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength. This is the greatest and most important mitzvah (commandment). And a second is similar to it, “You are to love your neighbour as yourself.” All of the Torah and the Prophets are dependent on these two mitzvot (commandments).’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;‘And you shall love…’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What does it mean to ‘love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your strength’, and how is it possible to command someone to love?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yeshua’s answer included the words ‘ve-ahavtah’ which literally means ‘and you shall love’. It’s a command but it’s future, as in ‘and you SHALL’ and the day will come when we will stand before our Messiah, completely redeemed and removed from this life and we will be like the angels in that we’ll be overawed with love for Him and we’ll never have to leave Him or be distracted by this world ever again. That’s pure heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Often today we confuse the ‘feelings’ we get during a moving song service at church as evidence of loving God and from this we can wrongly believe that Christianity is all about this feeling. But what if we never experienced those feelings ever again, could we still love God supremely?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Hebrew word ‘ah-havtah’ is quite broad in its meaning. Besides the common word which refers to affection, ‘ah-havtah’ moves far beyond emotion and also describes actions associated with love as in acting lovingly and to be loyal to someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Ancient treaties between a king and his enemy were a signed covenantal agreement where the enemy would pledge to ‘love’ the king he was making the agreement with. This was a pledge of loyalty not necessarily to hold warm feelings toward the monarch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When the Israelites responded to the 10 commandments given them by Moses, they didn’t respond with warm gushy feelings, they responded by promising to obey them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;So loving God doesn’t command warm affection and feelings from those who worship Him necessarily, it’s a command of loyalty and faithful acts of devotion and obedience. This doesn’t mean emotions aren’t important, but we usually get these priorities around the wrong way; we want to feel the emotions and then follow those up with actions when we’re to respond to God with faithful and loyal actions of devotion to the One and Only God, and the emotions then follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Remember king David, who for most of his life had been faithful in his behaviour and actions toward God (apart from a few glaringly abysmal sins) one day just spontaneously burst into joyful dance in the streets, casting aside his royal robes, giving up decorum for the sheer joy and love he felt for his God. For many, many years before his came to the throne, David lived in exile and fear for his life and was defamed and insulted by king Saul. He was a fugitive on the run and often felt misery which is blatantly obvious when reading the psalms he wrote, but his feelings never prevented him from loving God supremely in both word and deed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The entire encompassing definition of the word ‘love’ includes loving others in action not just with mental and emotional feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The truth is that we are not capable of loving God and other people simply by holding warm feelings and always thinking nice things toward them, love according to God’s definition means getting up and doing something that demonstrates love; love via action. Love is both warm feelings and the actions that they come from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This is why Yeshua said in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Luke 6:27&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; that we are to love our enemies and do good to those who hate and persecute you. It doesn’t mean we’re to have warm fuzzy feelings toward them, it means to treat them with faithful loyalty and to commit to acts of kindness that demonstrate love. Living a life of love toward an enemy means treating them fairly, praying for them and never seeking revenge no matter how unkind or hurtful they’ve been to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It doesn’t mean foolishly thinking they’re nice people and are deserving of acts of kindness, demonstrating acts of kindness to an enemy demonstrates the kind of love God places inside His children that in actuality confounds the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;‘With all your heart…’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;To the English mind when we refer to the heart we think of emotions and even delineate between our ‘head and our heart’ to point out the differences between emotions and rational thinking. But in Hebrew, ‘lev’ or ‘levav’ is referring to emotions, as well as the mind and thoughts. It is in fact referring to all the inner life. So this phrase could be read as ‘with all your inner life’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This brings greater understanding to passages like &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Deut 6:6 that says, ‘These words, which I am ordering you today, are to be on your heart’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and in practice this means that these commandments are to be a part of all your thoughts. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Proverbs 16:23 says, ‘The wise man’s heart teaches his mouth, and to his lips it adds learning,’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; which means that the wise person thinks before speaking so that he can be persuasive when he does speak. So whenever you read ‘heart’ in the OC, it should be considered as referring to the intellect as well as the emotions because in Hebrew is can also be referring to the mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;So not only should our actions and our emotions be engaged in our love of God but so should our thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In both ancient days as well as today, it is a common practice for Orthodox Jews and Rabbis to memorise enormous amounts of Scripture and commentaries which they can recite at any time. This is not such a common habit among the church, but this habit of memorising the Bible has meant total engagement of the thoughts and minds of those learning it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;As we’ve learned in previous Home Groups, if we learned more of the Word of God our lives would be a far greater picture of a life lived in worship and adoration of God first and other people that we interact with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Next week we’ll take a look at the other elements of Shema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

13757,Home Group - Shema Pt 2,"&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/954634_94521374%20small.jpg&quot; width=&quot;421&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; style=&quot;margin-right: 14px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;Shema Pt 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Last week we focused on the first portion of Shema, in particular the portion that revealed to us that shema which translated as ‘hear’ actually means to ‘hearken &amp;amp; take heed’ to what God is saying and obey it. It’s a call to active obedience to God’s Word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What is the shema?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There will always be those who get concerned about focusing on the Jewishness of the Christian faith and some have legitimate concerns because some people can go a little strange and some think it means going back under the law. For anyone concerned that we are suggesting that I want to allay those fears. We’re absolutely not suggesting we must adhere to the intricacies of the Old Covenant Mosaic laws at all and we’re not suggesting that we in any way need to become Jews or live like Jews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The purpose of learning our Jewish foundations is to get a really clear understanding of what the Scriptures mean in their context and setting because when we understand that we come away with a far clearer and meaningful understanding of what God has revealed through His Word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&quot;Shema Israel, Adonai elohenu, Adonai echad.&quot; (Hear O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff2600;&quot;&gt;Deuteronomy 6:4-9, 11:13-21; and Numbers 15:37-41.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yeshua was asked by a Torah teacher the question in Mark 12, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff2600;&quot;&gt;&quot;Which is the most important mitzvah (commandment) of all?&quot; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;and this is how He answered him…&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff2600;&quot;&gt;&quot;The most important is, 'Shema Yisrael, Adonai Eloheinu, Adonai echad (Hear O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one), and you are to love Adonai your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your understanding and with all your strength. The second is this: You are to love your neighbour as yourself. There is no other mitzvah (commandment) greater than these.&quot;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If we jump back to the portion of Shema that most Christians gloss over but Jews focus heavily upon is the 'echad' or 'one'. This line is usually understood to be a statement of belief in monotheism; which is the belief in ‘one God’ as opposed to many gods which is commonly believed in paganism. Hinduism is the belief in millions of gods as an example. Ancient Greek, Roman, Assyrian, Mesopotamian mythology helds to many gods, ancient Egyptians believed in many gods and all these beliefs had hierarchy within those beliefs as in major gods and lesser gods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;One of the gifts the world received through the Jewish people is the understanding that there is one God. This is just one of the blessings to come to us through the Jews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;While the word ‘echad’ in Shema is commonly translated as 'one' as in a singular item, it &lt;i&gt;also&lt;/i&gt; means and encompasses 'only', 'alone' 'unique' or 'unified'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Because the Hebrew language doesn’t have vowels, the literal translation from the original reads like this: 'Yhwh - our God - Yhwh - one.' The verse can also read as 'The Lord is our God, the Lord alone'. Therefore the God of Israel alone is truly the only real and ‘unified’ God and this understanding most certainly doesn’t exclude the doctrine of the Trinity, actually it reveals the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This verse has been a point of contention between Jews and Christians for centuries because Jews believe 'echad' only means 'one' and therefore cannot accept the doctrine of the Trinity and Christians read 'echad' as referring to a compound unity in the same way that the morning and the evening - 2 separate time periods - equal one complete day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The hinge is in how Shema is interpreted. Is it 'the Lord is one' or is it 'The Lord is our God, the Lord alone'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;It’s believed that 'alone' is a better translation than 'one' as it is in the case of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff2600;&quot;&gt;Zechariah 14:9 which says, 'The Lord will be king over all the earth; on that day the Lord will be 'echad' or (one) and His name 'echad' (one).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff2600;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The context is that one day all humanity will cease to worship idols and instead worship God and Him 'alone'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;A Jewish scholar named Jeffrey Tigay is noted as saying that Shema is &lt;i&gt;“not a statement of belief, rather it’s an oath of loyalty”&lt;/i&gt; to God and God alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God alone is our God, and we are called to hear His Word and obey it. That is Shema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;'Shema Israel, Adonai elohenu, Adonai echad.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;How might we read this? 'Hearken Israel to the Lord your God, because He is God alone’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;How might we understand this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;To summarise, Yeshua answered the question posed to Him about the greatest commandment by quoting Shema – that we’re to love God alone with every fiber of our being, and by doing so we give no place for the love or worship of other gods at all. And it follows naturally that if we love God with every ounce of strength and purpose we possess, we would love other people who are also loved by God and created in His image for His good pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Scripture calls us to move beyond words and intellectual comprehension, to obedience, love and action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next week we’ll move on to the next portion of Shema which is all about ‘how’ we love God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

13756,Home Group - Shema Pt 1,"&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/724407_24295926%20small.jpg&quot; width=&quot;375&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; style=&quot;margin-right: 14px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;Shema Pt 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In 1945, Rabbi Eliezer Silver headed a search for displaced Jewish children all across Europe who’d been hidden from the Nazi’s on farms, in convents and monasteries and he desperately wanted to return them to their families if at all possible. There was a particular monastery in the south of France that had taken in Jewish children but when asked the priest in charge declared all the children to be Christian and the Rabbi wasn’t able to produce any records whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The family names of many of the children could be considered either Jewish or Gentile because they were predominantly common German names like Schwartz, Kaufmann and Schneider and looking into their faces didn’t give him any clues either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What he did do however after being given permission to visit the ward, he began to sing the Shema in Hebrew - &quot;Shema Israel, Adonai elohenu, Adonai echad.&quot; (Hear O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;A handful of faces lit up, and tiny voices from around the room joined him in the singing. They recognised the ancient words they’d been taught in their bedtime prayers from their earliest memories and from their parents reciting them each morning and evening during their own prayers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;For observant Jews, there are three sections of Scripture that are recited twice every day to remind them of their commitment to God which was ordained for them in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff2600;&quot;&gt;Deuteronomy 6:4-9, 11:13-21; and Numbers 15:37-41. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;For thousands of years Jewish parents have taught their children Shema and Yeshua would have learned it when sitting on Joseph’s knee too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yeshua had an interesting encounter in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff2600;&quot;&gt;Mark 12:28-31…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff2600;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff2600;&quot;&gt;&quot;One of the Torah-teachers came up and heard them engaged in this discussion. Seeing that Yeshua answered them well, he asked Him, &quot;Which is the most important mitzvah (commandment) of all?&quot; Yeshua answered, &quot;The most important is, 'Shema Yisrael, Adonai Eloheinu, Adonai echad (Hear O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one), and you are to love Adonai your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your understanding and with all your strength. The second is this: You are to love your neighbour as yourself. There is no other mitzvah (commandment) greater than these.&quot;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff2600;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Also, most Christians are unaware that what Yeshua said is found in the Old Covenant Scriptures, this is not a new teaching begun by Him. As mentioned already, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff2600;&quot;&gt;Deut 6:49, 11:13-21 and Num 15:37-41&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; contain the beginning of Shema and the second portion of what Yeshua said comes straight from &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff2600;&quot;&gt;Leviticus 19:18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff2600;&quot;&gt;Leviticus 19:18 God said, &quot;Don’t take vengeance on or bear a grudge against any of your people; rather, love your neighbour as yourself; &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;I am Adonai&lt;/span&gt;.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff2600;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What needs to be stressed here is that these portions of Scripture from &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Deuteronomy, Numbers and Leviticus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; are from the Torah - the books of the Law. The Law of God is Holy and sadly Christians look upon it as though it’s evil and bad, but it’s holy and reveals to us God’s ultimate standard for righteous position before Him. Of course we can’t measure up to it, but that’s its purpose, to let us know we can’t ever be good enough for God, which is why we needed a Redeemer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The question posed to Yeshua was an invitation to join a debate that was taking place at that time and it’s very likely the question was asked like this….&quot;Mah klal gadol ba’torah?&quot; Which means &quot;What is the great essence of God’s Law?&quot; In other words how can God’s entire Law be summarised in brief?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The word Torah which has been casually translated as Law actually means 'teaching'. The goal of those participating in this debate was to give their summary and choose a verse that would encapsulate all the rest of the Torah and end with a pinnacle of truth – a pointed focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;For the most part, the religious leaders of Yeshua’s day had the finer details of the Law under their belt, but they had no love for God and the people they were supposed to be shepherding. They had missed the entire intention of Torah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If we break down Shema and look at it more closely we’ll see something wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shema (hear)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Israel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Adonai (the Lord)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;elohenu (our God)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Adonai (the Lord)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;echad! (one / alone) – we’ll take a look at this in particular next week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The word we casually translate as 'hear' has far deeper significance in that it fully means taking heed and responding with action over what has been heard. A teacher once responded to a question posed by a student over the stupidity of another student when they said, &quot;how do you tell someone to obey in Hebrew?&quot; and the teacher responded by answering &quot;Shema&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;I did a little experiment myself, I typed into my online Bible (blueletterbible.org) the word 'obey' and in &lt;i&gt;almost&lt;/i&gt; all cases the original Hebrew word used for it is Shema (strongs #H8085)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;So shema is a call to listen to what God says and obey it with action. It doesn’t simply mean to listen to something in an audible sense. Those of us with children know what it’s like to give our kids an instruction that we know they’ve heard audibly, but they simply ignore it and continue with their own activities. Shema is so much more than simply hearing God’s Word, it’s a call to obey God’s Word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When you read through psalms and you read phrases like &quot;Hear my prayer O Lord, and give ear to my cry,&quot; the word shema is used, so the psalmist isn’t simply hoping that God’s ears are able to identify the sound of his words, he’s actually asking God to hear his petition and act upon it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Another way of saying Shema is &quot;Hearken, take heed Israel - the Lord is your God,&quot; and there are excellent examples of this in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff2600;&quot;&gt;Psalm 81&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff2600;&quot;&gt;Vs 8-9, 'Hear (shema) My people, and I give you warning! Israel, if you would only listen (shema) to Me! There is not to be with you any foreign god; you are not to worship an alien god.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff2600;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff2600;&quot;&gt;V 11, 'But My people did not listen (shema) to My voice, Israel would have none of Me.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff2600;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 36pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: -18pt;&quot;&gt;-&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Israel was disobeying God’s instructions!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff2600;&quot;&gt;V 13, 'How I wish My people would listen (shema) to Me, that Israel would live by My ways!'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff2600;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 36pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: -18pt;&quot;&gt;-&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;God earnestly wanted His people to obey Him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When Yeshua taught the Parables and when He delivered His letters to the churches in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Revelation 2 &amp;amp; 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and He said, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&quot;Let him who has ears to hear, let him hear&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; He wasn’t simply saying I hope your ears can hear the sound of these words, He was indicating that He had communicated to the crowds and the churches needed to heed and obeyed; to act upon His encouragements and His rebukes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff2600;&quot;&gt;James 1:22-25 says, 'Don’t deceive yourselves by only hearing what the Word says, but do it! For whoever hears the Word but doesn’t do what it says is like someone who looks at his face in a mirror, who looks at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like. But if a person looks closely into the perfect Torah, which gives freedom, and continues, becoming not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work it requires, then he will be blessed in what he does.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff2600;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Now most Christians at this point will say, &quot;Your telling us to go back under the law&quot; and I would say &quot;Absolutely not!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We are saved through faith in Christ alone through grace alone because of the completed work of the cross. We cannot add to our salvation one iota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Once we become believers however, we are to undergo a transformation from living a rebellious, reprobate life to a life that obeys and honours Christ. What precisely are we supposed to obey?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Yeshua said, &quot;If you love Me, you will keep My commandments.&quot; (Jn 14:15)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; What commandments was He talking about? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff2600;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When Paul wrote to the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Corinthians&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, he was dealing with a serious mess in that body of believers. They were Gentiles who were behaving abominably. They were greedy, selfish, conceited, self-indulgent, immoral and trampling each other for position and power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff2600;&quot;&gt;1 Corinthians 6:9-11, 'Don’t you know that unrighteous people will have no share in the Kingdom of God? Don’t delude yourselves - people who engage in sex before marriage, who worship idols, who engage in sex after marriage with someone other than their spouse, who engage in active or passive homosexuality, who steal, who are greedy, who get drunk, who assail people with contemptuous language, who rob - none of them will share in the Kingdom of God. Some of you used to do these things. But you have cleansed yourselves, you have been set apart for God, you have come to be counted righteous through the power of the Lord Yeshua the Messiah and the Spirit of our God.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff2600;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Paul was listing a string of offences that were an affront to God and pointed out that the Corinthians were guilty of them all but because they were now believers in Yeshua, those lifestyles were now supposed to be left in their past. There was supposed to be a transformation from the old man to the new man. As a church, the Corinthian’s were in a deplorable state because they weren’t being obedient to the call to righteousness that comes to every believer. They were not obedient to Shema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Remember the Parable of the Sower?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The farmer sowed his seed and some fell on the path and was eaten by birds, some sprang up and then withered from the sun, some were choked by weeds and some fell on good soil where it put down good roots, it grew and produced a crop. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Matt 13)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff2600;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When the Word of God enters the soil of a broken-hearted, repentant person, it takes root and that person will 'shema'…they will hear and obey what the Word of God says and that will produce a life of &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;godly fruit&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Through an obedient disciple, God can do great things for the His purposes and for His people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;And it’s through His grace lavished on us that we become equipped to be obedient to His Word…and again, not for salvation but as evidence of salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

Some of the paint was flaking off and it had become damaged from pollution and humidity. It was in such disrepair that in 1977, Pinin Barcilon was asked to undertake a restoration effort of the masterpiece. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Heavy coats of varnish, glue and poor attempts by other painters filling in the gaps with their own interpretations had to be removed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Once the work commenced, a particularly productive day may have revealed a section of the painting the size of a postage stamp but it wasn’t until 1999 that the final work was completed. The restoration of the ‘Last Supper’ took 22 years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It’s like taking a 2 dimensional black and white drawing and transforming it into a 3 dimensional, colour animation. It’s the same picture but vastly richer and more significant. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Today, it’s open to the public to walk through. The tunnel still has water running through it, fed by the Gihon Springs and while the water only reaches to a person’s mid calf, the tunnel is completely black until you come out into daylight at the end. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Archaeologists have revealed only a portion of the pool as the remainder of it lies under land belonging to the Greek Orthodox Church who refuse permission to excavate the remainder of the site at this stage, but it’s believed this ancient pool is approximately 49 x 61 metres. When it was excavated, coins from the 2nd Temple era were discovered embedded in the plaster walls confirming it as the real Pool of Siloam. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Also discovered alongside this pool was a first century street, a main thoroughfare that would have been the very last portion of road that pilgrims making their way to the Holy City would have walked on their way up to the Temple to celebrate the 7 mandatory feasts of the Lord each year. It’s very likely that the Pool of Siloam was one of the water sources that these same pilgrims would have used for spiritual cleansing before entering the Temple proper. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Without living water there is no life. Living water is flowing water as opposed to dead stagnant water that putrefies and kills those that drink it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

13513,Home Group - Walking In The Dust Of Our Rabbi Pt 2,"&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/724407_24295926%20small.jpg&quot; width=&quot;380&quot; height=&quot;285&quot; style=&quot;margin: 20px; float: right;&quot; alt=&quot;724407 24295926 small&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Walking In The Dust Of Our Rabbi Pt 2&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Throughout the centuries different countries have pictured Yeshua through the lens of their own culture. An artist in Peru would paint Him with dark braided hair and a poncho with a Peruvian face, while artists in Europe have painted him with blond hair and blue eyes and the Ethiopians portray Him as a tall black man, none of them ever stopping to ask what a Jew from 2000 years ago looked like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We mentioned Leonardo’s painting of the Last Supper last week and much of Christendom has been greatly influenced by it with regard to their understanding of that event, but it’s culturally wrong in every detail. The painting shows the feast during the daytime but Passover meals always take place at night; the people are white Caucasians instead of Semitic; there are none of the necessary elements of the Passover meal on the table; there is ordinary leavened bread instead of unleavened Matza and the meal of grilled eels and oranges is completely non-kosher. They were sitting on chairs at a table when they would have actually been reclining on soft cushions around a low table on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It’s important for us to look at Yeshua and what He said and did, through the Hebrew cultural eyes &amp;nbsp;of those living in Israel 2000 years ago. Yeshua’s teachings were life-changing and to His first followers what He taught was astounding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;They left all their earthly belongings and risked their relationships in order to follow Him but as earth-shattering as Yeshua’s teaching was 2000 years ago in a Jewish cultural context, we modern readers react to His words and actions with a ho-hum attitude because we don’t understand the context and setting. We simply read words on a page, quickly passing over their significance, but what if we were to scrub away the past 20 centuries of western influence and thinking and look at the original context of what Yeshua said and did and while His words won’t change, they’ll carry greater insight and significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yeshua’s environment and cultural setting was of Rabbis, synagogues, nomads, farmers, despotic kings, brutal oppressive regimes and shepherds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The very first church birthed in Jerusalem had the best advantage because they were eye witnesses to all Yeshua did and they knew the people involved in all that happened around Him and when you read the first chapters in the book of Acts you can almost feel their excitement and passion, their honesty and faith is very evident in their prayers. They were joyful when they met together and they were incredibly generous toward each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Most people don’t realise that the very first church in the book of Acts was made up entirely of Jews and they continued to study Torah and worship in the Temple, they maintained the celebration of the feasts and they recognised Yeshua as the fulfillment of every aspect of them. In fact, the church didn’t have any contact with Gentiles until Peter had his vision of the unclean animals in the sheet and then he promptly went to the house of Cornelius at Caesarea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When you compare the conduct of the Jewish congregations with Gentile congregations it’s obvious that the Jewish church was in a far healthier condition because they already had an amazing understanding of the Bible - they’d been raised in it their whole lives. The Gentile church at Corinth for example was a mess, they were selfish, greedy, immoral, self-indulgent and they were proud of it, but the Jerusalem church - all Jews - were for the most part, thoughtful, generous, selfless, moral and righteous in their behaviour. The Jewish church wasn’t given to the same level of worldliness that the Gentile church was because they already understood the precepts of God as laid out in Torah - Scriptures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There was another difference between the Jewish and Gentile believers…while the Gentiles knew Yeshua as their Saviour and God, the Jewish believers knew Him as their Rabbi but what does that mean in practical terms? To follow your Rabbi meant you were obligated to memorise His words and live according to His &lt;i&gt;halakhah&lt;/i&gt; or His interpretation of how God’s Word teaches us to live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This is really important because it demonstrates to us that we are not the ones who determine what the Scripture means, HE is the One who teaches what His Word means. Remember Yeshua is the author of Scripture because He is the Word made flesh who lived among us. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(John 1)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The world is always wanting to re-shape Yeshua to fit their expectations and the Catholic church ran a competition in the year 2000 called 'Jesus 2000' because they were searching for a new 'image' of Yeshua for the next millennium and the prize winning painting was called 'The Jesus of the People' and it was of a dark-skinned, thick-lipped feminine looking man. Nothing about Him was even slightly Jewish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If you study the Bible with others please be very careful about taking turns in sharing what you think a portion of Scripture means to you. Scripture means precisely what God intended it to mean when He revealed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;But what does it mean to be a disciple?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Most of the church has been greatly influenced by a Greek mindset which predominantly interprets Scripture spiritually or philosophically but the Hebrew mindset is predominantly physical, practical and literal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We predominantly look at spiritual applications to Scripture while the Jew would look at how to practically live out what the Scripture says. So to be a disciple according to the Hebrew mind is to practically, physically imitate your Rabbi, to obey Him in all things and even take on his persona and mannerisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This is what it means to &lt;i&gt;Walk in the Dust of your Rabbi&lt;/i&gt;. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Jewish disciples didn’t automatically join a Rabbi’s classes, they had to be personally hand-picked and chosen by the Rabbi personally and once they responded and accepted the offer of a disciple-ship, they were then committed to learn everything from the Rabbi, following him everywhere, watching every nuance, absorbing every word, obeying implicitly every tiny instruction until the students finally looked and sounded exactly like their Rabbi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Walking in the dust of the Rabbi conjures up the image of a disciple walking so closely to his Rabbi that the dust stirred up by the Rabbi’s steps settles all over the disciple, he literally steps into the very footprints of his teacher following him ever so closely so as not to miss a single word, or look, or expression. When Yeshua called His disciples and said &quot;Follow Me&quot;, He was literally calling them to 'walk after' Him, live alongside Him day and night and learn from Him every moment of every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;He didn’t hand them a textbook and have them sit exams; His teaching was most akin to an apprenticeship. This is the Hebrew mindset while the Greek mindset is to study information, retain the information in your head and answer an exam and with a passing mark you are declared qualified. To the Jewish mind, you walk alongside, you watch, you listen, you apply and you do under the supervision of your teacher and you keep doing it until you master it. You have more than a head full of knowledge, you have knowledge, but you have the practical understanding and application and you are then able to teach and train others to both understand and do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If the Rabbi says it, it’s true and must be obeyed. This is what is means to be a disciple of Yeshua. As a disciple walks closely after his Rabbi, his heart begins to change, he learns to love his Rabbi, to understand what motivates his Rabbi and what moves his Rabbi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The disciple love for his Rabbi grows and alters his motivations and his great desire is to please His Rabbi. He begins to adopt mannerisms and phrases and habits that mimic his Rabbi and even begins to talk like His Rabbi, repeating His words to those he comes in contact with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We are to walk as closely as we can to Him…obviously not physically because His physical presence is seated beside His Father in glory, but we have the Word of God - and every single word in both the Old and New Covenant Scriptures is the expression of Yeshua Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff2600;&quot;&gt;John 5:39 Yeshua said to the religious leaders, &quot;You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; it is these that testify about Me.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff2600;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The only Scriptures they had at that time were the Old Covenant Scriptures, so when we study the entire Bible (the whole counsel of God) we should be looking at it and placing Yeshua at the centre of it so that it reveals Him. We are to learn it and live it, for practical application from the examples set in it from those who lived during the Old Covenant time frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;So when we - 21st century disciples of Yeshua - read the Bible, are we reading it with a view to imitate our Saviour or simply to obtain knowledge or interesting information?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This is a challenge to me personally because I know I study from a Greek mindset because it’s the prevailing mindset of the west with regard to study and education. The real challenge for Yeshua’s disciples today is to read His Word and set ourselves to practical living and expression of His teaching so that we look and sound just like Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Our Rabbi has personally chosen us to be His disciples and that is a privilege beyond our comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;Yeshua said to His disciples in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff2600;&quot;&gt;John 15:16, &quot;You did not choose Me but I chose you, and appointed you that you would go and bear fruit, and that your fruit would remain, so that whatever you ask of the Father in My name He may give to you.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff2600;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;He chose us so that we would learn from Him, imitate Him, talk like Him, serve like Him, love like Him, and represent Him before the eyes of the watching world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;After His resurrection Yeshua said to this to His disciples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff2600;&quot;&gt;Matthew 28:19-20, &quot;Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptising them in the name of the Father, and the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and lo, I am with you always even to the end of the age.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff2600;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;They were to go and make disciples throughout all the nations, disciples who would be committed imitating the Father, Son &amp;amp; Holy Spirit; they were to teach those disciples to observe (attend to carefully, to guard, to keep, to undergo something) all that Yeshua had originally taught them and while they were producing and making disciples throughout the world - those who would obey and imitate Yeshua - He Himself would be with them throughout all of human history, walking with them throughout that process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Paul imitated Yeshua, Paul was a deeply committed and faithful disciple who never flinched from the call on his life to preach the Gospel to the Gentile world and he never stopped preaching the Gospel to his Jewish countrymen despite the danger it posed to himself, and then he told his own disciples within the churches to imitate him. He was like a father to them, he wasn’t merely a teacher or tutor to them, he loved them like a father and looked upon them as his children in the Lord. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(1 Cor 4:16)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Let’s imitate Paul, who imitated Yeshua. Let’s study His words, His life, His service and His love and walk in the dust of our Rabbi by becoming just like Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

13325,Home Group - Overview For Jewish Roots Of Our Faith,"&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/1058605_60297588%20small.jpg&quot; width=&quot;336&quot; height=&quot;241&quot; style=&quot;margin-right: 8px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;With a number of changes taking place on the Vision Radio Network and the fact that The Journey breakfast show has morphed into Rise &amp;amp; Shine and has been cut back to 3 hours instead of 4, it seemed like a good opportunity to revamp Home Group too and to start looking at some fresh subject matter as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;For the past 3 years approximately, we’ve been looking at different Bible personalities in greater depth to get a better insight into who these individuals were, what they did and what we can learn from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We looked at both New and Older Covenant characters, Apostles, prophets, kings, Jews, Gentiles, righteous and unrighteous people and every one of them played a role in God’s plan of redemption for His physical people Israel and the spiritual redemption of all mankind who would come to believe in His Son, Yeshua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This year we’re going to begin looking at the Hebrew roots of our Christian faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We’ll take a look at things Yeshua taught, things He did as well as the things said and the things asked of Him by others and we’ll look at them in their cultural and religious setting in Israel 2000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Have you ever heard a one-sided telephone conversation? You might be able to identify the topic being discussed and you might even be able to judge if the conversation is friendly or hostile. You might be able to determine the end result of the conversation, but without hearing both sides of the conversation, you really can’t understand with real clarity what was really discussed or what both parties truly believe and agreed or disagreed on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Learning about our Hebrew roots is very much like listening to both sides of the conversation; it fills in all the missing details and significance and provides far greater clarity and understanding of the subject matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In some cases, it even brings about a complete paradigm shift in understanding and this isn’t something you need to fear because Paul taught us that it’s imperative we correctly handle the truth of the Word of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;2 Timothy 2:15, ‘Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the Word of Truth.’ &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The word for ‘accurately’ in the Greek is ‘orthotomeo’ which means to make straight, to teach truth directly and correctly. It means ‘orthodox’. In a religious context it means to stay straight and to not deviate from the orthodox teaching to alternate or new interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It’s the same root word for orthodontics, professional dental practitioners who make crooked teeth straight. We are to correctly interpret the truth revealed in the Word of God ensuring that we don’t deviate from its originally intended meaning, but to remain orthodox in our study of God’s Word and not to embrace alternate views and opinions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;All of &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;2 Timothy 2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is about Paul admonishing Timothy about teaching the Word of God to faithful men who would in turn teach others the same things. He goes on to warn Timothy not to get caught up arguing or wrangling with those who want to move away from the clear meaning of Scripture to argue over worthless and alternate words and opinions. The whole point of Paul’s message to Timothy is to remain faithful to the clear teaching of God’s Word and to teach it to other faithful men who would in turn teach it to others. This message is vitally important to believer’s today especially so because of the myriad of aberrant and false teachings choking the church today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Sometimes when we talk about the Hebrew roots of our faith we get accused of trying to force people back under the ‘Law’ which is not true at all. So right from the outset we want to make very clear some very important points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We are not calling for anyone to live under the ‘Law’.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We are not advocating an embrace of Judaism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We do not believe Christians are obligated to begin living like Jews.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What we want to do is introduce Christians to the very rich, deep and incredibly practical and spiritually liberating significance of the Hebrew roots and foundations of our faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The history of the church over the past 2000 years has done such a thorough job of extracting every hint of ‘Jewishness’ from Christianity that the majority of secular Jews throughout the world don’t even realise that Yeshua was in fact a Jew Himself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There are a great many ‘Christians’ today who also don’t realise that Yeshua was Jewish or that the Apostles and first believer’s to make up the church after the resurrection were all Jews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;But there are some important facts that we need to stress and make clear and they are;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yeshua was and remains to this day, a Jew.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Every single Apostle was Jewish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Abraham was the first Jew.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Isaac and all his descendants after him are Jewish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;All the Old Covenant prophets (apart from the Gentile Balaam) were Jewish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;All the Old Covenant kings born in the line of David were Jewish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Our Old and New Covenant Scriptures were written by Jews except for chapter 4 of Daniel which was written by the Babylonian Gentile king Nebuchadnezzar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Scriptures that Yeshua and His Apostles taught from were in fact the Old Covenant Scriptures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Hebrew heritage of the Christian faith is so deep and rich that we could never plumb the depths of it in an entire lifetime and it’s a tragic indictment on the church that it deliberately separated every vestige of ‘Jewishness’ from our faith because of its deep-seated hatred and animosity toward the Jewish people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;To prove the point, here’s what Constantine said in his correspondence to the church universal at the conclusion of the Nicene Council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 12.25pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This is an excerpt from the letter by Constantine to the non-attendants of the council at Nicea. (Eusebius, Vita ConsL, Lib 11118-20)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 12.25pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;When the question relative to the sacred festival of Easter arose, it was universally thought that it would be convenient that all should keep the feast on one day; for what could be more beautiful and more desirable than to see this festival, through which we receive the hope of immortality celebrated by all with one accord and in the same manner? It was declared to be particularly unworthy for this, the holiest of festivals to follow the customs (the calculation) of the Jews, who had soiled their hand with the most fearful of crimes, and whose minds were blinded in rejecting their custom, we may transmit to our descendants the legitimate mode of celebrating Easter; which we have observed from the time of the Saviour's passion (according to the day of the week).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 12.25pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;We ought not therefore to have anything in common with the Jews, for the Savior has shown us another way; our worship following a more legitimate and more convenient course (the order of the days of the week): And consequently in unanimously adopting this mode, we desire, dearest brethren to separate ourselves for it is truly shameful for us to hear them boast that without their direction we could not keep this feast. How can they be in the right, they who, after the death of the Savior; have no longer been led by reason but by wild violence, as their delusion may urge them?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; They do not possess the truth in this Easter question, for in their blindness and repugnance to all improvements, they frequently celebrate two Passovers in the same year. We could not imitate those who are openly in error. How then, could we follow these Jews who are most certainly blinded by error? For to celebrate a Passover twice in one year is totally inadmissible.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 12.25pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;But even if this were not so it would still he your duty not to tarnish your soul by communication, with such wicked people (the Jews). You should consider not only that the number of churches in these provinces make a majority, but also that it is right to demand what our reason approves, and that we should have nothing in common with the Jews.&quot;“&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This wasn’t the start of anti-Semitism in Church history but it was most definitely a major and significant turning point that not only steered the church away from her Hebrew roots, it became the sanctioned ‘green light’ for all Christians to hate and target the Jewish people for on-going hatred and persecution and that’s precisely what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;I mention this because it reveals in large part why the Christian church rejected its Jewish roots and it explains why so many Christians lack understanding of the importance and significance of their Jewish roots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Romans chapters 9, 10 and 11&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are an excellent presentation by Paul on God’s everlasting and unfailing covenant with the Jewish people. In no way does Paul argue that Jews are automatically saved because they’re not; they must and can only be saved through faith in Yeshua as their Messiah in the same way Gentiles are saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The book of Romans is what some call the definitive writing on the doctrine of salvation and Paul goes into incredible detail explaining that the religious, the pagan and the moral man is dead in his sins and without hope except through the cross of Yeshua. Paul explains that only through faith can any individual know real salvation from sin and thus have an eternal assurance of security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Why would Paul - right in the middle of his teaching on salvation and eternal security - suddenly begin a defense of God’s covenant with the Jewish people? He does so to emphasise that God never breaks His promises or His covenants and that despite Israel’s national rejection of her Messiah, God was still going to fulfill His promise to Israel and that at the right moment in history future, all Israel would be saved. Not because of anything they’ve done but rather because God is the One keeping His covenantal promises to them. As individuals they must repent and put their faith in Yeshua, but nationally one day, all Israel will be saved. So Paul in the middle of his teaching about salvation uses Israel as an example of God’s commitment to keeping His promises – since God will never reject His chosen people, we can trust Him to not reject His adopted people either. Our salvation is dependent on God not on our efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Once he finishes his teaching about God’s faithfulness to His covenant with Israel, Paul gets right back into his teaching on salvation and what’s interesting is Paul’s warning to the Gentile believers with regard to their attitude toward his Jewish countrymen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Romans 11:11-32, ‘“I say then, they did not stumble so as to fall did they? May it never be! But by their transgression salvation has come to the Gentiles, to make them jealous. Now if their transgression is riches for the world and their failure is riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fulfillment be!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;But I am speaking to you who are Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of Gentiles, I magnify my ministry, if somehow I might move to jealousy my fellow countrymen and save some of them. For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;If the first piece of dough is holy, the lump is also; and if the root is holy, the branches are too. But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them and became partaker with them of the rich root of the olive tree, do not be arrogant toward the branches; but if you are arrogant, remember that it is not you who supports the root, but the root supports you.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;You will say then, ‘Branches were broken off so that I might be &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;grafted in&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;.’ Quite right, they were broken off for their unbelief, but you stand by your faith. Do not be conceited, but fear; for if God did not spare the natural branches, He will not spare you either. Behold then the kindness and severity of God; to those who fell, severity, but to you, God’s kindness, if you continue in His kindness; otherwise you also will be cut off.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;And they also, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again. For if you were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and were grafted in contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these who are the natural branches be grafted into their own olive tree?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;For I do not want you brethren, to be uninformed of this mystery - so that you will not be wise in your own estimation - that a partial hardening has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in; and so all Israel will be saved, just as it is written, ‘The Deliverer will come from Zion, He will remove ungodliness from Jacob, this is My covenant with them, when I take away their sins.’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the standpoint of the Gospel they are enemies for your sake, but from the standpoint of God’s choice they are beloved for the sake of the fathers; for the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;For just as you once were disobedient to God, but now have been shown mercy because of their disobedience, so these also now have been disobedient, that because of the mercy shown to you they also may now be shown mercy. For God has shut up all in disobedience so that He may show mercy to all.’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In these passages from Paul, he explains that while Israel has had a &lt;i&gt;‘partial hardening’&lt;/i&gt; because of their rejection of their Messiah, it was for the explicit benefit of the Gentiles so they could be &lt;i&gt;‘grafted in’&lt;/i&gt;. Grafted into what? The new Gentile believers were not grafted into Catholicism or Lutheranism or Presbyterianism or any other ‘ism’, they were grafted into the &lt;i&gt;‘Commonwealth of Israel’&lt;/i&gt;. Yeshua didn’t come to start a new religion, but to graft the Gentiles INTO the original olive tree of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When Paul wrote to the Ephesian church (which was predominantly Gentile) he said this to them...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ephesians 2:11-16, “Therefore remember that formerly you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called ‘Uncircumcision’ by the so-called ‘Circumcision’, which is performed in the flesh by human hands - remember that you were at that time separate from Christ, excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. But now in Christ Jesus, you who formerly were far off, have been brought near by the blood of Christ. For He Himself is our peace, who made both groups (Jews and Gentiles) into one and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall, by abolishing in His flesh the enmity, which is the Law of commandments contained in ordinances, so that in Himself He might make the two into one new man, thus establishing peace, and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross by it having put to death the enmity.’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;So the Gentile believers are the wild olive branches ‘grafted in’ to the tree with the natural branches gaining our sustenance and support from the root of the tree which is Christ. What is the tree...it’s the ‘commonwealth of Israel’ – NOT ethnic Jews, but grafted into the Commonwealth of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Gentiles are grafted into Israel when they come to faith in Yeshua as their Messiah, they are not to be arrogant and think themselves better or more pious and loved by God more than the natural Jewish branches, in fact they’re supposed to extend mercy and kindness to the natural branches with the same measure of kindness and mercy that God showed them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;With this in mind, we’re going to embark on a series of studies that look at the Jewish/Hebrew roots of our Christian faith because this is what we’ve been grafted into. Paul told Timothy to teach what he himself had been taught to faithful men, to study to show himself approved and to teach God’s Word accurately and faithfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We’ll be looking at God’s Word in its narrative context, its social and political context and its spiritual context which will mean looking at what Yeshua taught through Hebrew eyes in a 2000 year old cultural setting. You’ll be amazed at just how relevant and life transforming it will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This name means ‘Lord’.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Last week we looked at Cyrus king of Persia; this week we take a look at Darius the Mede, he is mentioned throughout &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Ezra 4, 5 &amp;amp; 6, Nehemiah 12, Daniel 5, 6 &amp;amp; 9, Haggai 1 &amp;amp; 2 and Zechariah 1 &amp;amp; 7.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some have become confused about who actually conquered Babylon because both Cyrus and Darius have been credited with this military victory. It’s not really a great conundrum because the kingdoms of Media and Persia were a combined military force. Originally Media was the dominating nation that held Persia in subjection, but upon the rise of Cyrus military conquests, the domination switched to Persia. The relationship or agreement between the Medes and Persians remained, but the power based moved from Media to Persia. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;God told Belshazzar on that fateful night He wrote on the kings’ banquet hall that his kingdom was going to be overthrown by the Medes and the Persians. Cyrus was the victorious conqueror who, upon taking Babylon without a fight, was informed by Daniel that he had been named by the Prophet Isaiah more than 150 years earlier and that he would be responsible for the rebuilding of Jerusalem and the Jewish Temple. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, Cyrus was very likely accompanied by Darius the Mede and upon taking control of Babylon and all nations that were under Babylonian rule, Cyrus returned to his own country of Persia leaving Darius to rule Babylon, or perhaps he was installed in Babylon shortly after Cyrus took the city, it’s not really known for sure. The book of Ezra demonstrates the reigns of both Cyrus and Darius; Ezra talks about the opposition the Jews had to deal with when they were trying to rebuild Jerusalem and the Temple. After the decrees were given for the rebuilding to take place, the non-Jews living in Judea caused them a great deal of trouble and opposed them at every turn but the account in Ezra names both Persian kings...&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;“all the days of Cyrus king of Persia even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.” Ezra 4:5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, this verse infers that there may have been quite a period of time between these two monarchs and if that’s the case, it’s curious that they’re both credited with conquering the city of Babylon. If there is a time period between them, it’s possible Darius is credited as being the conqueror of Babylon and the overthrow of Belshazzar because he was present and a participant at the invasion of Babylon but didn’t hold any specific role or title at that time. He was appointed king of the Persian Empire after the death of Cyrus and his son Cambyses. So Darius probably was a leading military participant in the overthrow of Babylon, but didn’t come to be king over Babylon until after Cyrus was dead. This shows that both Cyrus and Darius were militarily speaking the conquerors of Babylon and Belshazzar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Outside of the Bible there isn’t a lot of information about Darius, but we can learn about his character by looking at him in the book of Daniel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Darius was 62 years old when he became king; he was a wise strategist and knew he needed solid leaders spread throughout the empire so he appointed 120 satraps (governors or viceroys over provinces) over the entire kingdom to help maintain order and rule the empire efficiently. Over the 120 satraps, Darius appointed 3 commissioners (chiefs or overseers) to ensure they did what they were supposed to do and they would report directly to Darius on how things were being handled throughout his kingdom. Daniel was 1 of the 3 commissioners. So far so good. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Dan 5:31, 6:1-2)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Envy and jealousy is a terrible sin, it hurts others and ultimately hurts the one indulging in it. “Green-eyed Monster” is an apt description of this destructive character trait.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Job 5:2 says ‘For anger kills the fool and envy slays the silly.’ Proverbs 6:34 says, ‘For jealousy drives a man into a rage; he will show no mercy when he takes revenge.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(CJB)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Daniel was an incredibly hard working man, he served faithfully and he distinguished himself among both the other 2 commissioners and the 120 regional governors. The Bible says that he possessed an extraordinary spirit and did such an incredible job that Darius was planning to appoint him over the entire kingdom! &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Dan 6:3)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Daniel had the same kind of spirit that Joseph had; both these men lived such integrous lives that those they served trusted them with everything they had be it a household to run (Potiphar), a jail where Joseph was wrongfully kept for years; a nation (Egypt) or an entire empire like Persia. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This caused an envy overload in the commissioners and governors and they jointly conspired to destroy Daniel. They watched him and investigated him and &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Daniel 6:4 says, ‘The other chiefs and the viceroys tried to find a cause for complaint against Daniel in regard to how he performed his governing duties, &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;but they could find nothing to complain about, no fault; on the contrary, because he was so faithful, not a single instance of negligence or faulty administration could be found.’&lt;/span&gt; (CJB)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The only way they could think of to undermine Daniel, was to make him compromise his faith in God. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Dan 6:5)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;They knew they would never get Darius to agree to get rid of Daniel; Darius loved and respected Daniel more than all of them, so they decided to appeal to Darius’ ego instead. They jointly approached Darius and told him that they all agreed that the king should issue a decree that was only to last for 1 month (30 days), and this decree would forbid every person in the kingdom from making a petition (prayer or request) of any man or god other than Darius the king himself. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;What greater injection to a man’s ego could there be? This was in effect saying that Darius was greater than both men and gods; that he himself was actually divine. What’s more, anyone who dared to disobey this edict was to be thrown into a den of hungry lions! Darius should have noticed immediately that Daniel wasn’t present at this meeting with the governors and commissioners and had Daniel been there, Darius would have realised immediately that Daniel would never agree to such a ridiculous edict. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Daniel was very close to Darius and it’s curious that Daniel wasn’t there to notice this gathering of all these national leaders, so it’s possible he was elsewhere on official business perhaps in an ambassadorial role. No one knows really, but it’s amazing that Darius, who trusted Daniel implicitly, never thought to seek Daniel’s opinion on this matter. Perhaps this reveals the extent of Darius’ inflated opinion of himself. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;What kind of twisted minds would come up with such a malevolent and sadistic punishment? What kind of ego would agree to such a sadistic punishment? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Proverbs is very true when it says that &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;“jealousy drives a man into a rage; he will show no mercy when he takes revenge.’ (Pro 6:34)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, Darius’ ego was sufficiently inflated to make him agree immediately and he signed the edict that was from that moment on irreversible according to the law of the Medes and Persians. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Dan 6:7-9)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;When Daniel heard about the edict, he simply continued to serve Darius as he had always done, but he continued to pray 3 times a day to God, in front of his open window that faced the direction of Jerusalem. The conspirators knew Daniel was an uncompromising man, and as a group they went to Daniel’s home and found him praying and they promptly went straight to Darius with their accusation against Daniel. This is what we call entrapment!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;They confronted Darius with his own law...&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;”Didn’t you sign a law...”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; When Darius was confronted with the news that Daniel was the ONLY one who was guilty of breaking this law he was mortified. In fact, when the conspirators told Darius that Daniel had broken the law, they described him as &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;“That Daniel, one of the exiles from Judah, respects neither you, your majesty, nor the decree you signed; instead, he continues praying three times a day.” (Dan 6:13) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;That’s like saying &lt;i&gt;“That Jew”&lt;/i&gt;, as though they wanted to remind Darius of Daniel’s inferior ethnicity. It’s a special kind of targeted racism that the Jewish people have experienced every century since their slavery in Egypt. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Darius knew he’d been conned and I imagine he felt inner shame and embarrassment at how gullible and egotistic he’d been. He knew he’d been manipulated by a group of jealous, envious, spiteful and malicious men. Daniel was his most faithful and loyal servant and Darius’ ego was going to cost Daniel his life. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The king tried in vain to come up with some means of saving Daniel from what can only be described as one of the worst possible ways to die; being eaten alive by lions. Of course the conspirators knew there was no way to skirt the law, it was irrevocable even for the king himself. Darius had no alternative but to command Daniel to be put into the lions pit and when he did he said to Daniel, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;“Your God, whom you are always serving, will save you.” (Dan 6:14-16)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The interesting thing about this situation is that Daniel’s unwavering dedication to God made him an uncompromising servant of the king despite the fact that Darius was a pagan. Darius (and Nebuchadnezzar before him) recognised this fact. Daniel was never ashamed of Yahweh and he lived an exemplary life to the point where absolutely no one could find a single solitary thing with which to find fault in him. Not one!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scripture doesn’t say that there were any miraculous accounts that Darius witnessed to make him think that Daniel’s God was real, he may have heard the story of Isaiah’s prophesy that named King Cyrus more than 150 years before Cyrus was born; he may have heard rumours of Daniel’s interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar’s dream and his ability to interpret the writing that appeared on the wall during Belshazzar’s last party revealing that Babylon was going to fall to the Medes and Persians, he may have even heard rumours about Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego’s miraculous escape from Nebuchadnezzar’s furnace...we don’t know...but we do know that he held Daniel’s God in very high esteem because of the character and integrity that he saw in Daniel. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;That night, Darius refused to eat, he stayed awake all night fasting and more than likely praying to Daniel’s God and very early in the morning he hurried to the lion pit and as he got close he called out in anguish, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;“Daniel, servant of the living God! Has your God, whom you are always serving, been able to save you from the lions?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp; Note that he called Yahweh the &lt;i&gt;“living God”&lt;/i&gt;. And wonder of wonders...Daniel called back from the pit, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;“May the king live forever! My God sent His angel to shut the lions’ mouths, so they haven’t hurt me. This is because before Him I was found innocent; and also I have done no harm to you, your majesty.” (Dan 17-22) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Daniel disobeyed a man-made law but that man-made law required him to disobey God’s Law. As far as God’s Law is concerned, it supersedes man’s laws if man’s laws require people to disobey God. If man’s laws don’t require us to break God’s Laws then we’re expected to obey them. Daniel was an innocent man who had been deliberately set up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Darius knew he’d been manipulated because of the unfounded jealousy of all the other commissioners and governors and he had them tossed into the lion pit and they were dead before they’d even hit the bottom. What Job said about the envious is very true; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Job 5:2, ‘For anger kills the fool and envy slays the silly.’ (CJB)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;What did this event do to the heart of Darius the Mede, king of Persia? It changed him in the same way that Nebuchadnezzar was changed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Daniel 6:25-28, ‘King Darius wrote all the peoples, nations and languages living anywhere on earth: “Shalom Rav! (abundant peace!) I herewith issue a decree that everywhere in my kingdom, people are to tremble and be in awe of the God of Daniel. For He is the living God; He endures forever. His kingdom will never be destroyed; His rulership will last till the end. He saves, He rescues, does signs and wonders both in heaven and on earth. He delivered Daniel from the power of lions.” So this Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and also during the reign of Cyrus the Persian. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The interesting thing about this speech is that there is no record of God doing any wondrous signs in the heavens during the reign of Darius, and the closing of the mouths of the lions wasn’t something Darius saw with his own eyes because the pit was closed and sealed. God’s miraculous salvation of Daniel was done without an audience. But Darius came to know and understand that Yahweh was the only ‘living God’ as opposed to the dead idols he was used to, he came to understand that Yahweh was &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;the only&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; God who was all-powerful and supernatural because Daniel should have been utterly consumed by those lions by daybreak. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Therefore, Darius knew that Yahweh and only Yahweh could possibly be responsible for the creation of the heavens and the earth, He alone is the One True Living God and the only witness that Darius had to the authenticity of God was the uncompromising, integrous and faithful example of Daniel. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is a challenge to all believers today to stop being embarrassed to name the name of Yeshua, and to be visible in our faith and to live faithful and blameless lives that can then impact those around us for the sake of the Gospel. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shalom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mandy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;PS. Since this is the last Home Group for this year I’d like to take this opportunity to say thank you for all your encouragement over this past year and before and for the incredibly favourable and positive feedback you’ve given regarding these Bible studies. There is nothing more satisfying to me than hearing people say how much their love for God’s Word has grown and how much they’ve enjoyed learning more and more about Him and the people He used to fulfil His purposes. May the Lord bless you and keep you over the Christmas / New Year period. Shalom Rav.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",2013-12-19 00:00:42,mworby
12699,Home Group - Cyrus,"&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/1058605_60297588%20small.jpg&quot; width=&quot;302&quot; height=&quot;216&quot; style=&quot;margin-right: 8px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;Cyrus (Ko’resh)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This name means ‘Posses thou the furnace’. (I have no idea what the significance of this is!!!)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cyrus the Great of Persia is mentioned in the Bible in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Ezra 1:1-8; Isaiah 44:28 &amp;amp; 45:1-4; 2 Chronicles 36:22-23 and Daniel 1:21, 6:29 &amp;amp; 10:1.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cyrus was the founder of the Persian Empire, his name is of Indian heritage as Kurus and is apparently Aryan. The original meaning of Aryan comes from the Sanskrit word ‘arya’ which means ‘noble’ which was a national name to identify those who worshipped the Vedic deities (foundational Hindu deities), especially Indra who was the supreme leader of all their gods, who controlled rain and thunder and wielded a lightening bolt and rode a white elephant. Pictures of Indra riding on his elephant look incredibly similar to Hindu images, in fact if you didn’t know better, you would think he was one of the many millions of Hindu deities. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The term ‘Aryan’ was adopted by the Nazi’s in the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century to describe what they believed was a pure and superior race of people, namely those of Nordic descent, but this is not the original meaning the word. In the Persian context, the original word is evident in names like Alani and Ir, and even the word Iran is the Persian word for ‘land or place of the Aryans.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;So it’s very likely that the ancient Persians were originally from India. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cyrus came from the Pasargarde tribe which was situated where the city of Istakhr was established which today is in southern Iran. The kingdom of the Medes was the dominating power of that region and the Persians were subject to them. The Medes held territory to the north and the Persians established themselves in the south and the Medes were happy to have Cyrus fill the role of vassal to the king of Media. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As Cyrus power grew however, he rebelled against the Medes and ultimately defeating them and the Persian Empire went on to conquer the Babylonians, Egyptians, Lydians, Spartans and Asia Minor and his reign spanned from 559-529 BC. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The habit Cyrus developed upon capturing a city or nation was to allow the people to worship their traditional gods, he never tried to force conversion from their traditional beliefs to the adoption of his own which was Zoroastrianism. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The archaeological evidence for Cyrus is quite limited; there are historical writings from Herodotus, the Cylinder of Cyrus that was excavated which is covered with inscriptions, cuneiform inscriptions in Babylon and of course the Biblical account, and all of these confirm each other. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Last week we learned about Belshazzar’s demise when the Persians invaded Babylon and killed him. Babylon was considered to be impregnable; it was built over the Euphrates River in order to provide the city with an in-exhaustible water supply. The city walls straddled the river and they had steel gates reaching from the walls to the water preventing anyone from entering the city from the river itself. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;It was Cyrus who took the city in the year 539 BC, and according to Herodotus, Cyrus diverted the Euphrates River causing the level to drop which allowed the Persian army to enter the city under the river gates where the river had been. According to the account, no one noticed the soldiers entering the city; they opened the gates to their comrades and the Persians simply walked in and took the city without a fight. Not only that, it’s been said that it was 3 days before everyone in the city finally realised they were now under Persian rule. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;In &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Jeremiah 29:4-12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, God told His people that they were going into exile in Babylon because of their sin and rebellion, that they were to build homes and have families and to be responsible citizens there, and that after 70 years He would bring them back to their own land. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Jeremiah 29:10-12; “For thus says the Lord, ‘When seventy years have been completed for Babylon, I will visit you and fulfil My good word to you, to bring you back to this place. For I know the plans that I have for you’, declares the Lord, ‘plans for welfare and not for calamity to give you a future and a hope. Then you will call upon Me and come and pray to Me, and I will listen to you.’”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This was God’s explicit word to His people who were going to be in exile in Babylon. His plans to prosper them didn’t remove the fact that they were still going into exile and that their nation, capital city and holy temple were going to be destroyed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Keep in mind that Jeremiah gave them this prophecy before his own exile from Jerusalem, so this was long before the 70 years of exile was over and Jeremiah was believed to have died around 570 BC. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Isaiah lived from 740-681 BC and he prophesied about Cyrus in 711 BC and this is what he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Isaiah 44:27-28 &amp;amp; 45:1-5; ‘“It is I (God) who says to the depth of the sea, ‘Be dried up!’ And I will make your rivers dry.’ It is I who says of Cyrus, ‘He is My shepherd! And he will perform all My desire.’ And he declares of Jerusalem, ‘She will be built,’ and of the temple, ‘Your foundation will be laid.’” Thus says the Lord to Cyrus His anointed, whom I have taken by the right hand, to subdue nations before him and to loose the loins of kings; to open doors before him so that gates will not be shut. “I will go before you and make the rough places smooth; I will shatter the doors of bronze and cut through their iron bars. I will give you the treasures of darkness and hidden wealth of secret places, so that you may know that it is I, the Lord the God of Israel, who calls you by your name. For the sake of Jacob My servant, and Israel My chosen one, I have also called you by your name; I have given you a title of honour though you have not known Me. I am the Lord, and there is no other; besides Me there is no god. I will gird you, though you have not known Me”.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The prophet Isaiah prophesied in 711 BC that Cyrus would be used by God to rebuild the city of Jerusalem and the Temple. Cyrus wasn’t born until 576 BC and he didn’t conquer Babylon until 539 BC. This means that God revealed to Isaiah that He was going to use a pagan king named Cyrus to rebuild the city of Jerusalem and the holy Temple 77 years before Nebuchadnezzar was born; 124 years before Jerusalem and the temple were even destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar; 135 years before Cyrus himself was born and 172 years before Cyrus conquered Babylon. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This prophecy by Isaiah details the drying up of rivers; the fear of Cyrus that would loosen the loins of kings who would fall before him (which happened to Belshazzar when he got the message on the wall that his kingdom was being taken from him by an invading army); that God would open up gates that won’t be shut and he would make the way smooth for him; that the treasures that had been taken and kept hidden would be given to him; that his very name was known to God and God was orchestrating all these things so Cyrus would understand that God alone is the One True God and he was chosen for the express purpose of facilitating the rebuilding of Jerusalem and the Temple for the Jewish people. And all this while Cyrus didn’t even know that Yahweh existed!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Because Daniel was promoted to 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; highest ruler of Babylon on the very night Cyrus took the city, it’s believed that Daniel may have been the one to welcome Cyrus into the city as the new ruler and conqueror and it would undoubtedly have been Daniel who showed Cyrus the prophecy by Isaiah. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Can you imagine what it must have been like for Cyrus when he read Isaiah’s prophecy only to find out that the prophet who wrote it had been dead for 142 years? (Isaiah died in 681 BC) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cyrus obeyed the Word of God and he gave the command for Jerusalem and the Temple to be rebuilt and he returned the confiscated treasures that had been taken as well. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(2 Chron 36:22-23; Ezra 1:1-8, 3:7, 4:3-5, 5:13-17, 6:3,14)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The question you can’t help but ask is whether or not Cyrus became a believer and follower of God? He knew that Yahweh was the one and only true God, however there are no declarations of devotion to Him like that of Nebuchadnezzar and Darius. He does call Yahweh the ‘God of Heaven’ but there doesn’t appear to be any evidence that he forsook the worship of his traditional gods to worship Yahweh alone. If this is the case, he is absolutely accountable for his rejection of God. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Proverbs 21:1 says; ‘The king’s heart is like channels of water in the hand of the Lord; He turns it wherever He wishes.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are some who believe that God takes no active role in the lives of mankind and there are some who believe that because of the fall, God cannot legally take an active role in the lives of mankind and both these views are wrong because they contradict Scripture.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Firstly because they deny the sovereignty of God and secondly because the Bible reveals all the way from Genesis to Revelation how God is intimately involved in the affairs of mankind and indeed, He turns the hearts of kings – and all men for that matter – in the direction He determines they should go.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;He does this to ensure His plans and purposes are fulfilled as this confirms repeatedly the plans He has laid out in His Word; He does this for His great honour and glory and He does this for our great good. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;God can and does use both Jew and Gentile, believer and unbeliever to fulfil His plans and purposes because He alone is sovereign and holds all things in His hand and knowing this should give us great comfort and assurance that He can hold us too. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The other thing this does for us is assure us that God doesn’t judge non-believers unfairly or unrighteously. God is always fair and just and in one way or another, He will reveal Himself to everyone and what they do with that information or knowledge or revelation makes them accountable before Him. God will never condemn or judge someone unfairly. In remote and unreached areas of the world, how He chooses to reveal Himself is His business but our responsibility is to remain faithful to His Word where He has us. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;His Word tells us to preach the Word and make disciples and the salvation of men’s souls is entirely the domain of God Himself. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(2 Tim 4:2, Matt 28:19)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

12632,Home Group - Belshazzar,"&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/954634_94521374%20small.jpg&quot; width=&quot;321&quot; height=&quot;214&quot; style=&quot;margin-right: 8px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;Belshazzar (Bail,shats’air)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This name means ‘Bel protect the king’.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We read about Belshazzar in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Daniel 5 and 7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and for many, many years those who constantly cry out that the Bible is wrong used this Babylonian king as evidence for their case. They said that Daniel was wrong because there was no non-Biblical evidence that such a king ever existed. However in 1881 Assyriologist Hormuzd Rassam discovered at Sippar in Babylonia the temple of the sun where he also discovered the clay cylinder of Nabonidus. This cylinder is now in the Pergamon Museum in Berlin Germany and there is a copy of it in the British Museum in London and on this cylinder are writings that refer to Belshazzar, king of Babylon confirming yet again that the Bible is accurate. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Belshazzar was quite young, around 36 years old when he was king; he was decadent, idolatrous, immoral, disrespectful, arrogant and proud. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Between the end of &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Daniel chapter 4 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;and the beginning of &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;chapter 5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is a span of around 23 years. Daniel was about 80 years old and the 70 years of Jewish exile were complete. There were several kings between Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar, and it’s important to note that according to Biblical theology, Israel is the theological centre of the world; only those kings and nations that are directly important or connected to the history and plan of Israel and God’s plan of redemption for mankind are mentioned and this is also the case regarding prophecy yet to be fulfilled. There are several major world empires that are not directly or seemingly indirectly mentioned in Scripture, like the British, Russian, Mongol and Spanish Empires, because they’re not connected directly with the unfolding of God’s plans as laid out in Scripture.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The kings between Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar were Evil-Merodach (Amel-Marduk), Nergal-sharezer (Neriglissar), Labashi-Marduk and then Nabonidus. Nabonidus was not related to Nebuchadnezzar, the previous kings were but were assassinated (Nabonidus being one of the conspirators responsible for their assassination) and in order to legitimise his reign it’s believed he married a member of Nebuchadnezzar’s family thereby marrying into the royal line. It’s believed that Belshazzar was already an existing heir of Nebuchadnezzar who was adopted by Nabonidus in a bid to be seen as a legitimate king with a legitimate offspring and heir with a legal right to the throne. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;So Belshazzar was called Nebuchadnezzar’s son, he was in fact Nebuchadnezzar’s grandson and as far as the ancients were concerned, son and grandson were considered the same; King David was called the ‘father’ of the Messiah. God said to Israel many times that He would extend mercy on them for the sake of their ‘father’ David. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nabonidus’ royal standing was precarious and he still didn’t feel safe (even with a legitimate heir) so he moved his capital to a place called Tayma in the middle of Arabia and for 14 of his 17 year reign he did not set foot in Babylon. For the most part, Nabonidus was considered to be a fairly decent man, he was not considered cruel or barbaric and he wasn’t a war monger despite his complicity the assassinations of those he usurped. He was defeated in battle by Cyrus, king of the Medes and Persians out in the wilderness away from Babylon and he was taken captive and this left Belshazzar as king of Babylon. It’s possible Belshazzar filled the position of regent in Babylon while Nabonidus ruled the empire from Tayma but that’s speculation in large part but it would have certainly made it easy for him to simply slip into the role of king once Nabonidus was out of the picture. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;From the time of Nebuchadnezzar’s death, the Babylonian Empire was in decline, each succeeding king was weaker and less effective than the other, there was little stability because there was so many rulers over such a short period of time and Belshazzar was the worst of them all. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;His empire was falling apart, his step-father Nabonidus and his army had been destroyed by the Medes and Persians and Belshazzar’s response was to host an enormous party for 1000 nobles. This is like Nero fiddling while Rome was burning!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Daniel 5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; retells the story of Belshazzar bringing all the sacred cups and vessels of the Temple that had been captured at the fall of Jerusalem so that he, his wives and concubines and his guests could use them to toast all the false gods of gold, silver, bronze, iron, wood and stone. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The obscene thing about this story is that Belshazzar would have known his own family history. Belshazzar was 13 when Nebuchadnezzar died and He would have known what kind of man his grandfather Nebuchadnezzar was and he would have known about his dreams and visions, his 7 years of insanity and subsequent restoration to the throne and of his conversion and belief in Yahweh. He would have known about the prophet Daniel who was the Prime Minister of the kingdom during his grandfather’s reign, who had been a faithful and loyal servant to him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;He would have seen the failures of those who tried or were too young to rule Babylon well after Nebuchadnezzar died and he knew that the Medes and Persians were rising in power and were a real and present threat to his empire and the people he was responsible for. His response was to throw a party and insult the One True God Yahweh, whom his great grandfather knew to be real and whose very public experiences proved Yahweh to be God. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most of us know the story well, that during his feasting and toasting of false gods, suddenly the fingers of a man’s hand appeared and wrote a message on the wall of the banquet hall terrifying Belshazzar so badly that he collapsed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Daniel 5:3-6, ‘Then they brought the gold vessels that had been taken out of the temple, the house of God which was in Jerusalem; and the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines drank from them. They drank the wine and praised the gods of gold and silver, of bronze, iron, wood and stone. Suddenly the fingers of a man’s hand emerged and began writing opposite the lampstand on the plaster of the wall of the king’s palace, and the king saw the back of the hand that did the writing. Then the king’s face grew pale and his thoughts alarmed him, and his hip joints went slack and his knees began knocking together.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Belshazzar called all his supposed wise counsellors and conjurors together so they could translate the message but they were clueless. He promised fancy clothing, jewellery and the position of 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; highest in authority over the empire to the one who could explain it but there was no-one and he went into a panic. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then the queen entered the hall, (while this is only speculation, it was possibly his mother, and may even have been his grandmother) and not one of his wives because they were already attending the banquet), she had obviously heard about this supernatural phenomena, entered the hall and went immediately to Belshazzar to tell him that there was a man who would be able to tell him what the message on the wall was – Daniel – the man who had served his grandfather faithfully, the man who had been able to tell his great grandfather what he dreamed and what his dream meant. Daniel, the man of God that Belshazzar had completely disdained and disregarded as a nobody. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Daniel came before the king, he would have seen at a glance the sacred vessels of the holy temple, the wine and overindulgence, the decadence and debauchery all around him and at 80 years of age, he probably didn’t care if he offended this pathetic, foolish and arrogant young king. Daniel was a man of integrity and he knew his God. He stood alone before Nebuchadnezzar as a teenager and honoured God with his words and stood alone and uncompromising in his conduct even in the face of death. He wasn’t about to change now. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Belshazzar asked him if he was able to provide an answer for him, something his own advisors and occultists couldn’t do...and if so, he’d lavish gifts and authority on him. Daniel doesn’t respond to him with the traditional obligatory niceties like “long live the king”...he basically told him to keep his gifts for himself! Daniel didn’t hide the disgust he felt for this man. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Daniel 5:18-29, ‘”O king, the Most High God granted sovereignty, grandeur, glory and majesty to Nebuchadnezzar your father. Because of the grandeur which He bestowed on him, all the peoples, nations and men of every language feared and trembled before him; whomever he wished he killed and whomever he wished he spared alive; and whomever he wished he elevated and whomever he wished he humbled. But when his heart was lifted up and his spirit became so proud that he behaved arrogantly, he was deposed from his royal throne and his glory was taken away from him. He was also driven away from mankind, and his heart was made like that of beasts, and his dwelling place was with the wild donkeys. He was given grass to eat like cattle, and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven until he recognised that the Most High God is ruler over the realm of mankind and that He sets over it whomever He wishes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Yet you, his son Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, even though you knew all this, but you have exalted yourself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of His house before you, and you and your nobles, your wives and your concubines have been drinking wine from them; and you have praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood and stone, which do not see, hear or understand. But the God in whose hand are your life-breath and all your ways, you have not glorified. Then the hand was sent from Him and this inscription was written out. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Now this is the inscription that was written out: ‘Mene, (me’nay) Mene, (me’nay) Tekel, (te’kal) Upharsin’ (per’ass). This is the interpretation of the message: ‘Mene (me’nay) – God has numbered your kingdom and put an end to it.’ ‘Tekel (te’kal) – you have been weighed on the scales and found deficient.’ ‘Peres (per’ass) – Your kingdom has been divided and given over to the Medes and Persians.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Belshazzar couldn’t renege on the gifts and political promotion he promised and immediately gave them to Daniel which put Daniel into an incredibly important place for when Darius the Mede conquered the city that very night, but Belshazzar was executed that very night when the Medes and Persians invaded the city of Babylon...a fortified city considered to be impregnable. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We should learn a number of very important lessons from this miserable account of Belshazzar. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We are the most foolish people on earth if we refuse to learn the lessons of those around us. We see the messes they make and how God rescues them and transforms them and yet we defiantly dig our heels in and refuse to surrender to Him. A wise man learns the lessons of others. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(1 Cor 10:11-12)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;All men are responsible and accountable for their actions and we cannot lay blame at the feet of others. We ignore and defy God at our own risk. Rom 1 says we are ‘without excuse’ because God has made Himself known to everyone. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Rom 1:20)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;God hates pride and arrogance. In fact, He opposes the proud. There is no scarier place to be than on the side that God Himself has declared He will oppose. It is incumbent upon us to deal ruthlessly with pride in our own lives lest we find ourselves facing God as His opponent. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Jam 4:6; 1 Pet 5:5)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;God has always made Himself known to the Gentile world and we can be absolutely assured that when He deals with Gentiles, He is absolutely fair, right and righteous otherwise He wouldn’t be a righteous God. (Melchizedek, king of Salem; Lot; King Abimelech; Pharaoh during Moses life; Pharaoh Neco during Josiah’s life; Jethro Moses father-in-law; Rahab; Ruth; Ninevites; Namaan; Balaam and others). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;God is perfect and righteous in all His dealings with men be they Jew or Gentile. We don’t always see how God tries to reach them, but rest assured He does and the consequences of rejecting Him is always the responsibility of the individuals themselves. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, God’s love for mankind is such that He is always extending grace and providing opportunities for them to respond to Him, and in these last days, it is through Yeshua His Son. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Hebrews 1:1-2, ‘God, after He spoke long ago to the fathers in the prophets in many portions and in many ways, in these last days has spoken to us in His Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the world.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

12535,Home Group - 'Hanukkah',"&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/724407_24295926%20small.jpg&quot; width=&quot;252&quot; height=&quot;189&quot; style=&quot;margin-right: 8px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;Hanukkah – Feast of Dedication or Festival of Lights&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;At the end of each year, around the same time that we celebrate Christmas (Dec 25), Jews around the world celebrate Hanukkah. Hanukkah falls on the 25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of Kislev on the Jewish calendar which is different every year on the Gregorian calendar that we use. This year, Hanukkah began at sundown last night, Wednesday November 27. Hanukkah lasts for a total of 8 days and as well as the name ‘Hanukkah’, it’s also called the Feast of Dedication and the Festival of Lights. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;Most people are unaware that this festival is mentioned in the New Covenant Scriptures; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; color: red;&quot;&gt;John 10:22-23, ‘At that time the Feast of the Dedication took place at Jerusalem; it was winter and Jesus was walking in the temple portico of Solomon.’ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;(Because this was winter time, we know this time of the year – November/December – was not when Yeshua was born. It was too cold to have sheep pasturing all night out in the fields therefore Yeshua was born during the warmer months, probably around the end of September at the end of summer.)&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;Hanukkah is not one of the mandatory ‘Feasts of the Lord’ but it became an annual feast of celebration because of the historic importance of an event that happened in Israel’s history. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;Antiochus Epiphanes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;In 175 BC Antiochus IV came to the throne of the Seleucid (Greco-Syrian) Empire and he amended his name by adding ‘Epiphanes’ to it which means ‘god manifest’, some believe it may also mean ‘the coming one’ but I’ve been unable to corroborate this one. He was such a maniac that the general populace called him Antiochus Epimanes which means ‘the madman’. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;To make a name for himself, he immediately embarked on an attempted expansion of his empire by trying to conquer Egypt, something none of his predecessors had been able to do. Because the Romans were growing in might and were spreading further east, Antiochus thought that having Egypt within the borders of his empire might prevent Rome from attacking him. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;There was considerable unrest within the Seleucid Empire, Hellenisation under Alexander the Great made accommodation for cultural variants within the multicultural population but Antiochus became an agent of cultural totalitarianism. He assumed absolute control over both the public and private life of every subject within his empire in a bid to bring stability and unity so he could embark on his conquest of Egypt. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/055%20seleucid%20empire%20%20parthian%20kingdom%20250%20bc%20map.jpg&quot; width=&quot;415&quot; height=&quot;265&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 8px; float: right;&quot; /&gt;Antiochus Epiphanes knew however, that the one people group that would give the most push-back over his new policy was the Jews because they stubbornly adhered to their ancient religious practices and teachings like no others in the empire. The Jewish population still primarily lived in their ancient national homeland which is geographically situated between the Seleucid Empire to the east and Egypt in the south. Judea was a buffer zone and he had to bring the Jews into submission if he was to take Egypt. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;To force capitulation from the Jews, Antiochus removed the legitimate High Priest serving in the Temple in Jerusalem – Onias – and installed Onias’ brother Joshua who was considered to be loyal to the Greeks and as soon as he became High Priest he changed his name to Jason, a Greek name. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;Antiochus introduced Hellenistic gymnasiums, encouraging the priesthood to participate in Greek sports which were performed nude, he allowed illegitimate Hellenistic Jews known as Tobiads, who were not of the priestly tribe of Levi, to purchase the position of High Priest which infuriated faithful religious Jews. Some of these corrupt Jews stole sacred vessels from the Temple which resulted in rioting in the streets by Jews who became incensed with the corruption. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;To make matters worse, Antiochus began accessing the Temple treasury to fund his military campaign against Egypt which was a dismal failure because he simply wasn’t powerful enough to take on the might of Rome and he took his frustration out on the Jews.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;He made studying or reading the Torah a crime; owning or being found in possession of a Torah scroll brought the death penalty; observing Shabbat carried the death penalty. He forbade circumcision, disobeying this law resulted in the murder of both mother and baby. He sold thousands of Jews into slavery; he forbade Temple worship; he indulged in every conceivable form of torture to force the Jews to renounce their faith. He placed an altar to Jupiter in the Temple, a statue of Zeus was placed above it and on his birthday, he slaughtered a pig on it, the date was the 25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of Kislev in 168 BC. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;This vile act was the proverbial straw that broke the camel’s back as far as the Jews were concerned and this is what sparked the Maccabbean Revolt. This violation of placing a statue of a false god in the Holy of Holies was called the ‘Abomination of Desolation’ in Daniel. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Dan 9:27)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;It took a while but the Maccabbees defeated the Seleucids and on the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; anniversary of the Temple’s desecration the Temple was re-dedicated. The corruptions that had been placed in the Temple were removed and then ceremonial cleansings were required and part of the dedication required the lighting of the menorah. At the time of the rededication there was only enough oil to last for 1 day, and it would take at least 1 week to produce another batch of oil prepared according to the Biblical instructions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;According to tradition, when the menorah was lit for the rededication, it burned for a full 8 days until the new batch of oil was ready. This miracle resulted in an 8 day festival to be celebrated every year and this is how the Hanukkah celebration began. This is a celebration about the miracle of the oil and the light in the Temple not going out, it’s not a celebration of the military victory of the Maccabbees. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;The interesting thing is that this is a celebration that Yeshua participated in and the history that preceded it – the Abomination of Desolation – is in Yeshua’s own teaching with regard to the Last Days.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; color: red;&quot;&gt;Matthew 24:15, Yeshua said, “Therefore when you see the Abomination of Desolation which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand), then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;And the passage goes on to the end of the chapter. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;Because the Jews celebrated the rededication of the Temple every year, they were all very much aware of what the term ‘Abomination of Desolation’ meant; it referred to an evil pagan despot who placed a pagan statue in the holiest place on earth and sacrificed an unclean animal on the altar to it. It was truly an abomination of what was &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; most holy and sacred place in the world, by what was the most unholy and profane; it caused absolute desolation to their holy Temple. It was a real event that took place in their history.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;One day as Yeshua left the Temple his disciples were talking about all the Temple buildings and He told them that everything they could see around them would be destroyed and not one stone would be left upon another; this happened in 70AD under Titus Vespasian, he sacked Jerusalem and levelled the Temple and not one stone was left standing upon another! &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Matt 24:1-2)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; They walked to the Mt of Olives which overlooked the Temple and His disciples asked Him when this disaster would take place and about the signs that would precede His return and the end of the age. From this question we can know for sure that they already anticipated that He would be coming a 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; time and that it would be at the end of the age. It will be a literal return and there will be literal events that take place prior to it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;By the time you get to verse 25 and read about the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;‘Abomination of Desolation…standing in the holy place’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, you have no alternative but to come to the conclusion that the Temple which was to be destroyed (and was) in verse 2, is at some point going to be rebuilt by the time history reaches verse 25. And since they knew what the abomination was, they knew that another pagan despot would in fact defile this future temple by placing a pagan statue or altar in the holy place. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;Apparently, while the abomination by Antiochus Epiphanes was a fulfilment of Daniel’s prophecy in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Daniel 9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, Yeshua indicates that Daniel’s prophecy was really just a precursor to let us know what will take place in the future in the Last Days just before He returns. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;Hanukkah is a celebration of the light of God returning to His Temple and His sustaining power of it for His people. It’s a celebration of God keeping His promises to His people and that He is the Light of the World. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;When Jews celebrate Hanukkah, they use a 9 branched menorah, the centre branch is called the ‘servant’ just as it’s called for the 7 branched menorah used in the Temple. The servant branch is then used to light the other branches. On Hanukkah, 1 branch is lit from the servant on the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; night, 2 branches are lit on the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; night, 3 are lit on the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; night and so on. The menorah is placed in a window so that the light can be seen outside in the darkness because it shows those outside the way home. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;Yeshua is the Light of the World, and when we look at Him, He is our way home to the Father. The future in His hands and it will unfold according to His unfailing Word, but to all men Yeshua is and always will be the Light of the world!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; color: red;&quot;&gt;John 8:12, ‘Then Jesus again spoke to them saying, “I am the Light of the World; he who follows Me will not walk in darkness, but will have the Light of life.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This name means ‘May Nebo protect the crown’ or ‘Nebo defend my boundary’.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nebuchadnezzar is mentioned in many places in the Bible, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;1 &amp;amp; 2 Kings, 1 &amp;amp; 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Jeremiah and Ezekiel&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; all in relation to either his impending invasion of Israel for judgement or after the fact. But the most significant amount of information about Nebuchadnezzar can be read in the &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;book of Daniel&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;‘Babylonian’ is another name for the Chaldean (the Semitic peoples Abraham originally came from) and the ancient city is situated in present day Iraq.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Before the Babylonians rose to become a world empire, they were oppressed and suffered terribly under the Assyrians until Babylon rose up under the leadership of Nabopolassar, father of Nebuchadnezzar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nebuchadnezzar lived from 605 – 562 BC and he was a mighty warrior and military tactician. He not only prevented Egypt and Syria from encroaching on his territory, he conquered the Phoenicians and the Southern Kingdom of Judah in 586 BC as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nebuchadnezzar built the city of Babylon so that it became a city of splendour and came to be known as one of the most magnificent cities in the Middle East. Some archaeologists disagree with him, but Herodotus said that “Babylon surpasses in splendour any city in the known world.” He went on to say that the cities outer walls were 56 miles in length, 80 feet thick and 320 feet high – the wall was wide enough for 2 four horse chariots to pass each other. The city also had an inner wall, not quite as thick as the first but just as strong.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-mce-mark=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Inside this double fortress were smaller fortresses and temples containing immense gold statues made of solid gold and rising above the city was the famous ‘Tower of Babel’ which was very high and had a temple to the god Marduk on top of it. The most famous aspect of Ancient Babylon were the hanging gardens considered to be one of the 7 wonders of the ancient world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The name ‘hanging gardens’ is not quite correct, it should really be ‘overhanging gardens’; they were actually vaulted terraces raised one above the other held up by cube shaped pillars, the terraces were filled with earth and planted with huge trees and plants which were watered daily by a team of workers whose sole job was to transport water from the Euphrates River to the top of the terraces to water the gardens and keep them alive. The water that was quite possibly pumped to the top with a chain pump that would then filter its way down through the terraces to water all the plant life. Apparently Nebuchnezzar built the gardens to relieve his wife’s depression. She (Amyitis) missed her green homeland of the Medes and found the hot, dry desert of Mesopotamia depressing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;When Nebuchadnezzar became king he inherited all the politicians and sycophants that served his father; these ‘servants’ were in for a very rude shock because Nebuchadnezzar was a very cruel and very unreasonable and irrational man. He liked beauty, he was creative (as was evident with his majestic gardens) and he surrounded himself with the best looking and most intelligent people from both his own people and the people he conquered. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Dan 1)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;But...Nebuchadnezzar had a short temper and was known for his cruelty. The book of Daniel reveals that Nebuchadnezzar demanded his advisors and wise men reveal to him the dream he’d had and then reveal what it meant and when they couldn’t do it, he demanded all the wise men – even the ones not present – &amp;nbsp;to be slaughtered. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Dan 2)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;When Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah (Shadrach, Meshach &amp;amp; Abednego) refused to bow down and worship the golden image of Nebuchadnezzar he threw them into a blazing furnace even killing some of his own soldiers in the process. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Dan 3)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other historical writings reveal his cruelty too; when he led the Jewish captives from Jerusalem (this included Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah) he refused to let the captives rest because he feared they might pray repentantly and God might rescue them, they didn’t rest until they reached the Euphrates River and the boundary line of Babylon. Even then he made them lay down chained and naked and to increase their misery, he had their Torah scrolls turned into sacks that were filled with sand that they were forced to carry. During his celebrations he tried to force the Jews to play their sacred worship songs to entertain him and in honour of his gods, they bit off their own fingers so they couldn’t play or were executed. Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah were truly remarkable young men to endure that and still faithfully serve this vicious tyrant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;During his reign Nebuchadnezzar inherited his father’s kingdom which included the western provinces of Aram, the Cimmerians and the Scythians; Nebuchadnezzar extended his dominion and fought against and defeated not only Judah (The Southern Kingdom) but he quelled the rebellions of the Phoenician’s, and then conquered the Egyptians and the Arameans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-mce-mark=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Nebuchadnezzar was very arrogant and believed himself to be divine, he denied himself nothing and demanded unwavering, unquestioning loyalty from every one of his subjects. He was very immoral (which was not in the least bit shocking as his religion encouraged immorality) but some historians believe he had an interest in teenage boys.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-mce-mark=&quot;1&quot;&gt;What’s particularly interesting about Nebuchadnezzar is that he is the only Gentile who actually wrote an entire chapter of the Bible – &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot; data-mce-mark=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Daniel chapter 4&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. God gave Nebuchadnezzar a dream of a mighty tree that gave great provision to all living around it, but the tree was cut down and left in the field under the dew but with the promise that one day it would be restored, and this was a warning for him to give honour to God as the King of the Universe and not assume divinity for himself; Nebuchadnezzar was the tree and it was God alone who appointed Nebuchadnezzar to be king and he was subject to God’s will not his own. Because Daniel had proven himself faithful and loyal and because he’d provided an accurate interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar’s previous dream, poor Daniel was called upon to give the interpretation of this latest dream and he was really frightened to tell it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Unfortunately for him, Nebuchadnezzar ignored the warning and a year later judgement fell.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Daniel 4:29-33, “Twelve months later he was walking on the roof of the royal palace in Babylon. The king reflected and said, ‘Is this not Babylon the great, which I myself have built as a royal residence by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?’ While the word was in the king’s mouth, a voice came from heaven saying, ‘King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is declared: sovereignty has been removed from you, and you will be driven away from mankind and your dwelling place will be with the beasts of the field. You will be given grass to eat like cattle, and seven periods of time will pass over you until you recognise that the Most High is ruler over the realm of mankind and bestows it on whomever He wishes.’ Immediately the word concerning Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled; and he was driven away from mankind and began eating grass like cattle, and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven until his hair had grown like eagles’ feathers and his nails like birds claws.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Babylonian Talmud (which is not inspired Scripture by any means) claims that Daniel the prophet maintained care of Nebuchadnezzar during his 7 years of insanity and returned to serving him after he regained his mind and was restored to his throne. Amazing, considering what Daniel and his countrymen experienced at the hands of this most brutal of tyrants. Daniel's faithfulness was ingrained in his character, it was non-negotiable for him and was not dependent on who he was called upon to serve.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This also shows how great and merciful our God is even to the most wicked of men, like Nebuchadnezzar.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Daniel 4:34-37, “But at the end of that period, I, Nebuchadnezzar, raised my eyes toward heaven and my reason returned to me, and I blessed the Most High and praised and honoured Him who lives forever; for His dominion is an everlasting dominion, and His kingdom endures from generation to generation. All the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing, but He does according to His will in the host of heaven and among the inhabitants of earth; and no one can ward off His hand or say to Him, ‘What have You done?’ At that time my reason returned to me. And my majesty and splendour were restored to me for the glory of my kingdom, and my counsellors and my nobles began seeking me out; so I was re-established in my sovereignty, and surpassing greatness was added to me. Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise, exalt and honour the King of heaven, for all His works are true and His ways just, and He is able to humble those who walk in pride.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Daniel chapter 4 is the personal testimony of a Gentile king who was cruel, brutal, merciless, immoral, corrupt, unreasonable, unbelieving, delusional, suspicious and callous; but he came to know and believe in the One True God and after his own personal restoration, wrote in his own hand his living testimony of brokenness to forgiveness and restoration by God and sent his declaration throughout his entire empire.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is no reason not to believe that Nebuchadnezzar is in heaven. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;As an encouragement to those who have hard-hearted and unbelieving loved ones, Nebuchadnezzar is a graphic example to us that we should never stop loving or believing for them to come to saving faith in Yeshua. If God was able to save a man such as Nebuchadnezzar, He can save anyone! Never give up hope.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shalom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sukkot – Feast of Tabernacles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There are quite a lot of celebrations and anniversaries and feasts in the Jewish calendar but Sukkot (Su-coat) is the last of the mandatory feasts of the Lord commanded by God in the Bible; it’s the last of the Autumn feasts in the Jewish calendar and it’s also known as the Feast of Tabernacles or the Feast of Booths. Sukkot begins on 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of Tishri and runs for 7 days. Today, September 19 this year, is the first day of Sukkot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The word sukkot actually means ‘booths’, and this holiday is both a historical celebration as well as an agricultural celebration; historical because it reminds the Jews of their wilderness wanderings when they lived in temporary dwellings for 40 years after leaving Egypt, and agricultural because it’s a celebration of the ingathering of the harvest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Sukkot was instituted by God in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Leviticus 23:34-44&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and is also explained in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;Deuteronomy 16:13-17&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; this celebration requires the Jews to build booths or temporary dwellings to live in for 7 days. The dwellings are called sukkah’s and the roofs of the sukkah’s must be made of plants or plant materials such as branches, timber slats or bamboo and the like, which must not be nailed down or affixed, they must remain loose. There must also be small gaps that allow for a smattering of rain to come through (on the odd occasion that it rains) or to see the stars at night. Jewish families to this day build sukkah’s and in general eat all their meals in them, and many of them sleep in them as well. Even hotels in Israel prepare large sukkah’s for their guests to eat in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Because Sukkot is also a celebration of the harvest, most Jews decorate their sukkah’s with flowers and vines; fruits and vegetables are hung around in much the same way American’s decorate their homes for their annual Thanksgiving holiday with sheaves of corn and pumpkins and squash etc. In fact, the pilgrims who travelled to and settled America were particularly religious and they established the holiday of Thanksgiving because they wanted to demonstrate their thankfulness to God for His protection of them and for His sustaining them through successful harvests as they were establishing their new nation. For inspiration, they turned to the Bible and learned about God’s feasts and how they were celebrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Along with the sukkah’s they build and live in for a week, they also perform a special ‘wave’ ceremony with the ‘lulav’ – the ‘four species’ that represent the harvests they’re celebrating and this is a Biblical requirement found in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Leviticus 23:40&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. They make a bouquet of the 4 plants which are Etrog – a lemon-like citrus fruit; a ripe date palm frond; 3 myrtle branches; and a leafy branch of a willow tree.&amp;nbsp; All items must be in absolutely perfect condition and there is a special method of making up the bouquet. The ‘lulav’ is used each day during Sukkot so it must be kept in good condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;During Sukkot, candles are lit, prayers and blessings are recited and the ‘lulav’ is waved in a particular directions to symbolically acknowledge God’s all encompassing and surrounding presence. There is singing and storytelling, and there is particular emphasis placed on reading the book of Ecclesiastes to remind them of the transitory nature of life and the importance of not wasting time on futile things, but remaining faithful to God and pursuing Him rather than the fleeting pleasures of this world. Every day of Sukkot follows a similar format every day and they celebrate God and each other with great joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;On day 1 they will read from &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Leviticus 22:26-23, 44; Numbers 29:12-29, 16; Zechariah 14:1-21&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;; (Messianic Jews also read from &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;John 1:10-14, Revelation 7:1-10, 21:1-4&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;). Day 2 they will read from &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Leviticus 22:26-23, 44; Numbers 29:12-29, 16; 1 Kings 8:2-21&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;; (Messianic Jews also read from &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;John 1:10-14; Revelation 7:1-10, 21:1-4&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;). Day 3 they will read from &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Exodus 33:12-34, 26; Ezekiel 38:18-39, 16; Ecclesiastes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Day 4 they will read from &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Numbers 29:20-25&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Day 5 they will read from &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Numbers 29:23-28&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Day 6 they will read from &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Numbers 29:26-31&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Day 7 they will read from&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Numbers 29:26-34&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There is also a water ceremony during Sukkot, it was originally performed in the Temple; the High Priest would lead a procession to the Pool of Siloam where he would fill a golden vessel with water and return to the courtyard of the Temple and when the High Priest poured the water out before the people, they would wave their lulav and sing...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Save us we pray O Lord!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;O Lord, we pray, let us thrive!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;We bless You from the house of the Lord.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This is taken from &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Psalm 118:25-26&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; which is a Messianic psalm and it’s the very psalm the crowds were singing when Yeshua made His triumphal entry into Jerusalem riding on a donkey. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Matt 21:8-9; Luke 19:38; John 12:13)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The religious leaders knew the people were declaring Yeshua to be the Messiah and they demanded Yeshua stop them. Yeshua’s response was that if the people remained silent the rocks themselves would cry out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The fact that this Psalm is sung during a water ceremony is significant because Yeshua said He would give us living water to drink, water that would quench our thirst and satisfy us forever and this came to us through God the Holy Spirit. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(John 4:14, 7:38-39; Rev 21:6; Isa 55:1)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;During Temple times, the priests would light 4 enormous Menorahs and put on a bit of a light show with torch dances while the Levites provided the music and singing. These were wonderful times of enjoyment and celebration. Again, the significance of this is that Yeshua declared Himself to be the Light of the World. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(John 8:12)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;John 9:5-11&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Yeshua used the waters in the Pool of Siloam to heal the man who had been born blind and this resulted in his miraculous healing which enabled him to see the Light of the World face to face – the very One who gave him the living water of Salvation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Sukkot is a feast of great celebration and joy as God’s people remember how He led them out of bondage in Israel and sustained them throughout their wanderings; He provided for them daily, their clothing never wore out, their shoes never wore out, He provided them with food and water; He was visibly present with them day and night leading and directing them until He finally led them into their Promised Land. As mentioned above, it’s also a celebration of the harvest, a time to thank God for His blessing on the land and His provision through His creation toward His people. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Deut 8:4, 29:5; Neh 9:21; Exo 13:21-22, 14:19, 16:35; 1 Cor 10:4)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Prior to Sukkot the Jews celebrate their new year and new beginnings with Rosh Hashanah and their expectation is high as they await their Messiah and Rosh Hashanah begins the Days of Awe that are 10 days of repentance and preparation for Yom Kippur the Day of Atonement when a ‘scapegoat’ symbolically took their sin away after another goat gave its life as a substitute on behalf of the people. The substitute pays the penalty of sin, the scapegoat bears the burden of sin and carries it away, and the people are delivered and redeemed from the judgement of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Sukkot occurs immediately after Yom Kippur and it is a time of absolute joy, great rejoicing because the people have recognised their sin, returned to the Lord, repented with sincere grief and remorse and judgement has been removed. Now the time of celebrating their restored fellowship to God has come, they express their love, devotion and gratitude for His on-going provision, protection and sustaining of His people. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;During their wilderness wanderings, God’s house was the Tabernacle and He dwelt in the midst of His people in that Tabernacle. He wanted to be among them. Later, the Temple was built as a permanent structure. When Yeshua was born, we read in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;John 1:14&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, that He became flesh and &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;‘dwelt among us’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the word ‘dwelt’ means to &lt;i&gt;‘have one’s tabernacle’&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;‘abide or live in a tabernacle’&lt;/i&gt;. Yeshua Himself was the tabernacle of God who came to live among us. In fact every element and piece of furniture in the actual Tabernacle and Temple are symbolic of Yeshua and His mission of redemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There is a very important future fulfilment of Sukkot that we can’t ignore. Sukkot remembers God’s protection in the wilderness and His dwelling among them in His Tabernacle and it’s also the ingathering of the harvests as He sustains them. Yeshua tabernacled among us when He came to earth to live with us and His Gospel has spread throughout the whole earth. There is a future harvest yet to come and it will fulfil the promise God made to His people Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When the Jews rejected Yeshua the first time around, it opened the door for the Gentile world to come to faith in HIm and be grafted in to the Commonwealth of Israel &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Eph 2:12)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, but according to His promise to His people, the future in-gathering (harvest) of the Jewish people is absolutely assured. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Rom 11:25-29)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Sukkot is not only a celebration of past events in Israel’s history, it’s also a pre-celebration of the final and complete redemption and ingathering of Israel yet to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;These days the celebration has been extended to 9 days for the following reasons. The 2 days following Sukkot have been included and the ‘8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day’ is called Shemini Atzeret, because God mentions this 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day in&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Numbers 9:35&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, so it became the day of final assembly to close out the Sukkot celebration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day is Simchat Torah. Each week in Synagogues all around the world, a particular portion of the Torah is recited and focused on. The Torah is divided into 54 portions, almost 1 per week through each year and this means that the entire Torah is read by these congregations ensuring that they are learning all of God’s Word year after year. So ‘Simchat Torah’, which means ‘Rejoicing in the Torah’ – is about great joy because they’ve completed the yearly reading cycle of the Torah and great joy because they’re about to start the cycle all over again! In fact, during Simchat Torah, the last Torah portion from Deuteronomy is read and the first Torah portion from Genesis is read as well to indicate that the study of Torah never ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;A great deal of reverence is given to the Word of God. Torah scrolls are protected by special coverings and are stored in purpose built cupboards; they are never touched by bare human hands (gloves must be worn if the scroll has to be handled for some reason) and a ‘yad’ (Torah pointer) is used when reading so the reader doesn’t lose his place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Over the last 2 weeks we learned the basic story of Ruth and Boaz, how Ruth was a Moabitess who married into a Jewish family, then became a widow along with her mother-in-law Naomi whom she refused to leave, she also committed herself to loving and obeying Yahweh. Upon returning to Israel, they were poor and Ruth provided for them by gleaning in the fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The owner of the fields was Boaz, a close relative of Naomi, and upon following the instructions of her mother-in-law, Ruth made herself available to Boaz for the fulfillment of Hebrew Levirite Marriage (Yibbum) and this not only protected Naomi’s family line and inheritance, it placed Ruth, a Gentile woman in the direct lineage of Yeshua the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When interpreting Scripture, the Jews believe there are 4 levels of interpretation and this is called Pardes (an acronym).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Peshat (simple) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; the plain, simple and direct meaning of the text&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Remez (hint) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;the deeper meaning beyond just the literal direct meaning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Derash (search) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; the comparative meaning as given through similar occurrences elsewhere in Scripture&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Sod (hidden) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;the mystical meaning as given through inspiration or revelation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Remez, Derash and Sod interpretations must always, be in complete harmony and never, ever contradict or contravene Peshat interpretations, the plain and simple direct meaning of the text. If they do contradict or undermine the plain meaning of the text, they’re illegitimate interpretations and meanings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The story of Ruth is not only a historical account it’s also a ‘type’. While it obviously has Peshat meaning - a simple and direct understanding of the plain text - it also falls under both Remez &amp;amp; Derash interpretations because it hints at deeper meaning through what we see in the process of Yeshua’s redemption of both His people Israel and His Gentile Bride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;‘Yibbum’ - The Law of Levirite Marriage: This law comes from verses in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Deut 25:5-10&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; which says that if a married man dies without leaving a son to inherit, his wife is to be married to his brother in order that a son can be born who will carry on the name of the deceased husband. It also protected the property of the deceased ensuring it remained in the family line and tribal allotment as God ordained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If the surviving brother isn’t willing to enter into Levirite Marriage with his brother’s widow, an elaborate ceremony was held in public before the community elders where the brother says he won’t marry his sister-in-law and then he has to take his shoe off and the widow is supposed to spit on the ground in front of him (or even in his face) almost as an act of disgust because he doesn’t care about his brother’s lineage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yibbum was what Ruth was asking of Boaz, and he was willing to do this honourable thing for both Naomi and Ruth and as such Boaz became her ‘Go’el’ - her Kinsman-Redeemer. Kinsman meaning a relative and redeemer in that he was basically buying back that which had been lost in order to restore it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It’s very easy to see the parallels between the story of Naomi, Ruth and Boaz and the story of Israel, Yeshua and the church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Naomi is a ‘type’ of Israel in that she’s already in the covenant, she is part of the bloodline but she suffered great loss and was cut off and left destitute. Boaz is a ‘type’ of Saviour like Yeshua in that He is also in the bloodline and He is not only able but is willing to be the ‘Go’el’, the Kinsman-Redeemer who would pay the Bride-price to ransom that which was lost and restore it to full inheritance within the nation of Israel. Ruth is a ‘type’ of Gentile bride who leaves her pagan past behind and is like the wild-olive branch grafted in to the natural tree. She is the Gentile bride of Christ redeemed by the Kinsman-Redeemer who brings restoration not only to the bride but to the mother-in-law whose inheritance rights are restored in full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Feast of Shavuot (Pentecost) - &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Leviticus 23:16-22&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There are 7 Feasts of the Lord that God specifically required His people to observe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Pesach &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (Feast of Passover)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yom Habiikurim &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (Feast of Firstfruits)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shavu’ot &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;(Feast of Weeks/Pentecost) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;- leavened bread&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Rosh Ha’Shana &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (Feast of Trumpets)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yom Kippur &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (Day of Atonement) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;- leaven not mentioned&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Sukkot &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;(Feast of Tabernacles)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shavuot requires leaven in the bread; the offering of the first fruits of the wheat harvest to God, and along with the animal sacrifices for sin, 2 loaves of bread were also to be offered to the Lord. Leaven ALWAYS represents sin in the Scriptures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In modern Judaism, the Feast of Shavuot is a celebration of the giving of the Torah, however Torah isn’t mentioned at all in conjunction with Shavuot in the Bible; Scripturally, Shavuot was to be a celebration of the wheat harvest, as the feast of Firstfruits was the celebration of the barley harvest and Shavuot was to be celebrated exactly 50 days after the Feast of Firstfruits. Seven weeks from Firstfruits was 49 days and the ‘day after’ - the 50th day - was to be Shavuot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What do the elements mean? Well, the first 3 Biblical feasts were all fulfilled in Yeshua the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Passover - Yeshua was our Passover Lamb, slain in our place for our sin to bring us redemption through the shedding of His blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Unleavened Bread - We are set apart, sanctified. His own body never experiencing decay because of sin, simply because His body (the bread) was without sin (without leaven).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Firstfruits - Resurrection. Death could not hold Him down, and He was the first to be raised from the dead, never to be touched by death again, and we who believe in Him will follow His example, we are the fruit He has produced, but He was the ‘First’ fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Fifty days, two loaves and leaven - they basically point to the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and the birth of the Church making Jews and Gentiles both children of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The following is an excerpt from the book, ‘The Feasts Of The Lord’ by Kevin Howard and Marvin Rosenthal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;“The Son of God arose from the grave on Firstfruits. He then spent forty days with His disciples in post-resurrection ministry. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;(Acts 1:3)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; He informed them that it was necessary that He ascend to His Father (there to apply the benefits of His once-and-for-all sacrifice), but that He would not abandon them. He would send them His Holy Spirit who would come alongside to help in His absence. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;(Jn 14:16-17)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;They were commanded to tarry at Jerusalem until He came. &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Acts 1:4)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/b&gt;They waited as they were commanded. Their wait was not long - only ten days. And then it happened: the Spirit of God descended on those first century believers.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;For the Feast of Weeks (Pentecost), two loaves were brought to the Temple. They represented Jew and Gentile, now one in the Messiah with the coming of the Holy Spirit. Writing to the Ephesian believers, Paul said: &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘For He Himself is our peace, who has made both Jew and Gentile one, and has broken down the middle wall of separation...to create in Himself one new man from the two (Jew and Gentile), thus making peace.’ (Eph 2:14-15)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;There was to be leaven in those two loaves for the believers have not yet been glorified. During this age, there is still sin within the church....positionally in the Saviour, the church is perfected. Practically or experientially, she still has a long way to go. Messiah, the Head, is unleavened, the church, the body, still has leaven within her, therefore, leaven was to be included in these two loaves.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Despite the fact that modern Judaism says Shavuot is about celebrating the giving of Torah, on Shavuot every year the book of Ruth is read in synagogues all over the world and one cannot help but wonder why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;I personally believe that the book of Ruth is read throughout the Jewish world on Shavuot (Pentecost) because it is the anniversary celebration of the day that Yeshua prophetically fulfilled the meaning of this feast; that because of His blood sacrifice on Passover, and His sinless broken body bringing us sanctification during Unleavened Bread and His resurrection assuring us of eternal security during Firstfruits, He brought together both Jew and Gentile as His bride the church exactly 50 days later during Shavuot, the Feast of Weeks (Pentecost) uniting us through the power of the Holy Spirit. No longer seen as Jew and Gentile in His eyes, but one in Yeshua. Jew &amp;amp; Gentile equal in salvation but different in function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In the context of the entire chapter of &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ephesians 2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Paul discusses how Yeshua Himself broke down the separation barrier between Jew and Gentile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ephesians 2:17-18 says, “…and He came and preached peace to you who were far away (Gentiles), and peace to those who were near (Jews); for through Him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The book of Ruth is a beautiful picture of Yeshua ransoming both the nation of Israel and the Gentile world by His own willing act of sacrificial redemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yeshua is our Kinsmen-Redeemer bringing both Jew and Gentile together in one body.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

11791,"Home Group - Ruth, Naomi &amp; Boaz P2","&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/954634_94521374%20small.jpg&quot; width=&quot;289&quot; height=&quot;193&quot; style=&quot;margin-right: 8px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;Ruth (root’h), Naomi (Na’o’mee) &amp;amp; Boaz (Bo’aaz) Pt 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;To recap very quickly on last week, Naomi, her husband and 2 sons left their home in Bethlehem for Moab; her sons married and one by one, her husband and sons died leaving Naomi and her 2 daughters-in-law as widows. Orpah returned to her family but Ruth refused to leave Naomi’s side. They returned to Bethlehem and Naomi taught Ruth the ways of Judaism and sent her to glean for food in the local fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Ruth gleaned in the fields owned by Boaz who noticed Ruth and enquired about her and discovered she was a very loyal and gracious young woman. This is where we pick up the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Every harvest was followed by a celebration and Naomi instructed Ruth to go to the threshing floor once the partying had ceased, to where Boaz was sleeping, then she was to uncover his feet and then lay down at his feet. Many people completely misunderstand this gesture believing that Ruth was propositioning Boaz illicitly but this is not the case at all. When Boaz woke to find a woman at his feet he asked who it is and this is how she responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Ruth 3:9, ‘He said, “Who are you?” And she answered, “I am Ruth, your maid. So spread your covering (wing/skirt) over your maid, for you are a close relative.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The word for covering actually means the corner or hem or skirt of a garment, which was an emblem of authority. What Ruth was actually asking of Boaz was for him, as a relative, to become a Kinsman-Redeemer and marry her to maintain the lost family line of Naomi’s son who had been Ruth’s husband. As a relative Boaz could do this. It was an honourable thing she was asking of him, a very big deal actually and not in the least bit immoral. She was asking him to cover and protect her and the lost family inheritance with his authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Boaz was very impressed with this woman who could have gone chasing after any man who showed an interest in her which in turn would have left Naomi completely desolate, but she remained faithful to the family she married into and submitted to the tradition of Jewish Levirite Marriage to protect not only the family lineage, but the family property and inheritance as well, it was an all encompassing deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Remember the story of Judah and his daughter-in-law Tamar who married his son who died, then married her to his 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; son who died, and then withheld his 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; son. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Gen 38)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Remember when the Pharisees tried to trick Yeshua when asking about the woman who married 7 brothers one after the other and they all died. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Matt 22)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; These are references to the law of Levirite Marriage or ‘Yibbum’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Levirite Marriage was primarily enforced to ensure family lineage when a man died without heirs. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Deut 25:5, 47-50)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; This law also protected inheritance laws as well with the family member willingly redeeming both the widow and property for the assurance of future genealogical bloodlines and inheritances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Back to the story…Boaz was willing to marry Ruth to redeem her and the family property, but there was another relative somewhat closer than him who would have legal right ahead of Boaz and he approached him to ask him if he would be willing to redeem Naomi’s family inheritance, and the man was very willing – he was more than willing to redeem and gain the benefits of the family land allotment and property; he would protect the family to be sure but he was also going to benefit materially. But there was a catch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When he found out that marrying Ruth the Moabitess was part of the package deal, he quickly withdrew and forfeited his legal right to be the redeemer in this case. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In order to become a Kinsmen-Redeemer, he had to meet 3 specific criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;1. He had to qualify as a relative of the deceased man&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;2. He had to be able to fulfill the obligations required&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;3. He had to be willing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When Boaz asked his near relative if he was willing or not to become a Kinsmen-Redeemer he did so at the gate of the city where the official city elders gathered for business and social matters, he took 10 city elders with him to be public witnesses of the transaction and then presented his relative with his proposition. Initially, Boaz didn’t mention Ruth, he simply stated that his relative had first legal option to purchase (redeem) Naomi’s land on behalf of their deceased relative Elimelech (Naomi’s husband) to ensure it remained in the family line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;At first, the relative was more than willing and able to redeem the property…and then Boaz dropped the bombshell….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Ruth 4:5, “On the day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you must also acquire Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of the deceased, in order to raise up the name of the deceased on his inheritance.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The only thing stopping the relative from redeeming the land of Elimelech was Ruth. He then rejected the opportunity of becoming the Kinsmen-Redeemers without evening mentioning Ruth; he simply said he couldn’t redeem &lt;i&gt;“it”&lt;/i&gt; otherwise he might jeopardize his own inheritance. Scripture doesn’t say, but it may very well be that he was already married or just couldn’t bring himself to raise a child on behalf of someone else. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Ruth 4:6)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The curious and elaborate ceremony that then took place was meant to be a public declaration of the absolute release of any legal claim to Elimelech’s property and his son’s wife (Ruth). The ceremony is called Halizah and takes place in public, traditionally, the widow removes the sandal of her brother-in-law who won’t marry her to continue the family line of her deceased husband, spits in his face and says, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Thus it is done to the man who does not build up his brothers house.” (Deut 25:9&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In the case of Boaz and his relative however, Ruth wasn’t present for this ceremony at all and this is important and we’ll learn why next week. Boaz and the relative underwent the ceremony without rancor in the presence of the elders and Boaz proclaimed before them all that he himself would be the Kinsmen-Redeemer of the land inheritance of Elimelech, husband of Naomi, and their 2 sons Chilion and Mahlon as well as taking Ruth to be his wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Ruth and Boaz married and had a son whose name was Obed and when Obed grew up he had a son named Jesse and when Jesse grew up he had a son named David who was Israel’s greatest human king and from the line of David came the Messiah Yeshua who is and always will be Israel’s greatest and eternal King and Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;For her part, Naomi was restored and secure once again. Her losses became gains, she was protected and loved and the inheritance of her family had been redeemed by a willing and loving relative, and her greatest joy was that she was central in the caring and raising of her grandson Obed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Ruth 4:14-16, ‘Then the women said to Naomi, “Blessed is the Lord who has not left you without a redeemer today, and may his name become famous in Israel. May he also be to you a restorer of life and a sustainer of you old age; for your daughter-in-law, who loves you and is better to you than seven sons, has given birth to him.” Then Naomi took the child and laid him on her lap, and she became his nurse.’ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Naomi’s life, once again restored, with her family inheritance saved and preserved for her future generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Next week we’ll look at some of the prophetic implications of the book of Ruth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

11790,"Home Group - Ruth, Naomi &amp; Boaz Pt 1","&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/724407_24295926%20small.jpg&quot; width=&quot;293&quot; height=&quot;220&quot; style=&quot;margin-right: 8px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;Ruth (root’h), Naomi (Na’o’mee) &amp;amp; Boaz (Bo’aaz) Pt 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The name Ruth is not found in Ancient Hebrew, but it’s made up of two Hebrew root words, ‘ra’a’ and ‘ra’ which mean to tend or pasture, and a friend or associate and from these the name of Ruth developed. Ruth is seen as a feminine derivation of these root words which mean ‘female or lady friend’ or ‘female or lady companion’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The name Boaz appears to have different meanings according to different sources. The most reliable one has determined that the name has the root foundation from the word ‘azaz’ which means ‘be strong’. The name Boaz literally means ‘By strength’. The less convincing source holds that Boaz means ‘fleetness’ but this doesn’t give any source or origin for this meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When looking at the characters of both Ruth and Boaz they fit their name meanings perfectly; Ruth was the epitome of a faithful friend, daughter and companion to her mother-in-law Naomi after they both became widows. Boaz was an incredibly strong and loyal man when he willingly entered in the Levirite marriage by willingly marrying Ruth who was a Gentile convert to Judaism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The book of Ruth was possibly authored by Samuel during the rule of the Judges of which Samuel was the last. It was written after David’s birth because he is mentioned in the lineage at the very end of the book, but was written before Solomon’s lifetime because he was not mentioned in the family lineage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The book of Ruth is a literary masterpiece. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, a German writer, artist and politician born in 1749 described the book of Ruth as &lt;i&gt;“the loveliest, complete work on a small scale.&lt;/i&gt;” Dr John MacArthur describes the book of Ruth by saying, &lt;i&gt;“What Venus is to statuary and the Mona Lisa is to paintings, Ruth is to literature.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The book of Ruth is only 4 chapters long, and while it’s a beautiful love story, it’s an account that begins with great loss and grief and ends with great rejoicing and happiness; it’s also a book packed with prophetic insight and importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The story of Ruth is as follows...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;A woman named Naomi and her husband and 2 sons lived in the town of Bethlehem in Israel, the nation at that time was experiencing a severe drought so they moved east across the Dead Sea and into the land of Moab. There, Naomi’s 2 sons married Moabite women; something the Jews were not supposed to do but during the time of the Judges, everyone was doing what was right in their own eyes. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Jud 17:6, 21:25)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Tragedy followed this family and Naomi’s husband and both her sons died leaving Naomi and both her daughters-in-law - Ruth and Orpah - as widows. Naomi must have been an exceptional woman and mother-in-lw because both these young widows wanted to remain with her rather than return to their own families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It took some convincing on Naomi’s part but eventually Orpah relented to Naomi’s urging and returned to her family but Ruth refused point blank to leave her mother-in-law; she said…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Ruth 1:16, ‘But Ruth said, “Do not urge me to leave you or turn back from following you; for where you go, I will go, and where you lodge, I will lodge. Your people shall be my people, and your God my God.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;From this we know that whatever pagan background Ruth had, she renounced it and converted to absolute belief and trust in Yahweh; Ruth converted to Judaism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Naomi learned that things had improved in Israel and since they had no means of looking after themselves in Moab without husbands, she and Ruth set out on the journey to return to Bethlehem. It was Naomi’s job to now teach Ruth what Judaism believed and what the laws were all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Sadly, Naomi mistakenly believed that God had abandoned her, but her loss and tragedy were the very things that drove her to return to the Lord even though all she felt was pain and loss. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Ruth 1:13, 20-21)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Once they arrived back in Bethlehem, they had to find a way to survive. There was no such thing as social security in ancient cultures, there was still no king over the people, they were governed intermittently by different ‘judges’ interspersed with bouts of oppression from neighbouring enemies such as the Philistines. Life was still precarious but because God had instituted laws that protected and provided for the poor, the widows and orphans, and foreigners living among them, they had a far greater chance of survival. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Part of Jewish law required that landowners were only to harvest their crops once; this meant that any of the produce that was missed the first time through would not be gathered up, rather, it would be left and made available for the poor of the community to gather for themselves. This was called the Law of Gleaning. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Deut 24:19-22; Lev 19:9-10) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Naomi - an old woman - told Ruth about the law of gleaning and instructed her to go and work in the local fields to gather food once the first reaping had taken place. Ruth sought permission to glean in the fields of Boaz and Boaz noticed her; she was quite a beautiful woman but obviously not a local, and of course he wanted to know who was working in his fields…who they were and where they were from. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Bethlehem was a fairly small rural community and like most towns, everyone knows everyone else’s business and so they all knew that Naomi had returned from Moab without her husband and sons and only 1 single daughter-in-law who was a foreigner. They knew that Naomi had experienced enormous grief and loss when her husband and sons died, but they also recognized that Naomi had an exceptional daughter-in-law in Ruth. It’s because Ruth was such a loving and devoted daughter-in-law that she quickly became known as a very gracious woman and this is what Boaz learned when he made enquiries about her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In fact, Boaz was so impressed with the quality of this young woman, he told his own workers to deliberately ensure extra food was left in her way so she could gather more than enough food to take home; he instructed her to work close to the other women so she would remain safe and he sternly warned the young men that they were not to even attempt to take advantage of her. Basically, Boaz took it upon himself to make sure Ruth was protected and provided for without her realising what he was doing. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Ruth 2:3-17)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When Ruth returned home with such a large amount of food, Naomi was stunned and wanted to know whose field she’d been gleaning in and when she found out the owner was Boaz, she recognised that he was in fact a near relative. This is really important because it brings the Law of Levirite Marriage (Yibbum) into play which we can look at next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Naomi believed in God, but she thought God had turned against her because in her mind, tragedy means God is against you but this is not true. God had a plan; a big plan and He Himself was leading and directing Naomi both to go into Moab to start with and then to bring her back with Ruth. This plan will become clearer over the next two weeks as we look at the implications of all that happened to these women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The first lesson we need to really understand from today however is that material wealth and lack of sorrow doesn’t mean God is pleased with us any more than poverty, loss and grief mean God is displeased with us. The lesson for us is to honour God no matter what is going on in our lives and trust Him to lead us where He wants us to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Paul said in 2 Corinthians 12:10, ‘Therefore I am well content with weaknesses, with insults, with distresses, with persecutions, with difficulties, for Christ’s sake: for when I am weak, then I am strong.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

11753,Home Group - 'Yom Kippur',"&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/1058605_60297588%20small.jpg&quot; width=&quot;270&quot; height=&quot;193&quot; style=&quot;margin-right: 8px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;Yom Kippur – Day of Atonement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yom Kippur is the holiest and most solemn day in the Hebrew calendar and it was instituted by Yahweh in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Leviticus 23:27-28&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, there are 7 Feasts of the Lord and Yom Kippur in number 6 and this year it falls on Saturday, September 14 on our calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;All the Feasts of the Lord represent in various ways God’s plan of redemption and they reflect how Yeshua the Messiah, represents and fulfils them - Yom Kippur is no different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Man’s greatest predicament is that he is sinful and therefore separated from God - God is holy and cannot abide sin so does this mean that God cannot abide mankind and if so, is mankind without hope? Yes and No. God knew man would sin and had already instituted His plan of redemption; because God cannot and will not tolerate sin, He made sure that His plan of redemption would provide the means for man to be reconciled to Himself. The feasts of the Lord reveal how God will redeem mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yom Kippur takes place on the 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day of the Hebrew month of Tishri (the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; month of the annual Hebrew calendar but it’s the 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; month of the religious Hebrew calendar); Rosh Hashanah begins on 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; of Tishri and it begins what is termed the 10 ‘Days of Awe’ or &lt;i style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;‘Aseret Yemei Teshuvah’&lt;/i&gt; – the ‘Ten Days of Repentance’ and they are meant to be days of personal preparation, reflection and repentance for sin and wrong doing in whatever forms they’ve taken and subsequent turning to God by the individual. Yom Kippur has a very sacred and solemn Biblical history and unbelievable significance when we look at Yeshua’s act of redemption on our behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Leviticus 23:27-28, ‘On exactly the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement; it shall be a holy convocation (sacred assembly) for you, and you shall humble your souls and present an offering by fire to the Lord. You shall not do any work on this same day, for it is a day of atonement, to make atonement on your behalf before the Lord your God.’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The actual details of what took place on Yom Kippur are found in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Leviticus 16&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The name ‘Yom Kippur’ means a ‘Day like Purim’ in that it’s similar to the celebration of the Feast of Purim which is the celebration of deliverance and salvation from death and annihilation as we learned about in the book of Esther. The name was given over time because like Purim, the Jews were saved from annihilation and Yom Kippur is salvation from God’s judgement of annihilation through the substitutionary sacrifice of an animal. Yom Kippur comes from the root word ‘kafar’ which itself is derived from the word ‘kofer’ which means ‘ransom,’ and the word ‘ransom’ is parallel to the word redeem which means &lt;i style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;‘to atone by offering a substitute’&lt;/i&gt;. Yom Kippur then is about salvation and deliverance from sin through a substitute.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The ritual and requirements of Yom Kippur in the Old Covenant are both fascinating and gruesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The role of the High Priest&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Holy of Holies was the small room in the heart of the Temple and Tabernacle, and was only entered once per year and only by the High Priest on Yom Kippur. The High Priest would undergo extensive and numerous ceremonial cleansings, he would wear special garments specifically for this day and he would offer a bull as a sin offering for himself and his own family first. Then he would present 2 goats as sin offerings for the people. He would lead them to the doorway of the Tabernacle or Temple and there cast lots to see which one would be offered and which one would become the ‘scapegoat’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;One goat would then be sacrificed and the blood would be taken into the Holy of Holies and sprinkled on the Mercy Seat over the Ark of the Covenant, then the High Priest would leave, put his hands on the living goat to symbolically place the sins of the nation on it while at the same time, confessing the sins of the nation over it and then it would be sent out into the wilderness bearing the sins of the people and taking them away. A man was selected to follow the goat for up to 7 days to make sure it never returned bringing the sin back. (There is a traditional belief that the High Priest had a rope tied around his ankle in case he somehow displeased God and was struck dead and had to be dragged out, however this is not in Scripture and there is no Jewish tradition or history of this and it’s probably just a medieval legend).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There is a traditional Jewish belief in the Talmud (not Scripture) that says a scarlet cord was tied around the neck of the scapegoat that reportedly turned white as the goat was led away from the city. However, for the last 40 years before the Temple was destroyed in 70 AD (which would have been from the time of Yeshua’s death and resurrection) the scarlet cord failed to change colour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The role of the people&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yom Kippur is the only ‘holiday’ or ‘celebration’ that specifically requires the affliction or ‘humbling’ of the soul before God, or abstinence, or ‘self denial’ for the purpose of lamentation or grieving over sin. It’s the only ‘holiday’ where fasting is specifically commanded by God from His people. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Lev 16:29-34, 23:26-32; Num 29:7-11)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The fast begins an hour before sundown on 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of Tishri and lasts for 25 hours until sundown on 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Tishri. Before the fast begins, a special meal is eaten together, candles are lit and blessings recited and they customarily say ‘Tzom Kal’ – ‘Easy Fast’ or ‘G’mar khatimah tovah’ – ‘May you be sealed in the Book of Life for good’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This day was also a ‘Shabbat Shabbaton’, a very special kind of Shabbat which was a day of complete abstention from any kind of work, other than to save a life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The order of celebration for Yom Kippur is very enlightening, it begins with Rosh Hashanah which begins the Days of Awe when the people are in the attitude of self examination, confession of sin and solemn repentance and remorse over their sin. God commands repentance and that His people return to Him earnestly with all their heart and then He provides the means of reconciliation or atonement with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Today there is no Temple and the sacrificial order laid out in the Torah is not possible and without a High Priest the focus has now fallen on the individual and personal repentance and return to God, rather than from a national perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Using &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Leviticus 23:27&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as the foundation, observant Jews implement what they call the Five Afflictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1.No eating and drinking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2.No washing and bathing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3.No applications of lotions or perfumes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4.No wearing of leather shoes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5.No marital relations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In short, it’s about grief and remorse of body and soul over sin. Sin is very serious! Sin is the most expensive thing in the universe – it cost God His only Son to pay for it!!! We must stop treating sin as though it’s just an ‘issue’ or a ‘problem’...no, sin is deadly and God despises it and He Himself paid the ultimate price so we can be free from it. If dealing with sin is that important to God, surely it should be a priority for us to never indulge in it or explain it away and treat it casually. Sin is deadly and separates us from God and Yeshua died in our place so we could be forgiven and reconciled to God. That’s the heart and power of the Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Ultra-orthodox perform the Kapparot where a chicken is used in place of a goat. While reciting a prayer, the chicken is circled above the head and then taken to a kosher butcher for slaughter and is then given to the poor for their Yom Kippur evening meal after the fast is broken. This particular custom began in the 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. It’s curious that even today, non-Messianic Jews understand the necessity of atoning blood sacrifice for sin, they know that without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness. Without a Temple to offer the Biblically prescribed offering, Judaism has come up with an alternative method. Sadly, because the majority of Jews don’t recognise Yeshua as Messiah and their substitutionary atoning sacrifice, they don’t understand that there is no further need for sacrifices. Pray for the Jewish people that God would lift their blindness and recognise Yeshua as their long awaited Messiah. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;On Yom Kippur observant Jews are required to attend 5 different services in the Synagogue as this day is essentially, the last appeal, your last chance to change the ‘judgement of God’ and to demonstrate repentance and make amends and each of the 5 services has a different and specific focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Torah readings on Yom Kippur are: Service #1 – &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lev 16:1-34; Num 29:7-11; Isa 57:14-58, 14 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(Messianic synagogues include &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rom 3:21-26, 2 Cor 5:10-21&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;). &amp;nbsp;Service #2 – A memorial service for departed family members. Service #3 – A retelling of the Yom Kippur service in the Temple and the priestly blessing. Service #4 – &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lev 18:1-30; Jon 1:1-4, 11; Mic 7:18-20 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(Messianic synagogues include &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rom 3:21-26, 2 Cor 5:10-21&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;). Service #5 – Thought to symbolise the ‘closing and sealing’ of the Book of Life, and the great shofar is sounded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The significance of Yeshua the Messiah in the incredible celebration is obvious. First of all, Yeshua is our High Priest, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Heb 3:1-2)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and God instituted the system of atonement and the forgiveness of sin to come only through the shedding of blood. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Lev 17:11)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The substitutionary shedding of blood which is the ‘life for a life’ principle is absolutely essential for atonement with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hebrews 9:22, ‘And according to the Law, one may almost say, all things are cleansed with blood, and without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yeshua our High Priest, offered Himself to be the perfect sacrifice for sins - vastly more suitable than bulls and goats. The elaborate ritual and sacrificial system in Leviticus was a foreshadowing, and ‘symbolic type’ that would ultimately be fulfilled by Messiah who sacrificed Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Just like the High Priest laying the sin of the people on the head of the scapegoat, God laid on Him the sins of us all: Yeshua bore our sins upon Himself – He became our scapegoat!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Isaiah 53:6, ‘All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned, every one, to his own way; and the Lord has laid on Him the iniquity of us all.’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hebrews 9:24-28, ‘For Christ has not entered the holy places made with hands, which are copies of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us; not that He should offer Himself often, as the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood of another – He then would have had to suffer often since the foundation of the world; but now, once at the end of the ages, He has appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself. And as it is appointed for men to die once, but after this the judgement, so Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many. To those who eagerly wait for Him He will appear a second time, apart from sin, for salvation.’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (The last line is another verse emphasising believers to eagerly wait for the return of Yeshua!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;For Messianic believers, they don’t have the same concerns as non-Messianic Jews in that they know that their salvation is not based on whether or not they fast or do enough good deeds or in denying themselves or abstaining from earthly pleasures. Messianic Jews know – as do Gentile believers – that what Yeshua did for us was once and for all, a one-time event powerful and far reaching enough to cleanse and save permanently the soul who has genuinely repented and put their faith and trust in Him alone. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(2 Cor 5:21; Heb 7:27, 9, 10:11-20; Rom 3:25; 1 Jn 2:2, 4:10)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Some Messianic Jews participate in Yom Kippur fasting in order to reach their Jewish brethren, some participate in the fast for personal reflection but they never fast in order to gain special favour because through faith, we’ve all been brought near to God through His sacrifice not through pious actions on our own behalf. Messianic Jews participate in Yom Kippur celebrations and fasting because they remember the gravity and extreme sacrifice of Yeshua in substituting Himself as the Scapegoat on their behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;For the believer in Christ, Yom Kippur is remembrance of the sacrifice of Yeshua our High Priest who took our sins upon Himself, bearing them in His body on the cross and became the scapegoat that took our sins away permanently. As a result, our names are written in the Lamb’s Book of Life which has assured us of our eternal security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hebrews 10:14-25, ‘For by one offering He has perfected for all time those who are sanctified. And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us; for after saying, “This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord: I will put My laws upon their heart, and on their mind I will write them,” He then says, “and their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more.” Now where there is forgiveness of these things, there is no longer any offering for sin. Therefore, brethren, since we have confidence to enter the holy place by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way which He inaugurated for us through the veil, that is, His flesh, and since we have a great High Priest over the house of God, let us draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;; and let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds, not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you see the day drawing near.’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;I’ve mentioned this before, but there are some who don’t believe in the doctrine of Substitutionary Atonement believing it’s really a form of “cosmic child abuse” of God sacrificing His Son, but Scripture is clear that without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;But why wasn’t the blood of bulls and goats sufficient to pay for sin permanently? The example I like to use is this: pretend that you loaded me your brand new Rolls Royce and I totalled it in an accident, I apologise to you and promise to replace your brand new vehicle with another brand new vehicle and a week later I present to you a new Mini Minor. It will fulfil the same function as your Rolls Royce but it’s a completely inadequate substitute, in value and all other areas it’s an inferior substitute. Kind for kind is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God had His plan of redemption laid out before the foundations of the world were laid, and He established a sacrificial system to teach His people about the cost and severity of sin and that in all cases, someone has to pay for the crimes they commit. Knowing we could never pay for our own sins sufficiently, God Himself chose to become a human being like us and then offer Himself in our place. Kind for kind. His perfection meant He wasn’t paying for His own sin, rather He was paying on behalf of all of us and this is why the Son of God had to die for us. Substitutionary Atonement is the Gospel and without it there is no forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We have so much to be thankful and grateful for to God, His Son and His Holy Spirit who indwells us assisting and maturing and purifying us for our benefit and His glory. My you be more aware of all He’s done for you, especially this Yom Kippur.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

11626,Home Group - 'Rosh Hashanah',"&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/724407_24295926%20small.jpg&quot; width=&quot;311&quot; height=&quot;233&quot; style=&quot;margin-right: 8px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rosh Hashanah – Jewish New Year&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Rosh Hashanah is the Jewish New Year. There are 7 Feasts of the Lord and Rosh Hashanah is the 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;. The Hebrew Calendar has several ‘new years’ in it, which can be very confusing until you get your head around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The beginning of the religious year begins in the Spring time with Pesach (Passover) on the 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day of the month of Nissan. The 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; day of Nissan is the new year for counting the reign of kings and months on the calendar; the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; day of Elul is the new year for the tithing of animals, the 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day of Shevat is the new year for trees which helps to determine when first fruits can be eaten and the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; of Tishri is the new year for years which is Rosh Hashanah. Rosh Hashanah means more than ‘New Year’; it actually means ‘Head of the year’ or ‘First of the year’. So it’s the New Year of all the new years in the Hebrew calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;So, Nissan is the first month of the Jewish religious calendar but Tishri is the first month of the Jewish 12 monthly cycle of the yearly calendar when the year number ticks over, so today is 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; of Tishri in the year 5774 &amp;nbsp;which began at sundown last night because each day in the Jewish calendar begins t sundown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;For example, at the stroke of midnight December 31&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; 2013 as our calendar moves into January 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; our year will become 2014. At sunset on 29&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Elul, the Hebrew calendar will tick over onto 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; Tishri and it will become the year 5774.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This celebration will last for 2 days and unlike our western celebrations which become an excuse to drink excessive amounts of alcohol, eat excessive amounts of food, make excessive amounts of noise keeping neighbourhoods awake until the wee small hours of the morning, leaving excessive amounts of rubbish all over the place and watching fireworks demonstrations, the Jewish new year is a time of introspection, reflection of mistakes and poor choices during the previous year with the determination to make necessary changes to avoid the same thing during the new year…similar to making new year’s resolutions but with a greater emphasis on spiritual and ethical matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In the Bible this festival was instituted in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Leviticus 23:24, ‘In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall observe a day of solemn rest, a memorial proclaimed with blast of trumpets, a holy convocation.’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;(A ‘convocation’ is a calling together or a formal assembly for a specific purpose)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This festival is also known as ‘Yom ha-Zikaron’ which means ‘The Day of Remembrance’ and also ‘Yom Teru’ah’ which means the ‘Day (feast) of Trumpets’. Rosh Hashanah is celebrated over 2 days because of the difficulty in pin-pointing the exact timing of the new moon upon which the festival begins, it’s commonly believed that no one knows the day or hour of this particular feast so to make sure they don’t get the timing wrong, they cover their bases with a 2 day celebration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It’s also believed in Jewish tradition that God created the universe on 25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of Elul making 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; of Tishri the 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day of creation and this festival was to be celebrated with the blowing of the shofar. The shofar is blown 100 times during Rosh Hashana (hence the name ‘Feast of Trumpets) using various styles and the shofar blasts are a coronation of God as King of the Universe. They’re a reminder for us to remember that God is our Creator and that He is our King.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There are 4 primary shofar blasts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Tekiah &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - long single blast used for the kings coronation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shevarim &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - 3 short wail-like blasts that signify repentance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Teru’ah&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - 9 staccato blasts of alarm that signify the awakening of the soul in response to repentance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Tekiah ha-Gadol&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - a final long blast held as long as possible, it’s called the Last Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The general custom during Rosh Hashanah is to first blow Tekiah, the coronation and honour of the God the King, then to follow with Shevarim for repentance before Him, then followed by Teru’ah for the souls response to the call of repentance and then the closing with Tekiah ha-Gadol – the ‘Last Trump’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In the synagogue services on day 1 of Rosh Hashanah, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Genesis 21:1-34, Numbers 29:1-6, 1 Samuel 1:1-2; 10&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(Messianic synagogues include &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 &amp;amp; 1 Corinthians 15:51-54&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) are read and taught on. On day 2 of Rosh Hashanah, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Genesis 22:1-22; 24, Numbers 29:1-6, Jeremiah 31:1-19&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Messianic synagogues include &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 &amp;amp; 1 Corinthians 15:51-54&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) are read and taught on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The traditions that surround Rosh Hashanah include lighting candles and reciting prayers and blessings; serving apples and bread (khallah) dipped in honey before the meal to wish one other a sweet year ahead; round shaped khallah (bread) is served to represent the crown of God’s kingship and from a Messianic perspective, it’s a reminder that those who obey the Lord receive a crown of righteousness from Him. Often the round khallah bread is baked with honey and raisins. Sweetness is always associated with Rosh Hashanah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Usually on the afternoon of the first day of Rosh Hashanah, Jews perform a ritual called ‘tashlikh’ which means ‘casting off’, where they symbolically cast their sins into a body of water by emptying their pockets and casting the contents into the river, stream or creek. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Micah 7:18-20, Psalm 118:5-9, 33 and 130&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are recited during the Tashlikh ceremony. Rosh Hashanah is also believed to be the time when the righteous are written in the Book of Life and the unrighteous are written in the book of death in Jewish tradition; this tradition believes that all people have 10 days during the Days of Awe to repent and determine their fate. These are Jewish traditions, they’re not found in Scripture but they hold great symbology of what is in Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Another major theme that is focused on during Rosh Hashanah is the Akedah Yitzchak – ‘The binding of Isaac’. In Jewish tradition God told Abraham that the shofar was to be blown on Rosh Hashanah to remind the people of God’s substitutionary sacrifice when He provided a ram to replace Isaac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Rosh Hashanah is also known as ‘The destiny of the Righteous’ interestingly enough and it begins what is termed the Days of Awe and they lead into the most holy and solemn day of the Hebrew calendar known as Yom Kippur – the Day of Atonement – which we can look at next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;From a Messianic/Christian perspective, it’s important to understand that ALL the feasts of the Lord are fulfilled or yet to be fulfilled by Yeshua. With regard to Rosh Hashanah, there are 7 really important points to look at in relation to what we’ve just learned about Rosh Hashanah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1.Yeshua &lt;b&gt;IS&lt;/b&gt; the King of the Universe, the Creator and Redeemer. In Hebrew the term is Melech Gadol al-kol-ha’aretz – ‘Great King over all the earth’ &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Psalm 47:2)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;; Yeshua is called the Mashiach which denotes His kingly dignity and royalty; He is the Creator and Sustainer of all life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Colossians 1:16)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2.The month of Elul which is before Tishri and Rosh Hashanah is a month of preparation for Rosh Hashanah and for honouring God. For the believer in Yeshua, we are warned to be ready and watching, earnestly awaiting the return of our Messiah. Yeshua spoke often of the need for repentance by individuals before God and repentance is linked tightly with salvation and the blowing of the shofar (trumpet) is to awaken the conscience to be sensitive to sin and deal with it accordingly. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Mark 1:15; Rom 10:8-13)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3.There is prophetic significance for the Christian in Rosh Hashanah; because this particular feast has such trouble with its starting point because of the issues regarding the new moon, no one really knows the exact hour or day of its beginning and this is the same characteristic of the return of Yeshua to take His Bride away. He Himself said, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;“But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;(Matt 24:36; Mark 13)&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Yeshua has promised to return to snatch His Bride away and in fact He has promised that this event will occur &lt;i&gt;‘at the last trump’&lt;/i&gt; and the last trumpet blast of Rosh Hashanah is called the ‘Last Trump’. We don’t know what day or hour Yeshua will return, but we’re to be watching and waiting and ready when He does. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;‘Behold, I tell you a mystery; we will not all sleep, but we will all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable and we will be changed.’ (1 Corinthians 15:51-52)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The Talmud (not inspired Scripture by any means) states that on Rosh Hashanah, the dead will be raised which corresponds with the words of the Apostle Paul.&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4.The ‘Tashlikh’ (casting off of sin ceremony) is a reminder of the new beginnings we have through Yeshua because He has cast our sins away from us and cleansed us from them all. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(1 Jn 1:9)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Yeshua became the bearer of our sin and we can know absolute forgiveness and newness of life because of His sacrifice. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(1 Pet 2:24)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5.As believers, we rejoice that because of Yeshua’s sacrifice on the cross on our behalf, and our faith and trust in Him, our names are written in the Lamb’s Book of Life and it is appropriate that we express and demonstrate gratitude and thankfulness. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Titus 3:5-6; Rev 20:12, 15, 21:27)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6.The Akedah Yitzchak – the ‘Binding of Isaac’ and God’s subsequent provision of a ram to replace Isaac as an offering is of course a pre-cursor to God Himself providing His only begotten Son Yeshua, to be the ultimate substitutionary sacrifice for the sins of man. We should be ever grateful and eager to celebrate this incredible sacrifice on our behalf by Yeshua, the Creator of the Universe. &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7.Prophetically, Rosh Hashanah is a celebration of new beginnings and the beginning of the Days of Awe leading up to Yom Kippur – a national day of repentance and agony over sin – which pre-empts the ultimate and hopefully near future repentance of national Israel and her subsequent belief in and salvation from Yeshua their Messiah. Rosh Hashanah is the celebration of this momentous prophetic future of the nation of Israel and her destiny with her Messiah. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Rom 11:26)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It truly is a celebration of the destiny of the righteous through Yeshua the Messiah.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Feasts of the Lord are not obsolete, insignificant holidays that have no importance or relevance for Christians, in fact the opposite is true. We can learn an enormous amount about God’s nature and character, His love and faithfulness to all people and most especially to His people Israel, and we can learn a phenomenal amount about the future, not to prognosticate – which is sinful – but to prepare and eagerly await God’s promises and His return. In fact, God has promised a very special blessing to those watching and waiting for His return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;2 Timothy 2:7-8, Paul said, “I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith; in the future there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day; and not only to me, but also to all who have loved His appearing.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;When celebrating the new year we typically say ‘Happy New Year’ and for those celebrating Rosh Hashanah we say ‘Shanah Tovah’ – a good new year or ‘L’Shanah Tovah’ – to a good new year!&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shanah Tovah!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Esther’s parents were dead and her uncle was raising her as his own daughter. The account in the book of Esther took place between the first two Jewish returns to Jerusalem, and Esther and Mordecai were among the Jewish population that decided to remain in the Diaspora and they lived in Susa, the Persian capital. Esther was of course born in the Diaspora, the destruction of Jerusalem took place over 70 years beforehand, and it’s quite likely that Mordecai was born in the Diaspora as well, and this may be part of the reason they didn’t join the Jews returning to Jerusalem. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A beauty contest of sorts was then embarked on and many women were taken from all over the country into the kings harem and one by one over a period of time, were presented to the king and he chose Esther for his bride.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And he had a particularly intense hatred of Mordecai, Esther’s uncle because he refused to bow down in homage to him whenever he walked past. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

They defeated their enemies on the 13th of Adar and they celebrated victory on the 14th of Adar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

God and satan (as invisible players) moved real kings, queens and nobles. When satan put Haman into place it was as if he announced ‘Check’. God then positioned Esther and Mordecai in order to put satan into ‘Checkmate!’ Ever since the fall of man satan has attempted to spiritually sever God’s relationship with His human creation and disrupt God’s covenant promises with Israel. For example, Christ’s line through the tribe of Judah had been murderously reduced to Joash alone, who was rescued and preserved. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: red;&quot;&gt;(2 Chr 22:10-12)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt; Later, Herod slaughtered the infants of Bethlehem thinking Christ was among them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: red;&quot;&gt;(Matt 2:16)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt; Satan tempted Christ to denounce God and worship him. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: red;&quot;&gt;(Matt 4:9)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt; Peter, at satan’s insistence, tried to block Christ’s journey to Calvary. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: red;&quot;&gt;(Matt 16:22)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt; Finally, satan entered into Judas who then betrayed Christ to the Jews and Romans to Calvary. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: red;&quot;&gt;(Luke 22:3-6)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt; While God was not mentioned in Esther, He was everywhere apparent as the One who opposed and foiled satan’s diabolical schemes and providential intervention. In Esther, all of God’s unconditional covenant promises to Abraham &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: red;&quot;&gt;(Gen 17:1-8)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt; and to David &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: red;&quot;&gt;(2 Sam 7:8-16)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt; were jeopardised.

Esther was allowed to be taken into the palace as a possible candidate for queen so she would rise to a position of influence at the most critical moment in the history of her people up to that point. Mordecai was allowed to learn about an assassination attempt against the king and thus save the kings life while at the same time becoming an object of intense hatred by Haman who used Mordecai as the reason for attempting to annihilate every Jew in Persia. But God knew and orchestrated it all to prove Himself to be God, and to prove the Jewish people to be His own special and chosen possession. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

There is a teaching today that says that because of the Fall in Eden, God lost His legal authority on earth and it was given to satan; however the Bible clearly shows that God is intimately and integrally involved in the affairs of man and who would ever dare to say that God, who never sinned or broke any law, has no legal right to direct or be involved with His own creation? God is not only the legal owner of His Creation, He is enthroned over it. Heaven is His throne and the earth is His footstool and satan, who is a liar, thief and murderer – himself the worst of all lawbreakers – can never hide behind some kind of legal loophole to restrain God Almighty!!! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: red;&quot;&gt;(Psa 11:4, Matt 5:34-35; Jn 8:44)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

All the most beautiful women in the empire were brought into a royal harem and he chose Esther to be his new queen. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

However, his pleasure turned to livid rage when he left the palace and he passed by Mordecai who again, didn’t bow down in homage to him. When he got home to recounted what a great day he’d had but how it was all worth nothing because of his intense hatred for Mordecai. His wife and family advised him to build a gallows...a really high gallows...that he could hang Mordecai on and disgustingly, this cheered him up and he ordered the gallows to be built. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: red;&quot;&gt;(Est 5:9-14)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

They recounted how Mordecai had overheard the plot to murder him and how he reported it thus saving the kings life. The king immediately asked what reward had been given to this faithful subject and surprisingly discovered that nothing had been done at all. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: red;&quot;&gt;(Est 6:1-3)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The king, now keen to reward Mordecai for his faithful service calls Haman to himself and asks him what he thinks should be done for the man whom the king desires to honour? Haman is so egotistical that he thinks the king is talking about honouring him and so he advises the king to lavishly dress the ‘man’ in personal royal robes of the king himself, to have him seated on a horse that has been ridden by the king himself and to place a royal crown on the ‘man’s’ head and for one of the king’s nobles or princes to lead him through the city before all the people calling out, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: red;&quot;&gt;“Thus it shall be done to the man whom the king desires to honour.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt; Haman must have been imagining himself, crowned and robed as the king himself, being led through the streets on a royal steed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: red;&quot;&gt;(Est 6:4-9)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

So humiliated was Haman that when it was all over, he covered his head in shame and scurried home to lick his wounds. When his wife heard what happened she basically prophesied that it was a bad omen for him and he would fall before Mordecai. Before she’d even finished speaking, the escort arrived from the palace to take him that evening to the banquet with the king and queen. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: red;&quot;&gt;(Est 6:11-14)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The king was stunned and demanded to know who would dare try to kill his own wife and her people!!! She of course points directly at Haman and says this is the man and understandably, Haman was absolutely terrified at this turn of events. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: red;&quot;&gt;(Est 7:1-6)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Perhaps he was becoming aware of how he’d been manipulated and tricked but also how willing he’d been to condemn people on nothing more than here-say? Who knows, but he would have been evaluating how such a situation had arisen and what his own role had been and how he could undo it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He said, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: red;&quot;&gt;“Will he even assault the queen with me in the house?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt; Immediately Haman was arrested. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: red;&quot;&gt;(Est 7:7-8)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The king then demanded that Haman be hung on his own gallows. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: red;&quot;&gt;(Est 7:9-10)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

You see, under Persian law, once a law was enacted, even the king couldn’t rescind it; the best he could do was issue a law to counter the first one and he made an edict that the Jews were allowed to take up arms to defend themselves against their enemies. Once the day of the intended slaughter - the 13th day of Adar - arrived, all the kings own faithful leadership throughout the empire assisted the Jews, mostly because they were now very fearful of the king and Mordecai. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: red;&quot;&gt;(Est 9:1-3)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

11335,Home Group - Day Of Miracles,"&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/575231_55762839%20small.jpg&quot; width=&quot;225&quot; height=&quot;169&quot; style=&quot;margin-right: 8px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;Day Of Miracles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Today is Miracles Day, a day we partner with CBM to assist the neediest of the needy in third world countries as well as bringing awareness of this vital ministry to the poorest people on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Western society is quite educated about ‘poverty’ because it’s been a leading issue for decades with some of the most famous people and celebrities championing the cause of the poor around the world. Sir Bob Geldof and others organized the first Band-Aid concert in 1985 to raise funds for famine relief in Ethiopia. That same year the Live-Aid concerts were held around the world to do the same thing on a global scale and with satellite link-ups and TV broadcasts there was an estimated global audience of approximately 1.9 billion people watching from across 150 nations. Very impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Then there’s the ‘Make Poverty History’ campaign which is good and altruistic but sadly, will never achieve its goal. As long as there are corrupt human beings on earth, there will always be poverty, but since all humanity is corrupt through sin, poverty will remain an issue until Yeshua returns and establishes His rule on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yeshua told us that there would always be poor people among us. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Matt 26:11)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Secular and Christian bands often release songs with the express purpose of generating funds to assist the poor and needy, and many other people come up with creative ways of raising funds to help improve the lives of the most desperate people on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;But what does the Bible say about the poor and our responsibility regarding them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God instructed His people to love their neighbors as themselves in both the Old and New Covenant Scriptures, in fact Yeshua said that this was the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; greatest commandment of all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Leviticus 19:18, ‘You shall not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the sons of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself; I am the Lord.’ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Matt 22:37-40, ‘And He said to him, “’You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.’ This is the great and foremost commandment. The second is like it, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ On these two commandments depend the whole Law and the Prophets.”’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If we love God supremely, we will love what He loves and hate what He hates, and since He loves the poor we should also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Psalm 82&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, God speaks directly to His people about how they should be caring for the people, especially the poor and downtrodden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Psalm 82:3-4, ‘Vindicate the weak and fatherless; do justice to the afflicted and destitute. Rescue the weak and needy; deliver them out of the hand of the wicked.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When a believer cares for the poor, He is in fact honouring God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Proverbs 14:31, ‘He who oppresses the poor taunts his Maker, but he who is gracious to the needy honours Him.’ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;And &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Proverebs 19:17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; says that caring for the poor is like loaning money to God,&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt; &lt;b&gt;‘One who is gracious to a poor man lends to the Lord, and He will repay him for his good deed. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This doesn’t mean we should care for the poor in order to gain a blessing from God, God doesn’t bless the mercenary, but what it does show us is the heart of God not only toward the poor and needy, but also &lt;i&gt;toward&lt;/i&gt; those who have a heart of compassion toward the poor and needy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The principle of sowing and reaping with regard to the poor is revealed in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Proverbs 21:13, ‘He who shuts his ear to the cry of the poor will also cry himself and not be answered.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God expects us to make an effort to assist the poor and needy, it’s not really an option. The truth is that while we may not live in a third world country and the issue of poverty in Australia by comparison is very, very minimal, we do still have people here who are desperately poor and we even have personal seasons where we can’t always meet our obligations financially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;I personally have experienced what it’s like to have to choose between paying the mortgage or buying food to feed my children. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Proverbs 21:13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is saying that if we don’t express compassion toward the poor in their distress, we can’t expect compassion toward ourselves when we experience distress. For most Australians, we have no idea what real poverty is actually like because we’ve never been in utter beggary and it’s easy to become unintentionally callous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Again Proverbs tells us that one who assists the poor will never lack for themselves, but the one who ignores the poor will be cursed. This is a heavy warning!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Proverbs 28:17, ‘He who gives to the poor will never want, but he who shuts his eyes will have many curses.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The curses come because it offends God when we neglect the needs of the poor who are part of His creation. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Prov 14:31, 17:5, 19:17, 29:13)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Isaiah 58&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; God questions His people over their religious practice of fasting – a ritual God Himself instituted but they corrupted. They would fast for pious and self-righteous reasons and in fact, during the times of their fasting they would treat their workers really badly, driving them really hard. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Isa 58:3-4)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; So God explained why He instituted fasting and what it was supposed to result in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Isaiah 58:6-11, “Is this not the fast which I choose, to loosen the bonds of wickedness, to undo the bands of the yoke? Is it not to divide your bread with the hungry and bring the homeless poor into the house; when you see the naked, to cover him; and not to hide yourself from your own flesh? Then your light will break out like the dawn and your recovery will speedily spring forth; and your righteousness will go before you; the glory of the Lord will be your rear guard. Then you will call, and the Lord will answer; you will cry and He will say, ‘Here I am.’ If you remove the yoke from your midst, the pointing of the finger and speaking wickedness, and if you give yourself to the hungry and satisfy the desire of the afflicted, then your light will rise in the darkness and your gloom will become like midday. And the Lord will continually guide you, and satisfy your desire in scorched places, and give strength to your bones; and you will be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water whose waters to not fail.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yeshua said something similar in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Matthew 25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; when He talked about judging the nations at the end of all things and He will separate them as a sheep from the goats. He was speaking in general of His followers but specifically of His Jewish brethren because this was before the birth of the church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We know that the Jewish people have lived in some of the most deplorable conditions throughout the world, often living in situations of absolute beggary and having every human right and dignity withheld from them, and there has historically only been pockets of people around the world who gave them assistance. Genuine Christians being the most prevalent while the official church led much of their persecution along with Communist regimes and Islamic regimes among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;But in general terms, the poor have also suffered terribly throughout the world and Yeshua was letting us know that all men – both believing and unbelieving – will give an account for how they treated specifically His Jewish brethren and generally the poor and needy among His followers. How does Yeshua expect people to treat the poor and needy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Feeding them when they’re hungry, quenching their thirst, providing them with shelter, comforting them in prison, providing them medical attention when they’re sick, making sure they have clothing to cover their bodies. He wants us to meet their physical needs. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Matt 25:32-44)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Sermon on the Mount was a detailed dismantling of the corruption of Judaism in Yeshua’s day and it was directed to His own people who understood the burden of the religious regulations they were living under because of their religious leaders. His teaching showed very clearly that God has an expectation of exceedingly high morals, selflessness and self-denial, and compassion for their poor and in very large measure as well as toward their enemies and strangers. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Matt 5, Luke 6)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; So this was directed at His people in treating their own Jewish brethren and any strangers or enemies (Romans for example!) living among them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This shows again that there are two levels of ministry to the poor in the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The first is that as believers it is our primary responsibility to look after the needy and poor within the Christian community first; this is the primary response of the believer. Paul, James and John were very clear in their instructions to the churches about meeting the needs of their own believing brethren first; remember, they were writing to believers about their conduct and behavior amongst themselves within their respective church fellowships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;2 Cor 9; 1 Tim 6:17-19; Jam 1; 2:14-24; 1 John 3:17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Even Yeshua pointed out the need for His followers to love each other in order to demonstrate their loyalty to Him before the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;John 13:34-35, “A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one another. By this all men will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We generalize this commandment to mean loving all mankind, but it’s actually a very specific command for Yeshua’s disciples; His followers to love and care for each other. He was specifically addressing His disciples about their love toward each other to be a witness before the world; that their love and compassion and care for each other would be like a beacon to the watching world. In the world, the philosophy is ‘look out for number one’, it’s ‘dog eat dog’, but not so in the Christian church, we are to care for and love each other even at the expense of ourselves. This demonstrates to the world our relationship and commitment to Yeshua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Loving each other with grace, compassion and mercy, forgiveness and practicality is our light-bearing testimony that we are entirely different from the world and all other religions and philosophies; uniquely reflecting our commitment and dedication to Yeshua Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Galatians 6:10, ‘So then, while we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, and especially to those who are of the household of the faith.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Sometimes Christians ignore this important teaching; they want to reach the world but they’ve forgotten the desperate and needy within their own Christian community and by ignoring their needs, the world cannot see that they’re disciples of Yeshua; they’ve just become a person doing good works within the wider community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Secondly, we are to then reach out to minister to non-believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Matt 5:39-48, 19:19, 22:39, 25:34-46; Mk 12:31-33, Lk 10:30-37, 12; Rom 13:9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This brings us to the mission of Christian Blind Mission and the Day of Miracles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;I have visited slums in Kenya, Uganda, South Africa, Ethiopia and the Philippines and slums are putrid, stinking, ugly, hostile, tragic, miserable and hopeless places and the fact that so many people around the world live in such conditions is mind-boggling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;I remember visiting the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; biggest slum in sub-Saharan Africa – the Mathare Valley in Nairobi Kenya, an area of about 4km sq with a population of between 600,000 and 1,000,000. The ‘homes’ are no bigger than 6x8 ft made of corrugated iron, wood scraps and mud walls and dirt floors. There’s no electricity, no running water, and no toilets though some charities have built some toilets, the few there are, are simply not even close to being sufficient. The ‘flying toilet’ is notorious in the Mathare Valley which residents use because there’s no alternative. A piece of plastic is used and then it’s tossed away to land wherever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Common illnesses especially in children are dysentery, malnutrition, malaria, typhoid, cholera, infections, tetanus and polio. All these are preventable but if they’re left untreated can result in all manner of other physical problems and worst of all, death.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In situations of abject poverty, it’s literally a fight for survival and the people don’t want to neglect each other; they’ll do whatever they can – if they can – but for each of them they’re simply trying to survive themselves. So if you have a physical condition such as blindness, deafness, tumors, being crippled, you are at an even greater disadvantage because you can’t even go out looking for some day labor work. You cannot help yourself even though you want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;As Christians we have a duel responsibility; we are to care for the needy within our own Christian communities first and then we are to care for needy of the world. It’s not either or, it’s both!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Adults in poverty need our help so that they are better able to look at ways to meet the needs of their own families, and children need our help because all too often, their parents simply cannot afford the medical care their kids so desperately need, and their futures are doomed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;As Christians we are to give not for recognition, not for reward or ‘blessings’ but because these people are created in the image and likeness of God and He wants us to show compassion on them and meet their needs in the same way that He showed compassion on us and continually meets our needs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

The name Esther is simply the Persian word for ‘star’ but it comes from the root word ‘satar’ or ‘seter’ which both mean to ‘hide or conceal’, which means the name Esther means ‘I am a hiding place’ or ‘something hidden’. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This name means ‘little man’ or ‘worshipper of Marduk or Mars’. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

On the historical timeline this account took place during the reign of king Ahasuerus between 486-465 BC at the height of the Persian Empire. It took place between the 1st and 2nd waves of Jewish returns from Babylon back to Jerusalem. Both Esther and Exodus show just how rabidly foreign powers tried to commit genocide against the Jewish race and how God sovereignly protected and blessed His chosen people while bringing destruction on their enemies...against all odds! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It’s believed that what he actually wanted her to do, was strip naked before them and understandably, she wasn’t willing. In his drunken anger at being disobeyed and at the advice of his male advisors, he vanquished Vashti to teach all the women of the empire about the consequences of disobeying their husbands. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: red;&quot;&gt;(Est 1:1-22)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Why? The answer should be obvious. The Jews had suffered persecution and oppression from many different people throughout their history and rather than risk attacks or even murder, they kept their heritage private in order to stay safe. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: red;&quot;&gt;(Est 2:10-11) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

That is all but Mordecai and it drove Haman mad that this one stubborn Jew refused to bow the knee to him. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: red;&quot;&gt;(Est 3:1-5)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Haman also promised the king that this deal would boost his financial coffers as well. Of course, the Jews did obey Persian law, they simply obeyed their Judaistic laws as much as was possible while in exile, but they were not in the least bit subversive, this was simply Haman’s con-job to legally commit mass murder. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: red;&quot;&gt;(Est 3:6-12)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Mordecai sent word back to Esther about all that Haman had orchestrated against the Jews because being hidden away in the palace, she had no idea what Haman had ordered, and Mordecai ordered Esther to go to the king and beg him to reverse his edict. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: red;&quot;&gt;(Est 4:1-8)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Persian law dictated that no one, no matter who they might be, was permitted to simply present themselves into the king’s presence without first being summoned by the king. To do so carried the death penalty. Why this law even existed I don’t know, but this was Persian law in that day. If the king raised his sceptre to the intruder he would be permitted to live, but if he didn’t, then execution was certain. So Mordecai’s request of Esther was a very probably a death sentence for her, particularly since the king hadn’t had any interest in seeing her for an entire month. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: red;&quot;&gt;(Est 4:10-11)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The law applied to every Jew in the Persian Empire of which she was one. This is when Mordecai said that most famous line, “And who knows whether you have not attained royalty &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;for such a time as this&lt;/span&gt;?” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: red;&quot;&gt;(Est 4:13-14)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This is when she said her most famous line, “And thus I will go in to the king, which is not according to the law; &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;and if I perish, I perish&lt;/span&gt;.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: red;&quot;&gt;(Est 4:16)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I don’t imagine that it was an easy thing for him to ask of his daughter, but he also knew that if she didn’t approach the king she would be killed as a result of this edict regardless of where she lived. She would die one way or another, at least taking the option of appealing to the king might bring about a means of escape and as he pointed out to her, the sovereignty of God may very well have been behind her rise to royalty so that she would be in a position to save her people. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

As a Persian subject she knew very well what had happened to Queen Vashti; so she knew that being a queen was no guarantee of protection where the king and Persian law was concerned. She knew that the result of her unapproved approach of the king would more than likely result in her death. She was very brave to do what she did, but she didn’t do it without spiritual preparation as she, her maids and the Jews in the capital Susa, all fasted for 3 days. She made no move without first seeking and petitioning God. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Without doubt, God leads and directs by His sovereign will, the affairs of men and for those of us who know and love Him, it’s comforting to know that all our days are in His hands and He determines the direction our lives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

When these enemies realised they couldn’t stop the work from progressing, they plotted to harm Nehemiah probably believing that if they killed the leader, the Jews would scatter and quit, but Nehemiah was wise and gave these men no opportunity; he had a job to do that was given to him by God and he wasn’t about to give away any time to those he knew were against both God and His people. We are not called to negotiate with our enemies...love them yes, but negotiate with them, no!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

So I sent messengers to them, saying, “I am doing a great work and I cannot come down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and come down to you?” They sent messages to me four times in this manner, and I answered them in the same way.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Those who were rebuilding the wall and those who carried burdens took their load with one hand doing the work and the other holding a weapon.

He served as governor of Jerusalem twice, the first time between the years 445-433 BC &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: red;&quot;&gt;(Neh 5:14, 13:6)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt; and the second time possibly beginning in 424 - 410 BC. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But what we learn from Nehemiah and men like him is multi-faceted: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He never succumbed to self-pity and he never, ever blamed God for the mess his countrymen had gotten themselves into and he never resorted to compromise. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;color: #232323; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Despite the time it took to finally see the rebuilding of the Holy City of Jerusalem, Nehemiah remained faithful to the task even when the people became disillusioned or frightened; he encouraged them and motivated them to keep going. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;color: #232323; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;He never ignored his enemies or detractors, but neither did he allow them to dissuade or stop him from working. He was well aware of their efforts but he refused to make deals with them and he wouldn’t allow their threats and mockery to slow him down. He took measures to protect both his people and the work God called them to do. At one point they even wanted to join in the re-building effort but Nehemiah would not permit them. We can work and socialise with non-believers, but when it comes to spiritual enterprises we do not include non-believers or those of other faiths because inevitably, compromise creeps in so that offense isn’t given to those who don’t believe what we believe. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;color: #232323; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;In his dealings with the authority over him - i.e; King Artaxerxes - he remained faithful, respectful and he worked within the parameters set for him by his king. He never showed disrespect for the king and never exceeded the boundaries or permissions granted to him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

He was dedicated to the Word of God and to submitting himself to God and being obedient to His Word. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;color: #232323; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Most important of all, Nehemiah was uncompromisingly faithful to the Word of God and it governed every aspect of his life and his leadership over and for his people. So much so, that they gathered all the people together and he had Ezra read aloud the entire book of the Law before all the people from early morning to midday. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Such reverence and respect they had that they would not sit and recline comfortably to hear what God’s Word, they stood alert and attentive so they could absorb what was said. It’s very different today in our churches, very often only a verse or two are ever referred to during services and rarely are whole chapters or portions of Scripture read aloud and even more rarely, do people stand out of respect to hear the Word of God read. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This genuine display of remorse over sin and real repentance pleased Nehemiah – God can do amazing things through hearts that are broken before Him and willing to submit to Him - so Nehemiah, a man of God who recognised real heartfelt repentance among the people responded wisely...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Then he said to them, “Go, eat of the fat, drink of the sweet, and send portions to him who has nothing prepared; for this day is holy to our Lord. Do not be grieved, for the joy of the Lord is your strength.” So the Levites calmed all the people, saying, “Be still, for the day is holy; do not be grieved.” All the people went away to eat, to drink, to send portions and to celebrate a great festival, &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;because they understood the words which had been made known to them.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

After genuine repentance, God always forgives and restores.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The reading of the Word of God actually brought about revival to the nation of Israel during the days of Nehemiah. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

If God held the people of Israel in ancient times accountable for disobeying His Word, even when they didn’t have their own personal copies to read, how much more accountable are we today, when we have multiple copies of His Word, copious other resources to teach us such as DVD’s, CD’s, mp3’s, books, videos, online resources all accessible with a simple click of the mouse and a lot of it is free. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Why is it we put so much emphasis on what the latest top selling books are saying in the Christian bookstores, or on the latest teaching fad working its way through the church but we give little to no time to God’s Word. There is nothing more powerful than God’s Word, it just doesn’t entertain or tickle the ears like many teachers these days.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The book of Nehemiah is not a how-to manual for church building projects, rather it is an enormously important book for leaders and in the importance of obeying God’s Word and the on-going consequences of disobeying God’s Word. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Leaders are to serve God first, they’re to serve the authorities over them and they are to serve those they are called to govern. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It’s based in large part on the personal diaries of Nehemiah as well as a great deal of administrative documents from the royal Persian archives, something Nehemiah didn’t necessarily have access to. He held a high position within the royal Persian court, but that didn’t mean access to the archives. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Ezra was not only a Scribe and priest but he did have access to the royal archives. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: red;&quot;&gt;(Ezra 1:2-4, 4:9-22, 5:7-17, 6:3-12)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt; Another reason it is believed that Ezra is the author of this book is because it’s believed that the books of Ezra and Nehemiah were originally one book and in the Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate, Nehemiah used to be named 2nd Ezra in the same way manner as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: red;&quot;&gt;2nd Kings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: red;&quot;&gt;2nd Chronicles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Ezra had access to the royal Persian archives, Joseph became the Prime Minister of Egypt which brought about the salvation of his entire family and Nehemiah was in a very special role as cup-bearer to King Artaxerxes himself. All these Jewish people were in specific roles that helped facilitate both the return of the Jews to their homeland as well as the rebuilding of both their ancient Capital city of Jerusalem and the Holy Temple. This is nothing short of miraculous. God has always had the right people in the right places at exactly the right time in history to fulfil His promises for His people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A cupbearer was a &lt;i&gt;“high ranking official primarily in charge of serving wine to the king. Since he was close to the person of the king, who feared intrigue and the possibility of poisoned food, the cupbearer was required to be a man of irreproachable loyalty capable of winning the king’s complete confidence.”&lt;/i&gt; - Jewish Virtual Library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Sackcloth was a demonstration of mourning. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: red;&quot;&gt;(Est 4:2)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt; So when Nehemiah looked mournful in the presence of the king and the king questioned him about it, he had every reason to be afraid because the death penalty could be issued for such an infraction of Persian law. Apparently Persian kings would only permit happy people to work for and serve them!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

O Lord, I beseech You, may Your ear be attentive to the prayer of Your servant and the prayer of Your servants who delight to revere Your name, and make Your servant successful today and grant him compassion before this man.” Now I was the cupbearer to the king.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

During the days of Ezra, the canon of Old Covenant Scripture was set to basically what it is today, the structure of weekly Torah reading and teaching was established which is still in operation to this day and ensures the entire Old Covenant Scriptures are read and taught verse by verse throughout an entire Jewish calendar year. He established the daily Amidah – or central liturgical prayers that are said 3 times every day by observant Jews; the goal of which was to continually bring God into a central place of thought and worship in the everyday lives of the people. Christians today tend to mock such a tradition or religious ritual as being little more than works righteousness, which it can easily become if the individual has a hard heart, but how many Christians with all their freedom and liberty in the Spirit pray deliberately even once per day, let alone 3 times? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt;One of the really challenging aspects of the book of Ezra is the issue of divorce. We know that God hates divorce &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: red;&quot;&gt;(Mal 2:16)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt; and yet the Jewish population went through a process of mass divorce on a national scale. You have to ask the question, “How could this have been sanctioned by God when God states how much He hates it?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt;Firstly, we learned from the book of Malachi that there was a pandemic of divorce for illegitimate reasons, they just wanted to remarry other women who appealed to them, so that was wrong to start with. Illegitimate divorce had already become a problem within Jewish society. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt;Secondly, God had expressly warned His people not to intermarry with non-Jews because this would inevitably result in the tolerance of, then the acceptance of and then the worship of false gods resulting in national idolatry which would result in national judgement...they’d already been through this before, it’s a large part of why they went into captivity in the first place! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: red;&quot;&gt;(Deut 7:1-4) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt;The real issue in this situation was that the foreign wives were not converts to Judaism and they didn’t believe in Yahweh, they retained their worship and devotion to their foreign gods. This was not an issue of racial prejudice it was an issue of spiritual harlotry and deliberate disobedience. Moses married a dark-skinned Midianite whose family origins were from Cush which was around the southern regions of Ethiopia, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: red;&quot;&gt;(Num 12:1)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt;; Naomi’s son married Ruth the Moabitess, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: red;&quot;&gt;(Ruth 1:4)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt;; Salmon married Rahab of Jericho who was formerly a prostitute and an idolater, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: red;&quot;&gt;(Mt 1:5)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt;. The difference between the foreign wives of the Jews during Ezra’s day and that of these other notable Gentile women is that these specific ladies became devoted believers and worshippers of Yahweh; they became Jewish converts and it’s worth pointing out that Rahab and Ruth are both in the direct lineage of Yeshua the Messiah! So God didn’t forbid intermarriage with foreign nations because He’s racist – He created all men – this was about holiness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The nations of the world were (and still are) reprobate, they worshipped idols and indulged in all manner of immoral and barbaric practices and God wanted to save them and show them a better way, a righteous and holy way and Israel was the means He chose to demonstrate how the One True God could live with and lead people so they could know freedom from the bondage of sin and experience great blessing as a result. By living according to God’s standards Israel could reflect the reality of God to the rest of the world so they would seek Him out for themselves. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And it was a very difficult and painful thing for all involved; it didn’t mean these men didn’t love their wives and the children born to them because they did, but they knew they couldn’t remain in deliberate sinful rebellion to God and be restored to God at the same time. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

God doesn’t give us strict parameters for us to live within because He’s cruel and sadistic; He gives us those parameters because it’s in our best interests and for our protection. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Obviously, the preference is that marriages remain intact and that both parties love and serve God together but if that’s not possible, the preference is at least that the believing spouse remain faithful to God in the marriage circumstance they’re in. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Of course, many couples marry when they’re unbelievers and then one spouse comes to faith and suddenly they’re ‘unevenly yoked’ with an unbeliever. This is precisely what Paul was addressing in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: red;&quot;&gt;1 Corinthians 7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: #232323;&quot;&gt; and he says it’s better for the marriage to remain intact with the believing spouse praying for the salvation of the unbelieving spouse, but if the unbeliever decides to leave, the believing spouse isn’t guilty of sin if divorce eventuates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Everything they did was for the purpose of being a point of remembrance of God who had warned of impending judgement, brought the judgement, promised restoration and then brought their restoration. It was to remind them that God kept His Word and was faithful and therefore was worthy of their time and devotion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

When they were initially established by god-fearing men like Ezra, the purpose was to help keep the people faithful to God. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; color: red;&quot;&gt;(Gen 28:20-22; 35:1-9; Josh 4; 1 Sam 7:12)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; color: #232323;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Even if these traditions have become little more than pious ritual that have been added to and added to throughout the centuries, they have kept the Jewish people as a distinct separate people unto God even though most of them are in unbelief because they don’t believe Yeshua to be their Messiah. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

That’s merely speculation because the Scripture doesn’t say so, but Ezra was in Persia during Haman’s attempt to annihilate the Jewish people and therefore, knew how important it was for the Jews to return to their homeland and having a Jewish ‘brother’ in such a strategic position as the PM made it all easier to facilitate another return which Ezra himself led. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The people had to rebuild the Temple and the city walls, Jewish law had to be reinstituted, the leadership of Zerubbabel, Ezra and Nehemiah were Moses-like in their authority and instruction, they were challenged by the local enemies, and giving into temptation to intermarry with non-Jews which resulted in idolatry. To the returning Jews the situation must have seemed like God was giving them a fresh start and in real terms, that is exactly what God did for them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He waited until He couldn’t wait anymore before bringing judgement. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Just a quick recap from last week…the situation in Israel during the ministry years of the prophet Malachi was that about 50,000 Jews returned from Babylon to re-establish the city of Jerusalem and rebuild the Temple which they did and the Temple service had been re-established and the priesthood was once again functional and unfortunately after only 1 generation the people had fallen back into their old rebellious ways which is what led to their exile to Babylon in the first place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;The 3 main areas of sin among them which were exemplified by their religious and civic leaders was…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm;&quot; start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Intermarriage with foreign women which led to the embace of paganism and idolatry. (remember Solomon) God doesn’t hate non-Jews, He created all men but the Jewish people were chosen to be a light to the nations, a physical demonstration of people in relationship with the One True God and so were not to intermarry with people who would draw them away to worship false gods. Foreigners could convert and live among the Jews, but Jews were not to marry and embrace pagans and paganism.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;The corruption in the area of sacrifices, tithes and offerings as the priests were keeping the best for themselves and giving the weak, sick and lame to God. The people weren’t robbing God, the priests were.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;They were ripping their own people off, abusing the most vulnerable of their society namely orphans, widows and foreigners who were living among them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Malachi is the last book of the Old Covenant in both the ‘Christian’ and ‘Jewish’ Bible. The Jewish Bible has the Old Covenant books listed differently, but Malachi is listed as the last book in each case. Keep that in mind because it’s very important…it was the very last book or prophetic warning given by God before the arrival of Messiah.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Without understanding the situation with the Jewish leadership and their corrupt system, you don’t realize when reading through the Sermon on the Mount by Yeshua in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Matthew 5 &amp;amp; 6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; that the entire dialogue is a dismemberment and rebuke of the corruption that Judaism had become because of practices and traditions of both the Priesthood and religious leadership. Every point Yeshua made was a complete contradiction of everything the people had been taught by their spiritual leaders. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Blessed are...the poor in spirit...those who mourn...the gentle...those who hunger and thirst for righteousness...the merciful...the pure in heart...the peacemakers...the persecuted and insulted. These attributes are so contrary to what most human beings aspire to – the religious Jews of that day in particular – that those who demonstrate them in their lives make the individual like a bright light that is noticed by everyone, or like salt that brings preservation, purification and flavor; they become like a beacon of attraction to those around them. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Matt 5:3-16)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The religious leaders held to the belief that material blessing, health, wealth and prosperity and civic and or religious authority and position were evidences of God’s blessing and conversely, they believed that lack of these things was evidence of God displeasure and cursing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Yeshua shattered that mindset however and pointed out that the attributes He specified in His sermon were so contrary to the world, that whoever exemplified them would be so absolutely different to the world, that they would be like a beacon of light in the darkness for all to see. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Yeshua emphasised faithfulness and dedication to God’s Word and that every single word, letter, dot was expressly important and God would fulfill every single stroke of it. Those who love Him are to be faithful in obeying His Word. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Matt 5:17-20)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; In fact Yeshua said that our righteousness is supposed to surpass that of the Pharisees...they kept the tiniest requirements and details of the law to be sure, but they added a huge number of additional rules, regulations and traditions that allowed them to circumvent the original commands of God and Yeshua then went on to pin point some of the specifics. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Mk 7:1-13)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Yeshua rebuked the religious leaders at another time because while they were fastidious about keeping certain aspects of the Law, which was right for them to do, they had completely discarded the mandate to demonstrate care and compassion and nurture of the people they were supposed to be shepherding. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; color: red;&quot;&gt;Matthew 23:23, “Woe to you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and cumin, and have neglected the weightier provisions of the Law: justice and mercy and faithfulness; &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;but these are the things you should have done without neglecting the others.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Back to the Sermon on the Mount; Do not commit adultery even if it’s only in your heart; don’t murder even if it’s only through hatred because God considers hatred to be the same as murder; don’t present an offering to God if your relationship with another person is broken; don’t make oaths to others, simply say yes or no (the religious leaders claimed that oaths to them and the temple could supersede the commandments of the Law and there are churches and movements today that call people to make oaths and ‘covenants’ with them which is entirely unbiblical) &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Mark 7:9-13)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;; no more vengeance but forgiveness and generosity were to rule because truth and honesty had become commodities to be bought and sold as was obvious when the religious leaders bribed Judas to lie falsely and betray Yeshua for 30 pieces of silver and they also contrived for more false witnesses against Him at His mock trial. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Matt 26:15; 27:3 &amp;amp; 9; 26:60)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;They blatantly and deliberately broke the commands of God while continuing to profess faithfulness and dedication to God through outward works and piety…but they were literally conspiring to murder a man through the false testimony of paid liars! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;You can go through every verse of &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Matthew 5&amp;amp;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and you’ll see that the behaviour Yeshua was encouraging was not what was being demonstrated by the religious leadership of the day. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;When Yeshua entered the Temple what did He see? Stalls of doves, pigeons and livestock being sold to pilgrims for sacrifices. The religious leaders had a great money making gig set up forcing their own people to buy sacrificial animals from them at highly inflated prices and they were making a huge profit off the backs of their own people. It was in the priests financial interests to reject the animals brought by pilgrims as being inferior and unacceptable for sacrificial purposes thereby forcing them to buy the animals bred by the Temple Priesthood. Not only that, there were money changers set up in the Temple courts as well. Roman coins had the image of Caesar on them – a graven image – which was not allowed within the confines of the Temple, so that the pilgrims would have to exchange their Roman coins for Temple shekels and of course the exchange incurred a fee which was pocketed by the priesthood. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Not only that, but this ‘market place’ for ripping off the people was in large part set up in the court of the Gentiles which meant that the Gentile population who believed in Yahweh and who wanted to worship Him were limited in being able to worship or draw as near to the Lord as possible because it was no longer functioning as a place of worship; it had become little more than a livestock market and currency exchange centre. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;The last Old Covenant prophet in the Bible was Malachi who warned the priests and civic leaders about their corrupt ways and rebuked them for it. He warned them that a messenger, a forerunner would come to herald the arrival of Messiah and that when Messiah came He would deal with them; and while dealing with them, He would also not utterly consume them but through His judgement would see their hearts turned back to Him and to each other in righteousness. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Four centuries after Malachi’s rebuke and warning, John the Baptiser heralded the arrival of Messiah and then pointed out Yeshua as the Messiah who arrived on the scene teaching and ministering as One with authority in the Word of God - unlike the hypocritical and corrupt manner of the religious leaders of the day - and when Yeshua arrived in the Temple He found that nothing had changed from the last prophetic warning by Malachi four centuries before and He brought judgement down in the House of the Lord. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Matt 21:12-13)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; color: red;&quot;&gt;Malachi 3:1-6, ‘“Behold, I am going to send My messenger, and he will clear the way before Me. And the Lord, whom you seek will suddenly come to His temple; and the messenger of the covenant, in whom you delight, behold, He is coming,” says the Lord. “But who can endure the day of His coming? And who can stand when He appears? For He is like a refiner’s fire and like fullers’ soap. He will sit as a smelter and purifier of silver, and He will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver, so that they may present to the Lord offerings in righteousness. Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the Lord as in the days of old and as in former years. Then I will draw near to you for judgement; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers and against the adulterers and against those who swear falsely, and against those who oppress the wage earner in his wages, the widow and the orphan, and those who turn aside the alien and do not fear Me,” says the Lord of hosts.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Isn’t that stunning? Malachi prophesied the warning and John and Yeshua fulfilled it exactly! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;We are to obey God’s Word and not be manipulated or cajoled by men into keeping their man-made rules and rituals. If it’s not in the Scripture we’re not obligated to it. If our desire is to please the Lord then it’s His Word and His ways that we are to pursue. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;This comes through genuine love and fear of God. Had the people of Malachi’s day heeded the warning of the prophet and put away corruption, hypocrisy and genuinely loved and feared God they would have genuinely loved their own people and the foreigners living among them and they would have treated them with respect and compassion. How different might things have been for them had they heeded the warnings and returned to the Lord with their whole hearts? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.45pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;As it was, God gave them 4 centuries – 4 hundred years – to repent but they didn’t and then Messiah came bringing them redemption, forgiveness and reconciliation as well as His promised judgment when they rejected Him as was seen with the destruction of the Temple and the subsequent scattering of the Jews throughout the nations of the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.45pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Since God chose the Jewish people to be a light to the nations and an example to the rest of the world, we should be looking at them and their history to understand that having no reverential fear of God leads to gross sin and error which leads to judgment. We can also be very sure that after judgment God always brings the promise of forgiveness and restoration which is all for His honour and glory. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.45pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

You will tread down the wicked, for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day which I am preparing,” says the Lord of hosts. Remember the law of Moses My servant, even the statutes and ordinances which I commanded him in Horeb for all Israel. Behold, I am going to send you &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and terrible day of the Lord&lt;/span&gt;. He will restore the hearts of the fathers to their children and the hearts of the children to their fathers so that I will not come and smite the land with a curse.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Malachi means either ‘My Messenger’ or ‘My angel’, angels throughout Scripture have been sent typically to deliver a message from God. Though when speaking of a human being, the name typically would mean ‘My Messenger’. It’s thought that Malachi could be a shortening of the name Malachiah which would mean ‘Messenger of the Lord’.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;As with many other Old Covenant prophets there is little to no information about Malachi as a person but Jewish tradition believes that he was a member of the Great Synagogue or the ‘Great Assembly’ that collected and preserved the Scriptures. The ‘Men of the Great Synagogue’ were believed to have been Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi with a few other notables as well such as Zerubbabel. This synagogue or gathering lasted approximately 1 generation only unfortunately, but its role and influence was pivotal in the rebuilding and restructuring of the nation after the Babylonian exile. A great deal of effort by these men was put into the collection, storage and preservation of the Scriptures and in instructing the people from them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;The book of &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Malachi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is 4 chapters long and has for a very long time been wrongly believed to just be about tithing. Yes, it touches on tithing but the real issues dealt with by Malachi are vastly more encompassing more than just tithing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;The book of Malachi is dated to the late 5th century BC (433-424BC), the 2nd Temple had been rebuilt (completed in 516 BC) and sacrifices were being made daily, so this was during a functional period of the 2nd Temple built by Zerubbabel. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Nehemiah travelled to Jerusalem in 445 BC to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem and then he returned to his position within the royal Persian court in 433 BC. He returned to Israel around 424 BC to deal with the sins that Malachi had described &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Neh 13:6)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; so it’s very likely that the book of Malachi was penned during the timeframe that Nehemiah was back in Persia. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;It’s easy to see the connection between Malachi, Nehemiah and Ezra because there are similar concerns in each of these books. It’s clear that these men were not only contemporaries but they knew and respected each other and they worked together with a unified heart and mission despite the times when they were separated by long distances; their goal was to teach their people the oracles of God and see them return whole-heartedly to the Lord. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;The historical setting was this; a mere 50,000 Jews returned to their homeland from the Babylonian exile, the temple was rebuilt by Zerubbabel and the sacrificial service was re-established. Ezra returned, then Nehemiah returned and after only 1 century the embellished ritualism of Judaism led to hard-heartedness toward God’s incredible love and faithfulness to them; there was a very widespread dismissive attitude with regard to God’s Law by the Priests who were followed by the people. Remember, people follow the example of leadership! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;They were still bringing tithes and sacrifices and offerings, they were still going through the motions of the rituals, but what and how they were keeping these rituals was the problem. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;The Jewish nation of Israel has always been God’s chosen people to be an example to the Gentile nations of the world. God made unconditional covenants with them and even though there were some glorious high points during their history such as during the exodus lead by Joshua, the rule of King David and the repentance of the nation preempted by King Josiah, the Jewish people have never seen the complete fulfillment of those promised covenants because of their repeated compromises and collapses into gross sin. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;In this way they are no different to the rest of the nations of the world, and this repeated cycle of rebellion to judgement to restoration to rebellion to judgement to restoration has meant they have never experience the complete fulfillment of the covenants between themselves and God. However, in the fulness of time these covenants will be completed and fulfilled otherwise God’s Word would fail. Sadly, after God kept His promise to return His people to their land after their 70 year Babylonian exile, it only took 100 years for them to fall back into the sinful ways.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Malachi along with Ezra and Nehemiah, were very committed to drawing their people back to a focus on obeying and honouring the Law, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Mal 4:4; Ezra 7:14, 25-26; Neh 8:18)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and then Malachi set about addressing their many sinse:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Many men, including the priests, were marrying foreign women &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Mal 2:11-15; Ezra 9:10; Neh 13:23-27)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, they were divorcing their Jewish wives whom they’d married in their youth simply so they could marry foreign wives. Divorce was allowed by Moses as we know, but only for a just and legitimate cause; these men were divorcing their wives just so they could upgrade to a exotic foreign wife and this led to the embrace of pagan religious worship once again. King Solomon is the prime example emphasising why God expressly forbade the marrying of foreign women. The only exceptions were the women who converted and were wholly devoted to God, women such as Ruth and Rahab. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Mal 2:11-15)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;There was much corruption in the area of tithes and offerings. The priesthood had become so corrupt that when the people brought their sacrifices, tithes and offerings as had been mandated to do in Torah the priests would keep the best for themselves and give weak, sick, blemished sacrifices to God in their place. As this became acceptable practice, the people simply followed that example. The priests led the people into grave sin. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Mal 3:8-10; Neh 13:10-14)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;If you have no respect for God and His Laws, it follows that you have no respect for the judicial rights and protections of the people around you and social injustice and civic corruption had once again become rampant in the priesthood and civic leadership. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Mal 3:5; Neh 5:1-13)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; They were ripping their own people off once again. They were indulging in sorcery and witchcraft - occult paganism; they were repeatedly going through divorce in order to marry more wives of foreign descent; they were lying and cheating against the most vulnerable of their society namely the average wage earning family, the widow and the orphan who had no real protection other than those who were in leadership; they treated non-Jewish citizens appallingly just turning them aside if they were in need. They did all this because they had no fear of the Lord. All these things were diametrically opposed to God’s instructions of conduct and behaviour for His people.&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt; (Mal 3:5)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;By comparison, if we were to look at the church across countries and denominations what would we see? How does the church universal today differ from the situation Israel found themselves in with regard to faithful adherence and devotion to God and His Word as opposed to the inflated and embellished traditions and dogma of man and in turn, how the congregants are being taught? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;There is a great deal of food for thought here and many lessons to be learned from the book of Malachi as he sought to lead his nation back to genuine faith and obedience to God and His Word. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Haggai is mentioned very briefly in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Ezra 5:1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;6:14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in conjunction with Zechariah, both quotes having to do with the prophetic words spoken in relation to the rebuilding of the Temple. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Zachariah’s encouragement was very much spiritual and visionary while Haggai’s encouragement was more practical and the two of them together really served to reinvigorate the people into action. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This is very much like Christians in the West today; they want to serve God but they think that means being personally blessed with power, wealth, influence and creature comforts without any kind of opposition. But serving God and completing the commissions He gives usually are done at great personal cost and self denial and most often with great opposition and struggle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The habit of meeting in synagogues was a practice that developed during their exile so they would have the opportunity of meeting together in places for social interaction, prayer meetings and the teaching of Torah and church buildings came about the same way but building synagogues and synagogues was never a command by God and the New Covenant ‘church’ is not a building it’s a body of people. The Temple on the other hand was specifically commissioned by God, first in the form of the Tabernacle (Tent of Meeting) in the wilderness and then in Shiloh and then the form of the Temple. It was David’s greatest desire to build the Temple but because he was a man or war, God said his son Solomon would be the one who would build it. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(2 Chron 28)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Their rationale was that they needed to take care of their own homes, businesses and creature comforts in order to be in a position to eventually complete the House of the Lord but there was a problem...no matter how hard they worked and no matter how much effort they put into building their personal lives and meeting their own needs, everything they put their hand to failed with no logical reason for it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;Their crops continued to fail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;They had food and drink, but never enough to satisfy their needs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;They had clothing but never enough to keep them warm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;They earned wages which disappeared so quickly it was as though their purses were full of holes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;They looked for much to meet their needs but it always turned out to be very little&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;They would gather around themselves what they needed and it would blow away&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; color: red;&quot;&gt;Haggai 1:6-9, ‘”You have sown much, but harvest little; you eat, but there is not enough to be satisfied; you drink, but there is not enough to become drunk; you put on clothing, but no one is warm enough; and he who earns, earns wages to put into a purse with holes.” Thus says the Lord of hosts, “Consider your ways! Go up to the mountains, bring wood and rebuild the temple, that I may be pleased with it and be glorified,” says the Lord. “You look for much but behold, it comes to little; when you bring it home, I blow it away. Why?” declares the Lord of hosts, “Because of My house which lies desolate, while each of you runs to his own house.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;The chapter goes on to reveal that God was the One who actually caused the drought that caused the crops and vineyards and olive plantations and livestock to stop producing sufficient yeilds. Why would God do such a thing over a building when we know that God cannot be contained in a building per se? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Where then is a house you could build for Me? And where is a place that I may rest?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;God isn’t opposed to His people living in comfortable houses or having successful businesses, on the contrary God told them very plainly in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Deuteronomy 28:1-14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; that their obedience to Him would ensure all these things for them. Conversely, disobedience would bring the opposite which He went on to clearly explain to them in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Deuteronomy 28:15-68&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;The situation was this...God declared to His people that the Temple was to be the one place on earth where His physical presence would reside right in the heart of His people in the city where He said He would place His very name. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; color: red;&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; color: red;&quot;&gt;Deut 12:5, 10-21; 16:2, 11; 1 Kgs 8:28-29; 9:3; 14:21; 2 Chron 6:5-6; 7:15-16; 33:7; Ezra 6:12; Isa 18:7)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; color: red;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;And God’s presence in both the Tabernacle at Shiloh and Solomon’s Temple was visibly manifested in both the cloud and fire of His shekinah glory. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Num 9; 10; 11; 12; 14; 16; Deut 31; Judg 20; 1 Kings 8; 2 Chron 5; 6)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;The issue wasn’t that God didn’t have a house to live in, He’s God, even the entire universe can’t contain Him, but His people didn’t care that God’s presence wasn’t among them. They didn’t even give Him a second thought. What they could see they didn’t miss or grieve for. They had a complete lack of earnestness about rebuilding the Temple because they really didn’t care if God’s presence was with them or not. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;The issue wasn’t about the Temple as much as it was their indifference to knowing that God’s presence was even among them at all…they were vastly more interested in their own sakes while not comprehending that God is the One who provides shelter, food, clothing, rain, produce from the earth and all that we need to live. Having enough food to eat and shelter to protect your family is without question very important, but they thought they themselves were the source of their provision when the truth is that we only have what we have because of the goodness and kindness of God. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;He withheld those things from them to get their attention back onto Him so they would understand that they needed to have Him as the absolute centre of their lives. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;The truth is that God &lt;b&gt;DESERVES&lt;/b&gt; to be the centre of our lives. He &lt;b&gt;DESERVES&lt;/b&gt; to be praised and honoured and worshipped not because of the things He &lt;i&gt;does for us&lt;/i&gt;, but purely because of &lt;i&gt;who He is&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;He’s is God and it is our highest honour and duty to give Him our very best and put His priorities before our own. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; color: red;&quot;&gt;Romans 12:1, ‘Therefore I urge you brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living (alive) and holy (set apart) sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;service&lt;/span&gt; of worship.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;We are not to be ‘dead’ sacrifices like the millions of animals sacrificed throughout the years of the Tabernacle and Temple services, rather we are to be ‘living’ sacrifices; children of God alive and living humble, submissive and surrendered lives in service to God who deserves nothing less from those He died to redeem. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Even in that uncompromising stand, he always managed to maintain a fierce loyalty and faithfulness to the Gentile pagan monarchs he served. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;The Bible doesn’t identify every single king he served by name or the roles Daniel filled in service to them, but of the kings named in the book of Daniel, we know that he served at the highest levels of government. His roles may have changed during the rule of each consecutive monarch, perhaps he was demoted or set over obscure areas of governance under the various regimes but probably, he spent most of his time training and equipping the Magi over whom he had become leader; what is important to understand however, is that as Daniel served each king in succession and he never compromised in any way. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Serving them was often perilous. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

However distant Belshazzar’s relationship was from Nebuchadnezzar’s, what we know is that Belshazzar appeared to have no idea who Daniel was. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

After Darius death Cyrus of Persia ruled the empire which had became more heavily dominated by the Persians rather than the Medes and again, Daniel served him faithfully until eventually Daniel himself died. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Under no circumstances would Daniel change his views according to the political climate or in order to gain favour among the populace or the political elite. Daniel lived according to his convictions not his or others preferences. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;There is one more thing that would be good to look at however to learn about the kind of man the Prophet Daniel was. In &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Daniel chapter 9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; he was reading the prophetic writings of the Prophet Jeremiah and he embarked on a period of prayer and fasting. During his prayer time he was interrupted by the angel Gabriel who gave him some detailed prophetic insight. There’s no time to unpack the details of that prophecy here, what is important however for our own personal learning is to focus on some really important elements throughout the chapter that reveal so much about Daniel himself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;Daniel was a man who was committed to the study of God’s Word.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;Daniel believed that the Scriptures mean exactly what the say – he took the Bible literally. Jeremiah stated that their captivity in Babylon would be for 70 years and Daniel believed that Jeremiah meant 70 literal years. And it was in fact 70 literal years before they were finally allowed to return to Jerusalem! &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Jer 29:10, Dan 9:2)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;Since the 70 years was almost over, Daniel embarked on a time of prayer and fasting. He didn’t conclude that because the captivity was almost over he didn’t need to pray or fast, He knew God would do what He promised so he prayed according to the desire of God’s heart. What kind of response had God always longed for from His people? He longed for them to have hearts of remorse and sorrow over their sin; He longed for them to be repentant and to return to Him out of genuine love. That’s exactly how Daniel responded in his prayer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;In his prayer Daniel gave his full attention to God, he denied all the distractions of his body by fasting and he put upon himself the degradations that demonstrate remorse and sorrow...’sackcloth and ashes’. The outward signs of remorse were true reflections of how he felt inside and he didn’t care if he looked like a fool to others. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;His prayer included: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;The angel Gabriel appeared and did not wear a white robe or have wings, he was described as ‘The &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;man&lt;/span&gt; Gabriel’. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Dan 9:21) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;We have quite an unbiblical perception of angels that mostly comes from Renaissance art!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;Daniel was faithful to the allocated times laid out in the Torah for prayers and daily offerings even though he wasn’t in Jerusalem and there was no Temple where sacrifices were being conducted. Daniel didn’t forget God’s ordinances or His timetable simply because the Temple was destroyed and he remained faithful to do what he was able to do at the times appointed in Torah. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Dan 9:21)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Daniel wasn’t upset or offended at not understanding everything, he was simply committed to being faithful to what God wanted him to do in the place God had placed him. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Daniel is the kind of person who reflects the nature and character of God whom he worshipped faithfully and he is a phenomenal example of someone we should emulate. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

(look back for the notes ‘Who Were The Magi’ in the Home Group blog for more information)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The vision Daniel saw was very much a dual prophecy because it laid out the centuries immediately following the reign of Babylon as well as presenting future implications for the very last days of human history, however we’re only going to look at the portion that was fulfilled during the ancient historical past after Daniel’s death.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Winged lions guarded the gates of the royal palaces of Babylon. Daniel’s contemporaries, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Habakkuk used animals to describe Nebuchadnezzar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;2.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;Bear: - This is Medo-Persia, with the greater side being Persia and the ‘ribs’ referring to vanquished nations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

He ruled from Europe to Africa to India. The ‘4 heads’ represent the 4 generals who divided the kingdom after Alexander’s death at age 33 (323 BC). They ruled Macedonia, Asia Minor, Syria, and Egypt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Roman dominion fell apart in AD 476, yet it lived on in a divided status but will be revived and return to great unified strength near Christ’s second coming. At that time it will be comprised of the 10 parts under 10 kings as well as the 11&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; king known as anti-Christ. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

The following information is again taken from the MacArthur Study Bible notes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The ram pictures the Medo-Persian Empire, as a whole, its 2 horns standing for the 2 entities (the Medes and the Persians) that merged into one. The history of this empire...is seen conquering from the east to the west, south and north under Cyrus as predicted also by Isaiah 150 years earlier (Isa 45:1-7). The longer horn, which appeared last, represents Persia. The goat represents Greece with its great horn Alexander, who with his army of 35,000, moved with such speed that he is pictured as not even touching the ground. The broken horn is Alexander in his death; the 4 horns are generals who became kings over 4 sectors of the Grecian Empire after Alexander. (The small horn is Antiochus Epiphanes, who rose from the third empire to rule the Syrian division in 175-164 BC. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;(The description of ‘Little Horn’ describes both Antiochus Epiphanes and the future anti-Christ as Antiochus pre-figures the final world ruler) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In addition to the desecration of the Temple, Antiochus blasphemed Christ to whom ultimately the host of Jewish people sacrifice and to whom the sanctuary belongs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

These four generals fought each other and the Seleucid Empire grew to become the biggest of the 4. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Antiochus was not European he was from Syria, which was commonly called the Grecian &lt;i&gt;Empire&lt;/i&gt; because of the influence of Greek Hellenism. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He wanted them to give up their faithfulness to their God and their religion so he could gain their loyalty, particularly as he incorrectly blamed the Jews for his defeat at the hands of the Egyptians, so after mercilessly slaughtering many Jewish men, women and children, he imposed new laws...something Alexander the Great would never have done. He forbad the reading of Torah; scrolls were destroyed so that the Scriptures couldn’t be read or taught; keeping Shabbat was forbidden; observing feasts and other religious rituals and traditions was outlawed, circumcision of male children was forbidden; and even admitting being Jewish was against the law. Doing any of these things could and did result in the death penalty. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

When Yeshua’s disciples asked Him about what signs would occur before His return, He gave them a very lengthy discourse on what would take place and it’s in Matthew 24, but Yeshua says something very important and very specific about something that will take place in the future...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He also stated that the reference to this abomination as stated by Daniel the prophet was really pointing to the very distant future of the final days...what Antiochus Ephiphanes did was just a precursor that gives us a reference so that we understand what the Abomination of Desolation actually is so that we know what to look for. Also, when He said, “let the &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;reader&lt;/span&gt; understand”, He was referring to future generations who would have the written record of the conversation He was having with His disciples; He wasn’t giving them the information because they would be witnesses of this future catastrophe, it was for the future generations who would be alive to witness it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The Temple Institute is situated in the Jewish Quarter of the Old City in Jerusalem and they have already made all the implements necessary to restore Temple Service; the Menorah, the Table of Showbread, the Altar of Incense, the Bronze Laver, all the pots, shovels, pans, jugs, forks and other implements are ready to go. The crowns for the High Priest, the clothing for the priests and the High Priest, the Breast Plate and so many more things are all done, even the musical instruments that will be needed to restore the 24/7 worship established by King David have been made.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;Many Biblical names have the name of God in them either in the abbreviated form ‘El’ for Elohim denoting ‘God’, or ‘Yah’ for Yahweh. Daniel is no different. The last part of this name is ‘el’ - God and the first part means to judge, contend or plead, however it’s in a more possessive form...my judging, my contending etc. So Daniel could mean ‘God is my judge’ or ‘God rules me’. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;Daniel’s birthplace and family are unconfirmed but Josephus states him as belonging to the family of King Zedekiah while others believe he was born to Israelite nobility. Whichever it was, Daniel belonged to a family that was part of the social elite that held positions of wealth, influence and financial means. Daniel was young and strong and good looking, highly intelligent and well educated, with a good understanding about how he should carry himself in a royal court. It was for these reasons that Nebuchadnezzar chose him, his friends and others to be taken to Babylon to serve him in the running of his empire. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He never compromised on the Laws of God whether it was regarding the food he ate, his commitment to prayer, his personal conduct, he always gave God glory and honour, never keeping even a small measure for himself and he never wavered in his profession of faith and devotion to God even in the face of death by sword or lion! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Daniel was always respectful, honouring and truthful to the monarchs he served but he never pandered to them like the other sycophants among his peers and this is seen starkly in the account of Belshazzar’s feast.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

(Me’nay, Me’nay, Te’kal, Perr’as) &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Dan 5)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Yes, I’ll tell you what the message says but I’m going to give you a history lesson first. God gave sovereignty, honour and glory to your father Nebuchadnezzar and this brought the world into submission to him but his power went to his head. He was so full of himself that he actually thought he was god, so to make him understand that he wasn’t god, Yahweh dethroned him and made him live like an animal until he came to his senses and repented. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Me’nay means God has numbered your kingdom and it’s about to end. Te’kal means you’ve been weighed in the balance and found wanting. Perr’as means your kingdom is going to be divided between the Medes and the Persians.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Belshazzar made sure that Daniel received the rewards promised (he had to save face in front of his 1000 guests) but if he was angry with Daniel for speaking so bluntly to him he never got the chance to exact revenge because he didn’t survive the night. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Daniel was 1 of 3 commissioners who were appointed over the Satraps – provincial governors - and he was well loved by Darius. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Dan 5:29-31)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This is evident in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Daniel 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, where Nebuchadnezzar writes the entire chapter which is basically his testimony and &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Daniel 6:16-28&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; shows Darius moving from simply observing Daniel’s faithfulness to God to acknowledging via a written edict sent throughout his entire empire that Yahweh IS the living God who is eternal and indestructible. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

9935,Home Group - Ezekiel Pt 2,"&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin-right: 8px; float: left;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/724407_24295926%20small.jpg&quot; height=&quot;186&quot; width=&quot;249&quot; /&gt;Ezekiel (yekh-ez-kal) Pt 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;We began looking at Ezekiel last week and learned that he was among the first exiles to Babylon, he was both a prophet and a priest and was of the family of Zadok which was part of Jewish Nobility. He was married and held a place of privilege and respect among his people. He was 25 when he was taken to Babylon and 30 when he began his prophetic ministry. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;Ezekiel loved his people and his greatest desire was not for political revival, rather he wanted to see his individual countrymen come to the Lord with repentant hearts for the sin they had committed that had led them into captivity. He also wanted to encourage his countrymen with the knowledge that God always kept His Word to His people. He said they would go into captivity for their unrepented sin and they did. He promised He would lead them back to their land and He would. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;Ezekiel also had a unique way of presenting the prophetic words God gave him, almost as though they were object lessons and he frequently displayed physical presentations in order to communicate a spiritual truth or message. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;We pick up this week by looking at some illustrations of spiritual principles in the book of Ezekiel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;Ezekiel was told to eat the scroll - even though the writing on the scroll was full of lamentations, mourning and woe it was sweet in the prophet’s mouth because it was the Word of God Himself, which is a light and always produces life. So sometimes when we read the Word of God it convicts and cuts us and exposes where we are in error, but because the Word brings correction and healing, restoration and forgiveness, despite the initial pain it brings, it always brings life making it sweet. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Ezek 2&amp;amp;3)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;The four creatures representing the 12 Tribes of Israel is again repeated in the book of Revelation which shows us that God keeps His covenant promises to His people and their future is absolutely assured. When He names and identifies specific people, He means them specifically and not someone else allegorically. God means precisely what He says. &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Ezek 1:4-21; Rev 4:5-11)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;The ‘barbershop’ scene where the prophet shaves his head and beard demonstrate the humiliation his people will face because of their rebellion. Therefore God wants us to understand that unrepentant sinful behaviour will have a consequence and it won’t be enjoyable, sin is deadly. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Ezek 5:1-4)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;The graffiti on the Temple walls offended God, this demonstrated that God wants holiness and purity in His house not filthiness and depravity. It is incumbent upon us to treat what is holy as holy and not to take God’s grace and mercy and provision for granted or treat His name, His Word and His Holy Spirit casually or disrespectfully. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Ezek 8:10-12)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;Another primary theme throughout the book is God’s holiness and sovereignty, something the Israelites had completely forgotten in their efforts to live as they pleased. Ezekiel communicated this truth to the people by contrasting God’s holiness and purity as bright glory against the despicable depravity of Judah’s sins. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;Like all the prophets of Israel, Ezekiel not only delivered God’s messages of anger, frustration and judgement on His people because of their rebellion, idolatry and stubbornness, but Ezekiel also delivered God’s promise of forgiveness, restoration and fulfilment of their calling and covenants especially with relation to the land and heritage He’d promised them unconditionally through Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and later on through David. God never left His people without hope for their future. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;One of the final major themes found in Ezekiel is in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;chapters 40-48&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and these all pertain to the future Temple in Jerusalem. The dimensions and elements of this final temple are markedly different from both the original Temple built by Solomon and the second Temple built by Zerubbabel which was finished by Herod the Great. This final Temple will be built and will be functional from which Messiah will reign when He returns to establish His righteous government upon the earth. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;Of course all the messages that Ezekiel was commissioned to speak to his countrymen came at great personal cost to the prophet because the people were unwilling to hear him and many times God forewarned Ezekiel that upon delivering his message the people would tie him up with ropes, imprison him, hate him, reject him...and this of course broke the heart of the prophet who desperately loved his own people, he loved God supremely and his greatest desire was to see his people reconciled to their God. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;Possibly one of the saddest and hardest things Ezekiel had to endure was the death of his beloved wife. Hard enough for any man (or woman) to lose their best friend and life partner, but in Ezekiel’s case, God instructed him that he wasn’t to grieve for her. He could grieve and groan inwardly, but he wasn’t to show any outward signs of grief or mourning. This is a very, very big ask by God from a man who loved Him supremely but also who loved his wife dearly. What was the purpose of God asking such a thing? God was illustrating through Ezekiel’s personal tragedy that His people were not to grieve over the loss of their holy city (often called ‘The Bride of Kings) and their holy Temple because they had become exceedingly corrupted and God was going to do away with them...for a time. God would eventually restore these things to them, but what had become filthy and polluted had to be destroyed and the people themselves were responsible for that mess. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;Another very sad chapter in Ezekiel is when he had a vision showing the glory of God leaving the Temple. God is holy and His nature and character is holy and His holiness is so profound and so pure that He cannot dwell with sin and corruption, because they people had polluted His Temple so badly, God’s glory – His indescribable presence – simply left and after that day, it never ever returned even after the second Temple was built. The next time God revealed His glory, it was in His Son Yeshua. God will not share His glory or His house with that which is profane and ungodly and there is a powerful lesson for the modern church to learn from this sobering and tragic portion of Ancient Israel’s history. &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Ezek 10)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;It’s not possible to talk about the prophet Ezekiel without mentioning three incredibly important chapters. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;The first of these being &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;chapter 37: The Valley of Dry Bones.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;Here’s an interesting piece of historical trivia...no nation or national people once they’ve been dispersed or exiled from their land for more than 200 years has ever been restored as a nation or national people...except for one – the Jewish people. Keep that in mind as we look at the next prophetic chapter in Ezekiel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;This chapter is a graphic description of the destruction of the Jewish people; the valley God showed to Ezekiel was full of dead bodies all reduced to very, very dry scattered bones. This was a people dead and without hope and yet God determined that they would live once more. He told Ezekiel to prophesy to the bones and when he did, he heard a noise, a rattling noise and all the bones came together and then sinews formed on the bones followed by new flesh and skin but they were still lying dead in the valley. They had reformed but were dead! Then Ezekiel continued to prophesy and the breath of God filled them, they stood upright and came to life and they became an exceedingly great army. Who do these bones represent? &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(37:1-10)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; color: red;&quot;&gt;Ezekiel 37:11-12, ‘Then He said to me, “Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel; behold, they say, ‘Our bones are dried up and our hope has perished. We are completely cut off.’ Therefore prophesy and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God, “Behold, I will open your graves and cause you to come up out of your graves, My people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel.”’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;When did this happen?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;What’s interesting is that after the Babylonian exile, the Jews were not utterly destroyed and without hope and when they did return after the Babylonian exile, they never ruled themselves as an independent sovereign nation, they were always under the rule of another occupying nation or empire, and they were never an exceedingly great army. Not until after the catastrophe of the Nazi Holocaust (or the Shoah as it’s called in Hebrew) when the Jewish people returned to their ancient homeland after being destroyed and left for dead and once the State of Israel was established in 1948, they developed an army that has to date been undefeatable despite the many invasions and attacks by their COMBINED enemies. This is a stunning fulfilment of the prophecy from &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Ezekiel 37&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, the Valley of Dry Bones. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;This Sunday just gone was Holocaust Remembrance Day in Israel and there are still over 150,000 Holocaust survivors still living in Israel today, many of them over 80 years of age, and what this 65 year old nation has achieved in such a short space of time is nothing short of miraculous! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;The other two chapters which are probably the most famous chapters in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Ezekiel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; are&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt; &lt;b&gt;chapters 38 &amp;amp; 39&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;These chapters are yet future and they describe what has become known as the Battle of Gog and Magog. They describe a time yet future when Israel will be living in a relatively peaceful state, specifically when they will be without walls or unwalled villages. It also describes the land as being wealthy and bountiful and God Himself draws Israel’s ancient enemies out against her; these enemy nations think they’re going to invade and take Israel and her wealth as plunder for themselves but God has determined to personally fight against Israel’s enemies to destroy them once and for all as a judgement against them for all their hatred and mistreatment of Israel throughout their history. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;These enemies will invade to take plunder, and for years Bible prophecy teachers have questioned what that plunder could possibly be. For decades people have been saying that Israel has no natural resources to make her attractive for invasion so what will these nations attempt to plunder? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;Well, Israel’s national economy is greater than all her surrounding neighbours COMBINED! Israel has been incredibly industrious over the past 65 years developing a thriving agricultural industry which includes not only fruits, vegetables and flowers, it also has a thriving meat and dairy industry too. They are a leader in medicine, pharmaceuticals, high tech, telephone and communications and IT as well as military technology industries and they are the most ecologically sound nation in the world as well having developed desalination plants to secure their water needs, solar hot water power for everyone, and each year Israel ends with more trees in the ground than when it started.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;This in and of itself makes Israel more than a little attractive to the war-torn poverty-ravaged neighbours who surround them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;But that’s not the only thing that will be in the minds of these enemies when they attempt to invade Israel, because Israel has discovered some of the world’s largest natural gas fields as well, and after the Muslim Brotherhood came to power in Egypt, terrorists blew up the gas pipeline that was transporting gas to Israel and only about a week ago, Israel began accessing its own natural gas from its own gas fields, which means Israel is well on its way to become energy self-sufficient. What other nation of the world can make that boast? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;These chapters are graphic in how the battles unfold and it names the nation’s who come against Israel, and its during this battle that Israel realises that she can’t defend herself with her own army as she has up to that point, she may have an exceedingly great army, but in this future instance she realises that she must call upon God for her deliverance or she won’t survive. The nations not listed are those who are on her immediate borders, and &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Psalm 83&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; lists them as being in a confederacy together whose goal is to destroy Israel so that the name of Israel will be remembered no more. Perhaps the reason these nations are not listed in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Ezekiel 38 and 39 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;are because their attempt to destroy Israel results in their own demise and therefore they’re not in a position to fight with the nations listed in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Ezekiel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. It’s an interesting possibility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;There are many who believe that this famed battle of Gog and Magog is very close at hand. Time will tell. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Wingdings;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;J&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;Being a prophet was a high calling but equally a lonely calling and always a dangerous calling. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;There is little known about Ezekiel’s death, in fact there are no details of how he died that I could find, but we do know that his grave is in Al Kifl in Iraq, south of Bagdad near the Euphrates River...Iraq of course is the modern name of Ancient Babylon. Ezekiel was buried in the land to which he was exiled after the siege and fall of Jerusalem when Judah was invaded and subjugated by King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;Many of Ezekiel’s prophecies have come to pass, those that haven’t are yet future but what we know for certain is that all of God’s words of warning, judgement, promise and restoration will come to pass because God’s word cannot fail...ever!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; color: red;&quot;&gt;Ezekiel 39:25-29, ‘Therefore thus says the Lord God, “Now I will restore the fortunes of Jacob and have mercy on the whole house of Israel; and I will be jealous for My holy name. They will forget their disgrace and all their treachery which they perpetrated against Me, when they live securely on their own land with no one to make them afraid. When I bring them back from the peoples and gather them from the lands of their enemies, then I shall be sanctified through them in the sight of the many nations. Then they will know that I am the Lord their God because I made them go into exile among the nations and then gathered them again to their own land; and I will leave none of them there any longer. I will not hide My face from them any longer, for I will have poured out My Spirit on the house of Israel,” declares the Lord God.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;If God were to break His covenant promises to Israel He would be defaming His own name, because He swore to keep His covenants with Israel by His own name. There is no one or nothing higher than His name, so He swore by Himself to keep His covenants with them and God cares more about His own reputation that we do about ours. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;This name is made up of two elements, the last element is ‘El’ which is a common abbreviation of the name of the Lord, ‘Elohim’ while the first element, ‘hazaq’ means to be or become strong or courageous. It’s mostly used to charge soldiers to be strong. So Ezekiel means ‘God Strengthens’, ‘Strengthened by God’ or ‘Strength of God’. This name is especially appropriate for Ezekiel because his message to his people made him extremely unwanted, unwelcome and unpopular and without God strengthening him for his mission it would have been particularly difficult to endure all he went through.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;The story of Ezekiel can be found in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;48 chapters of the book of Ezekiel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and this week is mostly background and historical setting to explain the social situation Ezekiel was in when he was called to be a prophet to his people. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;Ezekiel lived during the lifetimes of the prophet Daniel during the reign of King Zedekiah of Judah...who also happened to be the last king of Judah and also during the last half of the prophet Jeremiah’s life, and Ezekiel lived during the Babylonian exile. He began his prophetic ministry in the 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; year of King Jehoiachin’s captivity in Babylon, remembering that this king was so terribly wicked God pronounced a blood curse on his family line. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;Ezekiel saw the destruction of both Jerusalem and the magnificent Temple built by King Solomon and was part of the first Jewish contingency to be deported to Babylon at the beginning of the 70 year exile that had been prophesied by the prophet Jeremiah. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;As mentioned in previous studies, the primary task of a prophet was to provoke the people and the government to repentance and observance of God’s laws. This invariably meant that their messages were mostly in the form of a rebuke that not only listed the sins of the people in detail and God’s abhorrence to them, but their messages also included details of how judgement would come to them if they didn’t repent and return to the Lord and His ways. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;Many see God in the Old Testament as brutal and harsh and vengeful, but when you consider how many years God took to warn His people and how long He gave them to repent, you actually come away with the understanding that despite the depravity and rebellion of the people, God waited many hundreds of years before He finally brought promised judgement. God in the Old Testament is in fact incredibly gracious and patient and merciful. The culmination of His mercy is ultimately seen at the cross of Calvary. This picture of God’s enormous mercy is very dramatically seen if you read from Genesis right through to the end of the Gospels in a continuous sequence. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;Many have stated that today we’re living in the era of grace which is true, but God has always extended grace to humanity and it’s very evident throughout the Old Covenant as much as it is in the New Covenant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;Because prophets had a reputation for always bringing a message of rebuke and judgement they were very often feared by the people; nobody likes having their sins exposed, nor do they want to change their behaviour. Repentance is as unpopular today as it’s always been. Secret or unnamed sin has the most power, but if you admit and confess it, it loses it power and can no longer control you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;Ezekiel was only 25 years old when he was taken captive and he was 30 when he was called into the ministry which is the traditional age for Jewish men to enter ministry service. His ministry began in either 593 or 592 BC and his ministry lasted approximately 22 years and just like Jeremiah and Zechariah, Ezekiel was both and prophet and a priest, in fact he was in the Zadok family line and this meant he was among the aristocracy whom king Nebuchnezzar selected as his first captives...included among these noble Israelites was the prophet Daniel and his 3 close friends Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah more well known as Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;Ezekiel was a married man as was the case for the priests and he lived among other Jewish exiles near Tel-Abib on the River Chebar and he lived in his own house. He was considered to be wise by the Jewish elders and they often visited him wanting a divine word or oracle because Ezekiel was remember, of good family lineage and in the priestly line. His was a special position. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;As a prophet and priest he belonged to a privileged segment of the Jewish community and he lived at a strategic time in history because he was able to refer back to previous prophetic announcements by the prophet Jeremiah who warned the Jews of impending judgement and exile if they didn’t repent of their wickedness and he could also point to the fulfilment of those prophecies because they themselves WERE the fulfilment of those prophecies, they were actually living in exile after they’d been taken captive just as Jeremiah had said they would. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;The Jewish monarchy and government had been annihilated by the Babylonians, Jewish political and national life was over as far as their independent national identity was concerned, their city and state were ransacked and their Temple was utterly destroyed. This was the situation Ezekiel himself was living in when God called him to be a prophetic voice to his people living in and under Babylonian rule. I doubt he welcomed his mission; the people had no desire to be told that their misery and exile was of their own doing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;Ezekiel had the unenviable task of communicating to his countrymen that they didn’t need to despair, God wasn’t through with them...unfortunately, his countrymen believed that God was indeed through with them. Ezekiel had to try to communicate that God in His sovereignty had lead them to Babylon because of their sin and disobedience but that through His sovereignty God would restore them once again but this would occur through the repentance of the people themselves. Once again, this was a call for personal and individual repentance before God and submission to His laws and ways. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;What makes Ezekiel so very different to other prophets is that he strived to reach his countrymen in very personal and individual ways, he desperately wanted to win them back to the Lord and he felt personally responsible for each one of them. His focus was never on establishing the nation with political goals and aspirations, rather Ezekiel’s hope was for his people to become a congregation under the pure dominion of God one heart at a time. So for the collective nation to submit to God, they had to come as individuals and submit to God personally.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;Another unique characteristic of Ezekiel’s ministry was his prophetic behaviours and ‘acting out’ God’s message to the people, it’s as though he wanted to play spiritual charades (for want of a better description) in a bid to capture their attention and emphasise his message. Because his message was unwelcome, it’s easy to just dismiss someone standing and delivering an audible message so he incorporated action to his message to make his words easier to comprehend. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;His desire was to provoke his people to action and return to the Lord through repentance and faith that God would keep His promise to them. These actions were demonstrated in the following ways...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;Above all, the central theme in all that Ezekiel says and does is the ‘Glory of the Lord’; this is seen very graphically in chapters &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline; color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;:28, &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;:12 &amp;amp; 23, &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;:4 &amp;amp; 18, &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;:23, &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;43&lt;/span&gt;:4 &amp;amp; 5, &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;44&lt;/span&gt;:4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Ezekiel includes graphic descriptions of the disobedience of both Israel and Judah despite God’s kindness, patience and long-suffering warnings which He gave again and again and again. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;&quot;&gt;God will not withhold judgment and discipline forever, but He always promised that He would bring about forgiveness and restoration for His people and the judgement and discipline He used would invariably lead His people to repentance and remorse over the sin and rebellion that led them to that place in the first place. We can have great confidence that our God is a God who always keeps His promise. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;The celebration of Easter is really the Jewish feast of Passover which was instituted by God in the Bible and it was to commemorate the deliverance by God of His people from Egyptian slavery. The account of their slavery can be found in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Exodus 1-15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and the specifics of Passover are detailed in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Exodus 11-13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;There are no references to Easter in the Bible or in the Apostolic first church, it was introduced after the death of the Apostle John by some Gentile churches that had spread outside of Asia Minor and Polycarp, who was directly discipled by the Apostle John contested the alternate dates for celebrating the death and resurrection of Christ but all parties agreed it was not really something they should all break fellowship over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Those who maintained celebrating on 14 Nisan according to the Bible and the Jewish calendar came to be known as the Quartodecimans, which is just a fancy Latin word for fourteen. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;By the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; and 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centuries, anti-Semitism was becoming dangerously common place within the official church and in 325 at the Council of Nicea, the First Ecumenical Council declared that ‘Easter’ was never allowed to fall on the same date as the Jewish feast of Passover (14 Nisan) but had to fall on the first Sunday afterward. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;The result was the excommunication of individuals and whole church communities, specifically isolating any Jewish believers that were still part of the Christian community, some Quartodecimans were even executed because they wanted to remain faithful to the dates laid out in , rather than the dates instituted by the official church.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Emperor Constantine said that all those that attended the First Ecumenical Council had decided to adopt an uniform date, rejecting Jewish custom, blaming them for Christ’s death. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;‘It was resolved by the united judgment of all present, that this feast ought to be kept by all and in every place on one and the same day. For what can be more becoming or honourable to us than that this feast, from which we date our hopes of immortality, should be observed unfailingly by all alike, according to one ascertained order and arrangement? &lt;b&gt;And first of all, it appeared an unworthy thing that in the celebration of this most holy feast we should follow the practice of the Jews, who have impiously defiled their hands with enormous sin, and are, therefore, deservedly afflicted with blindness of soul. For we have it in our power, if we abandon their custom, to prolong the due observance of this ordinance to future ages, by a truer order, which we have preserved from the very day of the passion until the present time. Let us then have nothing in common with the detestable Jewish crowd; for we have received from our Saviour a different way. A course at once legitimate and honourable lies open to our most holy religion. Beloved brethren, let us with one consent adopt this course, and withdraw ourselves from all participation in their baseness... being altogether ignorant of the true adjustment of this question, they sometimes celebrate Easter twice in the same year. Why then should we follow those who are confessedly in grievous error? Surely we shall never consent to keep this feast a second time in the same year… &lt;/b&gt;And let your Holinesses' sagacity reflect how grievous and scandalous it is that on the self-same days some should be engaged in fasting, others in festive enjoyment; and again, that after the days of Easter some should be present at banquets and amusements, while others are fulfilling the appointed fasts. It is, then, plainly the will of Divine Providence (as I suppose you all clearly see), that this usage should receive fitting correction, and be reduced to one uniform rule.’ - &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot;&gt;Eusebius, in Schaff, &lt;span&gt;Life of Constantine&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;b&gt;book III&lt;/b&gt;, CCEL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;reference-text&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Over the past 50 years however there has been a concerted effort by Christians to learn about the Jewish roots of the Christian faith and this has brought considerable understanding and significance to all that we believe and all that Yeshua did for us, amplifying and explaining the prophetic implications. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Okay, basically the story of the Passover is that God brought 10 plagues upon the Egyptians for refusing to let the Hebrews go free, the final plague was absolutely tragic. The plague would kill every firstborn male of every family throughout the land of Egypt from Pharaoh’s household to the lowliest, even their animals would not escape. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;In order for the Hebrews to escape this plague they were required to take a first born male lamb from their flocks that was perfect, completely blemish free and at a specific time they were to kill the lamb and drain all the blood from it and paint the top and sides of their front door posts so that when the angel of death came later on that specific night it would see the blood on the door and ‘pass over’. They had to remove every trace of leaven from their homes, they had to roast the lamb and leave none of it till morning, they were to eat unleavened bread and bitter herbs along with the roasted lamb and they were to eat it in haste, with their travelling clothes on as though there were about to leave in a great hurry. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;There is a great deal more to the story but for the sake of brevity, that’s a basic overview. Now to the Passover Seder (Say-dah) which means ‘order’ (because the meal follows a particular sequence) and the Messianic significance of the elements incorporated in the feast. In a traditional Jewish home there are 15 steps in the Passover feast, but in Messianic homes or the less traditional homes, there may be less. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Removal of all leaven from the home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;All Jewish homes use the preceding days to thoroughly clean their homes and remove all forms of leaven because during Passover, leaven symbolises sin and its removal symbolises repentant hearts determined to expel anything sinful or displeasing to God from their lives. Typically, small leavened pieces of bread are hidden in obvious places in the home and the children or youngest members of the family are commissioned with finding them and disposing of them. It’s a bit of a ‘hide and seek’ type game which is meant to be fun. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(1 Cor 5:6)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Lighting of the Passover candles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;This is typically done by the woman or mother of the family, just as she is the one to light the Shabbat candles each week as well. The lighting of the candles during Passover is the serious part of the celebration because they symbolise the presence of God among them and that in and of itself is both serious and sacred. As believers in Yeshua, we recognise the He is the Light of the World come to bring light and life to those living in darkness. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Jn 8:12, 9:5)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;The first cup: the Cup of Sanctification &amp;amp; Freedom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;The four cups during Passover come from &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Ex 6:6-7, “Say therefore to the sons of Israel, ‘I am the Lord and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from their bondage. I will also redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great judgements. Then I will take you for My people, and I will be your God; and you shall know that I am the Lord your God, who brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.’”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;The four cups represent the four “I will” statements by God&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;“I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;“I will deliver you from their bondage.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;“I will redeem you with and outstretched arm and with great judgements.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;“I will take you for My people and I will be your God.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;The first cup is called the Cup of Sanctification &amp;amp; Freedom in which God makes His people holy unto Himself. In Yeshua we recognise that His sacrifice is what makes us holy, it’s His sacrifice that washes us clean from the filth and depravation of our sin. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Heb 10:10)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Hand washing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;This is not about hygiene, it’s a symbolic hand washing that because of what God has done we are made clean. Again, we see Yeshua doing this with His own disciples but He showed incredible humility by washing their feet, something only the lowest of slaves would do. Being washed by Him makes us clean. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Heb 10:22)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Karpas – the green vegetables (parsley)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;The parsley is dipped into salt water; the parsley represents the bitter herbs the Hebrews were required to eat and the salt represents tears; bitterness for all the bitter slavery they endured for hundreds of years and salt representing their tears shed while waiting for redemption. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;This portion of the Seder is also taken from the Song of Solomon which is typically a song between and man and a woman but in various places in the Old Covenant, God referred to Israel as His wife and He as her Husband. God wanted to see His relationship restored to His people and He wanted their love for Him to be rekindled. Yeshua is called the Bridegroom and those who believe in Him are His bride. The typology is stunning. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Isa 54:5-8; Hos 2:16; 2 Cor 11:2; Eph 5:25; Rev 19:7)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;The breaking of the Matza bread (Afikomen)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;After the Temple was destroyed in 70 AD, the Jews no longer had the opportunity to make sacrifices and this meant an alternative emblem had to be introduced into the Passover meal to replace the sacrificed lamb, the alternative was the Afikomen. Three pieces of Matza bread are placed into a special bag - the Afikomen - which means ‘That which cames after’ or ‘That which is coming’. The middle piece of Matza is removed and broken in half; one half is returned to the bag and the other half is wrapped and hidden in the house somewhere. Many Jews think that the second Matza symbolises their affliction in Egypt but cannot explain why the second piece is selected. As stated, this emblem is to replace the sacrificed lamb but why are there three Matza's and why is the second one broken and hidden? Some in the Jewish community believe they represent Abraham, Isaac and Jacob but have no explanation as to why the second – Isaac – has to be broken, but for believers in Yeshua, we see these Matza as being reflective of the Trinity; Father, Son and Holy Spirit with the second one – the Son – being broken on our behalf, with His body being buried and then rising again. In fact, during the ‘Last Supper’, when Yeshua broke the bread He actually said it represented His body! &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Matt 26:26; Mark 14:22; Luke 22:19; 1 Cor 11:24)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The fact that Afikomen actually means ‘That which is coming’ could also be a reference to His second coming. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;The story of Passover&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;This is the part of the Seder where the story is relayed and four questions are asked:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Why is this night different than all other nights?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Why on all other nights do we eat bread with leaven, but on this night we only eat unleavened bread?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Why on all other nights do we eat of all kinds of herbs, but on this night we eat bitter herbs?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Why on all other nights do we eat in the normal way, but on this night we eat with special ceremony?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;As all four questions are answered the story of Passover is recalled; they were enslaved to harsh Egyptian slave masters who made their lives miserable with unbearable burdens; they eat unleavened bread to remove sin from their lives and have repentant hearts before God and they seek His mercy; they eat only bitter herbs so they remember the bitterness of their slavery so they never forget; and they eat this meal with great ceremony because God provided for them incredible miracles of deliverance from their oppressive enemy. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Again, we see the parallel is striking: we were slaves to sin bearing unbearable burdens that we could not free ourselves from; we are to come before God with repentant hearts with true remorse for our sin seeking His forgiveness and cleansing; we must never forget the bitterness of our slavery to sin because it brought us death and suffering; we remember through our communion ceremony the price Yeshua paid for our redemption, we remember because He is worthy to be honoured and adored for His sacrificial love toward us. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Rom 6)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;The second cup: the Cup of Deliverance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;This cup is drunk in celebration of the deliverance as the people were lead out of Egypt, finally free of their slavery. We celebrate for the same reason as just answered in the four questions – deliverance was given because God granted it in His mercy. &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Rom 6)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;The Meal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;This is where the full meal is eaten, but all the elements on the Seder plate are systematically gone through. The full meal is served and everyone enjoys their food and each other’s company. This is a meal of joy and great celebration. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;The third cup: the Cup of Redemption&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;At the Passover Seder a place is always set that remains empty, it is set for the prophet Elijah because &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Mal 4:50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; brings the expectation the Elijah the prophet will be the forerunner of Messiah and of course Messiah is the One who will bring about ultimate redemption. Typically it’s at this point in the Seder that the children are sent to find the hidden Afikomen and the third Cup of Redemption is drunk. The Jews celebrate their redemption from Egyptian slavery but they are also earnestly waiting for Messiah to come with their ultimate redemption and therefore, the sooner Elijah comes the sooner Messiah comes and it’s for this reason Elijah has been incorporated into the Passover feast.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;We know that John the Baptist came in the spirit of Elijah and was the forerunner of Messiah, a voice in the wilderness making the way straight for Yeshua when He came the first time. When the children find the Afikomen there is great rejoicing because ‘That which is coming’ has finally come. Everyone takes a piece of the Afikomen and proceeds to eat it (symbolically eating the Passover Lamb) along with drinking the Cup of Redemption. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Often the youngest child will run to the door and open it in the hope that Elijah is waiting there ready to be welcomed in by the family in anticipation of the imminent arrival of Messiah. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;During the ‘Last Supper’ Yeshua instituted this part of the Seder to be about remembering His sacrifice of shed blood and broken body requiring His disciples (all of us) to eat and drink as often as we come together. The symbolism of the 'Communion' meal is once again very stark here. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Rom 7:6; 2 Cor 1:10; Col 1:13)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;The fourth cup: the Cup of Thanksgiving and Hope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;This cup closes the Seder stating that the Seder is complete just as our redemption is complete even though we are still awaiting the Messiah. It’s a cup of thanksgiving and hope, knowing that what God has promised He will most assuredly do. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;It’s believed that it was this last cup of the Passover Seder that Yeshua did not drink, and He said He would not drink it again until He drinks it in His Father’s Kingdom which will be when He returns and is welcomed by His own people. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Matt 26:29; Luke 22:18)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;We as believers can be absolutely assured that our redemption is complete, we cannot add a single thing to it and neither do we need to, Yeshua’s work on the cross was absolutely complete. It’s in this knowledge that we should demonstrate intense gratitude and thankfulness to Him for what He has done and knowing that our hope is not in vain; we don’t waste our hope when we put our faith and trust in Him. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Because Messiah hasn’t come by the end of the Seder, everybody says together...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;“Next year in Jerusalem” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;This has been the cry of every Jewish heart since the Diaspora of the Jewish people around the world and they’ve repeated this every year for the past 2000 years and it carries the hope not only of restoration for the people and their nation but also for the coming of Messiah. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;As believers we long for the return of Messiah that He would come and set right all things and establish His kingdom in His righteousness and His throne will be in Jerusalem, the throne of His father ‘David’. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Luke 1:32)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;At this point the candles are extinguished and the Seder is complete.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Happy Passover...never forget!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

So Zechariah means ‘Yahweh Remembers’ or ‘the Remembrance of Yahweh’.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The name Zechariah was very common through Biblical times and there are 29 men in the Bible with this name, but Zechariah the prophet was no ordinary man because he was both a prophet and a priest like 2 other OT prophets, Jeremiah and Ezekiel. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Neh 12:12-16)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Jewish tradition believes he was a member of the Great Synagogue, a council of 120 who originated with Nehemiah who were presided over by Ezra, this group eventually developed into a group of ruling elders for the nation that was collectively called the ‘Sanhedrin’, so Zechariah was a founding member of the Sanhedrin. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Scripture says Zechariah returned to Jerusalem with his grandfather Iddo, who was the High Priest at one point, and Zechariah was often called the son of his grandfather, and it’s for this reason it’s believed his father Berechiah died quite early before he himself had the opportunity to become the High Priest, this resulted in Zechariah being raised by his grandfather. They returned to Jerusalem under the leadership of Zerubbabel and Joshua the High Priest at that time &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Neh 12:4)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and Zechariah lived and ministered at the same time as the prophet Haggai; it’s believed their ministry years lasted about the same length of time. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In 538 BC, Cyrus the Persian freed the Jewish captives and allowed them resettle to in their ancient homeland and about 50,000 made the decision to return and they immediately began the task of rebuilding the Temple despite a great deal of opposition from the locals. Both Zechariah and Haggai were commissioned by God to stir the people up to remain committed to God and zealous in rebuilding the Temple regardless of the opposition they faced. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Or God, who had called them to repent time after time after time and ultimately delivered severe judgement and exile, as He said He would, but who promised on His own name that He would bring them back into their land. He was in effect telling his people to judge the trustworthiness of God by looking back on their history to see how God proved Himself by keeping His promised of both blessing and judgement. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Wall St in New York, the hub of world trade and finance? The United Nations building in New York; the site of all the nations of the world coming together for the betterment of humanity and the planet? No! The most contested piece of real estate in the entire world today is the city of Jerusalem in Israel. It’s a small city, it has no harbour, it is not on a major trade route; it has no natural resources within its borders to speak of, and by comparison to other international capital cities, has a very small population. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The whole world is beginning to gather against Jerusalem and it’s becoming extremely antagonistic toward Israel and are infuriated over the fact that Israel will not divide its ancient capital and give east Jerusalem to the Arabs. This is what Zechariah had to say about Jerusalem in the last days. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Jerusalem’s status is so contentious that all the foreign embassies that reside in Israel are not situated in Jerusalem, Israel’s capital as they should be and as they are in all other nations, foreign embassies in Israel are situated in Tel Aviv instead. The UN – the voice of representation of the combined nations of the world – has passed more resolutions against Israel than any other nation on earth. The UN hasn’t passed any resolutions against Iran or Syria or Saudi Arabia and we know the kind of human rights abuses that these nations are guilty of, but Israel, which is the ONLY free democracy in the entire Middle East is singled out repeatedly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The embassy relocation was supposed to be completed by May 31, 1999. This law has never been implemented and each sitting President since this law passed – Clinton, Bush and Obama – have all claimed the presidential waiver citing national security issues to renege on this move. When this bill passed, it passed with a majority; 93 – 5 in the Senate, and 347 – 37 in the House. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

How would Australians feel if foreign nations decided they wouldn’t establish their embassies in our nation’s capital or even recognise the legitimacy of our capital, the very seat of our government and sovereign rule, because of past perceived offenses to members of our society but instead, established their embassies in Sydney or Adelaide? What if something similar happened in the USA because of their past historical treatment of the American Indians, or the UK because of British colonialism and their treatment of millions of people within the British Commonwealth over several centuries which is very well documented and verified. The difference between Israel and Australia, the UK and the USA and a majority of other nations, is that Israel HASN’T done the majority of what she’s been accused of, actually the opposite is true. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

At the time Zechariah lived, the High Priest’s name was Joshua, the name Joshua is basically the same as Yeshua and it means ‘Yahweh Is Salvation’; we also know that Yeshua the Messiah is also our High Priest. Zechariah had a prophetic message for the then High Priest at that time whose name means Salvation, and God’s message was prophetic for the entire nation both then and for the future; He told Joshua and the men with him that they were a symbol of what was to come. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

There is of course still sin in the world, but its power over those who repent and come to faith in Christ has been utterly shattered and destroyed because of that singular event we call Calvary. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This is not talking about the physical Temple of that day because it was built by Zerubbabel and later increased and improved by Herod the Great.

However, in the case of the Messiah, He will be both. He will rule His people from His throne...a throne represents a political position of authority and power. He will be a Priest, a Mediator who would provide sacrifices and offerings to God on behalf of the people and bring the Words of God, His direction and instruction and encouragement to the people. Something Yeshua has done.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

So this name may mean ‘Hidden or stored for Yahweh’, ‘Hid of the Lord / Whom the Lord hides or protects’, it may also mean ‘Jehovah has treasured’. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Zephaniah lived during the reign on King Josiah of Judah the Southern Kingdom, the Northern Kingdom of Israel had already been destroyed by the Assyrians, he also lived during the ministry years of the prophet Nahum and he was alive very briefly at the beginning of Jeremiah’s ministry. Zephaniah was the great-great-great-grandson of King Hezekiah and was therefore of the royal bloodline and as such it’s quite unusual that he was called to be a prophet. The only other royal king who was a prophet was king David who himself wrote some amazing prophetic psalms although he never held the office of a prophet. Of course, Zephaniah was not a king he was merely of royal descent so in truth, he is the only Biblical prophet of royal lineage. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

So it may very well have been a shock when God raised Zephaniah up as a prophet to his people with a message of incredible judgement. Zephaniah’s ministry focus was not so much on the present day circumstances of his people, rather, his focus was like that of the prophet Joel, he prophesied about the very distant future, a specific period of time called the Day of the Lord. Zephaniah as a prophet was aware that the apparent ‘righteous’ behaviour of his people was not only a facade, it was very temporary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But as stated above, the prophecies of Zephaniah actually look forward to that very distant future time of judgement that was also prophesied about by various other prophets and the Day of the Lord is referred to as the most cataclysmic time the earth will ever know. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We do know that God’s judgement in the form of Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon did come several years after Josiah died, but total annihilation of the people of Judah didn’t occur at that time. We have seen some dreadful disasters in the past few years with hundreds of thousands of people dying, yet none of them have left the world in the kind of condition that the Bible describes about the Day of the Lord. If the Day of the Lord is described as being like no other day then we can know that it has yet to take place. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In the fire of His jealousy, for He will make a complete end, indeed a terrifying one, of &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;all the inhabitants of the earth&lt;/span&gt;.’ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;This has to be talking about a final day of judgment that will affect the whole world, not just Judah as the invasion by the Babylonians had done.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

When the capital of a nation is mentioned in relation to judgement it’s still talking about the whole nation, the reason the capital city is identified is because it’s the seat of government and the decisions made by that government determine the direction, attitude and behaviour of the whole nation. The main focus of &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;chapter 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; however is against Israel’s enemies. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Verse 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is a call to all the people of the earth to humble themselves before the Lord in the hope that they will be spared God’s wrath during this day of judgement but it progresses on to specifically name certain enemies that God is going to focus His wrath on for their treatment of His people. The result will be in the form of provision for the remnant of His people Israel. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Moab and Ammon today are in the specific region of the modern nation of Jordan. The Hashemite kingdom of Transjordan is an invented country whose borders were set after WWII by the British and the French and they appointed Emir Abdullah to be its king and then the British and French militarily prevented other Arab incursions from dethroning him. Transjordon was established in 1946, a mere 2 years before the re-establishment of the State of Israel in 1948. Edom is not mentioned in Zephaniah, but it is also situated in modern day Jordan. The descendents of Ammon and Moab come from the children that were born to Lot and his 2 daughters after their incestuous encounters.&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Genesis 19:30-38)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The descendents of Edom come from Esau who not only married Hittite women of Canaan he also married the daughter of his uncle Ishmael and there is a lot of familial bad blood amongst these people toward Israel. &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Genesis 26:34; 28:6-9)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Considering the unfolding of history in these specific regions today, these prophecies are very provocative, particularly when these prophecies state that these regions will ultimately be for the provision of the remnant of Israel to possess and right now the rest of the world is chanting to the drumbeat that the land Israel currently has is already too much. According to Scripture, the land they have now is much smaller than what they will eventually have. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We know who the Assyrians were and that they were situated in the region that is today Iraq. The ‘Ethiopia’ mentioned here is not the country that we know today as Ethiopia, the ancient Cushites were the Nubian people in the region today which is situated directly south of Egypt which is Sudan. To the ancient Greeks they were called Aethiopia and to the ancient Romans they were called Nubians.

This is historically proven to be the case because immediately after Josiah died Judah rapidly returned to paganism and idolatry. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Some say that Israel returning to the land God gave them is nothing more than coincidental and means absolutely nothing, that they are merely usurpers and have no rights to be there. But in saying this they undermine God’s Word, they contradict Him and deny God the praise and honour He deserves for the miracle He has done in bringing His promises and covenants to pass for the very people He made those covenants and promises to. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It will be a decidedly difficult and dreadful day but it will ultimately be a glorious day when wickedness will finally be dealt with and God’s righteous government will be established. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He was a sensitive, young and quite emotional man who loved God supremely, and he loved his nation and longed for them to turn from their wickedness in the hope of them avoiding invasion and exile by the Babylonians. His people refused to listen to his warnings and they hated him for them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The ‘individuals’ who were directly involved in the rebuilding efforts endured incredible opposition and struggles and make many sacrifices to ensure the work was done. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Well God is indeed keeping His promises but His promises are not unconditional...His covenants with Israel are unconditional, but not so all of His promises. God will use suffering, judgement, calamity, war, destruction, persecution, exile, sickness, death, poverty, loss, grief – all these things to turn the hearts of His people and over time direct and guide them until they’re in the place where He can ultimately deliver to them the fullness of His promises. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

God’s people were constantly blowing it and God had to hold off the promises for a later date until they had been chastised and became remorseful and repentant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

How could He let calamity hit them when He promised welfare and a future filled with hope when all they seemed to experience was struggle after struggle after struggle? Is God a liar? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Daniel died in Babylon, he wasn’t one of the captives who returned to Israel. Did God break His promise to His faithful servant Daniel? Hardly!

They will not teach again, each man his neighbour and each man his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ for they will all know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them,” declares the Lord, “for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more.” Thus says the Lord, who gives the sun for light by day and the fixed order of the moon and the stars for light by night, who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar; the Lord of hosts is His name: If this fixed order departs from before Me,” declares the Lord, “Then the offspring of Israel also will cease from being a nation before Me forever.” Thus says the Lord, “If the heavens above can be measured and the foundations of the earth searched out below, then I will also cast off all the offspring of Israel for all that they have done,” declares the Lord. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Israel is still a nation before God, even in the Diaspora as they were scattered throughout the nations of the world, they remained for the most part a separate people among their host nations and were singled out as different; God has re-established them in their land and because we know that the sun, moon and stars and their seasonal order will never wane, we know that Israel will never cease from being a nation before Him, and since most Israelis are still in unbelief we know this covenant isn’t conditional on their obedience, rather it’s all about God being faithful to His own covenant promise. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

While the overwhelming majority of Biblical prophets tell little or nothing about themselves, Jeremiah is the only prophet who shares the most about himself personally; he shares about his ministry, the reactions of those he speaks to, his testings and his personal feelings. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He was from a small village called Anathoth &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Jer 1:1)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; about 4km NE of Jerusalem in the tribal land allotment of Benjamin, he was a Levite because he was in the priesthood, but he lived in the region of Benjamin. He was assisted in his ministry by a Scribe named Baruch (Ba’rook) &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Jer 36:4, 32; 45:1)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and as an object lesson to Judah, he remained unmarried. The object lesson being that God was so repulsed with Judah’s sin, He didn’t want to be a husband to them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Only a handful of Jews survived and were taken captive to Babylon. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Jer 43, 44)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; It is possible he was still ministering in 570 BC as a rabbinic note claims that when Babylon invaded Egypt in 568/567 BC, Jeremiah was then taken captive to Babylon. If he lived to see the day when king Jehoiachin was taken captive to Babylon, he would have been between 85-90 years old. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

His most earnest appeal was to his own people to repent of their wickedness and return to the Lord to avoid judgement, however their stubborn refusal to repent took them to the point of no return with regard to God’s impending judgement, at which point Jeremiah’s message became an earnest plea for them not to resist the Babylonians because God was going to use them as a means of disciplining them. Unfortunately, his warnings fell on deaf ears. This same message of not resisting the Babylonians was also issued to other nations as well; God wanted to teach Judah and other nations a lesson for their sin and rebellion and by resisting the Babylonians they would only bring upon themselves more destruction. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Jer 27; 25:12-38; chaps 46-51)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It goes against all normal instincts for a nations leadership not to defend their people and their borders?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Primarily the people of Judah had gone beyond the point of repentance and God could no longer withhold righteous judgement for their innumerable crimes. Failure on God’s part to deliver a just and righteous sentence on His people for their wickedness would not encourage the people to turn from their sin and repent and God’s would have been considered impotent, unjust and compromising. God’s holiness and the honour of His Word would have been questioned. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Rom 1:28-32; 2:1-2)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This was the situation after the first siege of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The foolish Jewish leadership again defied Nebuchadnezzar which brought on the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; and final siege of Jerusalem which resulted in massive loss of life, the destruction of the city and the Temple, all the holy objects being taken to Babylon and a remnant of people taken hostage to Babylon. A mere handful of Jews were left in the land which was utterly devastated. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Their disobedience brought about a catastrophe instead. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Jer 27)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

If they had repented it would have held off the Babylonian invasion, but because they refused to listen, invasion and exile became unstoppable; their rebellion had gone as far as God would tolerate it – and He had patiently tolerated it for hundreds of years – and they were a hair’s breath away from being overthrown. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Jeremiah was a man with a very gentle nature, he was a peace-lover who longed for the quiet life but his calling compelled him to speak out against his people and their unrelenting sin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Jeremiah does talk about a future restoration for his nation, but because judgement was literally knocking at the door, he spent more time focusing on and gaining the attention of his people in the hope that he could bring them back from the brink of disaster. This is most noticeably seen in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;chapters 1 to 29&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

9087,Home Group - Habakkuk,"&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin-right: 8px; float: left;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/1058605_60297588%20small.jpg&quot; height=&quot;247&quot; width=&quot;346&quot; /&gt;Habakkuk (Kha’vak,kuk)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The name Habakkuk is curious in that it means ‘Embrace’ or ‘One who embraces’ and for this particular prophet it appears to be a very appropriate name because as he reveals his confusion over the message God gives him about what will happen to his people, he clings to God in faith and will not let go. In effect, he rests in the loving ‘embrace’ of God, trusting in God’s wisdom to deal with His rebellious people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Habakkuk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is listed among the Minor Prophets and his book like that of Nahum, is also only &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;3 chapters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; long, but unlike Nahum’s message which is directed against the Gentile Assyrians, who were the enemies of Israel, the Northern Kingdom, Habakkuk’s message was directed toward the Jews, the citizens of Judah, the Southern Kingdom. Habakkuk lived during the lifetimes of the prophets Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel and Zephaniah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Jewish legend holds that Habakkuk was the son of the Shunammite Woman who baked bread for Elisha and as a reward for her ongoing kindness to him he prophesied she would have a son. He said to her in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;2 Kings 4:16, “At this season next year you will &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;embrace&lt;/span&gt; a son.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The word embrace is ‘kha’vak’, the same root word for the name Habakkuk. It’s only a legend, it’s not confirmed in the Bible but it’s an interesting possibility to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Taking a quick look back at Judah’s history, when King Josiah came to the throne, he found the book of the Law of God and was so convicted over his and his nation’s sin and disobedience to God’s instructions, he brought about national repentance, the overthrow of paganism and corruption, and returned to true worship of Yahweh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;After Josiah died, his son took the throne and turned the nation back to paganism and rampant corruption. Habakkuk was distraught over the immediate willingness of his nation to so quickly reject God yet again in favour of idols and immorality and he was longing for God to bring judgement on His people to turn them back. His confusion came when God revealed to him that judgement was coming in the form of a Babylonian invasion and subsequent exile of Judah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The prophet wanted God to bring judgement on Judah Himself, but he wanted God to immediately restore Judah to righteousness and he couldn’t understand why God had instead determined to use the Babylonians as the means of His judgement. The Babylonians themselves were vastly more wicked that Judah; Habakkuk just couldn’t understand why God was going to use them to be His instrument of judgement. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Hab 1:6 – 17)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Habakkuk 1:13, “Your &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;(God’s)&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt; eyes are too pure to approve evil, and You cannot look on wickedness with favour. Why do You look with favour on those &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;(the Babylonians)&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt; who deal treacherously? Why are You silent when the wicked swallow up those more righteous than they?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In other words, why would God use really REALLY evil and wicked people, and ‘favour’ them with a military victory over Israel, who were wicked to be sure, but nowhere near as wicked as the Babylonians?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We need to gain an understanding of the various types of God’s wrath and how and why He uses it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Oppositional wrath&lt;/b&gt; is wrath against sin. It was demonstrated through animal sacrifices and most intensely through Yeshua’s undeserved execution on the cross. Yeshua bore the wrath of God for the sins of men. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Leviticus; Matt 27; Mark 15; Luke 23-24; John 19; Acts 2, 4; Rom 6:6; 1 Cor 1, 2, 13)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Catastrophic wrath&lt;/b&gt; is wrath in the natural world. It was demonstrated through Noah’s flood. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Gen 6:13-7:24)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eschatological wrath&lt;/b&gt; is specific wrath of pre-determined kinds. It is detailed in the book of Revelation which describes specific catastrophic events that will impact the natural world but are of supernatural origin and outworking in the last days before the return of Christ. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Rev 6-11; 16-17)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abandonment wrath&lt;/b&gt; is God’s withdrawal from His people. It is seen quite graphically in the account of Samson, who willingly allowed himself to be deceived by Delilah and she cut his hair. He got up expecting to successfully destroy his enemies like he had always done before, but he didn’t know the Lord had abandoned him. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Jud 16:20)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Habakkuk loved his nation very much but when he looked around at how badly his society had corroded he was heartbroken and when he called out to God through weeping and pleading for God to restore His nation to Himself and God’s answer that an idolatrous, pagan nation was going to invade, overthrow and exile them was unthinkable and shattering for him. It was the wrath of abandonment that God was demonstrating toward Judah (and Israel previously) because they had ignored His warnings for hundreds of years and there comes a time when God, the righteous and perfect Judge of all the earth, must take action and deal with evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;For God to ignore sinful behaviour and wickedness and not deal with ‘law breakers’ would make Him and unjust Judge in the same way we would deem human judges to be unjust and corrupt, when they turn a blind eye to societal law breakers and criminals by allowing them to walk free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;To be perfectly honest, it’s hard not to see the parallel of Habakkuk’s day with that of our own. Is there any evidence for such a statement?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Habakkuk’s society in ancient Judah:&lt;/span&gt; (Strong’s word definitions in brackets)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The prophet saw violence (wrong; cruelty; injustice) and iniquity (trouble; wickedness; sorrow; idolatry) and wickedness (trouble; mischief; toil; labour). Both destruction (havoc; violence; devastation; ruin; social sin) and violence were everywhere he looked and it resulted in strife and contention among everyone (controversy; quarrel; dispute; case at law).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This disgraceful attitude among the people resulted in the law being ignored (both civil and religious laws; to ‘grow numb’ against; be ‘feeble’ against); those who maintained a standard of righteousness themselves became targeted by the wicked (surrounded and encircled; trapped) which inevitably had to result in justice being perverted (a right judgement or ordinance that is proper and fitting was never delivered; bent out of shape, distorted and crooked).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Pride, drunkenness, financial greed and oppression, the killing of innocents, taking advantage of others for personal gain, false religions and the worship of nature and idols and corruption from the highest to the lowest in the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Our society in 2013:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Violence is not only glorified on our television and movie screens as entertainment, it’s seen every day in our streets and cities. The news is reporting every hour on the violence taking place not only in our nation but right across the nations of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Sin (iniquity) is rampant in our society and getting worse; what we used to consider as reprehensible 20-30 years ago is now common place. Our society now endorses and promotes all manner of sin and even encourages it deeming it healthy and normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Our justice system is so PC and strangled by the manipulation of those who ‘work’ system, not only by those who wield the gavel in the courtroom (judge), it’s by those manipulating the facts and arguments standing in front of the gavel in the courtroom (lawyers/barristers/defendants). How many times have we heard of a murderer or rapist being found guilty and given 15-20 years imprisonment for his crime, but he walks free in 3 or 4! It’s getting increasingly more difficult to have any faith in justice being served.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In fact, our system of justice was based on the Westminster system that declares the accused is innocent until proven guilty; today however the opposite is seen...the accused is deemed guilty until proven innocent. I have personally observed this twice in the last 12 months with people I know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Anyone speaking out for righteousness today or maintaining a righteous or moral position is rounded up and branded a hater or phobic and are condemned in law courts, the broader secular community and are lampooned in the media. Even worse, the internet can destroy lives this way when stories go global in a matter of hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Our government is even proposing to introduce legislation that will make offending someone a criminal and prosecutable offense. If we’re guilty until proven innocent, anyone can claim to be offended by anyone else and the accused doesn’t have any recourse!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Pride and arrogance by those who are committed to the overthrow of our justice system and the long-standing socially established boundaries is more than a little apparent; drunkenness and substance abuse are out of control; there have been 55 million babies murdered in the womb in the USA since Roe vs Wade and I read a statistic 2 weeks ago stating that 1 in 4 babies in Australia is murdered the same way. ONE QUARTER of all babies conceived, are murdered in the womb in our &lt;i&gt;‘lucky country’&lt;/i&gt;- apparently only some are lucky!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;False religions are innumerable (yes, atheism is a religion) and even formerly illegal occultic belief systems like Wicca and Druidism and witchcraft are now considered legitimate religions. The worship of nature leads people to put their lives on the line to save a tree or a whale, but then with the same fervour they’ll pound their fists into the air in support of women being allowed to kill their unborn babies. I personally believe in protecting our wildlife and preserving as much vegetation on the earth as we can, but I unquestionably believe that protecting the lives of innocent human babies should be the number one priority of any civilised nation or people group!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There isn’t much difference between ancient Judah and modern Australia and Habakkuk was grieved and offended by his own people and was really distressed at what God was going to have to do to bring Judah to repentance and eventual restoration. I believe most of us feel the same way about our beloved Australia as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;However, like Habakkuk, we need to understand that the righteous person who trusts and believes in God will live by faith. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Hab 2:4) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;This was something the Apostle Paul drove home to the believer’s of his day in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Romans 1:17, Galatians 3:11 and Hebrews 10:38&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In the end, Habakkuk knew that what God deemed necessary to cleanse His people was God’s business, he didn’t like what was coming but he knew that God would do what God knew was absolutely necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Habakkuk 3:17-19 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;the prophet says,&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt; “Though the fig tree should not blossom and there be no fruit on the vines, though the yield of the olive should fail and the fields produce no food, though the flock should be cut off from the fold and there be no cattle in the stalls, &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;yet I will exult in the Lord, I will rejoice in the God of my salvation&lt;/span&gt;. The Lord God is my strength and He has made my feet like hinds feet, and makes me walk on my high places.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God can sustain His own children ‘above the frey’ so to speak, regardless of the chaos that comes from judgement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Job said something similar after he experience unfathomable loss and grief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Job 13:15, “Though He slay me, I will hope in Him. Nevertheless I will argue my ways before Him.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Habakkuk did the same thing, he questioned God over His decision to use the Babylonians to bring judgement on Judah but trusted Him implicitly regardless of his own lack of understanding over the obvious devastation his people were going to endure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Habakkuk knew that having faith in God regardless of the decay he was witnessing around him or the punishment God was going to bring to bear against his nation, was the most important thing for him to do; he determined in his heart to rejoice in God, to worship and honour Him because God alone could provide and bless with deliverance and salvation for those who belong to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Will we as believers hold to the same faith and trust that Habakkuk did regardless of what we see in our own nation and the nations of the world? Will we commit to honouring and worshipping Him, holding to our faith in Him while He deals with the rest of the world according to His plans and purposes? The truth is that history shows us that when times are hard and difficult the church grows exponentially, but when times are easy and comfortable, people don't need God and the church becomes incredibly self-focused and self-righteous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It’s really important that we resolve to stand in faith and trust in God because this is probably one of the best ways to be the salt and light that Yeshua said we were to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Matthew 5:13-16,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Yeshua said, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;“You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt has become tasteless, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled under foot by men. You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden; nor does anyone light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on the lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house. Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It’s not easy to see a flickering candle in the midday sun when the day is at its brightest, but it’s visible to everyone in the darkness of night!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

9086,Home Group - Nahum,"&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000; text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin-right: 8px; float: left;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/575231_55762839%20small.jpg&quot; height=&quot;257&quot; width=&quot;343&quot; /&gt;Nahum (Nakh’oom)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The name Nahum is a shortened form of Nehemiah. It comes from the root word ‘naham’ and can mean sorrow or repentance when the subject content is God however when it’s used in a personal name the root word means comfort or consolation and as such, Nahum means ‘Full of Comfort’ or ‘the Comfort of Yahweh’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Nahum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; the prophet wrote 1 book, it’s only &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;3 chapters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; long and is listed among the Minor Prophets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;One of the things that is notable about most (though not all) the Hebrew prophets is that their importance comes from their prophecies and writings not from their personal lives, these men didn’t write about themselves and they were not self-promoting in any way, they maintained their focus on God and what He wanted to communicate. There is next to nothing known about Nahum as an individual except that he is called Nahum the Elkoshite in the very first verse of his book. It’s possible that some of the Jews who were exiled to the region today known as Iraq named a town after Elkosh in Israel in the same way many Australian towns have identical names to places in England from where many of our early settlers came.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There is some disagreement about what ‘Elkoshite’ actually means, some consider it to be his birth place while others consider it to be his ministry identifier. Some think Elkosh is the same as the town Al Qosh which is situated in northern Iraq while others believe it was a small village in the Galilee area. The so-called grave of Nahum in Iraq however is dated to be no older than the 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. It appears that the only connection of Elkosh to Al Qosh seems to be a result of the similarity of the names. There are 2 Bethlehem’s in Israel and several around the rest of the world as well, so an almost identical name isn’t evidence enough to claim this town as the birthplace of the prophet Nahum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We know that when the Northern Kingdom was taken into captivity, only the very poor were left behind. The population of the Galilee were not counted among the socially elite classes of Jerusalem and other regions so it’s very likely that Nahum and perhaps some of his family were left behind because they were less important and therefore considered to be less of a threat of starting an uprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;After looking at the arguments, it’s most likely that Nahum did actually come from the Galilee region, that he saw firsthand the exile of almost all his countrymen and it was from that experience and viewpoint that God called him to prophesy to the Gentile nations. The name Capernaum means ‘Village of Nahum’ and only someone of some importance has a town named after them. Perhaps the town of Capernaum was given its name long after the exile of Israel to Assyria and perhaps Nahum’s prophecy of judgement against Nineveh the capital of Assyria, was the reason he had a town named after him? Perhaps his fellow Jews wanted to honour of him for his prophecy against their enemies? It’s a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Here are a couple of interesting points to consider...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Nahum is 1 of 3 Old Testament prophets called specifically to prophesy to Gentiles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The region of Galilee is called ‘Galilee of the Gentiles’ in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Isaiah 9:1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yeshua made Capernaum, in the heart of the Galilee region His base for His ministry operations and ¾ of the Gospel accounts took place right there and those accounts show that Yeshua ministered to both Jews and Gentiles in that entire region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Since there are no co-incidences in the plans of God, it would appear to make perfect sense that the home town of the Jewish prophet to the Gentiles became the ministry base of the Messiah who would be THE LIGHT ‘to those in darkness’ in ‘Galilee of the Gentiles.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The entire book of Nahum is a direct prophetic declaration against the Assyrians, in particular the city of Nineveh. Jonah was sent by God to Nineveh to deliver the message of absolute annihilation in 40 days unless they repented of their sin and much to Jonah’s frustration and anger, they repented and God withheld judgement for another century by which time Nineveh had returned to its paganism and wickedness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Assyrians took their name from their god Asshur and culturally they were almost indistinguishable from the Babylonians except that from their inception to the demise, they were a race of particularly cruel and barbaric warriors. While God used them to bring judgement on Israel, their cruelty and brutality went beyond every rule of war and as such God used Nahum to prophesy of their own impending judgement and destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Those who for centuries proudly declared that the Bible was untrue and full of fairy tales would use lack of archaeological evidence of Nineveh as proof for their argument; up until 1842, the archaeological record showed absolutely no sign of a city called Nineveh. They said that a capital city as big as the Bible described Nineveh to be would have to have some archaeological evidence and there was none so therefore the Bible was supposedly wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;However, the book of Nahum has been vindicated exponentially because of the many archaeological discoveries over the last century. In 1842 French Consul General Paul Emile Botta discovered the royal palace of Sargon II, and in 1849 Sir Austen Henry Layard discovered the lost palace of Sennacherib which contained 71 rooms and the famous library of Ashurbanipal which contained 22,000 cuneiform tablets. Later in 1927 further discoveries were made of not only building structures but 300 fragments of prisms detailing the royal annals of Sennacherib, Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;After WWII, more excavations were undertaken and these discoveries show that Nineveh was destroyed exactly as the prophet Nahum said it would be. God’s Word was proven true once again and the Bible’s detractors were silenced on the matter of Nineveh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In many respects, the book of Nahum is the sequel to the book of Jonah in that Jonah was the warning to the Assyrians to repent of their wickedness or they would be destroyed. They heeded his warning and were spared, but they quickly forgot God’s mercy and they returned to their wickedness and the next time God spoke to them it was a declaration of judgement and destruction. To Assyria God said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Nahum 1:12-14, ‘Thus says the Lord, “Though they &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;(the Assyrians)&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt; are at full strength and likewise many, even so, they will be cut off and pass away. Though I have afflicted you &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;(Israel)&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;, I will afflict you no longer. So now, I will break his &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;(the Assyrians)&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt; yolk bar from upon you, and I will tear off your shackles.” The Lord has issued a command concerning you &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;(the Assyrians)&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;: “YOUR name will no longer be perpetuated. I will cut off idol and image from the house of your gods. I will prepare your grave for you are contemptible.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;But to His people He said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Nahum 2:1-2, “The one who scatters has come up against you. Man the fortress, watch the road; strengthen your back, summon all your strength. For the Lord will restore the splendour of Jacob like the splendour of Israel, even though devastators have devastated them and destroyed their vine branches.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Looking at Israel today we can see very clearly that God has kept His word to Jacob (Israel).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Isaiah is responsible for some of the most remarkable prophecies about the Messiah and what He would do when He came. He also gave a prophecy that confirms the Trinitarian nature of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Isaiah 9:6-7, ‘For a child will be born to us, a son &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;(God the Son)&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt; will be given to us; and the government will rest on His shoulders; and His name will be called &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Wonderful Counsellor &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;(God the Holy Spirit)&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;, Mighty God, Eternal Father &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;(God the Father)&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;, Prince of Peace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;. There will be &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;no end&lt;/span&gt; to the increase of His government or of peace, on the throne of David and over his kingdom &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;(David’s kingdom)&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;, to establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness from then on and &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;forevermore&lt;/span&gt;. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will accomplish this. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;How can a human born child be called &lt;i&gt;‘Wonderful Counsellor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace’&lt;/i&gt; and rise to a position of ruling a kingdom that will never end? This can only be true if God became a man by being born into the human race and that was exactly what Yeshua did when He was born to a virgin and then died for our sins and rose again on the third day to provide redemption thus proving that He truly is God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It was also Isaiah who prophesied about the virgin birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Isaiah 7:14, ‘Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, a virgin will be with child and bear a son and she will call His name Immanuel.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;One of the most notable and descriptive passages about the mission and ministry of Messiah comes from &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Isaiah 53&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Actually, it begins in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;chapter 52&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; where God promises to redeem His people Israel from the slavery and punishment they’ll experience at the hands of their enemies and in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;verse 6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; God says that &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;“My people shall know My name; therefore in that day I am the One who is speaking, ‘Here I Am’.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;The next verse is the famous Messianic verse, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;“How lovely on the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news, who announces peace and brings good news of happiness, who announces salvation, and says to Zion, ‘Your God reigns!’”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The chapter continues to describe God powerfully delivering and restoring His people and the description of Messiah begins in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;verse 13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Isaiah 52&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Verse 13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; – God’s ‘Servant’ would be ‘lifted up and greatly exalted’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Verse 14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; – He would be ‘marred more than any man’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Verse 05&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; – He’d be pierced, crushed and scourged for the sins of the people&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Verse 07&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; – Despite His oppression, He remained silent like a lamb to the slaughter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Verse 08&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; – He was killed as a judgement for the sins of the people&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Verse 09&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; – He was assigned to die with the wicked but when actually dead, He was with the rich&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Verse 10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; – God was pleased to crush Him because by offering Himself He would bring God man children&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Verse 11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; – The Servant’s sacrifice would justify many, and the Servant Himself would see it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Verse 12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; – The Servant’s reward would be ultimate Lordship because He willingly died on behalf of sinners&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 12pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The last 2 verses affirm the resurrection of the Servant because if He remained dead, He wouldn’t be able to see the justification of many or attain ultimate Lordship, He would have to be living to see the fruit and reward of His sacrificial death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Isaiah was murdered when Manasseh took the throne after his father Hezekiah died. Manasseh was incredibly wicked and Isaiah and a group of fellow prophets fled into the desert for safety after Manasseh accused him of treason and condemned him to death. When Isaiah was finally captured he was sawn in two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The book of Isaiah however is a stunning book of history and prophecy and when the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered, a complete scroll of the book of Isaiah was found. Much to the chagrin of the Bible’s detractors who claim the Bible has been distorted and altered throughout history, the Isaiah Scroll (as with all the Dead Sea Scrolls) are identical to the oldest manuscripts in our possession at that time and the Dead Sea Scrolls are over 1000 years older than them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We can have absolute confidence that &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;in its original form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; the Scriptures are absolutely accurate which is why it’s really important that we ourselves use translations that are as close to the original as possible. The reasons for this trustworthiness of the Bible’s accuracy is two-fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Firstly, the copying and reproduction of the Scriptures was entrusted to trained Hebrew scribes who followed meticulous rules. Some of which include;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul style=&quot;margin-top: 0cm;&quot;&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Each page of the scroll had to be no less than 48 lines but no more than 60 lines and no more than 30 letters across.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The parchments used had to meet specific kosher requirements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Scriptures could only be copied from an original or authentic copy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The ink had to be black and was made to a specific recipe that was only used for this purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;No word or letter, not even a ‘yod’ (the smallest letter of the Hebrew alphabet) could be written from memory, the Scribe had to look at each word before actually writing it and pronounce each word aloud as he wrote it down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There had to be a space the width of a hair or thread between consonants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The words were not allowed to touch each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There had to be a space of 3 lines between different books.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The pen had to be wiped clean but not newly dipped in ink before writing the name of Yahweh, to avoid a blob of ink distorting the name of God, and even if the king himself asked the scribe a question while he was writing the name of Yahweh, the scribe was to ignore the king.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Each scribe would bathe before beginning any writing and would undergo additional baths before every copying of the name of Yahweh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Each Hebrew letter has a numerical value and when each page of the scroll was complete, other scribes would count the letters and the lines to make sure it was identical to the original and then they would add up the numerical value of the letters to ensure it was precise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If 1 mistake was made, the page was condemned, if 3 mistakes were made the entire manuscript was condemned and the process begun all over again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The scribes considered the copying of the Scripture a sacred duty and they were fastidious in their efforts to maintain accuracy. This has been seen very clearly through the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The second and most important reason for trusting the accuracy of the Scriptures is that God is the One who protects His Word and will not allow it to falter or fade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The reason for stressing the point of the accuracy of Scripture is that many over the centuries claimed that &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Isaiah 53&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; wasn’t accurate and had been deliberately distorted to make it appear as though it was describing Yeshua, and as a result some Jewish communities actually removed it altogether, but the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls put that argument to rest because the complete scroll of Isaiah has the all the verses of &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;chapter 53&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; exactly as all other manuscripts from later dates have them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If God is the author of Scripture – and He is – we are obligated as His children and His ambassadors to obey it. We shouldn’t allow ourselves to be distracted from it or doubt it simply because some men question its validity. We can have great confidence in knowing that the Bible really is the inspired, God-breathed Word of Yahweh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Isaiah 40:8, ‘The grass withers, the flower fades, but the Word of our God stands forever.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Jeremiah 1:12, ‘Then the Lord said to me, “You have seen well, for &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;I am watching over My Word to perform it&lt;/span&gt;.”’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God actually watches over His own Word to make sure it unfolds precisely as He has revealed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Finally, God Himself holds His Word in incredibly high esteem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Psalm 138:2, ‘I will worship toward You holy temple, and praise Your name for Your lovingkindness and Your truth; for &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;You have magnified Your Word above all Your name&lt;/span&gt;.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This is stunning...we know that there is no other name by which men can be saved &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Acts 4:12)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and yet God has magnified his Word even above His name. If His word is magnified and honoured that much by God Himself, surely we should honour and love and treasure and believe and obey it as well.&lt;/p&gt;

8943,Home Group - Isaiah Pt 1,"&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin-right: 8px; float: left;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/954634_94521374%20small.jpg&quot; height=&quot;187&quot; width=&quot;280&quot; /&gt;Isaiah Pt 1 (Yesh’eh’ ya) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The name Isaiah has the same basic structure as Hosea whom we looked at last week, as well as other names such as Joshua and Yeshua. Isaiah is made up of 2 elements, the first is an abbreviated form of Yahweh and the second is a verb that means to be saved or delivered. So Isaiah means ‘Yahweh is salvation.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It’s interesting that the name Isaiah consists of the same 2 elements as the name Joshua, and Joshua rendered in Greek is Jesus. So Joshua means ‘Yahweh is salvation’ and the entire book of Joshua is the account of Joshua leading his people by the power of God to save his people from the desolate wanderings in the wilderness to take possession of Canaan. The book of Isaiah which means ‘Yahweh is salvation’ heavily Messianic, and Messiah was to come to save His people from their sins and redeem and deliver them from slavery to liberty. Yeshua means ‘Yahweh will save’, slightly different from Isaiah and Joshua in that these 2 names refer to Yahweh as other than themselves, but Yeshua IS the One who will do the saving. Joshua is a type of Christ and Isaiah describes Christ to perfection and their names point directly to Christ Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The prophet Isaiah is listed among the Major Prophets of the Bible, and in fact, the book of Isaiah is considered the ‘Holy Grail’ of Biblical prophecy to quote Chuck Missler. You can read about Isaiah not only in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;66 chapters of the book of Isaiah&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, but also in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;2 Kings 19 &amp;amp; 20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and he is mentioned in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;2 Chronicles 32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The book of Isaiah is directly quoted in the New Testament over 65 times, far more than any other Old Testament prophet, and Isaiah is named more than 20 times in the New Testament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Isaiah is considered the greatest of the Hebrew prophets next to Moses. He lived in and around Jerusalem in Judah, the Southern Kingdom and lived for approximately 53 years during the reigns of kings Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, possibly between the years 739 – 686 BC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Isaiah was married to a prophetess (although her actual name isn’t given), either because she herself held the office of a prophet or because of the sons she bore and the names they were given. Two sons were born to Isaiah and they were both considered ‘signs’ of divine appointment; the first son was named ‘She’ar Yashuawb’ which means ‘a remnant shall return’, obviously prophetic of the return of God’s people after their exile &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Isaiah 7:3)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;; and the second son was named Maher Shalal Chash Baz which means ‘swift is booty, speedy is prey’ which was to indicate that Damascus and Samaria were soon to be plundered by the king of Assyria. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Isaiah 8:3)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Isaiah lived during one of the most turbulent periods of Jerusalem’s history from both a political and religious viewpoint and being a prophet allowed him to participate in some events and even to influence them. He had connections to members of the royal house and in fact he apparently had free access to the palace and may even have been a member of Jerusalem aristocracy. His ‘social standing’ however didn’t stop him from being outspoken on behalf of the powerless members of society who were suffering under the corruption of the nation’s leaders and ruling elite. Not fearing any consequences, he spoke out boldly for the Lord...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Isaiah 1:14-17, ‘”I hate your new moon festivals and your appointed feasts, they have become a burden to Me; I am weary of bearing them. So when you spread out your hands in prayer, I will hide My eyes from you; Yes, even though you multiply prayers, I will not listen. Your hands are covered with blood. Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean; remove the evil of your deeds from My sight. Cease to do evil. Learn to do good; seek justice, reprove the ruthless, defend the orphan, plead for the widow.”’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Isaiah was possibly the most ‘political’ of the Hebrew prophets and when Assyria was aggressively expanding he counselled his leaders to take a passive political and military approach, encouraging them to put their faith in God for protection. If they had heeded Isaiah, this would have precipitated necessary change in both their moral and spiritual condition before God which is precisely what God was calling His people to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Isaiah warned his leaders that human or earthly efforts to alter the course of events was doomed to failure because the might of Assyria was really God’s ‘rod’ of discipline and punishment against them for their sin. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(Isaiah 8:6-7)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In fact, for a time, Isaiah was quite hopeful that his words of warning hadn’t fallen on deaf ears because King Hezekiah, while resisting the Assyrians, fell on his face before God repenting and he lead his people in repentance as well. Isaiah encouraged him with a word from God in that instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Isaiah 37:33-35, ‘Therefore, thus says the Lord concerning the king of Assyria, “He will not come to this city or shoot an arrow there; and he will not come before it with a shield or throw up a siege ramp against it. By the way that he came, by the same way he will return, and he will not come to this city,” declares the Lord. “For I will defend this city to save it for My own sake and for My servant David’s sake.”’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Hezekiah didn’t reject God, he was just like the rest of the human race in that he was a slow learner and a fast forgetter. God had proven Himself utterly trustworthy but Hezekiah quickly forgot God’s faithfulness and set about making political alliances to ensure no enemies would try to attack them in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Jerusalem was protected and Hezekiah’s fame grew and when Hezekiah got a little cocky after the Assyrian victory, Isaiah rebuked him very sternly for putting his faith in political alliances with Egypt and for showing the Babylonian envoys the wealth and might of Judah. This behaviour brought the promise of invasion and captivity for Judah by the Babylonians. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;(2 Kings 20:14-18)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The book of Isaiah is very heavy laden with Messianic prophecy and we’ll take a look at some of them next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

8857,Home Group - Hosea,"&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin-right: 8px; float: left;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/575231_55762839 small.jpg&quot; height=&quot;197&quot; width=&quot;262&quot; /&gt;Hosea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The name Hosea has the same foundation as the names Joshua, Isaiah, Yeshua among others and it means ‘Salvation’. It’s related to the word Hosanna which basically means ‘Please, we pray earnestly that you save us’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;book of Hosea&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is 14 chapters long and Hosea is listed as the first of the minor prophets. Everything we know about this prophet is found in this book and in reality, there is very, very little information about him as a person. All we really know is that his father’s name was Beeri.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Hosea probably lived in the Northern Kingdom of Israel because he had a familiarity with its history, circumstances and the geography of that region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The length of Hosea’s ministry was considerable, he prophesied for 45years between the years 755-710BC which spanned the reigns of the last 6 kings of Israel and his fellow prophets in Judah in the south were Isaiah and Micah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;To learn more about the history that was unfolding during Hosea’s lifetime, you need to read &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;2 Kings 14-20&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;and&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;2 Chronicles 26-32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There are so many lessons we can learn from the book of Hosea; the political and social situation during Hosea’s lifetime was very similar to our western societies in that their political and financial situations are pretty much identical. Ancient Israel had experienced a period of relative stability and prosperity in both the Northern and Southern Kingdoms; the wealthy and powerful in both private and civic leadership were unfettered in their corrupt practices and in their oppression of their own people. Pagan religions were celebrated and promoted and there was zero tolerance of those who loved Yahweh and who remained faithful to Him. The majority of the populace had no time for God, greed was rampant, corruption was the norm and the people seemed completely oblivious to the destruction that was fast approaching them. Their faith and trust was in their own skills, abilities and political machinations and alliances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;After the strong reign of king Jeroboam II in the north, the fall and ultimate destruction of Israel came rapidly with one king after another being replaced, often by assassination, eventuated in the Northern Kingdom being obliterated by the Assyrians. A large number of the population lost their lives, the rest were sent permanently into exile and the very few that managed to remain intermarried with non-Jews who became known as the Samaritans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The theme of the book of Hosea in a nutshell is God’s love for and loyalty to His covenant people Israel in spite of her faithlessness and idolatry. In order for God to demonstrate just how much He was committed to His covenant people He had His servant Hosea actually live out an incredible challenging scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Hosea was to marry a woman who would be unfaithful to him. Some believe she was a chaste woman who was unfaithful later in the marriage while others believe he was to deliberately marry a prostitute, these conflicting opinions both have good arguments behind them, but regardless of which viewpoint is correct the fact remains that God wanted to use the human relationship of marriage to be a physical representation of His relationship with Israel and since Israel had been continuously rebellious and unfaithful to Him, His spokesman – Hosea the prophet had to also have a wife who was adulterous and faithless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God equates adultery and prostitution to idolatry; it’s an incredibly intimate act of completely surrendering and giving oneself to another person. Idolatry doesn’t just mean bowing before a carved image of some pagan deity, idolatry is worship and adoration of anything or anyone above God Himself. For some atheism is their god though they would deny that vehemently; idolising your spouse or children, your money, your possessions, your body by attaining and maintaining physical beauty, a Hollywood celebrity or musician, even food can lead to idolatry...the list is endless and very, very sobering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Hosea’s wife’s name was Gomer and each time she was unfaithful to Hosea, God commanded Hosea to go after his wife and bring her back home and each of the children born to them were given specific names that had rather unpleasant meanings. Names like Jezreel – ‘God will scatter’, Lo-ruhamah – ‘Not pitied’, Lo-ammi – ‘Not My people’. These names were important because they expressed very clearly not only that God was justifiably angry but that the consequences for the sins of His people, His bride, should and would be severe. The sin and rebellion they were indulging in was very serious in God’s eyes and God had to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The book of Hosea can really be broken into 3 parts: &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;chapters 1-3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; deal with Hosea’s marriage; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;chapters 4-13&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; contain a series of prophecies that promise doom and destruction for Israel’s sin and rebellion and finally, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;chapter 14&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; delivers the promise of restoration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Why would God expect such a sacrifice from one of His faithful servants? Isn’t it unfair of God to expect one of His own children who was faithful to Him, to go through such a painful and publically humiliating experience?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Perhaps the question could be asked differently. How could God get His people to really understand how He felt about their sin and how badly their rejection and idolatry hurt Him? Merely saying that He is angry and grieved over their sin didn’t impact them; however, we can all empathise with how we would feel if our husband or wife turned their heart away from us and committed adultery openly with another person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Infidelity is so painful and so destructive that it has led men and women to kill their unfaithful spouses and/or their lovers because the pain and anger is so intense. The betrayal is that bad and that painful. God has not only told us in His Word that being unfaithful and rebellious toward Him is wrong and that it will bring judgement; He has also provided us with a very powerful image that we can all relate to, to help us understand the intense pain God endures when we’re unfaithful to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The picture God has presented to us through Hosea is graphic and its purpose is to enable us to understand the kind of heartache and anger God feels when His own children turn away from Him and chase after other gods irrespective of what form they may take, and give themselves over to greed and corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It’s very important however to read right through to the end of this book otherwise you could be left with the wrong impression that God has justifiably rejected His people outright, that He was going to send judgement and doom on them and that He was no longer going to have any kind of relationship with them...ever! To miss the end of the book is to miss the greatest part of God’s character...which is, He will NEVER break His own covenants and promises to His people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Will God discipline and judge His people?....Yes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Will He forsake and reject them?....Never!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;To do so would be to break His own Word and promises and that would make Him a liar and God cannot lie!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Men and women divorce and go their own separate ways every day because of adultery and unfaithfulness and we agree that it’s natural and even understandable that divorce result from adultery. That is the normal human response and we can all empathise with that situation; but God is not a man and He doesn’t respond as man does, He is loftier, mightier, more gracious, more forgiving, more compassionate and loving and His ways are vastly higher than our own. What He has demonstrated to His covenant people Israel is that He will never utterly reject them no matter what they’ve done, He will ALWAYS be faithful to His own Word and promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;That’s very good news for us, because if God could justifiably turn His back on His promises to Israel for their sin He could equally and justifiably turn His back on His promises to us because we are also guilty of sinning and rebelling against Him in many different ways. The fact that God is fulfilling His promises to Israel should make us ecstatic because He’s proving that His nature and character are perfect and thoroughly trustworthy. As individual believers we can be certain that He will never leave us or forsake us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;From a national perspective however, our societies are in the same condition as Israel and Judah were in during the lifetime of Hosea; we have rejected God, we serve and please ourselves, we worship anything and everything but God, we indulge in corruption and greed and even congratulate ourselves by getting away with it. We are seeing incomparable levels of wealth and prosperity and the speed of change and decline within the social and political climate is staggering. The collapse of our societies in many ways appears imminent, and yet most people continue in their own ways ignoring the obvious warnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;As individuals we need to respond to the Word of God in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hosea chapter 14&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and understand that no politician, no form of government or international alliance can protect us and ensure our future security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;God says in His Word...“Return, O Israel, to the Lord your God, for you have stumbled because of your iniquity. Take words with you and return to the Lord&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;[acknowledge sin and repent of it]&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;(vs 1-2)..............O Ephraim, what more have I to do with idols? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;[They’re worthless and useless]&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;It is I who answer and look after you. I am like a luxuriant cypress; from Me comes your fruit.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;[God is an abundant provider for His children]&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;Whoever is wise, let him understand these things; whoever is discerning, let him know them. For the ways of the Lord are right, and the righteous will walk in them, but transgressors will stumble in them.” (vs 8-9)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The call for us is to be wise and discerning.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The society of Hosea’s day passed in judgement but the righteous, who remained faithful to their God were preserved...they endured trials and difficulties to be sure, but God preserved them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;To finish, put yourself in God’s place and understand that His heart breaks when we’re unfaithful to Him; when we give ourselves to other things and other people and willingly love them more than Him. God’s love is perfect and ours is flawed, and God isn’t unreasonable when He expects us to be faithful to Him, and because He knows just how weak and flawed we are, He gives us His Holy Spirit to indwell us so that we can remain faithful to Him and give Him the kind of honour and worship that He deserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jude 1:24, ‘Now to &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Him who is able to keep you from stumbling, and to make you stand&lt;/span&gt; in the presence of His glory blameless with great joy, to the only God our Saviour, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion and authority, before all time and now and forever. Amen.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God is the One who has promised to make us stand...our response should be to humbly submit to Him and His Word and obey Him and love Him supremely because He deserves nothing less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

8718,Home Group - The Role Of The Shepherds,"&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin-right: 8px; float: left;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/1058605_60297588 small.jpg&quot; height=&quot;196&quot; width=&quot;274&quot; /&gt;The Role Of The Shepherds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;A really quick history lesson from the book of &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ruth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: Generations before Joseph and Mary, a man named Boaz married a Moabitess named Ruth and their first son was named Obed; Obed became the father of Jesse and Jesse became the father of David. Boaz was a landowner and grew crops as a means of providing for himself and he was quite wealthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It was not customary or traditional for families to sell their property and move elsewhere, some did if they were poor and were desperate to find work and some were forced to leave or flee by invading foreign occupying forces, but the majority of people lived their whole lives in the same small communities and villages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Somewhere along the line, both Mary’s and Joseph’s families needed to leave Bethlehem and they made their way to Nazareth; this was quite possibly because they were poor. Bethlehem was only a small place but it was important because it was close to Jerusalem and had the distinct honour of being the home town of King David; property prices were probably very healthy and it was strategic because of the flocks that were housed and cared for there that were primarily owned by the Temple and priesthood. Nazareth on the other hand had a less than stellar reputation and attracted a lower socio-economic class of people and we can see the same situations in our own country today; towns, cities and suburbs attract different people and very different price tags for land and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Luke 2:8-19, ‘In the same region there were some shepherds staying out in the fields and keeping watch over their flock by night. And an angel of the Lord suddenly &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;stood before them and the glory of the Lord shone around them; and there were terribly frightened.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be for all the people; for &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;today&lt;/span&gt; in the city of David there has been born for you a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord. This will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;And suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying, “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among men with whom He is pleased.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;When the angels had gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds began saying to one another, “Let us go straight to Bethlehem then, and see this thing that has happened which the Lord has made known to us.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;So they came in a hurry and found their way to Mary and Joseph, and the baby as He lay in the manger. &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;When they had seen this, they made known the statement which had been told them about this Child. And all who heard it wondered at the things which were told them by the shepherds.&lt;/span&gt; But Mary treasured all these things, pondering them in her heart.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There are some really important points in this passage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;1&quot;&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was      night time and the shepherds were watching over the sheep out on the open      fields, this means that it wasn’t December. Its winter in Israel at the      moment and the temperatures at night are around 5-6 degrees. It’s more      likely that Yeshua was born around the end of September and Chuck Missler      has some excellent teaching explaining his conclusions from the      calculations of the rotations of the priesthood at the time Zechariah was      ministering in the temple, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Luke 1:5)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; [John the Baptist's father] which immediately saw the conception of John      and 6 months later was the conception of Yeshua and 9 months later Yeshua’s      birth. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Luke 1)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The weather in      September is around 20+ degrees at night making it more comfortable and safe      for the flocks and their shepherds. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One      angel appeared initially and seeing him made the shepherds very frightened      - angelic visitations are no joking matter and the message the shepherd's      were given was monumental. The Jewish people had been waiting with great      expectation for the arrival of their Messiah and suddenly a magnificent      spiritual being appeared right in front of this small group of Jewish shepherds and the glory of God was      shining all around them out in those fields...perhaps it was a little like daylight? He      gave them the news that their Saviour had been born that very night in      their little town...a fulfilment of prophecy &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Mic      5:1-4)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;...and the sign that this message was true, was that      this baby had been wrapped in cloths and was laying in a manger. This was truly a sign, because people didn’t lay newborn babies in mangers, they laid them in cribs or baskets or they slept in the same beds with their mothers initially. A manger is a stone feeding trough for animals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suddenly      the shepherds were surrounded by the heavenly host who were making a      rousing noise as they worshipped and praised God. It’s almost as though      heaven could no longer contain itself and the heavenly host suddenly burst      forth to shout praise over the fact that a miracle had just occurred...God      Himself had been born as a human baby!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How did      the shepherds know which feeding trough Yeshua had been laid in? They were      shepherds and they knew where the animals were kept in the cold weather.      Bethlehem was the place where the flocks owned by the Temple and      priesthood were cared for...we don’t know, but perhaps these shepherds      were part of the tribe of Levi who looked after the Temple flocks and knew      exactly which cave to go to, to find their Messiah. Above ground stables      were not the order of the day, the animals were cared for in caves both in      the winter time and when ewes were lambing. The cave was available for Messiah      to be born because the flocks were out in the fields. &lt;br /&gt;The      shepherds immediately made their way to the correct place because as shepherd's they were absolutely familiar with their surroundings and they found things      to be exactly as the angel had told them. They believed that their      Messiah was right before their very eyes and we know this because they      became immediate evangelists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Luke 2:16-18, ‘So they came in a hurry and found their way to Mary and Joseph, and the baby as He lay in the manger. &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;When they had seen this, they made known the statement which had been told them about this Child. And all who heard it wondered at the things which were told them by the shepherds.’ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We don't know for sure that the following scenario is absolutely correct but I offer it as a possibility to consider. Scripture doesn't lay out every detail for us, but understanding the culture and customs of the day, knowing about the population of Bethlehem at this time and what they primary 'industry' was at that time and holding closely to the Biblical text gives us a pretty decent picture of how things MIGHT have played out. Consider the following questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Is it      possible that the shepherds knew of the corruption of the chief priests in      the Temple?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Is it      possible that the shepherds knew that Herod was a bloodthirsty despot who      wouldn’t think twice about murdering an innocent baby if he thought that      baby may one day become a threat to him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Is it      possible that because of the testimony of the shepherds, the small      community of Bethlehem believed in and kept the identity of Yeshua&amp;nbsp; - their Jewish Messiah - a      secret in order to protect Him from harm by the priests, Herod and even the Romans?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Is it      possible that the &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Only Begotten      Son of God (Jn 3:16)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;...the &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lamb      of God who takes away the sins of the world (Jn 1:29, 36)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;;      was born in the same lambing cave where the first born male lambs of the      Temple flocks were born, eventually to be offered as sacrifices to atone for the sins      of the people each year at Passover?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Is it      possible that after Yeshua’s birth in the lambing cave among the shepherd’s      fields of Bethlehem, that Joseph and Mary were able to find a place to make      a home for Yeshua’s first couple of years among their own relatives who      had been living there from the days of Boaz and Ruth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Is it      possible that when the Magi came to Bethlehem, the people of Bethlehem      were not in the least bit surprised or worried like Herod and all Jerusalem      were, because they already believed that this child was their Messiah and      the Magi were just another confirmation of that fact? For the people of Bethlehem who knew their Messiah was with them, seeing Magi of Jewish lineage turn up in their town to worship their Messiah may have made perfect sense to them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Don’t let the familiarity of the nativity story dull the miraculous and wondrous reality of what took place 2000 years ago when God became a man and humbled Himself to the point that He allowed Himself to be born in a lambing cave and laid in an animal’s feeding trough. Yeshua left His throne in glory and became a humble peasant so He could relate to all the struggles and sufferings of humanity and yet remain uncorrupted by the sin that has destroyed all of mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The shepherds believed the Good News given to them by the angel on the night Yeshua was born;&lt;br /&gt;The people of Bethlehem believed the testimony of the shepherds and marvelled over it;&lt;br /&gt;The Magi believed the Scriptures and the prophets and travelled thousands of kilometres to worship their Messiah;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;....What will you do with Yeshua the Saviour of the world?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Wise men are still seeking Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

8667,Home Group - Who Were The Wise Men?,"&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin-right: 8px; float: left;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/954634_94521374 small.jpg&quot; height=&quot;197&quot; width=&quot;296&quot; /&gt;Who Were The Magi?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We’ve heard the Christmas story so many times that we rarely ask the ‘so what?’ questions about all the people involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Who were the Magi from the east and why on earth did they care about a royal Jewish baby born in a country they had absolutely nothing what-so-ever to do with?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There is a great deal of myth surrounding the Magi and the vast majority of it has no basis in Scripture and came about over the centuries of church history, some traditions even going so far as to allocate personal names for them! In our mind we hear the term ‘3 Wise Men’ and immediately imagine three men wearing fancy turbans riding on camels in the desert with an enormous star in the night sky that coincidently looks like a cross...or...we imagine 3 men wearing fancy turbans and robes, each presenting bejewelled canisters while bowing before a cute pink baby wearing nothing but a nappy waving his arms and legs around with a big smile on his face, laying in a timber cradle on clean, comfy looking straw sprouting from under the edges of a beautifully white bunny rug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This isn’t an accurate picture at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matthew 2:1-3, ‘Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, Magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem, saying, “Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we saw His star in the east and have come to worship Him.” When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him. Gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Messiah was to be born. They said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea; for this is what has been written by the prophet: ‘And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah, are by no means least among the leaders of Judah; for out of you shall come forth a ruler who will shepherd My people Israel.’”’ &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Who were the Magi and why was Herod &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;and all Jerusalem&lt;/span&gt; so bothered about their arrival?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The name ‘Magi’ has been translated from an ancient Greek transliteration of a Persian word that was originally taken to mean ‘magic’ and therefore they were considered to be ‘magicians’ of a religious or spiritual nature, similar to the magicians in Moses day who mimicked the first few miracles done by God in the plagues. However, this Persian group was not made up of ‘magicians’ but rather they held the dual position of being priest-like as well as holding government office which had an upper house of the council of the Magistanes, from which we get the word Magistrates. They were civil rulers with supposedly supernatural type wisdom and knowledge. One of their duties included &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘the absolute choice and election of the king of the realm.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It’s from this that they became known throughout the empire...and in successive empires...as &lt;em&gt;‘King Makers’.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In the Babylonian captivity of Judah, Daniel the prophet – one of the captives - became one of those chosen to serve king Nebuchadnezzar in his court and he became a member of the Magi, those considered wise and learned not only in supposed spiritual matters but also in national and civil matters with regard to economics, government, international affairs, laws and bylaws for the governance of the people and the king, national security etc. With regard to their ‘spiritual’ abilities, many were known to be phonies but due to their authority, they were revered nonetheless. So while their role was religious it was very much civil and political as well, and under Darius the Mede, the Magi were established as the state religion. They were particularly known to have the ability to interpret dreams. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Dan 1:1-6)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; We know this because of the account of Nebuchadnezzar’s dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When Nebuchadnezzar had his famous dream he called his wise men and tested them to see if they were the real deal. He demanded they not only interpret his dream, they had to tell him what his dream was first and had it not been for Daniel, they would have all been executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daniel 2:5-12, ‘The king replied to the Chaldeans, “The command from me is firm: if you do not make known to me the dream and its interpretation, you will be torn limb from limb and your houses will be made a rubbish heap. But if you declare the dream and its interpretation, you will receive from me gifts and a reward and great honour; therefore declare to me the dream and its interpretation.” They answered a second time and said, “Let the king tell the dream to his servants, and we will declare the interpretation.” The king replied, “I know for certain that you are bargaining for time, inasmuch as you have seen that the command from me is firm, that if you do not make the dream known to me, there is only one decree for you. For you have agreed together to speak lying and corrupt words before me until the situation is changed; therefore tell me the dream, that I may know that you can declare to me its interpretation.” &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;The Chaldeans answered the king and said, “There is not a man on earth who could declare the matter for the king, inasmuch as no great king or ruler has ever asked anything like this of any “magician, conjurer or Chaldean”. Moreover, the thing which the king demands is difficult, and there is no one else who could declare it to the king except gods, whose dwelling place is not with mortal flesh.” Because of this the king became indignant and very furious and gave orders to destroy all the wise me of Babylon.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Nebuchadnezzar wanted to find out if his wise men really were as wise as they wanting him to believe they were. Note that they actually differentiate between ‘magicians, conjurers and Chaldeans’, they were making a distinction between themselves and other common magicians and conjurers or illusionists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;At that time, Daniel was already a member of this elite group but not high enough in their hierarchy to be summoned before the king but being a member still had him scheduled for execution with the rest of them. When he heard about their imminent mass execution he asked why and then approached the king himself to ask for some time in order that he might declare the interpretation of the dream. He then went to his house and told his friends Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah (Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego) so that they could collectively seek the mind of God about this matter in prayer. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Dan 2:13-18)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We know the rest of this famous story, God revealed not only the dream of Nebuchadnezzar but also its interpretation. Daniel went before the king and told him that God alone knew the dreams men dreamed and what they mean and then he revealed everything he knew to the king. Understandably, Daniel gained immediate notoriety and promotion within the ranks of the Magi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It was Daniel who appointed Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego to high political office giving them administration over the province of Babylon &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Dan 2:49)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and Daniel himself personally served Nebuchadnezzar in the king’s court. It’s highly probable that Daniel appointed other Jews as well to positions of leadership within the government and particularly within the Magi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Over time, the other ‘wise men’ – overwhelmed by jealousy – deviously tried to have Daniel killed; he ended up in the lion’s den but the end of the story saw Daniel saved and the conspirators eaten by the hungry lions themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It’s believed that this resulted in Daniel becoming the ‘Prime Minister’, the ‘Rab-Mag’ – the leader of the Magi and it stands to reason that there were other Jews of the Babylonian Diaspora within the Magi with Daniel, after all, many Jews decided to remain in Babylon after the 70 years captivity was over and didn’t return to Judea with Nehemiah and Ezra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;While Daniel’s primary focus was on civil matters he also fulfilled his role within the Magi and he was always faithful to God so we don’t have to worry about Daniel and his friends bowing before false idols. They all showed themselves to be utterly faithful to God. Not once did they compromise and it’s because of this unwavering, uncompromising heart within these Jewish men that lead the other Babylonian priests to be so jealous in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Daniel, a prophet of God, would have taught his fellow Jews within the Magi about the promised Messiah, and there is little doubt that Daniel understood the Hebrew Mazzaroth and that he taught his kinsmen its prophetic meanings and implications which explains why any of the Magi were even watching the heavens for a sign of a Jewish Messiah in the first place. If the Magi were NOT Jewish, why would Persian civil and religious leaders care at all about the birth of a royal Jewish baby thousands of miles away from them that they had no connection and nothing whatsoever to do with?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There are some today who claim the Magi were ancient Zoroastrians, there is no proof of this, but Zoroastrianism may have developed in later centuries from the Magi...but this is uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Hebrew Mazzaroth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;After Job makes his long case about being righteous and that all his troubles are unfair, God responded to Job and asked him a series of questions about the enormity of all creation and what role Job played in its coming about and its daily order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Job 38:32-33, God asks, “Can you lead forth a constellation in its season and guide the bear with her satellites? &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Do you know the ordinances of the heavens, or fix their rule over the earth&lt;/span&gt;?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The inference of course is that Job had no clue about any of it...God and God alone is the Creator and Sustainer of the universe!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Hebrew word for ‘constellation’ is Mazzaroth which means, &lt;em&gt;‘the 12 signs of the Zodiac and their 36 associated constellations.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If you look at the Mazzaroth, you see the Gospel in the stars, beginning with Virgo (the virgin birth) going right through to Leo (the Lion of the Tribe of Judah). Chuck Missler has excellent teaching material on this in his Christmas DVD/MP3, as well as an audio teaching called &lt;em&gt;‘Signs In The Heavens’.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Mazzaroth or Zodiac, has been dreadfully corrupted by men and this goes back to Nimrod and the Tower of Babel, but regardless of these corruptions, God has nonetheless revealed His plan of redemption in the heavens, but they’re for His purposes not for us to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Psalm 19:1, ‘The heavens are telling of the glory of God; and their expanse is declaring the work of His hands.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This verse has far greater depth of meaning than simply extolling the magnificence of the heavens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;So with this knowledge and insight, it’s believed that Daniel taught his fellow Jews within the Magi to watch the heavens to see how the Mazzaroth moved and intercepted with one another and during these observances many centuries after Daniel the prophet had died, the Magi (members of Jewish descent from the Babylonian exile) saw the supernatural occurrence of &lt;strong&gt;THE STAR&lt;/strong&gt;. This was probably not a star like the bodies we see in the night sky, but rather a supernatural phenomenon, that appeared at specific times to these Jewish Magi to lead and direct them to the place where their Jewish King was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Upon recognition of this momentous event, the Magi journeyed to Judea with the authority and permission of their own Sovereign at the time. There’s no other explanation that would cause ‘Medo-Persian’ priests and civil government leaders to watch the heavens for a sign of a Jewish Messiah? Judea wasn’t a province over which they governed or had any interest in. At that time, it was under the rule and occupation of the Roman Empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Jewish members of the Magi held great authority and influence within their government and because they were the ones who had absolute authority over who would rule their nation, even their Sovereign Kings held them in great awe. They were highly respected and held to be official national dignitaries in much the same way that we treat ambassadors or national leaders of other nations when they visit our country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;These Jewish Magi watched the heavens – they were not astrologers or prognosticators, they were students of their ancient Scriptures and understood the promise of their Messiah – and when they saw the phenomenon, maybe the Shekinah Glory of God, they embarked on the long journey overland from Persia to Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We need to lose the imagery of three wealthy-looking, camel-riding, turban-headed guys with bulging saddle bags out for a midnight stroll in the desert. Three rich men on camels would have been easy targets for robbers on such a long journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This was in fact an official governmental delegation of high ranking officials, who would have travelled in a large company not only for protection, but because they were representatives of their nation and sovereign king. Their journey from Persia to Jerusalem was approximately 1,300-1,500km and they would have been accompanied by military escort, court officials, basic staff to take care of all their needs while travelling in such a large company; needs such as accommodation (tents) along the way, food for their group as well as their animals...horses and camels etc. This was a large company of people much like an ambassador’s diplomatic entourage making a friendly gesture to a neighbouring country upon the birth of a royal heir, or the death of their king or something similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Roman Empire ruled the majority of the then-known world, but they had never subdued the Persians who were a formidable foe and Rome didn’t like them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Herod the Great was given the title and position of ‘King of the Jews’ by the Romans, but he was neither a king nor a Jew, he was in fact Idumean – an Edomite – descendants of Esau. The Jews in fact hated Herod, so much so that it was too dangerous for Herod to rule from Jerusalem in his first three years for fear of assassination. His rule was more than a little precarious. He was also known as Herod the Butcher, he had his wife and two sons executed because he was suspicious they wanted him dead to take over his throne and he was also mentally deranged, he was literally paranoid and delusional. It was said that it was safer to be Herod’s dog than a family member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When the Magi turned up in Jerusalem Herod became seriously panicked and most people miss this part of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matthew 2:1-3, ‘Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, Magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem, saying, “Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we saw His star in the east and have come to worship Him.” &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;He called for the Jewish religious leaders to ask about the prophecies regarding Messiah and they told him that Bethlehem was the town named in prophecy to be the birthplace of Messiah. We know how this part of the story unfolded; God warned the Magi – who were probably God-fearing Jews – in a dream and warned them to go home by an alternate route to avoid Herod. Herod became so enraged by their secret departure that he ordered the murder of every little boy two years old and younger in Bethlehem in a bid to make sure the new Messiah would be killed. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Matt 2:16-18)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;So why was Herod and all Jerusalem troubled about the arrival of the Magi?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It’s almost understandable why Herod was troubled about the Magi coming to town, he himself was an imposter and the rightful King of Israel had finally arrived...exactly as the prophets had said He would...and what’s more, &lt;em&gt;King Makers&lt;/em&gt; from the east who were probably of Jewish descent had turned up on his doorstep to acknowledge the fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;He knew the populace hated him passionately and if they had the choice between him and their Messiah there would be no contest at all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Herod the Great was very troubled because his right to the throne was now in serious jeopardy. If the legitimate King of the Jews that had been prophesied for centuries had finally arrived, he was out of a job, and he wasn’t happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Romans hated insurrection and they strove for peace throughout the empire. The Jews were notorious for not submitting to Caesar and Rome’s multi-cultural, pluralistic embrace of all cultures and religions and if the Jews believed that their true King had finally arrived, it would cause a Jewish rebellion that might try to expel Rome from Judea. They didn’t want that kind of trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Both Rome and Herod were noted for their brutality; if they got mad, the people would suffer terribly from their brutal crackdowns and this would have brought concern upon the populace as well, they lived in fear of both Herod and Rome’s brutal oppression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matthew 2:9-11, ‘After hearing the king, they went their way; and the star, which they had seen in the east, went on before them until it came and stood over the place where the Child was. When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy. After coming into the &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;house&lt;/span&gt; they saw the &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Child&lt;/span&gt; with Mary His mother; and they fell to the ground and worshipped Him. Then, opening their treasures, they presented Him with gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This passage also hints that the Magi were Jewish because the Persian governmental elite would have no cause to fall to the ground and worship a toddler who had no connection to them whatsoever. They were &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘King Makers’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; with incredible power and authority; they would never bow their knee to a child who was not even of their own race or nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It also suggests that the ‘star’ was some kind of spiritual phenomenon because it appeared only when necessary and no one else ever testified to seeing it. The Magi were given the task of validating the prophetic Scriptures that were accurately taught to them by Daniel the prophet and they willingly and deliberately travelled between 1,300 and 1,500 km to see Him and worship Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The fact that they did this once again validates the legitimacy of the Word of God and proves that God always keeps His promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;You’ll notice too that when the Magi arrive in Bethlehem to worship Yeshua, the shepherds weren’t there. We’ll look at the shepherds next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Magi who visited Yeshua in Bethlehem were incredibly important men of high civil and religious rank were very probably of Jewish descent, they served in ancient Babylon/Persia and they believed the Scriptures and the prophets as taught by Daniel the prophet and they travelled a several thousand kilometre round trip to seek and worship their Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This is a true historical event from 2000 years ago but in 2012 it is true to say that wise men still seek Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There are many prophetic proofs that Yeshua is the promised Messiah spoken of throughout the Old Testament, these include fulfilment of things such as being born of a virgin &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Isaiah 7:13)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;; that He would be betrayed for 30 pieces of silver and that money would be thrown to a potter ‘in the house of the Lord’ &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Zech 11:13)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;; that He would be killed with criminals but buried with the rich &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Isa 53:9)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;; and His clothing would be gambled over &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Psa 22:18)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There are hundreds of specific prophecies that Yeshua fulfilled throughout His life to prove unquestionably that He was in fact the promised and long-awaited Jewish Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;But there are 4 specific prophecies that are particularly unique, and at first glance one would think they couldn’t apply to one single person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If I were to ask you where you’re from, you would probably tell me that you’re from the town you currently live in or the town or country you were born. This would be pretty normal for most of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;However in prophecy, Messiah is linked to 4 different geographical locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Bethlehem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When the Magi from the East arrived in Jerusalem to find out where the new born ‘King of the Jews’ was supposed to be born, Herod asked the priests what the Old Testament said about Messiah’s birth, and they told Herod that Messiah was to be born in Bethlehem. Not just ‘Bethlehem’ but ‘Bethlehem Ephrathah’; there were two towns in Israel called Bethlehem, one about 9km north of Nazareth in the northern Galilee region, and the other about 9km south of Jerusalem in Judah. The southern town was known as Bethlehem Ephrathah and it’s the town that Ruth and Boaz raised their son Obed, who then raised his son Jesse, who then raised his son David, from whom came the line of Messiah. It’s also the burial place of Jacob’s wife Rachel. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Gen 35:19)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Micah 5:2, ‘But as for you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, too little to be among the clans of Judah, from you One will go forth for Me to be ruler in Israel. His goings forth are from long ago, from the days of eternity.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This verse specifically singles out the southern Bethlehem town as the birthplace of Messiah and interestingly enough, this verse is also a claim of deity because it says that Messiah would be from ‘the days of eternity’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Nazareth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Messiah was to be called a Nazarene as stated in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Matt 2:23)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;even though there is no specific verse in the Old Testament that specifically says this in so many words. Some say this is because He lived His childhood years in the town of Nazareth and others believe it’s because He was going to be despised and rejected as though worthless which is how others thought of the residents of Nazareth &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Psa 22:6-8; Isa 49:7 &amp;amp; 53:7-12)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and still others believe that the word ‘Nazarene’ is actually the root Hebrew word that is referred to in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Isa 11:1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, where Messiah is referred to as the ‘Branch’. There are still others who believe that some prophetic writings have been lost or destroyed throughout the centuries and this is the explanation for there being no specifically worded prophecy in the Old Testament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There are four levels of understanding prophetic quotes from the Old Testament in the New Testament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;1 - Literal Prophecy With Literal Fulfilment&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Micah 5:2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; says that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem Ephrathah and &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matthew 2:5-6&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;details the Pharisees quoting &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Micah 5:2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to Herod to confirm that Bethlehem is to be the birth place of the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;2 - Literal With A Typological Fulfilment&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matthew 15:7-9&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; quotes &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Isaiah 29:13&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. In the Isaiah context the people were rejecting the word of the prophet Isaiah and that is the literal fulfilment. Israel’s rejection of the prophetic word of the prophet becomes a type of Israel’s rejection of the prophetic word of the Messiah Yeshua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;3 - Literal With Application&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matthew 2:17-18&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; quotes &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jeremiah 31:15&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; which is about Rachel weeping for her children because they gone. The historical context at that time was referring to the Babylonian exile and all the young men were being marched off as captives; they would never be seen again by their mothers. Since Rachel was one of Israel’s matriarchs, she becomes the representative of all the weeping mothers grieving for their children. The New Testament account is referring to Herod’s order to murder all the male children 2 years and under in Bethlehem, but this account has only one similarity with the Old Testament historical account – Jewish mothers weeping for their sons. All other details in these accounts are different. Because of the one point of similarity between these two historical events, the Old Testament quote brings prophetic application to the New Testament event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;4 - Summation&lt;/span&gt;: This is when a prophetic fulfilment comes to pass not from one specific prophetic statement but from multiple prophetic statements made by a number of prophets or in various prophecies by the same prophet. For example, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matthew 2:23&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; says that the Messiah would be called a Nazarene, but there is no passage in the Old Testament that actually makes that statement. The speaker (Matthew in this case) is making a prophetic summation of what previous prophecies collectively had said about the Messiah. He would minister to the people living in the Galilee region, in the tribal allotments of Zebulun and Naphtali, He would be despised and rejected. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Isaiah 9:1; Isa 53:5; Psa 22:6; 69:7-8; 118:22-23; Isa 61:1-2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; describe in advance the Messiah in His environment and how He would be received. Nazareth is in the Galilee region and it’s situated in the land allotment of the tribe of Zebulun. It’s also interesting to note that the people of Nazareth were not held in high esteem at all, in fact they were considered to be on the lowest rung of the social ladder and this is apparently when Philip told Nathanael that they’d found the Messiah – Jesus of Nazareth – and Nathanael responded by saying, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can anything good come out of Nazareth?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The implication here is that the people of Nazareth were considered worthless and therefore to be rejected – despised and rejected. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(John&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1:45-46)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;With point 4 in mind then, Matthew’s claim that the prophets foretold that Messiah would be called ‘a Nazarene’ is easily fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matt 2:22-23, ‘But when he (Joseph) heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Then after being warned by God in a dream, he left for the regions of Galilee, and came and lived in a city called Nazareth. This was to fulfil what was spoken through the prophets: “He shall be called a Nazarene”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yeshua wasn’t a &lt;em&gt;‘Nazirite’&lt;/em&gt;, someone who made a vow to God and didn’t cut their hair or drink wine, this is a totally different thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Egypt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We know the story of Joseph being warned in a dream to take his wife Mary and baby son Yeshua to Egypt because Herod was seeking to kill Him. Joseph was obedient and immediately took them both to Egypt where they stayed until Herod died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matt 2:15, ‘He remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfil what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet: “Out of Egypt I called My Son.”’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What’s interesting is that this verse is referring to &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hosea 11:1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the context is God referring to His son Israel (the nation that was enslaved in Egypt), and this serves to prove the words that Yeshua spoke to the religious leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This is a ‘literal with application’ prophecy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;John 5:39, “You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; it is these that testify about Me.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Every word throughout the Old Testament is in one way or another testifying to Yeshua being the Jewish Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Capernaum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Probably one of the most overlooked and yet most detailed and specific regions that Messiah would be connected to, is Capernaum. Capernaum is situated along the Via Maris, the main trade and travel route that connected all those travelling north up through Turkey (Asia Minor) and on through to Europe and Asia, as well as south down through Egypt and into Africa proper as well as east to Arabia and the deeper Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We know that Capernaum is situated on the shores of the Sea of Galilee, which is also known as Lake Kinneret and Lake Tiberius. We also know that the Decapolis (a series of 10 Gentile cities situated on the east/south east of the Sea of Galilee within the Jordan Valley) was populated predominantly with Gentiles and is included in the greater Galilee region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We also know that Capernaum is situated alongside the traditional land allotments for the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;These details make the next verse very important and it’s a connecting verse to the Nazareth prophecy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Isaiah 9:1, ‘But there will be no more gloom for her who was in anguish; in earlier times He treated the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali with contempt, but later on He shall make it glorious, by the way of the sea, on the others side of Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles. The people who walk in darkness will see a great light; those who live in a dark land, the light will shine on them.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Why did Yeshua leave Nazareth and set up a permanent base in Capernaum? Initially, after His baptism Yeshua immediately travelled to the Galilee region and was teaching the people, He selected His disciples and His fame was spreading all over the countryside. When He made His way back to Nazareth, He read the selected portion of the Torah on Shabbat and informed everyone present that the prophecy He had just read was fulfilled in Him right at that point. After getting over their shock, they then drove Him out of the city and to a high cliff in order to throw Him over it, but He simply walked through them and left. From there He made His way back to Capernaum and that became His base of operations and He moved in to the home of Simon Peter. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Luke 4)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matthew 9:1, ‘Getting into a boat, Jesus crossed over the sea and come to His &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;own town&lt;/span&gt;.’ (His adopted town of Capernaum)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matt 4:12-13, ‘Now when Jesus heard that John had been taken into custody, He withdrew into Galilee; and leaving Nazareth, He came and &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;settled in Capernaum&lt;/span&gt;, which is by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yeshua's base of operations was in the very heart of where the lowliest and most needy people were, the places the religious elite considered below them, the places they themselves didn't want to get contaminated by; these were the places that stirred Yeshua's heart when He looked on the masses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mark 9:35-38, ‘Jesus was going through all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the Gospel of the Kingdom, and healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness. Seeing the people, He felt compassion for them, because they were distressed and dispirited like sheep without a shepherd. Then He said to His disciples, “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Therefore beseech the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into His harvest.”’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Because Yeshua lived and ministered primarily in Galilee, the religious leaders rejected Him because they said that no prophet ever came from Galilee. (John 7:52) However, they showed their ignorance in this because the town of Capernaum got its name because the prophet Nahum was from there. ‘Ka’far’ means ‘village’ and ‘Nakh’um’ is the name Nahum whose name means comfort; Capernaum therefore means ‘Village of Nahum’. Nahum the prophet came from Galilee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yeshua was born in &lt;strong&gt;BETHLEHEM&lt;/strong&gt;, just as the Scripture said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yeshua came out of &lt;strong&gt;EGYPT&lt;/strong&gt;, just as the Scripture said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yeshua lived in &lt;strong&gt;NAZARETH&lt;/strong&gt;, just as the Scripture said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yeshua based His ministry in &lt;strong&gt;CAPERNAUM&lt;/strong&gt;, just as the Scripture said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The only person in history who could make these claims in Yeshua, no one else meets these criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Indeed, the people who were living in darkness saw a GREAT LIGHT, it shined on them revealing to them the hope of the Gospel in the Person of Yeshua and He poured out His life for them, just as the Scripture said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

8497,Home Group - Micah,"&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin-right: 8px; float: left;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/1058605_60297588 small.jpg&quot; height=&quot;189&quot; width=&quot;264&quot; /&gt;Micah (Me’xah)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Micah is from the name Micaiah in the same way John, Jon, Joan, Jan, Jane are basically the same name but with tiny variations that don’t alter the meaning in any significant way. Micaiah means ‘Who is like Yahweh?’ and Micah is made up of ‘mi’ which is the common inquisitive word ‘who?’ in the Hebrew, as well as the word ‘koh’ or ‘ka’a’ which means to be disheartened or frightened. In the context of this name, the foundational name being Micaiah – ‘Who is like Yahweh?’ – the name Micaiah is the rhetorical question ‘Who is like Yahweh?’ and then the show of trust in Him responds from the name Micah with ‘Who is afraid?’, Because if one trusts in Yahweh, who could possibly be afraid?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Micah, like Amos, is the author of the book that bears his name which is a small book of only 7 chapters. Micah is listed among the minor prophets and there is little known about him personally. His parents are not listed but his name suggests he possibly had godly parents. He comes from the town of Moresheth which is located in the foothills of Judah approximately 40km southwest of Jerusalem on the border of Judah and Philistia near the town of Gath where Goliath came from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Also like Amos, Micah was from an agricultural area, a country resident removed from the politics and religion of his nation but he was chosen by God to deliver an unpopular and unwanted message of judgement to the princes, false prophets and people of Jerusalem. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Mic 3:8)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Micah lived during the reigns of kings Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, approximately 735-710 BC and the godly prophets alive during his prophetic ministry years were Hosea in the Northern Kingdom of Israel and Isaiah in the Southern Kingdom of Judah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Micah’s ministry was primarily to the southern kingdom of Judah because the Northern Kingdom of Israel was about to fall to the invasion of the Assyrians which took place in 722 BC, so this devastating event happened half way through Micah’s ministry and should have been a serious example of what would happen to Israel if they didn’t repent and return to the Lord. This is why only Judean kings are named by him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There was a great deal of corruption in Judah and enormous injustice toward the people and by the time Hezekiah came to power things in Judah were very bad. Fortunately, judgement was stayed because of the turnaround brought about by king Hezekiah. Hezekiah refused to continue paying tribute to Assyria and this caused Sennacherib to lay siege to Jerusalem in 701BC and this rightly caused Hezekiah to call upon the Lord who delivered Judah from their enemy and the people were led back to right worship of Yahweh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;A consequence of the destruction of Israel was the flooding in of refugees from the Northern Kingdom into Judah and with them they brought their idolatry, so the return to the Lord in Judah was short-lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Micah addressed this sin of idolatry but his most vehement warnings were to the individual responsibilities of the people themselves for their sin, rebellion, idolatry and injustice to the weak and vulnerable in their communities. The fact that Judah’s biggest threat came from Assyria made Micah’s prediction of invasion by Babylon very remote however, they simply refused to even consider the possibility of invasion by the Babylonians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;book of Micah&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is seven chapters long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Micah exposed and denounced the idolatry of Samaria and      Jerusalem and Micah grieved over it and called the people themselves to      mourn over their sin from their heart, not just for being caught in sin      but to be genuinely remorseful and repentant for sinning in the first      place;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Micah called out their sins of oppression and foretold of the      punishment that would come upon them but he also foretold them of Israel’s      restoration because of God’s faithfulness; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Micah rebuked the princes for their cruelty toward their own      people and then he rebuked the false prophets because they were responsible      for so much evil in the land. He exposed the sins of the princes for their      oppression of the own people because they were feeding their own greed and      comfort at the expense of the populace. Both the religious and civic      leaders were the ‘shepherds’ of the people, and the shepherd was supposed      to put the needs of the sheep before himself and God promised to deal      severely with these false shepherds for their abuse of the sheep...God’s      people. Micah warned them that their sin will be the downfall of      Jerusalem;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Micah again told of the restoration of Jerusalem and of the eventual      glory of the house of the Lord as well as Israel’s eventual victory over other      nations; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Micah foretold of a powerful king who would come from Judah who      would vanquish other nations and ultimately destroy idolatry; this is a      Messianic prophecy about the birth and work of Yeshua the Messiah; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Micah 5:2, ‘But as for you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, too little to be among the clans of Judah, from you One will go forth for Me to be ruler in Israel. His goings forth are from long ago, from the days of eternity.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;C&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;hapter 6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Judah is again rebuked for her sins, most particularly her      injustice to the people and punishment is promised as a result; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chapter 7&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Micah grieves over the lack of righteous men and Israel’s      corruption but he comforts Israel as well, promising that they will      eventually be restored to their land and will triumph over their enemies;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Those who like to deny the Old Testament as honouring a God who is brutal, loveless, merciless, blood-thirsty and cruel because He promises and brings judgement don’t understand the intensity of God’s love and the extremes of His mercy. God sent warning after warning to both Jew and Gentile nations in the OT, and sometimes waited hundreds of years before finally having to honour His warnings. God takes no delight in the death of the wicked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ezekiel 33:11, ‘Say to them, “As I live,” declares the Lord God, “I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that the wicked turn from his way and live. Turn back, turn back from your evil ways! When then will you die, O house of Israel?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Sometimes we find it difficult to believe that God brings judgement because it messes with our theology that says God IS love and therefore would never bring judgement, but it’s because God’s love is perfect and right He must also hate. Because God is perfect in all He does, His hatred is also perfect and right. For example, because God loves children, He hates abortion; because God loves truth He hates lies; because God loves purity He hates immorality; because God loves life He hates murder. So because God loves He also hates and both are perfect and right because He is perfect and always right in His judgements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God’s promise of the eventual restoration of Israel to the land was a great encouragement to the few, the ‘remnant’ in Judah who were faithful to Him, even though they would go into captivity into Babylon eventually God would see them restored and re-established in the land He promised would be theirs. This is exactly what happened and Daniel the prophet was just one of those who ended up in Babylon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Micah was to Judah was Amos was to Israel. They warned their people that their worship of God had to not only be genuine it had to be right. It’s very possible to be genuine, but genuinely wrong. People don’t determine how they will worship God, people are to worship God the way He says they should, because human beings left to themselves ultimately re-form God in the image they think He should be and then become guilty of idolatry. How we worship and approach God really does matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Because God loves people, we are to treat them carefully and thoughtfully. How does a person know if they are truly honouring and worshipping God? They worship Him and honour Him according to His Word and not their own preferences and opinions and they represent Him in their words, thoughts and deeds and in how they treat other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If we allow God to reach into the very deepest part of our heart where our secret motivations reside to bring conviction and genuine remorse for our sin, He can then transform us and the evidence will be seen on the outside in how we speak, think and behave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proverbs 6:16-23, ‘There are six things which the Lord hates, yes, seven which are an abomination to Him; haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that run rapidly to evil, a false witness who utters lies, and one who spreads strife among brothers. My son, observe the commandment of your father and do not forsake the teaching of your mother; bind them continually on your heart; tie them around your neck. When you walk about, they will guide you; when you sleep, they will watch over you; and when you awake, they will talk to you. For the commandment is a lamp and the teaching is light; and reproofs for discipline are the way of life.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The last sentence of this passage reveals so much; the commandment, the Word of God, is a lamp for us, it disciplines us when we need it and it is a WAY OF LIFE...as opposed to being something we step into on Sunday and then step out of again on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Study the Word, learn the Word, live the Word and love God supremely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

8108,Home Group - Amos,"&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin-right: 8px; float: left;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/724407_24295926 small.jpg&quot; height=&quot;168&quot; width=&quot;224&quot; /&gt;Amos (Ah’mose)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name Amos comes from the Hebrew verb ‘amas’ which means a load or carry a load. This can mean a physical load carried by a donkey, it can mean a load carried by a nation or group of people perhaps like carrying the burden of war or oppression or it can mean a load carried by God, as in carrying the burden of sin for His people and the provision of salvation. Amos then means &lt;em&gt;‘burden’&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;‘burden bearer’&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two men in the Bible with the name Amos; the first is the prophet Amos who lived in the eighth century BC and the second is someone mentioned in the genealogy of Christ in Luke’s Gospel and he lived in the third century BC. Amos the prophet shouldn’t be confused with Amoz the father of the prophet Isaiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All information about Amos can be found in the &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;book of Amos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, it’s a small book of only 9 chapters and there isn’t a lot of information given about this particular man, but he is listed as being one of the &lt;em&gt;minor prophets&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Major and Minor Prophets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There can be quite a bit of confusion over the term &lt;em&gt;‘major’&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;‘minor’&lt;/em&gt; prophets and it can lead to thinking that the major prophets are important and the minor prophets are unimportant and insignificant, but the terms ‘major’ and ‘minor’ are defined by the length of the books not the content or quality of the messages in the books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Isaiah (66 chps); Jeremiah (52 chps); Lamentations [probably written by Jeremiah] (5 chps); Ezekiel (48 chps) and Daniel (12 chps), making a total of 5 ‘Major’ prophetic books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minor:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Hosea (14 chps); Joel (3 chps); Amos (9 chps); Obadiah (1 chp); Jonah (4 chps); Micah (7 chps); Nahum (3 chps); Habakkuk (3 chps); Zephaniah (3 chps); Haggai (2 chps); Zechariah (14 chps) and Malachi (4 chps), making a total of 12 ‘Minor’ prophetic books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiously, even though both Hosea and Zechariah have more chapters than the book of Daniel, Daniel is listed among the ‘Major’ prophets because of his incredibly substantial and detailed prophecies particularly of the last days. Also, Lamentations is only 5 chapters long but because it’s believed to have been written by Jeremiah, is listed alongside his other prophet writings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amos lived in a town called Tekoa, a small village about 16km south of Jerusalem and he is the only prophet who stated what his occupation was before his divine commission was given to him by God. He was not of the tribe of Levi and therefore was not in the priestly line and he had no claim to nobility either. Amos was in fact a farmer and more specifically he was a shepherd or sheepherder&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Amos 1:1)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and a grower of Sycamore trees &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Amos 7:14)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. The Sycamore tree is a variety of fig tree and native to Africa and portions of the Middle East and they fruit all year round. The Sycamore tree is mostly known to Christians because short Zaccheus the super short tax collector climbed into the high branches of a Sycamore tree in the city of Jericho in order to see Yeshua as He was coming through the town.&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Luke 19)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amos lived during the reigns of Uzziah king of Judah and Jeroboam II king of Israel and during the prophetic ministry years of Isaiah &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Isa 1:1)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Jonah &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 14:25)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and Hosea &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Hos 1:1)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amos was from Judea in the southern kingdom of Judah, but he was called to be a prophet primarily to the northern kingdom of Israel. The situation in Israel during the reign of Jeroboam II was strong politically and it was a time of great prosperity and security. Jeroboam II continued the example of his father Joash &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 13:25)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and significantly restored the borders of Israel &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 14:25)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and it was during his rule that Israel was living at peace with Judah her neighbour to the south and her more menacing neighbour to the north east....Assyria. It’s very possible that Assyria’s aspirations of war against Israel were subdued after they repented at the preaching of Jonah, who we looked at last week. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Jon 3:10)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spiritually however, Israel was experiencing a time of rampant corruption and moral decay. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Amos 4:1; 5:10-13; 2 Kings 14:24)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amos is very explicit when he warns that God is going to judge evil doers and he begins with the surrounding enemies of Israel; Damascus (Syria), Gaza (Palestinians), Tyre (Lebanon), Edom, Ammon and Moab (Jordan), and Judah (Southern Kingdom of Israel. God was angry with the wickedness of the surrounding nations and He was angry with His own people because He had demonstrated His great power and His great love and faithfulness to them when He brought them out of Egypt and destroyed their enemies before them, and in return they refused to obey Him, they refused to listen to the prophets when He spoke through them and in fact, many prophets were imprisoned and killed and were not allowed to prophesy the Word of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God was angry with the Gentile nations because they too had either seen or heard of God’s power and might when He brought the Jews out of slavery in Egypt and despite knowing that Yahweh was the One True God, vastly more powerful than their own false gods, they refused to seek and serve Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, Amos addresses two very serious sins of Israel; 1) there was no true, genuine worship of Yahweh and 2) there was no justice in the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most treacherous sins that Israel committed was to pretend to worship and serve God when in fact they were not. They had erected altars for worship and sacrifice, claimed they were for the worship of Yahweh and even maintained some of the requirements of the Mosaic Laws but they were corrupting these practices with pagan worship rites and practices and mingling the sacred with the profane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amos 4:4-5, ‘”Enter Bethel and transgress; in Gilgal multiply transgression! Bring your sacrifices every morning, your tithes every three days. Offer a thank offering also from that which is leavened, and proclaim freewill offerings, make them known. For so you love to do, you sons of Israel,” declares the Lord God.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people of Israel were going through religious formations and maintaining an appearance of religious observance, but they were utterly corrupted and compromised with paganism. They were following the way of Jeroboam, Israel’s first king after the nation split in two. He wanted to make sure the people didn’t travel back to Jerusalem to the Temple to make sacrifices to Yahweh so he set up two altars for that purpose, one in Dan in the north and one in Bethel in the south and when he presented them to the people, he used exactly the same words that Aaron used in the wilderness when he fashioned a golden calf for the people. “Behold your god O Israel; that brought you up from the land of Egypt.” Jeroboam made idols to represent Yahweh and he established a complete religious system that mimicked the Mosaic system but it was subtly different and he caused the people to commit great sin because they foolishly thought they could be perceived as remaining faithful in their worship of God, when they were in fact worshipping idols and demons and were not worshipping God at all. Once this kind of mixing of the sacred and profane (intermingling of religions and religious practices) takes place, it’s not long before people start thinking that all religions worship the same god, regardless of the different ways those ‘gods’ are represented. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;(2 Kings 12:25-33; Ex 32:4)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we call this ‘universalism’ – all religions basically worship the same god. If this were true, then Yeshua was a liar because He said in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;John 14:6, ‘Jesus said to him, &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;“I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father but through Me.&lt;/span&gt;”’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other great sin that Israel committed repeatedly throughout her history was the sin of injustice against the weak, vulnerable and innocent. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Amos 5:10-13)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Compare this list with our own modern society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They imposed heavy rent on the poor and forced them to pay tax      on their own crops; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They harassed and oppressed those in the land who were      righteous and sought righteous behaviour and conduct from their leaders      and who wanted to remain faithful to the Lord; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They accepted bribes from those who were wealthy enough to pay      them so that they could continue in their corruption and oppression; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They refused to allow the poor and needy into their villages      and communities because they didn’t want to give any time, effort or money      to assist them. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those who saw this kind of cruelty and corruption and who knew      it was wrong simply looked the other way and kept their mouths shut      pretending not to have seen anything. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing new under the sun...as it was in the days of the prophet Amos so it is in our own supposedly advanced and enlightened day today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amos 6:12, ‘”Do horses run on rocks? Or does one plow them with oxen? Yet you have turned justice into poison and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood?”’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horses can’t run on rocks without injuring themselves and farmers don’t plow fields that are covered in rocks; this goes against the rules of agriculture, if you want a good crop you sow good seed into good soil and tend the crop in order to reap a harvest. If a farmer foolishly tried to plow a rock filled section of his farm he’d end up injuring his oxen, damaging his plow and he wouldn’t grow any fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God used the imagery of well known farming practices to point out that by corrupting proven agricultural practices they would be gain nothing but a bad crop and in the same way, their corrupted religious and judicial systems had poisoning their society and would result in its destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Israelites of the Northern Kingdom of Israel did not listen to the warnings of Amos and therefore the promise of divine judgement remained on the people, but because there was always a small remnant of faithful followers of Yahweh, God also left them with a promise and this promise came true after both the Assyrian invasion and the worldwide diaspora. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Amos 9:7-15)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amos 9:14-15, ‘”Also I will restore the captivity of My people Israel, and they will rebuild the ruined cities and live in them; they will also plant vineyards and drink their wine, and make gardens and eat their fruit. I will also plant them on their land, and they will not again be uprooted out from their land which I have given them,” says the Lord your God.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the book of Amos and you’ll see how earnestly God calls upon His people to seek Him so that they would live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amos 5:6-7, ‘”&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Seek the Lord that you may live&lt;/span&gt;, or He will break forth like a fire, O house of Joseph, and it will consume with none to quench it for Bethel, for those who turn justice into wormwood and cast righteousness down to the earth.”’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amos 5:14-15, ‘”&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Seek good and not evil, that you might live&lt;/span&gt;; and thus may the Lord God of hosts be with you, just as you have said! Hate evil, love good, and establish justice in the gate! Perhaps the Lord God of hosts may be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.”’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God’s greatest desire is for people to seek Him and His ways in order to avoid the judgement that absolutely must come upon any people who refuse to stop sinning or to stop encouraging other people in their sin. God is righteous and just and therefore He must bring judgement on sin and those who commit it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But God is so incredibly merciful and compassionate and He gives us warning after warning and that is why the book of Amos is just as applicable today in our culture as it was in the day that it was written and spoken out to the people of Israel. Now is a really good time to take a little time to pray for our nation and our national leaders and our particular political ‘bent’ is really not important. Righteousness is what exalts a nation while sin is a reproach to any land. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;(Pro 14:34)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shalom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

8037,Home Group - Jonah,"&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin-right: 8px; float: left;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/575231_55762839 small.jpg&quot; height=&quot;211&quot; width=&quot;282&quot; /&gt;Jonah (Yo-nah):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There is quite a lot of detail in the background and history of this name but it’s quite complicated. Suffice it to say that all sources conclude that Jonah means ‘dove’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The story of Jonah is found in the book &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jonah&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, but he was also mentioned in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 Kings 14:25&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; which says that Jonah was the son of Amittai and that he was from the town of Gath-hepher, which is a town north of Nazareth in the Galilee. Jonah was also mentioned in the Gospel accounts; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matthew 12:40-41; 16:4; Luke 11:29-32&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It’s interesting that Nicodemus tried to defend Yeshua against the attacks of the religious leaders he was associated with, but they shouted him down by telling him to check the records to understand that no prophet ever came out of Galilee...but they were Biblically and historically wrong; Jonah, the prophet to the Gentiles of Nineveh came from the Galilee. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(John 7:40-53)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Psalm 96:4 &amp;amp; 9 &amp;amp; 13 says ‘...Tell of His glory among the nations, His wonderful deeds among all peoples. For great is the Lord and greatly to be praised; He is to be feared above all gods....tremble before Him all the earth. Say among the nations, The Lord reigns; indeed the world is firmly established, it will not be moved; He will judge the people with equity... He will judge the world in righteousness and the peoples in His faithfulness.’ &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Isaiah 49:6, ‘He says, “It is too small a thing that you should be My servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the preserved ones of Israel; I will also make You a light of the nations so that My salvation may reach to the end of the earth.”’ &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God specifically chose the Jewish people to have a special relationship with them and He entrusted His laws and oracles to them and He did that so that they would then demonstrate to the rest of the world what a nation looks like who has a relationship with the Creator of the whole universe. That was their role...to be a light to the nations. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Isa 42:6)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So the entire nation of Jews (the Hebrews/the nation of Israel) were to be a living national witness to the rest of the world; a living testimony if you will demonstrating God’s faithfulness, His greatness and His holiness which is seen most clearly through His Word. Through them also would come the Messiah to save all who would believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;From within the nation itself, God also selected special men to be His mouthpieces. Prophets who had the unenviable job of speaking the words that God specifically gave them to direct and instruct the people when they were in need or fearful, as well as words of rebuke, chastisement, warning and even judgement when the Jewish people were rebelling and sinning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God also used His prophets to preach to the unsaved nations as well. Moses was a prophet who preached the Word of God to Pharaoh of the Egyptians &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Gen 4 – Ex 13)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Isaiah chapters 13-27&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are messages specifically directed at Gentile nations, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jeremiah chapters 46-51&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; speaks the Word of God to 11 different Gentile nations, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ezekiel chapters 25-32&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; preached the Word of God to 3 Gentile nations, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daniel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;spoke the Word of God to numerous Gentile nations as well as the prophets &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Obadiah, Nahum and Zephaniah&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Now Jonah was a prophet whom God called to travel to Nineveh – the capital of Assyria – to preach to that people that imminent judgement was about to fall on them. Who were the Ninevites? They were the ancient Assyrians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Nineveh was situated on the eastern bank of the Tigris River and its ruins are across the river from what is today the modern city of Mosul in Iraq. It was settled as early as 6000 BC and by 3000 BC it had become an important centre of religious worship of the pagan goddess Ishtar, and many Ninevite kings continued the growth and development of the city but ultimately it was Sennacherib who really made the city magnificent at around 700 BC. The Assyrians were renowned for their cruelty and brutality, there were a particularly barbaric people - in fact they were probably the first ‘terrorists’ and they used the fear they instilled in other nations as a means of forcing capitulation and servitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The fact that God wanted to send one of His own prophets to warn this blood-thirsty people that judgement was about to fall on them shows how gracious and merciful God really is, but Jonah however, was not impressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Nineveh was directly east of Israel, about 1600 km from the sea port of Joppa. Jonah paid passage on a ship that was headed to Tarshish which is the city of Tartessus in Spain today. Tarshish was approximately 4800 km directly west of Israel. Jonah was determined not to go to Nineveh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The ship he boarded set sail and once out to sea an incredible storm came up, the sailors did everything they knew to keep the ship afloat and they were calling on their gods to save them and ultimately they came across Jonah asleep below. How he could sleep during such a storm is hard to comprehend, but they woke him and told him to call upon his God in the hope that He would hear him and save them all. These sailors were so distressed that they cast lots to see which person on board had committed an offense so bad as to cause this disaster to come upon them all; someone’s ‘god’ must have been offended and they were desperate to find out was responsible so they could do whatever they could to make things right. The lot fell to Jonah and his response is amazing. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Jonah 1:1-7)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jonah 1:9, ‘He said to them, “I am a Hebrew and I fear the Lord of heaven who made the sea and the dry land.”’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This reluctant prophet to the Gentiles who was running as far away from the call of God as he could, described God as the Creator of everything. That one sentence declares God to be the biggest, the greatest and the most powerful being ever! The reluctant prophet even in his disobedience was preaching about the truth of God to gentiles on board this ship. They were terrified but Jonah told them their only hope of survival was to throw him over into the sea. They didn’t want to have the death of a prophet on their hands but in the end they complied, and as soon as Jonah hit the water, the storm ceased and this resulted in these pagan sailors immediately putting their faith in the One True God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jonah 1:15-17, ‘So they picked up Jonah, threw him into the sea and the sea stopped its raging. Then the men feared the Lord greatly, and they offered a sacrifice to the Lord and made vows.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;No doubt these men eventually returned to their homes and preached to their own communities and families about their encounter with the God of the Jews and became evangelists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Now Jonah was swallowed by a very large fish and spent the next 3 days and 3 nights having his mind changed about being obedient to God’s instructions. The fish vomited Jonah back onto the beach at Joppa and then he began the long 1600 km trek to Nineveh – the capital city of Assyria; population approximately 120,000 souls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Jonah knew how brutal these people were; Chuck Missler believes that because Jonah was a prophet he knew that a time would come when his own people would suffer terribly at the hands of the Assyrians and that this is quite possibly why Jonah didn’t want the people to be spared. Jonah knew his people were sinful, but he was also a patriot, he didn’t want to see them decimated by their enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The city of Nineveh was very large, it would take 3 days to walk around it and when he arrived in the city, he walked through it for one day only and repeated one statement...&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Yet forty days and Nineveh will be overthrown.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Jonah 3:4)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It’s as though Jonah didn’t want to invite them to repent or give them any hope at all, Chuck Missler’s paraphrase of this statement is &lt;em&gt;‘In 40 days you get yours!!!’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Jonah’s message was heard by the people and it reached the ears of the king and all the people from the king himself to the lowliest servant...even their animals and livestock were dressed in sackcloth to demonstrate repentance. The king said, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Who knows, God may turn and relent and withdraw His burning anger so that we will not perish.” (Jonah 3:9)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;After delivering his message, Jonah saw the immediate response of the people and he left the city very angry and nursing a foul attitude. He begged God to kill him on the spot. Jonah knew that God was gracious, compassionate and very keen to forgive repentant sinners. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Jonah 4:1-4)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Jonah sat at distance from the city to see what would happen to it and attempted to make himself a bit of a shelter, it was very hot and uncomfortable and Jonah was miserable. God caused a shady plant to grow up quickly and it gave Jonah some shade and respite from the blinding heat and he was quite pleased about that. But then God caused a worm to eat into the plant and it withered and died exposing Jonah to the intense heat of the sun once again and he once again the prophet was angry and miserable and begged God to kill him again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Now it was time for Jonah’s life lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jonah 4:9-11, ‘Then God said to Jonah, “Do you have good reason to be angry about the plant?” And he said, “I have good reason to be angry, even to death.” Then the Lord said, “You had compassion on the plant for which you did not work and which you did not cause to grow, which came up overnight and perished overnight. Should I not have compassion on Nineveh, the great city in which there are more than 120,000 persons who do not know the difference between their right and left hand, as well as many animals?”’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The book of Jonah ends right there, nothing more is said, but there are very important lessons to learn from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When God’s Word says that God does not take pleasure in the death of the wicked, it’s true. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Ezek 33:11)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The Assyrians were a barbaric and cruel people, they were dreadful idolaters and murderers, but God wanted them to repent because God would rather forgive than condemn. But you can’t condemn someone if they don’t understand that they’ve done wrong. God said they didn’t know &lt;em&gt;the difference between their right and left hand&lt;/em&gt;, but because God is a fair and righteous God, He won’t judge those who are ignorant. That doesn’t mean they weren’t guilty of sinning and offending God, they just didn’t realise they were guilty of sin. Once they were aware, they were responsible and accountable. Paul said that the Law was given to show men that they were in fact sinners, law breakers who were deserving of judgement. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Romans 7)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jonah was a man of God, He was a prophet who knew the Law and also knew the voice and instruction of God; he also knew the nature and character of God – that He is kind, gracious, merciful and forgiving. Jonah’s biggest problem was his own prejudice against the cruel Assyrians who were one of Israel’s worst enemies. His main struggle was between his patriotism and his faith. This lesson is seen very clearly in the Gospels when Yeshua Himself taught that we are to love our enemies. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Matt 5:44; Luke 6:27-35)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Nineveh was not destroyed, God responded to their immediate repentance and they continued on for another 1000 years, after which God finally judged them because the following generations turned their back on God to follow their previous pagan ways and God destroyed them; they were no longer ignorant of their sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Despite Jonah’s resistance and personal prejudice, his preaching saw the entire city of 120,000 souls repent before the living God. God used him in spite of his hard heart, but because God loved Jonah as well, He used the situation to reveal to Jonah the sin in his own life so he could understand that God was interested in all people, even the most wicked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There’s one last point to note about the prophet Jonah and it’s probably the most important point of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When the religious leaders asked Yeshua to prove His messiahship by performing a sign, He called them wicked and perverse for doing so and then said that the only sign they would be given was the sign of the prophet Jonah. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Matt 12; 16; Luke 11)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Why did Jonah have to be 3 days and 3 nights in the belly of the fish...what was the significance of ‘3 days and 3 nights’? It was necessary for Jonah to be in the fish for this specific time because it was a symbolically prophetic picture of Messiah being dead for 3 days and 3 nights as a result of His execution for the sins of the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;John 5:39&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Yeshua said to the religious leaders, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; it is these that testify about Me.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;All Scripture points to Christ; every Word of God is written to testify that Yeshua is the Messiah, why He would come, what He would do when He came, what He would be like, how He would teach and save and deliver; what He would achieve and when He would come again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

The first ‘Yoe’ is an abbreviation of the name of Yahweh and ‘el’ is the abbreviated form of Elohim which means God. So Joel means ‘Yahweh is God’ or ‘The Lord is God’.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-font-family: Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;&quot;&gt;The name Joel in the Bible is very popular and there were many men with that name. The prophet Joel however is mentioned in the book bearing his name and also in Acts. To learn what Joel is about you should read the &lt;strong style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;book of Joel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; which is only three chapters long, and he is mentioned once more in &lt;strong style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Acts 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-font-family: Calibri; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;&quot;&gt;The Bible gives precious little information about the prophet Joel as an individual; we know his father’s name was Pethuel but that’s all the information there is about his family. In chapters &lt;strong style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;em style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;1 &amp;amp; 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Joel demonstrates great passion for the Temple however he also demonstrates familiarity with an agricultural life so this would suggest he wasn’t a Levite or a Priest. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

7863,Home Group - Elisha Pt 2,"&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin-right: 8px; float: left;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/954634_94521374 small.jpg&quot; height=&quot;213&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;Elisha Pt 2 (El-e-sha)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Elisha’s story can be read in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 Kings 19, 2 Kings, chapter 2 through to chapter 13.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;As a quick recap from last week, Elisha means ‘God is Salvation’ or ‘My God is Salvation’ and he was the &lt;em&gt;‘talmid’&lt;/em&gt; or student or disciple or apprentice of the prophet Elijah. Elisha was a faithful and committed student who learned well from his mentor and never shied away from what he was called to do. He was respectful and honouring to Elijah and refused to leave his side, right up to the very moment that God supernaturally transported Elijah to heaven by a whirlwind in a fiery horse and chariot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Elisha had one request of his mentor before he was taken away and that was to receive a double portion of his spirit. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 2:9)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Elisha wasn’t asking for Elijah’s actual ‘spirit’ but rather the spiritual inheritance and legacy of his prophetic gifting. He wanted to be just like his mentor, but because he loved Elijah like a father, he was asking for the blessing of a first born son; again not with a physical inheritance in mind, but a spiritual one. A spiritual inheritance for a spiritual son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Elijah promised that if Elisha actually saw him taken away by God, he would be granted his request, and yes, Elisha actually saw it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Elisha twice destroyed the physical attachments of his past – the oxen and plough he used to earn his living with and his outer clothing that designated his spiritual position – such was his determination to walk in the path God had chosen for him. He wanted no means of turning back to what was his past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Elijah his mentor was a powerful man of God and performed eight major miracles through the power of God. Elisha’s double portion sees him also become a very powerful man of God and the record of his life shows sixteen major miracles thus proving the double portion granted to him by God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;These miraculous events were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;ol start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He parted the Jordan River &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings      2:13-14)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He cursed the teenagers who were mocking him &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 2:23-25)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He healed the poisoned waters of Jericho &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2      Kings 2:19-22)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He filled the widows vessels with oil &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;(2      Kin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;gs 4:1-27)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The miracle birth of a son by the Shunemite woman &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 4:8-17)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He raised from the dead the son of the Shunemite woman &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 4:18-37)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He healed the poisonous stew &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2      Kings 4:38-44)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He fed 100 men with a small amount of food as well as leftovers      &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 4:42-44)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He healed Naaman the Syrian &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2      Kings 5:1-14)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He punished Gehazi with leprosy &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2      Kings 5:15-27)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He caused the sunken iron axe head to float on the water &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 6:1-7)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He caused the trenches on the battlefield to flood &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 3:1-27)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He gave special insight to the king’s messenger &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 6:16-17)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He blinded the Aramean army &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2      Kings 6:8-18)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He restored the sight of the Aramean army &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2      Kings 6:19-20)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A dead man was raised to life after his body was thrown onto Elisha’s      grave &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 13:20-21)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What’s interesting is that there are some similarities in the miracles done by both Elijah and Elisha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elijah parted the Jordan River      and Elisha parted the Jordan River. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 2:8,      13-14)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elijah miraculously caused the      flour and oil of a widow not to run out until the drought ended and Elisha      caused the oil of a widow not to run out until all the empty vessels she      could get her hands on were filled to the brim. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(1      Kings 17:9-16, 2 Kings 4:1-27)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elijah raised a young boy from      the dead and Elisha raised a young boy from the dead. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(1      Kings 17:17-24, 2 Kings 4:18-37)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elijah had power over the      elements of nature by causing drought and Elisha had power over the      elements of nature by causing a flood without rain. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(1      Kings 17:1, 2 Kings 3:1-27)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There is another aspect to Elisha’s character that is worth looking at; he was no respecter of persons, he didn’t allow a person’s position, wealth or social standing to influence him. This is seen when king Jehoram (son of Ahab) approached king Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom to go with him to battle against Moab. Jehoshaphat was a godly man and wanted to receive a word of direction from God through one of His prophets. So Jehoram sent for Elisha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 Kings 3:11-14, ‘But Jehoshaphat said, “Is there not a prophet of the Lord here, that we may inquire of the Lord by him?” And one of the king of Israel’s servants answered and said, “Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, who used to pour water on the hands of Elijah.” Jehoshaphat said, “The word of the Lord is with him.” So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him. Now Elisha said to the king of Israel, “What do I have to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father and to the prophets of your mother.” And the king of Israel said to him, “No, for the Lord has called these three kings together to give them into the hand of Moab.” Elisha said, “As the Lord of hosts lives, before whom I stand, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look at you nor see you.”’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Elisha didn’t give a toss that he was standing before royalty or that he was humiliating his king in front of two other monarchs. He even went so far as to compare his own wicked king with the righteous king Jehoshaphat. He didn’t even care that his insult against his king could have eventuated with his own execution. Elisha was faithful to the call of God and to truth and he had no time for pandering to wicked men in order to gain influence or to protect his own life - no matter who they were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This is also seen in his ‘sort-of’ encounter with Naaman the Syrian, I say ‘sort-of’ because he never actually met Naaman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Naaman was the captain of the army of the king of Aram, he was &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘highly respected because by him the Lord had given victory to Aram.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s very interesting isn’t it? God – Jehovah – the God of the Jews – had given victory to Aram, a pagan nation and He used Naaman, a pagan army captain to do it...and what’s more, Naaman and his king recognised that Jehovah was giving them victory over their enemies. They worshipped false gods but they knew their victories came through Jehovah. It’s hard to understand why they weren’t devoted to the One True God or why this didn’t stop them from going to war against Israel at a later date. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 5:1) &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Naaman was a leper and he had a young Jewish servant girl that obviously cared for her masters because she knew that if Naaman could get to Elisha the prophet in Israel he would be healed. In ancient times leprosy was a death sentence. Naaman heard about this prophet and spoke to his king and got permission to travel to Israel to seek a miraculous healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;He makes his way to Elisha with great pomp and ceremony with elaborate and expensive gifts and he has great expectations of how he would be healed. Elisha wasn’t in the least bit impressed with him, his stature, his standing with royalty or his wealth, in fact Elisha didn’t even walk out and meet the man, he simply sent a messenger to tell the Syrian captain to go away and wash himself seven times in the Jordan River and Naaman was furious at being treated like a nobody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 Kings 5:11-12, ‘But Naaman was furious and went away and said, “Behold, I thought he would surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the Lord his God and wave his hand over the place and cure the leper. Are not Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them and be clean?” So he turned and went away in a rage.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Of course, the story goes on to show that one of Naaman’s servants said that what he had been instructed to do was an easy thing so just go and do it. He did and was completely healed and restored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There’s one more thing that it would be good to look at that happened during the life of Elisha. The king of Aram decided to go to war against Israel and he would make a decision to go to such and such a place to attack the king of Israel. Each time he did, the king of Israel would go via a different place and every time the king of Aram’s plans would be thwarted. He got so frustrated he was sure that one of his own people was leaking his plans to his enemies. One of his servants however reminded him about Elisha the prophet (who had healed Naaman his captain of leprosy) who was receiving information from God about the king of Aram’s plans and he would promptly warn his own king about what was about to happen. The king of Israel would simply avoid the danger zones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The king of Aram was so enraged he sent his entire army to Dothan to capture Elisha; (any gratitude he may have felt toward Elisha for healing Naaman was gone...and since we never hear of Naaman again perhaps he quit the army to serve the God who healed him...that's only speculation but it's interesting to consider), they travelled at night and surrounded the city that Elisha lived in. Elisha's servant woke in the morning and was absolutely terrified at what he saw and went into a panic to Elisha and said, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Alas my master! What shall we do?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Elisha remained very calm because he knew that God was with them. He calmly responded by saying, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Do not fear, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.” Then Elisha prayed and said, “O Lord, I pray, open his eyes that he may see.” And the Lord opened the servant’s eyes and he saw; and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.’ (2 Kings 6:15-17)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;How did Elisha know what was surrounding them? He’d already seen what the horses and chariots of Israel looked like when he saw his mentor Elijah taken into heaven in one. Elisha didn’t need physical security because his confidence was in his God who wasn’t in the least bit limited by physicality. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 2:11-14)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Since May 14, 1948 Israel has been attacked seven times by surrounding nations resulting in major wars - this is not including uprisings, smaller attacks and terrorist bombings. One of them was the Yom Kippur war which took place in October 1973. I once read a book written by Lance Lambert called ‘The Battle For Israel’ which was written in 1979, and in it he recorded incredible miracles that took place during this war, a war that should for all intents and purposes have ended with the destruction of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In this book, Lambert records the testimonies of invading foreign forces in the desert who fled from their tanks leaving their weapons and ammunition behind. When asked why they fled, they said they ran for their lives before the massive army in white on the horizon that was surrounding them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Psalm 121, ‘I will lift up my eyes to the mountains; from where shall my help come? My help comes from the Lord, who made heaven and earth. He will not allow your foot to slip; He who keeps you will not slumber. Behold, He who keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep. The Lord is your keeper; the Lord is your shade on your right hand. The sun will not smite you by day, nor the moon by night. The Lord will protect you from all evil; He will keep your soul. The Lord will guard your going out and your coming in from this time forth and forever.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Elisha knew his God and he knew God wouldn’t fail him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What we see is not as important as WHO we know!&lt;/p&gt;

7786,Home Group - Elisha Pt 1,"&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin-right: 8px; float: left;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/575231_55762839 small.jpg&quot; height=&quot;191&quot; width=&quot;254&quot; /&gt;Elisha Part 1 (El-e-sha)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Elisha is made up of two elements; ‘El’ which is the common abbreviation of Elohim which means God. The second element, ‘yasha’ means to be saved or delivered. So Elisha’s name means ‘God is Salvation’, ‘My God is Salvation’, ‘God the Saviour’ or ‘The Salvation of my God.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Elisha is a great name and is similar to other names formed from the same verb ‘yasha’ which also mean salvation; names like Joshua, Yeshua, Hosea, Isaiah...these are also related to the word Hosanna which means ‘Save’ or ‘Bring about Salvation.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Elisha’s story can be read in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1Kings 19, 2 Kings chapter 2 right through to chapter 13. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God told Elijah to choose Elisha to be his successor and when Elijah came upon Elisha he was ploughing his family fields with twelve pair of oxen. Twenty four in total...that’s a lot of oxen!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The sheer number of oxen reveals that Elisha was from a very wealthy family, they had hired help to work with the sons of the family and Elisha was leading the twelfth pair and as Elijah approached the property and the teams working in the field he waited for Elisha to pass him and as he did he threw his mantle or cloak over him. Elijah’s cloak or mantle was what identified him as a prophet of God and when he placed it over Elisha he was signifying that Elisha had been chosen to not only be a prophet unto the Lord, but that he was to specifically be Elijah’s successor. He was handpicked to be Elijah’s ‘talmid’ – his student, pupil; and Elijah would disciple him, train him, apprentice him to become a man who knew and loved the Word of God and would be committed to speaking God’s very words to the people of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Elisha knew immediately what the significance was behind this action. Being trained by a prophet often meant living a hard life, often a lonely life, often on the run (especially if you were a prophet like Elijah), prophets were mostly unwanted, unwelcome and feared and quite often even hated and this meant the vocation of a prophet was often dangerous. Being the apprentice of Elijah was particularly dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Elisha made his decision immediately, he didn’t second guess his course of action and he had only one request of his new boss – to be allowed to say farewell to his father, family and friends and Elijah was happy to oblige him. This says a lot about the kind of man Elisha was; he was a man who loved God intensely and was willing to give up everything to serve Him. Elisha killed the two oxen he’d been leading and cooked them over the wood of the plough they’d been harnessed to and doing this was also significant because he destroyed his personal means of making a living according to his former way of life. He prepared a feast for his family and friends – a celebratory feast – and then promptly made his way to Elijah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Elisha watched Elijah over the next four years observing his mentor and learned all he needed to from him. He saw Elijah deal with King Ahab over his murder of Naboth and his sons when he conspired to steal his vineyard; he saw the fulfilment of the prophecies concerning Ahab and Jezebel’s deaths as well as other things. He knew Elijah was a real man of God, he was awed and inspired by the powerful prophetic ministry of his mentor and he learned well from him that God was faithful and could be thoroughly trusted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;On the day Elijah knew God was going to take him to heaven he told Elisha three separate times to stay where he was because the Lord was directing him to yet another place. The prophet was testing him to see how strong his loyalty really was. First they went to Bethel, next to Jericho and finally to the Jordan River. Each time Elisha refused to leave his master and remained at his side. There were many other prophets in these particular places and they all spoke to Elisha to ask him if he realised that he was going to lose his master that very day. Elisha acknowledged their information but he refused to be sidetracked or influenced by them, he refused to leave to plot his own ministry course. They were all godly men, prophets in their own right and this is acknowledged by the fact that they all knew Elijah was about to leave them because God was going to take him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Once they had crossed the Jordan River (miraculously because Elijah parted the water by striking his mantle [cloak] on the water and it parted for them to walk through), Elijah finally turned to Elisha to ask if he had a final request of him and we all know of Elisha’s famous request for a double portion of the same spirit that rested upon Elijah to rest on him. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 2:1-14)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Ancient Hebrew custom granted a double portion of the father’s possessions upon the firstborn son and with it gave the right of succession to that son to lead the family. Requesting a double portion of the spirit of Elijah didn’t mean that Elisha was greedy or considered himself to be superior to his mentor, rather, Elisha loved Elijah as a father, he honoured his mentor immensely and since Elisha had given up his claims to his physical inheritance when he left his home and family to serve Elijah, he was asking for the ‘double portion’ or inheritance of his mentor and spiritual father Elijah. He was in fact asking for a spiritual inheritance rather than a physical one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Elisha knew he was about to step into the shoes of his mentor, he would take over the position and authority of Elijah and he wanted to be thoroughly equipped for the task. He wanted to be a faithful student by becoming a mentor to others in the same way that Elijah had been to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When Elijah said that Elisha was asking a hard thing &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(v10)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; it was because the source of Elijah’s power wasn’t of his own doing, it was given to him by God. Elijah didn’t have the ability or authority to endow such power on another human being; that was entirely God’s prerogative. However, being a prophet meant that he could in fact issue instructions that would serve as a sign to his student to indicate whether or not God would grant the request. Elijah told Elisha that if he actually saw him taken into heaven by God that would be the sign to indicate that God would grant his request and that’s exactly what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 Kings 2:11-14, ‘As they were going along and talking, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire which separated the two of them. And Elijah went up by a whirlwind in to heaven. Elisha saw it and cried out, “My father, my father, chariots of Israel and its horsemen!” And he saw Elijah no more. Then he took hold of his own clothes and tore them in two pieces. He also took up the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and returned and stood by the bank of the Jordan. He took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and struck the waters and said, “Where is the Lord, the God of Elijah?” And when he also had struck the waters, they were divided here and there; and Elisha crossed over.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Elisha’s request was granted, he saw his mentor taken into heaven and there are several important things to note about Elisha’s reactions at this incredible event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He called Elijah “My father” which was a term of endearment and respect toward his mentor. It is a common title to call a leader/teacher ‘father’ in Hebrew culture, but Elisha’s high esteem and love for his mentor was greater than the relationships held by most teachers and their students as is evident by his refusal to leave him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He immediately took off his own clothing (an outer garment) and tore it in two. It’s a similar action to him slaughtering his oxen and plough in that he was destroying his former way of life so he couldn’t return to it. Here he is destroying his clothing to show that he was leaving his former position behind never to return to it and he was now the authorised successor and newly appointed prophet of God taking the place of seniority which had previously been held by Elijah.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When he approached the Jordan River, he used ‘his’ mantle just as Elijah had done to part the waters in order to cross over. He didn’t call upon the power of Elijah or the power that had been bestowed upon him. He didn’t feel the need to exercise his new authority or even to come up with his own methods, he did what he saw his mentor do and he called upon the God of Elijah. Yahweh was his God too, but he honoured his mentor and acknowledged his relationship with his old mentor and his new relationship standing with God. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;As a person Elisha was quite different from Elijah in that while Elijah was very much a solitary kind of figure, Elisha was often found in the company of other prophets &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 4:8-10)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;; he spent time with the elders of Samaria &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 6:32)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as well as the kings of Israel and on one occasion with the king of Judah. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 3:11)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;He travelled a good deal like his mentor and we know that he had his own home in Samaria &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 6:32)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;; he also had the use of the upper room in the home of the Shunemite woman whenever he was in that area. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 4:8-10)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Elisha was quite prepared to involve himself in his society and the general everyday dealings of life. He was committed to assisting his students when they needed help &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 6:1-4)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and it’s from this that we know he was committed to training other godly young men to be responsible prophets and leaders to declare the word of the Lord to their people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We know that there were eight major miracles performed by Elijah and we’ve just seen that God granted Elisha’s request for a double portion of Elijah’s spirit so what did that mean with regard to the things Elisha did? Well, Elisha performed sixteen major miracles and they were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;01 - He parted the Jordan River &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 2:13-14)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;02 - He cursed the teenagers who mocked him &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 2:23-25)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;03 - He healed the poisoned waters of Jericho &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 2:19-22)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;04 - He filled the widows vessels with oil &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 4:1-27)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;05 - The miraculous birth of a son by the Shunemite woman &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 4:8-17)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;06 - He raised from the dead the son of the Shunemite woman &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 4:18-37)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;07 - He healed the poisoned stew &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 4:38-44)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;08 - He fed 100 men with a small amount of food and provided leftovers as well &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 4:42-44)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;09 - He healed Naaman the Syrian from leprosy &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 5:1-14)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10 - He punished Gehazi with leprosy &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 5:15-27)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11 - He caused the sunken iron axe head to float on the water &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 6:1-7)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12 - He caused the trenches on the battlefield to flood &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 3:1-27)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;13 - He gave special sight to the kings messenger &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 6:16-17)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;14 - He blinded the Aramean army &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 6:8-18)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;15 - He restored the sight of the Aramean army &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 6:19-20)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;16 - A dead man was raised to life after his body was thrown onto the grave of Elisha &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 13:20-21)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ol&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Doing a quick Google search to get a comparative list of the miracles done by both the prophet’s Elijah and Elisha you quickly discover that different people have very diverse definitions of what constitutes a miracle. Some include all their prophecies but a prophecy doesn’t necessarily equal a miracle such as raising a dead body to life or multiplying food and oil. Regardless how one defines a miracle however, what is sure is that Elisha’s miracle count was twice that of Elijah thus validating and proving that God really did answer his request to receive a double portion of the spirit of his mentor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Next week we’ll take a closer look at a few of the specific miracles that Elijah did during his ministry years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

7686,Home Group Notes - Elijah Pt 2,"&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin-right: 8px; float: left;&quot; src=&quot;http://vision.org.au/images/blog_images/1058605_60297588 small.jpg&quot; height=&quot;201&quot; width=&quot;281&quot; /&gt;Elijah Part 2 (Ay-lay-yah or Ay-lay-yahu)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Last week we began looking at the life of the Prophet Elijah. Here’s a quick recap...(or see last week’s study notes on the Journey blog at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/the-journey&quot;&gt;www.vision.org.au/the-journey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Elijah’s story can be read in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 Kings 17, 18, 19, 21 &amp;amp; 2 Kings 1, 2, &amp;amp; 2 Chronicles 21.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He was a simple yet rough kind of man who lived simply and according to the old ways, he ate simply, wore animal skins and had a leather belt around his waist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His ministry life only spanned about twenty years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He was seriously zealous for the Lord.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He lived during the reign of King Ahab and Queen Jezebel and after then Ahaziah.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He did some amazing things and his ministry was defined by eight major miracles and we looked at just two of them last week, raising from the dead the son of the widow of Zarephath and the contest on Mt Carmel between Elijah and the prophets of Ba’al and Asherah.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This is where we pick up the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Elijah was a lone voice when he called the king, his people and their false religious system to the challenge on Mt Carmel and for the most part, Elijah probably felt like he was the only one of his nation who still loved God, he was seriously outnumbered but he obeyed the call of God. He stood alone on that mountain before his nation knowing he could pay with his life but he exposed the falsehood of their false religion and God showed Himself to be the One True God. The people responded and revival came to the land. It was a short lived revival to be sure, but it was a revival none the less and one man instigated it at God’s direction. Ba’al worship returned, but we have no way of knowing just how many Israelites were permanently saved from deception simply because of Elijah’s obedience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If you are called of God, don’t look at your situation and determine that your success or failure is dependent upon those around you or how many people you have on your side; your success or failure is determined by God alone. He’s the One you have to worry about. If you’ve never heard the story of Mr Genor on George Street in Sydney, can I encourage you to hear this story and be encouraged that whatever God has called you to do, your only responsibility is to obey God and leave the results to Him. Here’s the link...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ew1srubCw_0&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ew1srubCw_0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Elijah may have experienced some fear when he issued his challenge to the king, but the Scripture shows him being confident and even somewhat cheeky in how he related to the false prophets themselves. For all intents and purposes Elijah didn’t experience any fear during this challenge, so it’s really a surprise to see how Elijah reacted after this incredible display of God’s unmatched and unquestionable power. Queen Jezebel was so enraged over the slaughter of her false prophets that she sent a message to Elijah saying that within a 24 hour period, he would be as dead as all her prophets were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Elijah more than anyone knew God was all-powerful and could deal with this wicked woman, but her reputation was so huge, that Elijah literally ran for his life all the way to Beersheva which is a distance of about 165km from Mount Carmel (I checked on Google Earth), he literally crossed the border into the Southern Kingdom of Judah where he couldn’t be followed and caught and he was in a terrible state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;He left his servant at Beersheva and went even further into the wilderness and finally sat under a juniper tree and begged God to kill him; he’d had enough and he wanted to die. He probably thought that after such a powerful display against the false prophets of Ba’al and Asherah, real change would come to the nation starting with the king and his household, but what Elijah got was a death threat from the deadliest woman who ever lived and Elijah simply gave up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;He slept for a while (sheer exhaustion and strain would have finally taken their toll on him) and then an angel came to look after him, gave him food and drink and he slept again; the angel came a second time with more food and drink and it strengthened him so much that it sustained him for 40 days and nights and he set out on another long distance trek, but he didn’t make his way back home to Israel, to the place God had called him to prophesy and speak His words to the people, instead he travelled to Mt Horeb. This mountain is in Arabia, and this was a further 283km distance. Elijah ended up nearly 550km from his home in Israel and he was hiding in a cave in the backside of the Arabian wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God spoke to him and said, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What are you doing here, Elijah?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; You see God didn’t tell Elijah to run to this spot, it was all Elijah’s idea and this is where we come to see the flaws in Elijah’s character and he answered God this way...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 Kings 19:10, ‘He said, “I have been very zealous for the Lord, the God of hosts; for the sons of Israel have forsaken Your covenant, torn down Your altars and killed Your prophets with the sword. I alone am left; and they seek my life to take it away.”’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God was very patient with Elijah and told Him to stand on the mountain and the Lord would pass by him. This is extraordinary. A whirlwind, something like a hurricane that was breaking rocks into pieces went by, then an earthquake went by and then a fire went by. Three ‘natural disasters’ sent by God Himself, back to back, passed by Elijah for him to see. Was Elijah afraid? Not that we’re told, he simply stood there and watched as these events took place. God wasn’t in these things, but God was controlling these things and sent these things for a reason; to show Elijah that God is the One who controls all things...even the natural elements of the world around us. When these things had passed by there was a very quiet, gentle blowing, like a really soft breath of wind and Elijah wrapped his cloak around himself and stood at the entrance of the cave to hear what this last phenomenon was. And God spoke to him again...do you know what He said to him? &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What are you doing here, Elijah?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It was exactly the same message he’d received before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What is the lesson here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God had called Elijah to be His prophetic mouthpiece and Elijah was overcome with fear to the point of wanting to die. Elijah knew that God was the only True and Real God and Elijah had seen God’s power up close and personal, but Elijah had been completely sideswiped with the results that came against him after the contest on Mount Carmel. All Elijah could see was the terror and mayhem around him. When God sent the whirlwind, the earthquake and the fire, the noise and the chaos would have been phenominal and when that all stopped suddenly and there was barely a whisper of breeze, the quiet of the moment would have been ‘LOUD’...and he listened intently to hear God’s voice again very clearly ask, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What are you doing here, Elijah?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God didn’t take Elijah out into the backside of a desert wilderness to teach him how to hear the voice of God; Elijah had been hearing the voice of God very clearly for years and years; God was teaching Elijah that he didn’t need to fear the chaos and disaster that was going on all around him or even the death threats of a wicked woman, God was entirely in control of all that was taking place. All Elijah had to do was trust Him. Running out into the wilderness was not where God wanted Elijah. Hiding in a cave listening to a still small voice is not where God wanted Elijah...that’s why God asked him, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What are you doing here?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What was Elijah’s response? It was the same as the first response...woe is me...everyone’s against me and I’m the only one left who loves You. Woe is me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;How did God respond to him this time? He gave Elijah what he wanted. He told Elijah to head up to Damascus, he was given a couple of final tasks one of which was to anoint Elisha to be his successor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It wasn’t long after that, that God took Elijah up to heaven without tasting physical death and Elijah’s prophetic ministry was transferred to Elisha but Elijah hadn’t complete his mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This brings us to the doubly prophetic side of Elijah the prophet and his particular ministry...he is a forerunner of the Messiah. The Jews today set a place at every Passover table for Elijah, they have a cup of wine for Elijah and before the meal has finished, the youngest person at the table will open the front door in anticipation that Elijah just might be there. They believe from the Scriptures that before Messiah can come, Elijah must come first to prepare the way for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Now we know that John the Baptist was the forerunner for Messiah when He came the first time. John came in the spirit of Elijah and was the voice in the wilderness crying out for the people to get ready for the arrival of their Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;John was a rough diamond like Elijah, he wore camel skins and a leather belt, he ate locusts and wild honey, he lived a simple life according to the ‘old ways’ just like Elijah did. He preached a message of repentance and for the people to turn from wickedness and return to the Lord just like Elijah did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Unlike Elijah however, John completed his mission by pointing out the Messiah, calling Yeshua &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘The Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;John 1:29&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Not too long after Yeshua began His ministry, John’s ministry finished and he was executed. Mission complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We know that Messiah will come back a second time and before He does, Elijah will again be His forerunner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Revelation 11:3-6, ‘”And I will grant authority to My two witnesses, and they will prophesy for twelve hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.” These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth. And if anyone wants to harm them, fire flows out of their mouth and devours their enemies; so if anyone wants to harm them, he must be killed in this way. These have the power to shut up the sky, so that rain will not fall during the days of their prophesying; and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to strike the earth with every plague, as often as they desire.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This is talking about two individuals who will be prophetic witnesses during the last of the last days, they will be based in Jerusalem and they will boldly preach the Gospel and during their three and a half years of ministry, and tragically they will be despised. Some will attempt to kill them but these two prophets will have power to destroy their enemies by fire proceeding from their own mouths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Many but not all Bible scholars believe that these two men will be Moses and Elijah returned. Now Moses died on Mount Nebo but no one knew of his burial site so no ‘body’ was ever found. Elijah was taken up in a chariot and he never died. Moses’ mission to enter the promised land was cut short by his disobedience and Elijah’s mission was cut short by his self-pity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What’s interesting about these two men possibly being the two witnesses spoken of in Revelation 11 who will return during the final days of the Great Tribulation period is the characteristic behaviours they will display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;They will destroy their enemies with fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elijah called down fire from heaven to demonstrate that Yahweh was God and then destroyed 850 false prophets, he also called down fire on 102 men sent to capture him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;They will have power to shut the heavens so that no rain falls on the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elijah performed this miracle bringing a three year drought that almost destroyed Israel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;They will have power to turn the waters into blood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moses was given this power when he turned all the water in Egypt into blood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;They will have power to unleash plagues on the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moses brought in plagues to crush the Egyptians to force Pharaoh to let the Hebrews go free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In Rabbinical literature it’s believed that Elijah will play a vital role when the Messiah finally appears...&lt;em&gt;“His real Messianic activity – in some passages he is even called ‘go’el’ which means ‘kinsmen-redeemer’ – will commence three days before the coming of Messiah. On the first day he will lament over the devastation of Israel, but will close with the words: ‘Peace will now come over the earth’; on the second and third days he will speak words of comfort. When the archangel Michael blows the trumpet, Elijah will appear with the Messiah, whom he will present to the Jews. They will ask of Elijah, as an attestation of his mission, that he raise the dead before their eyes and revive such of the dead as they personally knew.’ &lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com&quot;&gt;www.jewishencyclopedia.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Non-Biblical and extra-Biblical literature is not inspired so we don’t base our theology on them, but what we learn from these additional sources show that the Scripture itself is the source of these teachings; they’re not made up out of thin air. Unlike most Jewish people today who don’t accept the New Testament as legitimate Scripture, believer’s in Yeshua have the benefit and wisdom from both the Old and New Testaments from which to base and build their theology with the Old and New reaffirming and confirming the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What is fascinating about this view for the Christian, is that we see this unfolding through both John the Baptist and Yeshua two thousand plus years ago. The Jews are living under judicial blindness at the moment, though there are currently more Jewish believers today than there was even at the birth of the church, and for those still living under this blindness, they wait with longing for the arrival of their Messiah and eagerly waiting for Elijah to come first. We however know that Messiah has already come and John the Baptist in the spirit or anointing of Elijah was the forerunner announcing Messiah’s imminent arrival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Messiah is getting ready to return again, and if the scholars are correct in their interpretation, this time Elijah will again be the forerunner and this next time will see all of national Israel saved at the arrival of the Messiah for the second time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Maranatha!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zechariah 12:10, “I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and supplication, so that they will look on Me whom they have pierced; and they will mourn for Him, as one mourns for an only son, and they will weep bitterly over Him like the bitter weeping over a firstborn.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

7608,Home Group Notes - Elijah Pt 1,"&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin-right: 8px; float: left;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/954634_94521374 small.jpg&quot; height=&quot;195&quot; width=&quot;293&quot; /&gt;Elijah Part 1 (Ay-lay-yah or Ay-lay-yahu)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Elijah’s name is a magnificent name. There are two main elements in this name, the first being ‘El’ which is an abbreviation for Elohim, a word that means ‘God’ or gods and the second element is ‘Jah’ which is God’s personal name, Yhwh (Yahweh). It’s believed that the name ‘Elijah’ means Yahweh is God...or from the personal perspective of the name holder, ‘Yahweh is my God’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This name personifies this Old Testament prophet because he lived his life declaring always through his words and his actions that he served Yahweh alone as his God and was a defender of Yahweh against the worshippers of false gods. It was because of his unwavering faithfulness to Yahweh that some assume that the name ‘Elijah’ wasn’t actually his given name but that he took this name upon himself because he wanted other’s to know he was a devoted servant of Yahweh. Scripture doesn’t say this however, it’s speculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Elijah’s story can be read in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;1 Kings 17, 18, 19, 21 &amp;amp; 2 Kings 1, 2, &amp;amp; 2 Chronicles 21&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Elijah lived during the last years of wicked king Ahab and queen Jezebel and during the very brief reign of king Ahaziah in the northern kingdom of Israel and he lived during the reign of king Jehoshaphat of Judah, the southern kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In many respects Elijah was the first prophet of Israel from the beginning of the monarchy even though Moses, Samuel and David are also very much confirmed as prophets, but as far as the history of Israel as a nation in the land during the reign of the Jewish monarchs, Elijah was the first prophet. To be sure there were always prophets who spoke the word of the Lord during Israel’s history, but not all became so notable as to have books written by or for them and what they spoke. So of the Biblical prophets, Elijah was the first ‘main’ prophet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Elijah the Tishbite gets this title either from the town he came from or from a family member with the name ‘Tishbe’; some think he hailed from a town within the boundaries of the tribe of Naphtali in the Galilee, while others believe he was from the east of the Jordan River because he’s described as being one of the settlers of Gilead and Gilead is situated in the tribal allotment of Dan which is east of the Jordan. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(1 Kings17:1)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;He lived very much according to the ‘old customs’ and presented himself in simple attire...a mantle of animal skins and a leather belt. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;(2 Kings 1:8)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;As an individual he was quite rough and ready, he didn’t carry a lot of ‘airs and graces’ - he wasn’t of the refined social set. He was what Aussies would call ‘a rough diamond’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Elijah had a dramatic start to his prophetic ministry and he was very enthusiastic about what God called him to do, though he was equally cautious. Being a prophet during the historical centuries of Biblical Israel was a dangerous vocation that saw the vast majority of God’s prophets killed in some very unpleasant ways. So Elijah always obeyed God but he didn’t hang around in public, he hid most of the time to avoid capture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Elijah’s ministry was marked by some remarkable miracles, in fact there were 8 distinct miracles. (Some like to say there were more but that list becomes a bit of a stretch with some events not really being classed as miracles).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He shut up the heavens to usher in a drought to show that God was very angry with the idolatry in the land of Israel. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(1 Kings 17:1)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While hiding from a furious king Ahab, he hid at the brook Cherith and God used ravens to provide him with bread and meat every morning and evening. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(1 Kings 17:3-7)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the brook dried up, God directed him to a widow in Zarephath, Sidon who would provide him with food. She only had a handful of flour and a tiny amount of oil to make one last meal for herself and her son. She obeyed the word of the Lord and made food first for Elijah and this resulted in her oil and flour multiplying until the end of the drought; this kept them all alive. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(1 Kings 17:9-16)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The woman’s son died of a severe sickness, Elijah prayed for the dead boy and the Lord raised him back to life. This was a powerful witness and testimony to the widow who was a pagan...a non-Jew!!! &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(1 Kings 17:17-24)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elijah called down fire from heaven to destroy 450 prophets of Ba’al and 400 prophets of Asherah on Mt Carmel. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(1 Kings 18:7-40)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elijah prayed seven times for the drought to break, and eventually he saw a cloud the size of a man’s hand and the heavens opening bringing drought breaking rain. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(1 Kings 18:45)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elijah called down fire from heaven twice upon a total of 102 soldiers sent against him by Ahab. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 1:1-18)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elijah parted the Jordan River. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 2:8)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;King Ahab hated him and called him a ‘troubler of Israel’ because of the drought...as though Israel’s problems were all Elijah’s fault. God was using the drought to get their attention because God hated their idolatry, something He’d told the people He would do to them before they’d even set one foot into their promised land. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deuteronomy 28:1-14&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; lists all the blessings they would live under at God’s hand if they obeyed Him and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;Deuteronomy 28:15-68&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;lists all the curses they would live under if they disobeyed Him. Then in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deuteronomy 29&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; God through Moses, tells the people that the disobedience He’s referring to that will bring these dreadful curses upon them is in forsaking God and His ways and embracing the practices and worship of false gods and paganism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Elijah had the unenviable job of being the messenger reminding King Ahab of God’s promise of bringing curses upon His people for their wickedness and idolatry and like most human beings on the planet, Ahab refuses to take responsibility for his own sin and tries to place the blame on Elijah, thus calling him the ‘troubler of Israel’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It’s amazing how people will place blame onto righteous men and women of God when they bravely confront the sin they see in society; society in turn reacts with venom and promptly lays the blame at the feet of the righteous declaring them to be ‘haters’ and ‘judgemental bigots’ and ‘Pharisees’ and ‘hypocrites’. No one wants to take responsibility today, we would rather hide behind pop psychology and blame our mothers for not potty training us correctly, or our fathers for not boosting our self esteem enough or our cousins or uncles or aunties or neighbours or school teachers...anyone but ourselves...and this is a fallen human trait in both ancient and modern eras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Elijah’s ministry life was very short, from 870-850 BC and he’s renowned for his zeal for God. Elijah’s ministry and life is also very prophetic because he is believed to be the one who will be the forerunner of the Messiah which we will look at more closely next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We can take a brief look at a couple of really significant things that he did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin-left: 8px; float: right;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/hg fun.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Home Group Fun with Steve's Biblical Timeline Chart&quot; title=&quot;Home Group Fun with Steve's Biblical Timeline Chart&quot; class=&quot;caption&quot; height=&quot;248&quot; width=&quot;336&quot; /&gt;Elijah is the only man of God to raise someone from the dead besides the Lord Jesus. The widow of Zarephath who fed Elijah during the drought when he was in hiding had a son and despite her acceptance of and care for the prophet and God’s supernatural provision for them, her son became very, very sick and died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;All people grieve over the loss of a loved one and ask the ‘WHY?’ questions, but this widow’s response is very interesting, this is what she said to Elijah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 Kings 17:18, ‘So she said to Elijah, “What do I have to do with you, O man of God? You have come to me to bring my iniquity to remembrance and to put my son to death!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We don’t like to call sin ‘sin’! We would rather call sin a ‘problem’ or an ‘issue’ or a ‘challenge’...but don’t call it ‘sin’. This widow was a Gentile...a pagan Gentile and she wasn’t a convert to Judaism. She had probably heard about the God of the Jews but she didn’t know the God of the Jews. One day, Elijah the prophet of Yahweh turns up on her doorstep...the very day she knows she’s going to cook her last meal for herself and her son and that after this, they’re both going to die of starvation because of the drought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;She’s got nothing to lose when Elijah asks her to give him a small cake of food first and wonder of wonders, the God of the Jews miraculously multiplies her flour and oil and this keeps them all alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;But it’s not possible to be in the presence of God and not recognise that He is pure and holy and we are sinful and wretched. When her son dies of a dreadful sickness, this woman is acutely aware of her sinful condition and the consequence of sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sin exacts a great cost in every human life whether we acknowledge it or not, in fact sin is the most expensive thing in the whole universe as well as the most destructive.The shocking thing about our fallen human nature is that we crave and run after the very thing that will destroy us! Thank God for Yeshua and His willingness to pay our debt and reconcile us to the Father!!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;She’s a pagan and she acknowledges sin for what it is and the consequences of it. But her grief has made her wish that Elijah had never come to her at all. In that moment of despair, she would have preferred ignorance over guilt because she knows she’s responsible for her sin. But Elijah calls upon the Lord and he took her son to an upstairs bedroom and prayed to God. He stretched himself out on the boy three times and God revived him to life again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What this did for the widow is incredible. She didn’t just believe in the man of God, she now knew that the God of the Jews was the One True God. If God can raise a dead person to life again, He can forgive sins and wash a person clean. Only a God with power over death has power over sin and can bring forgiveness and redemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Yeshua did something similar when He forgave the sins of the paralytic and the religious leaders questioned Him because of this; they said that only God had the authority to forgive sins...so Yeshua proceeded to heal the man’s physical body...something only God can do...proving Himself to be God and therefore absolutely able to forgive sins. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Mark 2:10; Luke 5:24; Matt 9:6)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Another really amazing thing that Elijah did was to utterly humiliate and destroy the false prophets of Baal and Asherah – 850 false priests/prophets in total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;He challenged them before the nation...calling the nation to return to God and turn away from their paganism. He called the false priests and all Israel to Mt Carmel for a contest between Ba’al and Yahweh. The challenge was this: Both Elijah and the false prophets would build and altar and place a bull for sacrifice upon it. They would then call upon their respective deities to send fire from heaven to consume the sacrifices. The deity that actually did respond with fire would be the true deity and therefore the people would know which deity they should worship. Everyone agreed to this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Elijah let the false prophets go first and gave them hours to call upon their false god Ba’al to respond. They danced around, called out to him...&lt;em&gt;”Oh Ba’al hear us”&lt;/em&gt;...Elijah watched the spectacle with both disgust and amusement and even mocked them during their rituals and said things like, “maybe he’s busy...maybe he’s on a trip somewhere...maybe he’s sleeping...maybe he’s on the toilet”...and this only drove them into greater frenzy...so much so that they cut themselves with swords and lances until the blood was gushing from them. This is a gruesome scene and they did this for a whole day...from morning until the time of the evening sacrifice. Ba’al did not answer and the people had completely lost confidence in them. No one paid them anymore attention despite the spectacle they were giving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Then Elijah said to the people, &lt;em&gt;“Come near to me”&lt;/em&gt; and they did. He then repaired the altar of the Lord that had been pulled down, it was made of twelve stones, one for each of the tribes of Israel, he dug an enormous trench around the perimeter of the altar, he put wood on the altar and then killed an ox and cut it in pieces and put it on the altar as well. Then he told some of the men there to get four large pitchers or jars of water and pour it all over the altar. He told them to do this three times...that’s a total of twelve large pitchers of water that left the alter, the wood and the ox saturated and the trench completely filled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Elijah didn’t perform any rituals, he didn’t dance around or cut himself, he didn’t act anything out as a sign or symbol, he simply prayed out loud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 Kings 18:36-37, ‘”O Lord, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, today let it be known that You are God in Israel and that I am Your servant and I have done all these things at Your word. Answer me, O Lord, answer me, that this people may know that You O Lord, are God, and that You have turned their heart back again.”’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Elijah gave God all the glory, all the honour, he asked for none for himself, he simply wanted God to confirm that he was only acting on God’s instructions and to prove it by answering with fire. And answer He did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Fire came down from heaven in an instant and it consumed the ox, the wood, the stones and the all the water that was in the trench. There was nothing left to look at but an enormous empty scorched hole in the ground. And the people fell on their faces in fear and readily acknowledged that Yahweh, the God of their fathers was the One True God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;At this point Elijah commanded the people to seize the false prophets, all 850 of them and to kill them all at the brook Kishon near the base of Mt Carmel. A gruesome event to be sure and it led to an interesting chapter in Elijah’s ministry life. Next week we’ll look at what happened and how Elijah is incredibly intertwined with the return of the Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What we learn from Elijah is that obedience to God doesn’t mean we’ll be popular or even welcome. Standing for righteousness comes at a cost, and in Elijah’s case the cost was living under the threat of death on a daily basis. We have our challenges in the West, but we have family all around the world who live under the threat of death for their faith in Christ every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Let's commit to keeping our family in Australia and around the world in prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

7504,Home Group Notes - Ezekiel,"&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin-right: 8px; float: left;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/575231_55762839 small.jpg&quot; height=&quot;219&quot; width=&quot;292&quot; /&gt;Ezekiel (yekh-ez-kal)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This name is made up of two elements, the last element is ‘El’ which is a common abbreviation of the name of the Lord, ‘Elohim’ while the first element, ‘hazaq’ means to be or become strong or courageous. It’s mostly used to charge soldiers to be strong. So Ezekiel means ‘God Strengthens’, ‘Strengthened by God’ or ‘Strength of God’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This name is especially appropriate for Ezekiel because his message to his people made him extremely unwanted, unwelcome and unpopular and without God strengthening him for his mission it would have been particularly difficult to endure all he went through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The story of Ezekiel can be found in all &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;48 chapters of the book of Ezekiel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; written by the Ezekiel himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Ezekiel lived during the lifetimes of the prophet Daniel during the reign of King Zedekiah of Judah...who also happened to be the last king of Judah and also during the last half of the prophet Jeremiah’s life, and Ezekiel lived during the Babylonian exile. He began his prophetic ministry in the 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; year of King Jehoiachin’s captivity in Babylon, remembering that this king was so terribly wicked God pronounced a blood curse on his family line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Ezekiel saw the destruction of both Jerusalem and the magnificent Temple built by King Solomon and was part of the first Jewish contingency to be deported to Babylon at the beginning of the 70 year exile that had been prophesied by the prophet Jeremiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;The Role of a Prophet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The primary task of a prophet was to arouse the people and the government to repentance and observance of God’s laws. This invariably meant that their messages were mostly in the form of a rebuke that not only listed the sins of the people in detail and God’s abhorrence to them, but their messages also included details of how judgement would come to them if they didn’t repent and return to the Lord and His ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Many see God in the Old Testament as brutal and harsh and vengeful, but when you consider how many years God took to warn His people and how long He gave them to repent, you actually come away with the understanding that despite the depravity and rebellion of the people, God waited many hundreds of years before He finally brought promised judgement. God in the Old Testament is in fact incredibly gracious and patient and merciful. The culmination of His mercy is ultimately seen at the cross of Calvary. This picture of God’s enormous mercy is very dramatically seen if you read from Genesis right through to the end of the Gospels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Because prophets had a reputation for always bringing a message of rebuke and judgement they were very often feared by the people because nobody likes to get bad news especially if it means they have to stop living and behaving the way they want to. The message of repentance is still unpopular today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;An example of how the people feared the arrival of a prophet is seen in the lead up to the calling and anointing of David when God instructed Samuel to go to the house of Jesse in Bethlehem and anoint one of his sons to be the next king of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 Samuel 16:4-5, ‘So Samuel did what the Lord said, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the city came trembling to meet him and said, “Do you come in peace?” He said, “In peace; I have come to sacrifice to the Lord....”’.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The leaders of the people of Bethlehem went to meet with Samuel as he arrived in their village to find out if he was coming to them with a fearful message and intention or a peaceful message and intention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Ezekiel was 25 years old when he was taken captive and he was 30 when he was called into the ministry which is the traditional age for Jewish men to enter ministry service. His ministry began in either 593 or 592 BC and his ministry lasted approximately 22 years and just like Jeremiah and Zechariah, Ezekiel was both and prophet and a priest, in fact he was in the Zadok family line and this meant he was among the aristocracy whom king Nebuchnezzar selected as his first captives...these noble Israelites included the prophet Daniel and his friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Ezekiel was a married man as was the case for the priests and he lived among other Jewish exiles near Tel-Abib on the River Chebar and he lived in his own house. He was considered to be wise by the Jewish elders and they often visited him wanting a divine word or oracle because Ezekiel was remember, of good family lineage and in the priestly line. His was a special position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;As a prophet and priest he belonged to a privileged segment of the Jewish community and he lived in a strategic time in history because he was able to refer back to previous prophetic announcements by the prophet Jeremiah who warned the Jews of impending judgement and exile if they didn’t repent of their wickedness and he could also point to the fulfilment of those prophecies because they themselves were actually living in exile after they’d been taken captive just as Jeremiah had said they would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Jewish monarchy and government had been annihilated by the Babylonians, the Jewish political and national life was over as far as their independent national identity was concerned, their city and state was ransacked and their Temple was utterly destroyed. This was the situation Ezekiel himself was living in when God called him to be a prophetic voice to his people living in and under Babylonian rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Ezekiel had the unenviable task of communicating to his countrymen that they didn’t need to despair, God wasn’t through with them...unfortunately, to his countrymen it appeared that God was indeed through with them. Ezekiel had to try to communicate that God and His sovereignty had lead them to Babylon because of their sin and disobedience but that through His sovereignty God would restore them once again but this would occur through the repentance of the people themselves. Once again, this was a call for personal and individual repentance before God and submission to His laws and ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What makes Ezekiel so very different to other prophets is that he strived to reach his countrymen in very personal and individual ways, he desperately wanted to win them back to the Lord and he felt personally responsible for each one of them. His focus was never on establishing the nation with political goals and aspirations, rather Ezekiel’s hope was for his people to become a congregation under the pure dominion of God one heart at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Another unique aspect of Ezekiel’s ministry was through various physical signs that he endured, experienced or acted out in order to communicate his message from God to the people. These signs included...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;He was bound up, made housebound, mute &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(3:23-27)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;He used a brick and an iron plate as preaching illustrations &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(4:1-3)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;He laid on his left side for 390 days and on his right side for 40 days &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(4:4-8)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;He had to eat food in an unclean manner &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(4:9-17)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;He had to shave his head and beard &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(5:1-4)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;He had to pack his bags and dig through the wall of Jerusalem &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(12:1-14)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;He had to eat bread with trembling and drink water with quivering &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(12:17-20)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;He had to brandish a sharp sword and strike his hands together &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(21:8-17)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;He portrayed Israel in the smelting furnace &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(22:17-22)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;He had to cook a pot of stew &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(24:1-14)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;He was not allowed to mourn the death of his wife &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(24:15-24)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;He had to be mute for a season &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(24:25-27)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;He had to put two sticks together that became one &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(37:15-28)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Above all, the central theme in all that Ezekiel says and does is the ‘Glory of the Lord’; this is seen very graphically in chapters &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1:28, 3:12 &amp;amp; 23, 10:4 &amp;amp; 18, 11:23, 43:4 &amp;amp; 5, 44:4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Ezekiel includes graphic descriptions of the disobedience of both Israel and Judah despite God’s kindness, patience and long-suffering warnings which He gave again and again and again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Ezekiel gives many illustrations of spiritual principles, a few of them are...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Ezekiel was told to eat the scroll:- even though the writing on the scroll was full of lamentations, mourning and woe it was sweet in the prophet’s mouth because it was the Word of God Himself which is a light and always produces life. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Ezek 2&amp;amp;3) &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The four creatures representing the 12 Tribes of Israel which is again repeated in the book of Revelation. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;(Ezek 1:4-21; Rev 4:5-11)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The ‘barbershop’ scene where the prophet shaves his head and beard to demonstrate the humiliation his people will face because of their rebellion. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Ezek 5:1-4)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The graffiti on the Temple walls demonstrating that God wants holiness and purity in His house on filthiness and depravity. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Ezek 8:10-12)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Another primary theme throughout the book is God’s holiness and sovereignty, something the Israelites had completely forgotten in their efforts to live as they pleased. Ezekiel communicated this truth to the people by contrasting God’s holiness and purity as bright glory against the despicable depravity of Judah’s sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Like all the prophets of Israel, Ezekiel not only delivered God’s messages of anger, frustration and judgement on His people because of their rebellion, idolatry and stubbornness, but Ezekiel also delivered God’s promise of forgiveness, restoration and fulfilment of their calling and covenants especially with relation to the land and heritage He’d promised them unconditionally through Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and later on through David. God never left His people without hope of their promised future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;One of the final major themes found in Ezekiel is in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;chapters 40-48&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and these all pertain to the future Temple in Jerusalem. The dimensions and elements of this final temple are markedly different from the original Temple built by Solomon and the second Temple built by Zerubbabel but which was later expanded and finished by Herod the Great. This final Temple will be built and will be functional from which Messiah will reign when He returns to establish righteousness upon the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Of course all the messages that Ezekiel was commissioned to speak to his countrymen came at great personal cost to the prophet because the people were unwilling to hear him and many times God forewarned Ezekiel that upon delivering his message the people would tie him up with ropes, imprison him, hate him, reject him...and this of course broke the heart of the prophet who desperately loved his own people, he loved God supremely and his greatest desire was to see his people reconciled to their God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Possibly one of the saddest and hardest things Ezekiel had to endure was the death of his beloved wife. Hard enough for any man (or woman) to lose their best friend and life partner, but in Ezekiel’s case, God instructed him that he wasn’t to grieve for her. He could grieve and groan inwardly, but he wasn’t to show any outward signs of grief or mourning. This is a very, very big ask by God of a man who loved Him supremely. What was the purpose of God asking such a thing? God was illustrating through Ezekiel’s personal tragedy that His people were not to grieve over the loss of their holy city and their holy Temple because they had become exceedingly corrupted and God was going to do away with them...for a time. God would eventually restore these things to them, but what had become filthy and polluted had to be destroyed and the people themselves were responsible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It’s not possible to talk about the prophet Ezekiel without mentioning three incredibly important chapters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The first of these being &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;chapter 37: The Valley of Dry Bones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This chapter is a graphic description of the destruction of the Jewish people; the valley God showed to Ezekiel was full of dead bodies all reduced to very, very dry scattered bones. This was a people dead and without hope and yet God determined that they would live once more. He told Ezekiel to prophesy to the bones and when he did, he heard a noise, a rattling noise and all the bones came together and then sinews formed on the bones followed by new flesh and skin but they were still laying dead in the valley. They were reformed, but dead! Then Ezekiel continued to prophesy and the breath of God filled them, they stood upright and came to life and they became an exceedingly great army. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(37:1-10)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ezekiel 37:11-12, ‘Then He said to me, “Son of man, these bones are the &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;whole house of Israel&lt;/span&gt;; behold, they say, ‘Our bones are dried up and our hope has perished. We are completely cut off.’ Therefore prophesy and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God, “Behold, I will open your graves and cause you to come up our of your graves, &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;My people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel&lt;/span&gt;.”’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What’s interesting is that after the Babylonian exile, the Jews were not utterly destroyed and without hope and when they did return, they never ruled themselves as an independent sovereign nation, they were always under the rule of another nation or empire, and they were never an exceedingly great army. Not until after the catastrophe of the Nazi Holocaust when the Jewish people returned to their ancient homeland after being destroyed and left for dead and once the State of Israel was established in 1948, they developed an army that has been undefeatable despite the many invasions and attacks by their &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COMBINED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; enemies. This is a stunning fulfilled prophesy from Ezekiel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The other two chapters which are probably the most famous chapters in Ezekiel are&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;chapters 38 &amp;amp; 39&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;These chapters are yet future and they describe what has become known as the Battle of Gog and Magog. They describe a time yet future when Israel will be living in a relatively peaceful state, specifically when the will be without walls or unwalled villages. It also describes the land as being wealthy and bountiful and God Himself draws Israel’s ancient enemies out against her; these enemy nations think they’re going to invade and take Israel and her wealth as plunder for themselves but God has determined to personally fight against Israel’s enemies to destroy them once and for all as a judgement against them for all their hatred and mistreatment of Israel throughout their history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;These chapters are graphic in how the battles unfold and it names the nation’s who come against Israel, and its during this battle that Israel realises that she can’t defend herself with her own army, she realises that she must call upon God for her deliverance or she won’t survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There are many who believe that this famed battle of Gog and Magog is very close at hand. Time will tell. &lt;img src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/plugins/editors/jce/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/img/smiley-wink.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Wink&quot; title=&quot;Wink&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Being a prophet was a high calling but equally a lonely calling and always a dangerous calling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There is little known about Ezekiel’s death, in fact there are no details of how he died but we do know that his grave is in Al Kifl in Iraq, south of Bagdad near the Euphrates River...Iraq of course is the modern name of Ancient Babylon. Ezekiel was buried in the land to which he was exiled during the siege and fall of Jerusalem when Judah was invaded and subjugated by King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Many of Ezekiel’s prophecies have come to pass, those that haven’t are yet future but what we know for certain is that all of God’s words of warning, judgement, promise and restoration will come to pass because God’s word cannot fail...ever!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ezekiel 39:25-29, ‘Therefore thus says the Lord God, “Now I will restore the fortunes of Jacob and have mercy on the whole house of Israel; and I will be jealous for My holy name. They will forget their disgrace and all their treachery which they perpetrated against Me, when they live securely on their own land with no one to make them afraid. When I bring them back from the peoples and gather them from the lands of their enemies, then I shall be sanctified through them in the sight of the many nations. Then they will know that I am the Lord their God because I made them go into exile among the nations and then gathered them again to their own land; and I will leave none of them there any longer. I will not hide My face from them any longer, for I will have poured out My Spirit on the house of Israel,” declares the Lord God.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

7316,Home Group Notes - Jehoiachin,"&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin-right: 8px; float: left;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/724407_24295926 small.jpg&quot; height=&quot;233&quot; width=&quot;311&quot; /&gt;King Jehoiachin (also known as Jeconiah or Coniah)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Two elements make us this name, ‘Yah’ meaning the name of the Lord, Yahweh. The second element can have several meanings, the first could mean ‘to bring something into being with a consequence that its existence is a certainty’ indicating steadfastness; it could mean a place, something that was established.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Other’s believe that Jehoiachin means either ‘He will be established by the Lord’ or ‘Yahweh is firm, enduring’. However knowing that God had already stated emphatically to Josiah that wrath was an absolute certainty because of the wickedness of the kings of Judah, it seems far more believable that God was going to bring wrath and judgement into being as a consequence for the sins of Judah and that this impending judgement was a certainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The story of Jehoiachin can be found in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 Kings 24 &amp;amp; 25, 2 Chronicles 36, Jeremiah 52&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;After Josiah died, Judah came under the subjugation of Egypt, his son Jehoahaz took the throne and ruled for a monumental 3 month period, he was a wicked man who displeased Pharaoh Neco who had him imprisoned and he never returned to Judah. Neco made Eliakim (Josiah’s other son) king instead and changed his name to Jehoiakim. He was 25 years old and he reigned for only 11 years and Judah was required to pay tribute to Pharaoh Neco. Jehoiakim was also very wicked and it was toward the end of his rule that Babylon began its rise to power. Nebuchadnezzar took the throne of Babylon and overthrew the dominion of the Egyptians and when Jehoiakim rebelled against Babylon’s domination over Judah, Nebuchadnezzar marched against Judah and that was the end of Jehoiakim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Upon Jehoiakim’s death, his son Jehoiachin took the throne of Judah. He was 18 years old and he ruled for only 3 months. Not a lot is stated about what he actually did...although we know he followed the ways of his wicked forefathers...so that meant his exploits included the murder of innocents, idol worship, pagan sacrifice, immorality and depravity...but his depravity far exceed that of his forbears...and he was only in power for 3 months!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God was so fed up with the sins of this people and most especially with the sins of the leaders of His people; when Jehoiachin took the throne and sinned like he did, God drew a line in the sand so to speak and issued a damning judgement upon him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jeremiah 22:24-30, ‘”As I live,” declares the Lord, “even though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were a signet ring on My right hand, yet I would pull you off; and I will give you over into the hand of those who are seeking your life, yes, into the hand of those whom you dread, even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and into the hand of the Chaldeans. I will hurl you and your mother who bore you into another country where you were not born, and there you will die. But as for the land to which they desire to return, they will not return to it. Is this man Coniah a despised, shattered jar? Or is he an undesirable vessel? Why have he and his descendants been hurled out and cast into a land that they have not known? O land, land, land, hear the word of the Lord!” Thus says the Lord, “Write this man down childless, a man who will not prosper in his days; for no man of his descendants will prosper sitting on the throne of David or ruling again in Judah.”’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Ok, this is really bad news, because this is the kingly line of David from which the Messiah was supposed to come from and then to rule and reign from David’s throne. God just placed a blood curse on this man and all his descendants making them ineligible to rule as Sovereign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Jehoiachin went into Babylonian captivity and he and his descendants died there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This has left a whopping great big problem now...how do we get a legitimate Messiah and heir to the throne of David from his direct bloodline if there is now a curse on that bloodline? The Messiah cannot be tainted by a blood curse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Matthew 1 lists Jehoiachin (Jeconiah/Coniah) in Yeshua’s genealogy and this provides legal proof of the lineage Joseph, the adoptive father of Yeshua. Here we have an established direct legal bloodline connection to the throne of David through the kingly line. But...this bloodline is tainted now because of the curse God placed on Jehoiachin stating that no child of this man’s descendant’s would sit on the throne of David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The genealogy of Yeshua listed in Luke 3 however, takes the bloodline through David’s son Nathan rather than Solomon and then down to Mary’s father Heli who apparently had no sons only daughters. So both Mary and Joseph were of the tribe of Judah and were direct descendants of David...Joseph on the cursed side through Jehoiachin and Mary on the non-cursed side through Nathan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Luke 3:23, ‘When He began His ministry, Jesus Himself was about thirty years of age, being, as was supposed, &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;the son of Joseph, the son of Heli.&lt;/span&gt;’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;But there’s an added twist. Matthew’s genealogy lists Joseph’s biological father as Jacob...Mary’s father was Heli...so which is it? This brings us to a SERIOUSLY important law that was instituted during the days of Moses...enter the Daughters of Zelephohad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Numbers 26&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; we read the laws regarding inheritance which insisted that land and property were always handed down to the sons in order to keep the land within families and more importantly within tribes. Women marry and join other families and change their names, so land inheritance had to be maintained through the males to ensure land wasn’t ultimately lost to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;However, there was a man named Zelephohad and he only had daughters; the girls approached Moses and basically said that because there were no male heirs in their family, their land would be completely lost altogether if they – the daughters – couldn’t inherit. So Moses sought God’s about what needed to be done about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The law was extended allowing daughters to inherit so long as they married within their own tribe so that the land would be retained...and their husbands would be ‘adopted’ as sons into their family in order to maintain the family line and inheritance. The husband’s didn’t stop exit or leave their own family lines, they were simply legally adopted into their wife’s family as well to protect the family inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This is what happened with Joseph...Heli adopted Joseph which is why he was listed as Heli’s son in Luke’s genealogy and this has stunning implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Joseph wasn’t Yeshua’s biological father which meant that Yeshua didn’t have tainted human blood flowing through His veins, but because his step father was in the direct lineage of the kings of Judah, Yeshua has legal legitimacy to be the king of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Both his biological mother and his step father who was adopted into His maternal bloodline...a non-cursed maternal bloodline, gave Yeshua a curse-free direct ancestry to King David doubling His legitimate claim of being the king of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Because He was conceived by the Holy Spirit, His Father had to be God making Him the absolute ruler and King of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;On all points, Yeshua is the One and Only legitimate King of Israel and this is why Jehoiachin is so important as is the blood curse placed upon him. There could be no physical connection between any wicked king and the Messiah or Messiah would be a corrupted human being like the rest of us...yet He had to have legitimate connection via bloodline. He got this through His mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;At every point since the day God called Abraham, up to the birth of Yeshua, the odds have been 100% against the line of Messiah being fulfilled...satan has tried time and time again to wipe out the line of Messiah, wicked men have brought curses, wrath and judgement upon themselves and the people, enemies have worked endlessly to wipe out the Jews as the people of God and God Himself has cursed wicked Jewish leaders for their sin and rebellion and yet despite all this, GOD has seen to it that His Word has never failed, His plans have come to pass and His Son came to earth to be the Messiah for His people Israel and for the Gentile world fulfilling every requirement and criteria exactly as God said He would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The wicked kings of Israel and Judah destroyed their nation, sent them into exile and after their return to Judah they never had a king of their own to rule over them again. They were longing for their Messiah and this was God’s promise to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Isaiah 9:1-7, ‘But there will be no more gloom for her who was in anguish; in earlier times He treated the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali with contempt, but later on He shall make it glorious, by the way of the sea on the other side of Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles. The people who walk in darkness will see a great light; those who live in a dark land, the Light will shine on them. You shall multiply the nation, You shall increase their gladness of harvest, as men rejoice when they divide the spoil. For You shall break the yoke of their burden and the staff on their shoulders, the rod of their oppressor, as at the battle of Midian. For every boot of the booted warrior in the battle tumult, and cloak rolled in blood, will be for burning fuel for the fire. For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us; and the government will rest on His shoulders; and &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;His name will be called Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace. &lt;/span&gt;There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace, on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness from then on and forevermore. The zeal of the Lord of Hosts will accomplish this.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This prophetic passage tells very clearly where Messiah would come from, that the people were living in darkness and in desperate need of a Messiah who would redeem and restore them bringing great light and deliverance to them;&amp;nbsp; that He would be born a physical human being...so He would be a ‘man’, but the titles given Him in this prophecy also declare Messiah to be God Himself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This is why Messiah had to be born of a woman – making Him human – but without an earthly father so He would bypass the hereditary sinful blood handed down to us by Adam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Messiah was fully human and fully God...just as the Scriptures foretold.&lt;/p&gt;

7302,Home Group Notes - Josiah,"&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin-right: 8px; float: left;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/1058605_60297588 small.jpg&quot; height=&quot;239&quot; width=&quot;336&quot; /&gt;King Josiah (yo’she’ya’hu)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The name Josiah is made up of two elements. ‘Jah’ is an abbreviated form of the Tetragrammaton:- the Name of the Lord: YHWH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The origin of the first part of Josiah however isn’t clear. It looks exactly the same as the verb ‘ya’ash’ which means to despair which means Josiah could mean, ‘The despair of Yahweh’, however, it could also be from the word ‘‘oshya’ which means buttress or pillar which would mean Josiah may mean ‘Yahweh Supports’. &amp;nbsp;But...this words is almost the same and ‘ashah’ which means ‘give’ and this could mean that Josiah means ‘Given of the Lord’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;More recent sources which believe Josiah means ‘Yahweh heals’ because they believe the name Josiah is imported from another language that uses the verb ‘rapa’ which in the Hebrew is ‘Rapha’ which means heal or healer and this has become the commonly held meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Names in the Bible are very important and were given with purpose so I lean toward ‘Yahweh Supports’ and or ‘Given of the Lord’ with regard to the meaning of Josiah because these meanings are borne out in his life, I also lean toward these meanings because God named Josiah before he was even born detailing what he would do in his life to honour God and oppose apostasy and this demonstrates that Josiah was indeed given of the Lord and supported by the Lord in fulfilling his specific calling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The story of Josiah is found in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 Kings 21, 22 &amp;amp; 23; 2 Chronicles 33, 34 &amp;amp; 35.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It’s interesting that the reign of Josiah was actually prophesied in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 Kings 13:1-2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; when a man of God spoke against Jeroboam because of his wickedness in setting up pagan altars. The man of God said;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘”...O altar, altar, thus says the Lord, ‘Behold, a son shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name; and on you he shall sacrifice the priests of the high places who burn incense on you, and human bones shall be burned on you.”’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This ‘man of God’ said that a man by the name of Josiah who was of the kingly line of David would destroy the paganism that Jeroboam had established and that the false priests themselves would die on those very altars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This is the how Josiah came to fulfil that prophetic word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;After Manasseh died his son Amon became king of Judah. Amon didn’t follow the ways of his father who repented and turned to God at the latter end of his life, rather, he followed the ways of his father at the first part of his life when he was a raging pagan and murderer. Amon was 22 when he came to the throne and he only ruled for 2 years but he was hated by his own servants...so much so that they conspired against him and killed him. The people were furious at such treason and in turn killed the conspirators and proceeded to make Amon’s son Josiah king over Judah. Josiah was the ripe old age of 8 when he became king. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 21:18-22:1)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Now Josiah did what was right in the eyes of the Lord and &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 Kings 22:2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; says he walked in the ways of his father ‘David’ and wouldn’t deviate one way or the other. His father Amon walked in the ways of Manasseh but Josiah walked in the ways of David. Josiah may very well have been a student of history...his personal family history, a young man who studied the lives of his forebears and this is why he behaved the way he did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The prophecy given to Jeroboam specifically said would be born of the ‘...house of David...’ and true to that prophecy, Josiah is associated with David specifically rather than Amon or Manasseh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;He had been king of Judah for 10 years, following the example of his great grandfather David, he was just a boy in many respects, and would have relied heavily on his adult advisors...but still, it was 10 years before Josiah sent Shaphan, the son of a well known Scribe to the house of the Lord...the Temple. The Temple had been allowed to fall into disrepair and had pretty much been deserted and Josiah wanted it opened up, cleaned up, repaired and restored to back to working and functional order. Money had been collected from the people for this task and builders were put to work to get the Temple up and running once more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In the process of the cleanup, the Priest Hilkiah told Shaphan the Scribe that he’d found the Book of the Law of God. Shaphan the Scribe immediately took it to Josiah and read the entire thing out loud to him. Josiah’s response is shocking...he tore his clothes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Rending of garments was a demonstration of intense grief...in fact the practice is still done today (with a great deal of criteria and regulations) and it’s primarily done when a loved one dies. It’s signifying ‘death’ and grief over that death. When Josiah tore his own clothing upon hearing the Word of God read aloud to him, he knew that he and his people were in serious trouble. Why? He loved God and he had modelled his life after his grandfather David, who was the greatest king the nation of Israel had ever had!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The issue in play here however is that we are to model our lives on the Word of God not other people. There’s nothing wrong with having godly mentors or aspiring to live righteously as we see godly examples in the lives of others but men always fail. King David was a man with a heart after God’s own heart...but he was also an adulterer, a murderer, an insipid father and very proud. David was a great sinner who genuinely loved God with all his heart but daily battled with his flesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Josiah came face to face with the reality that while he wanted to serve God, he and his people were living their lives in a manner that not only disobeyed God’s laws but their behaviour’s and lifestyles were inviting God’s wrath and judgement. God promised very clearly in His law that if His people obeyed Him, He would provide for and protect them but if they didn’t obey Him, He would judge them and hand them over to their enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Having never heard the law of God meant that Josiah was living in ignorance. Not knowing it’s a sin to tell a lie doesn’t change the fact that lying is still a sin and an offense before God. Not knowing that you’re offending God doesn’t change the fact that you’re offending God. In &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Romans 7:13 Paul explains that “...through the commandment sin would become utterly sinful.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In other words, the power of the Law is in its purpose to reveal and expose sin and how sinful we are and this in turn reveals to us that we are ‘rightly’ under the judgement of God until and unless we confess our guilt over sin and repent of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;As soon as Josiah understood their true sinful state before God he was immediately grieved and determined to seek God for forgiveness and a solution...he didn’t run from God...he didn’t try justify himself by saying...”I didn’t know any better”, he simply admitted his guilt and that of his people and their forefathers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 Kings 22:13, ‘”Go, inquire of the Lord for me and the people and all Judah concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the Lord that burns against us, because our fathers have not listened to the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.”’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Huldah, the prophetess had a word from God for Josiah and the people in response to Josiah’s earnest desire to seek God for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The sin of the people was grievous and had to be judged. Their wickedness was so bad that God had no alternative but to bring judgement upon them...however, because the heart of the king was tender toward God and he so willingly and immediately humbled himself before God, God would stay His judgement until after Josiah’s life had come to an end. God’s prophesied king – Josiah by name – would never see the judgement of God fall because he was a righteous man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Josiah ushered in a temporary reformation in the nation of Judah, as the leader of his nation he stood before the Lord in the Temple and made a covenant with God to keep His commandments and ordinances; he did away with all the paganism that was rampant throughout the land along with the false priests and prophets. He abolished the religious cult prostitution and banned all forms of witchcraft and creation worship. No High Places were left, no Ba’al worship or Asherah worship was permitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;During his reign, Josiah regained much of the land that had been part of Israel, the Northern Kingdom and this allowed him to destroy the two golden calves that Jeroboam put in place when Israel split from Judah; Josiah destroyed and ground them to dust. Josiah went through the land and cleaned the place out from top to bottom. No more spiritists, mediums or clairvoyants were allowed to remain and after all that he proclaimed a nationwide celebration of the Passover feast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It’s important to note that while Josiah implemented a huge amount of change and made laws that banned paganism, idolatry, immorality and occult practices, the hearts of the people were not transformed...human laws cannot regulate the wickedness of human hearts, that can only occur through the power and conviction of the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 Kings 23:25, ‘Before him there was no king like him who turned to the Lord with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; nor did any like him arise after him.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;His death was quite interesting; Pharaoh Neco of Egypt went to war against the Assyrian’s at God’s command and Josiah went to war against Pharaoh Neco which was most unusual because Neco wasn’t at war with Judah...but Assyria was most definitely an enemy of Judah...it would have made sense for Josiah to stand back and let the Egyptians destroy their Assyrian enemies. What on earth made Josiah go to war against Pharaoh Neco?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Sometime after the apostasy of Solomon and the nation of Israel was split in 2, the Ark of the Covenant went missing. It’s believed that it was hidden away or ‘secreted’ away before the Babylonian invasion and captivity. All the gold elements in the Temple were taken to Babylon and these items were mentioned by name but the Ark wasn’t...this is why many believe the Ark was sent away for safe keeping by a number of priests who were faithful to Yahweh and could see ahead of time that the Ark would fall into pagan hands if they didn’t hide it somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There are some who believe that the Ark was hidden in Egypt under the knowledge and protection of Pharaoh Neco and that’s why Josiah refused to turn away from battle with him. Pharoah Neco to some degree, believed in Yahweh because he admitted to Josiah that he was warring against the Assyrians at God’s direction and therefore, tried to talk Josiah out of his aggression toward him. Josiah, in his enthusiasm to have God honoured and the Temple function completely reinstituted wanted the return of the Ark. Scripture does not spell this scenario out, this is only a theory but it’s a very curious and interesting possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;During Josiah’s insistent pursuit of Pharaoh Neco, he was hit by an arrow and mortally wounded. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Chron 35:22-24)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Because God is sovereign, I believe that God was directing Josiah in his pursuit to make sure he died at exactly the right time. You see, one of the most grievous sins committed by Judah was their refusal to allow the land to have a Sabbath rest. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Chron 36:20-21)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Every 7 years, the land was to be left alone – to rest - and while God said their rampant sin, rebellion, idolatry and immorality was the reason they would have to endure judgement, the reason the judgement of exile to Babylon was to last 70 years was because that’s how many Sabbath years of rest the land had been denied. Josiah had to die at the right time to ensure his heirs – who were wicked – would rule after him for the right amount of time to fit into God’s plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There are no errors or mistakes in how days, months and years unfold in the lives of individuals, families, communities and nations. God times everything to perfection and when it was time for Josiah to exit the scene, God was in complete control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Josiah was an incredibly righteous and godly king, indeed, one of the very best the nation ever had and Judah mourned greatly for him at his passing. In fact, the prophet Jeremiah chanted a lament for Josiah and all the male and female singers used to sing their lamentations about him and they actually became ordinances in the nation. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Chron 35:25)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The greatest lesson that we can learn from Josiah is that having wholesome motivations toward God isn’t enough to please God...we absolutely must read, know, understand, love and obey the Word of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Isaiah 40:8, ‘The grass withers, the flower fades, but the Word of our God stands forever.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matthew 5:18, ‘”For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass from the Law until all is accomplished.’”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matthew 24:35, ‘”Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away.”’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Psalm 138:2, ‘”I will worship toward Your holy Temple, and praise Your name for Your lovingkindness and Your truth; &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;for You have magnified Your Word above all Your name.”’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

7239,Home Group Notes - Manasseh,"&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin-right: 8px; float: left;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/724407_24295926 small.jpg&quot; height=&quot;234&quot; width=&quot;312&quot; /&gt;King Manasseh (men-ash-sheh’)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The name ‘Manasseh’ is generally derived from the verb ‘nasha’ which basically means ‘forget’. To the Hebrew mind, this isn’t simply forgetting because something fades from our consciousness, but rather it’s a deliberate action of taking something away. More specifically, something was forgotten because God took something away. Because we know that God cannot not know something because God doesn’t forget the way we do, this is inferring that God actively pushes someone or something away in the same way that when God remembers someone He pulls them close, just like He did when He remembered His people in slavery in Egypt. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;(Gen 30:2)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; From this perspective ‘Manasseh’ means ‘Making To Forget’ (Pushing away)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This becomes more complicated however because there is another verb identical to ‘nasha’ which means to lend or be a creditor and these verbs are seen as separate because they denote different ideas. These verbs are intertwined however because if we lend to someone we in effect push that person away because they’re indebted to us – this is the Biblical mindset. When the debt is paid however, the person is then drawn closer to us. (Which is precisely what Christ did for us – forgiving our debt and our separation from the Father and bringing us close to Him)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;From this perspective ‘Manasseh’ means ‘From a debt’. A commonly held understanding of this name is ‘God has made me forget’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Considering everything Manasseh did during his 55 year reign in Judah and then what God did for him toward the end of his life, the meaning ‘From a debt’ and or ‘God has made me forget’ are quite appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Manasseh’s story can be read in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 Kings 21:1-17 and 2 Chronicles 33:1-20.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Manasseh was 12 years old when he came to the throne of Judah the Southern Kingdom. Israel, the Northern Kingdom was obliterated by the Assyrians; his father Hezekiah being a godly man, would have taught him about the wickedness of Israel and their destruction because of their sin, he would also have taught him that God was holy, just and absolutely faithful to protect and defend His people when they trusted and submitted themselves and their security to Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;However, every believing parent knows that a child cannot have a relationship with God vicariously through them; the child has to have their own personal relationship with God for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Manasseh was an incredibly rebellious young man, in fact, reading about Manasseh you would come to the conclusion that he made it his sole mission in life to undo all the good that his father did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;First, he rebuilt the ‘High Places’ that Hezekiah his father had broken down. High Places were typically chosen by pagan religions for the worship of demons because the highest points were places of power. God had specifically instructed His people to worship Him in the Temple in Jerusalem with specific rituals and sacrifices. God will not tolerate demon worship on high places which undermined His supreme authority and power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Second, he rebuilt shrines to Ba’al and Asherah. Remember that Ba’al was the chief god of Tyre and was considered to be the most powerful and supreme god. Hand in hand with Ba’al is Asherah, his female counterpart which was usually represented by a wooden pole with revolting images carved into it. Very often sacrifices were made at the base of the poles and also included fertility rituals as well...so sexual immorality became the order of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Third, he desecrated the Temple of God by placing altars for idol worship in it. It’s an abomination before God Almighty to re-establish the High Places and places of worship to Ba’al and Asherah throughout the land, but to actually place altars within the Temple of God itself to facilitate sacrifices to demon gods is abominable on a whole other level!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Four, he built altars of worship to ‘the Host of Heaven’. In other words he worshipped the sun, moon, stars and heavenly bodies. He worshipped the creation rather than the Creator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Five, he sacrificed his own sons to the despicable demon god Molech. Some believed Molech to be another representation of Ba’al...there are varying reports on who or what Molech was but what is absolutely sure is that this demon god required the murder of innocent babies. He was believed to be represented by a brass statue that was hollow with his arms extended in front; a fire would be made in the base section until the entire statue was red hot and a tiny infant would be laid on his extended arms to be burnt to death. Manasseh did this to his own babies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Six, he murdered so many innocent people that the Bible says &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. His commitment to paganism (demon worship) drove him to kill...such is the end result of such devotion. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;(2 Kings 21:16)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;You become like the gods you worship. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;(Psa 115 &amp;amp; 97)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Because satan comes to steal, kill and destroy, those who worship satan, in whatever form he takes, will become just like him and Manasseh is a prime example of a man who became like the god he worshipped. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(John 10:10)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God judged Manasseh by having Assyria attack Jerusalem, they captured him and placed him in shackles and chains of brass and ultimately dumped him in a prison cell 1000 miles away in Babylon. He was humiliated and absolutely powerless over his situation but sitting in his prison cell caused him to remember his father and his father’s God – Jehovah – whom his father loved and served. &lt;strong&gt;There’s nothing like utter devastation to cause a man to repent and call upon God. &lt;/strong&gt;This is why tragedy and devastation are not necessarily bad but are the means by which God draws us to Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;And that’s exactly what Manasseh did...he prayed and he repented, he confessed his sin before God and asked Him for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 Chronicles 33:12-13, ‘When he was in distress, he entreated the Lord his God and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers. When he prayed to Him, He (God) was moved by his entreaty and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem to his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the Lord was God.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Manasseh’s repentance was genuine; upon his return he worked hard to rebuild what had been broken and destroyed by the Assyrians; he re-established Judah’s military security, he removed the foreign pagan gods and the idols from the Temple, he removed the altars of paganism that he’d established in Jerusalem and tossed them outside the city. He returned to righteous worship and Temple sacrifices according to God’s instructions and what’s more, he ordered the people to return to the Lord as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Unfortunately, no man can bring about a genuine change in the heart of another person and the legacy of wickedness – idolatry, immorality, brutality – that Manasseh established during the majority of his reign was thoroughly ingrained in the people and in his own family and in his son and heir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;So what can we learn from the life of King Manasseh of Judah? Well, our society...our intelligent, educated, enlightened and technologically advanced society is no different in heart and mind than Manasseh was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Demon worship is prevalent in the unbelievable number of false religions throughout not only our own country but the world over;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Sex is big business and is no longer hidden away in dirty little porn shops hidden in back alleys, but is celebrated on TV and in movies, magazines, clothing stores...it is used to sell everything from cars, boats and even fishing tackle! Sexual immorality is rampant in our society and getting worse by the day and all manner of perversions are not only normalised, they’re celebrated and promoted as healthy alternate lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We have even gone so far as to normalise STD’s (sexually transmitted diseases) which have resulted from promiscuity and perverted behaviours and treat them as though they’re no different than the common cold. God has designed our human bodies in such a way that they contract shocking diseases when we engage in sexual immorality...it’s God’s way of dissuading us from participating in depravity, but we simply invent medicines that allow us to engage in depravity and get away with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Worship of creation has not only infiltrated our society in pagan religions such as Wicca, but it has invaded the education system under the guise of science. God Himself has been denied as our Creator and evolution has become the object of veneration...the creation has usurped God’s place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Astrology and the worship of the heavens has been around forever, but horoscopes and fortune telling is a massive business today...how many ‘Christians’ can’t go past reading their daily horoscopes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When it comes to sacrificing babies, our modern society beats Manasseh’s efforts hands down...it is hard to comprehend the number of innocent babies who have been slaughtered through abortion. Well over 100 million babies worldwide (50 million in the USA alone) have been sacrificed on the altar of convenience to appease the god of self-interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shedding innocent blood is not only a reference to the murder of unborn babies, shedding innocent blood also means killing of political opponents, killing those who don’t believe your religion, killing those who speak out against corruption, killing those who take action to bring about social and political changes that protect the people against despots and dictators. The world is reeling from wars and civil wars not simply in the past, but so many are happening right at this very moment!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The wonderful thing about Manasseh’s story that I love the most is the incredible picture we get of God’s stunning and unparalleled willingness to forgive and restore anyone who will genuinely repent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Manasseh was about as wicked as a man could be; he committed the most heinous sins bringing about not only his own demise but the destruction of his people as well. He slaughtered tens of thousands of innocents and offended God in every way imaginable and yet, when Manasseh had a genuinely repentant heart and a complete change of mind and attitude, God immediately forgave him and brought about his return and restoration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;How amazing is the mercy and grace of God!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There was still a legacy of wickedness that resulted from Manasseh’s sins that continued on through his family and among his people, but God utterly forgave Manasseh for every act of wickedness that he committed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We should take great comfort and assurance from that, because if God could forgive a man as wretched and depraved as Manasseh, He can also forgive us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Manasseh reigned over Judah for 55 years, most of those years were spent committing all manner of crimes against God and his own people; in the latter part of his reign he was imprisoned in Babylon and ultimately returned to Jerusalem by God because of his genuine repentance. His reign was the longest of any Jewish king either in the northern or southern kingdoms and this shows us very dramatically the long-suffering, patient and merciful character traits of Yahweh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There is no-one too wicked or too evil or too far gone that God cannot forgive, heal, save and restore. God’s love and forgiveness is vastly greater than our worst efforts at wickedness...He looks only for genuine repentance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In and of ourselves we cannot bridge the gap from our own wickedness and depravity to becoming holy and acceptable to God and God knows this; this is why God sent His Son, Yeshua, to come to earth as a man, remain sinless and die a criminal’s death on the cross in order to pay for our sin. He died, was buried and three days later He rose to new life. This is not a fictional account; Yeshua was seen by more than 500 people at one time! He spoke, ate and taught His disciples after His resurrection and the New Testament contains these eye witness accounts and what has been proven repeatedly over the past 2000 years is the accuracy and authenticity of the Bible...both Old and New Testaments. You can trust the Bible to exactly what it claims to be...the Word of God Himself. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(1 Cor 15:1-8; John 20:16-19, 21:1-14; Luke 24:40-43; Acts 1:9-11)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Salvation and forgiveness is available to all in the same manner as it came to King Manasseh...confession of sin, genuine repentance and faith in God to honour His promise of forgiveness to those who will call upon Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Isaiah 1:18, ‘“Come now and let us reason together”, says the Lord, “Though your sins are as scarlet, they will be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they will be like wool.”’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Psalm 86:5, ‘”For You, Lord, are good, and ready to forgive, and abundant in lovingkindness to all who call upon You.”’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Psalm 103:17, ‘But the lovingkindness of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting on those who fear Him, and His righteousness to children’s children.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If your desire is to become a believer and disciple of Christ, I would encourage you to spend some time talking with the Father, be honest and admit your sin and then repent. This is not a scary, nasty, judgemental word, rather it’s a glorious word of freedom because repentance brings about redemption and liberation from slavery to sin and replaces that slavery with relationship with the God of the Universe. Repentance is a magnificent gift from God to you. Put your faith in Him and the promise in His Word to forgive all who call upon Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If this has been a starting point for you in your relationship with God, we’d love to know about it. Please contact us as we’d love to assist and encourage you in this most important and pivotal decision that you will ever make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

7083,Home Group Notes - Hezekiah,"&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin-right: 8px; float: left;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/575231_55762839 small.jpg&quot; height=&quot;179&quot; width=&quot;239&quot; /&gt;King Hezekiah (khiz-ke’ya / khiz-ke’yahu)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The name ‘Hezekiah’ is made up of two elements. The first part – ‘hazaq’ means to be or become courageous or strong, the second part – ‘jah’ (Yah) is God’s name, ‘Yahweh.’ So Hezekiah means “Yahweh strengthens’ or ‘Yahweh has strengthened” or “the Strength of the Lord”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;You can learn about King Hezekiah in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 Kings chapters 16 to 21; 1 Chronicles 4, 2 Chronicles chapters 28 to 33&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Hezekiah became king of Judah, the Southern Kingdom and he was a very good king. He was only 25 years old when he ascended the throne and he ruled in Jerusalem for 29 years. He did right in the sight of the Lord...most of the time we read that many kings who ruled in Israel and Judah &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘did evil in the sight of the Lord’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; so it’s really refreshing when reading through Kings and Chronicles to come upon a verse that says, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“and he did right in the sight of the Lord.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;By the time Hezekiah took the throne of Judah, Israel (the Northern Kingdom) had already been destroyed by the Assyrians and most had gone into captivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Upon becoming king, Hezekiah believed it was essential that he and his people get their spiritual lives together and in the first year of his rule he opened up and repaired the doors of the house of the Lord. Under the previous leadership, the Temple and the things of God had been ignored and had fallen into disrepair. The people had been guilty of sin and idolatry and Hezekiah meant to put things right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Do you remember the bronze serpent that Moses made in the wilderness? Over the centuries this had become an object of idolatrous worship and Hezekiah destroyed it and he also removed the high places and cut down all the Asherah as well. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 18:1-5)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;King Hezekiah was responsible for a great spiritual revival in Judah and it began when he turned his focus on the religious leadership. Hezekiah reinstituted worship in the Temple, he brought in the priests and the Levites and when he gathered them together he said to them, “&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;He said to the religious leaders...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 Chron 29:5-11, ‘...”Listen to me, O Levites. Consecrate yourselves now, and consecrate the house of the Lord, the God of your fathers, and carry the uncleanness out from the Holy Place. For our fathers have been unfaithful and have done evil in the sight of the Lord our God, and have forsaken Him and turned their faces away from the dwelling place of the Lord, and have turned their backs. They have also shut the doors of the porch and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense or offered burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel. Therefore the wrath of the Lord was against Judah and Jerusalem, and He has made them an object of terror, of horror, and of hissing, as you see with your own eyes. For behold, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this. Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with the Lord God of Israel that His burning anger may turn away from us. My sons, do not be negligent now, for the Lord has chosen you to stand before Him, to minister to Him, and to be His ministers and burn incense.”’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The encouraging thing in this situation is that the priests and Levites responded rightly. They immediately set about consecrating themselves and getting their sacred religious system cleaned up and back into function and service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;With their (religious leaders) hearts now resolute to worship God, Hezekiah turned his attention from them put it squarely on the national and civic leaders of Judah. In &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;verse 20&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Hezekiah got up early, assembled all the ‘princes of the city’ and promptly led them all up to the Temple and then the process of purification began: there was sacrifice for the kingdom, for the sanctuary and for Judah, for the sins of the people and it says in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;verse 24&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, that Hezekiah ordered burnt offerings for all of Israel. This probably meant that he was including Israel, the former Northern Kingdom in the offerings being made. Scripture doesn’t spell this out, but this is a real possibility because Israel the Northern Kingdom has been destroyed by the Assyrians and taken captive, so when &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;verse 21&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; specifies offerings on behalf of Judah and &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;verse 24&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; specifies ‘all Israel’; Hezekiah was wanting to seek God’s forgiveness on ALL of Israel...both north and south. Because Israel and Judah were both guilty of rebellion and idolatry before God they were both under God’s wrath and righteous judgement; Israel had already been destroyed but Judah was also in line for judgement and Hezekiah knew that Judah would end up like Israel if they didn’t repent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What’s important to note however is that this event was positively huge. During this time of consecration and purification 70 bulls, 100 rams, 200 lambs were sacrificed as burnt offerings. On top of that a further 600 bulls and 3000 sheep were offered as sacrifices as well. This was a bloodbath...just under 4000 animals (3970) were slaughtered in a day in the same spot. There were so many animals that needed skinning that the priests simply couldn’t handle the numbers and had to call upon their Levite brothers to help them with the job. The purpose of these sacrifices was spiritual cleansing and consecration. The number of animals sacrificed shows the level of seriousness and commitment held by the priests and particularly the Levites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It’s really important that we understand that sin is the most expensive thing in the universe (as well as the most destructive). The number of animals who forfeited their lives to cover the sins of the people in these events was phenomenal and they were only temporary!!! It took the very life of Yeshua, the Son of the Living God to sacrifice His own life to ensure our sin could be washed away permanently. Sin is incredibly expensive and our Saviour paid the most extreme and expensive price to pay for our forgiveness. I need to keep that in mind the next time I’m tempted to sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This also demonstrated the enormity and severity needed for gaining right standing or ‘righteousness’ with God and with the return of Temple service, there was great rejoicing not only on behalf of Hezekiah, but also among the people in attendance because revival had broken out and it had happened suddenly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;So that took care of the religious leaders and the civic leaders; next Hezekiah sent letters throughout the nation calling on them to come to the House of the Lord to celebrate the Feast of Passover to the Lord. This was a call to reinstate the full celebration because it had only been minimally attended in previous years. This was God using Hezekiah to call the people to repentance and to return to Him fully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 Chron 30:6, ‘The couriers went throughout all Israel and Judah with the letters from the hand of the king and his princes, even according to the command of the king, saying, “O sons of Israel, return to the Lord God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, that He may return to those of you who escaped and are left from the hand of the kings of Assyria. Do not be like your fathers and your brothers, who were unfaithful to the Lord God of their fathers, so that He made them a horror as you see. Now do not stiffen your neck like your fathers, but yield to the Lord and enter His sanctuary which he has consecrated forever, and serve the Lord your God, that His burning anger may turn away from you. For if you return to the Lord, your brothers and your sons will find compassion before those who led them captive and will return to this land. For the Lord your God is gracious and compassionate, and will not turn His face away from you if you return to Him.”’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Here again we see Hezekiah wanting to reach out to the northern tribes as far as Zebulun, which is the Galilee region; his desire was to reach out to any of his people who remained there after the Assyrian invasion and destruction. Hezekiah was in fact calling for revival among his people to reunite them and draw them back to the Lord. Unfortunately, most of the remaining northern tribes laughed at them and mocked them...obviously near total annihilation didn’t soften their hearts, but there were some from the tribes of Asher, Manasseh and Zebulun who humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem for the Passover. This Passover event dwarfed the Temple consecration event in that 2,000 bulls and 17,000 sheep were sacrificed...a total of 19,000 animals. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;(2 Chron 30:24)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Hezekiah is noted for bringing revival to the people of Israel and for uniting the separated brethren from the north. This was a remarkable thing that he did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Hezekiah was successful in his wars against the Philistines and he retook all the cities that his father had lost to them as well as others &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 18:7-8; 2 Chron 28:18)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and Hezekiah was alive during the life of the prophet Isaiah and relied heavily on the prophet of God for counsel and it was at Isaiah’s word that he revolted against the King of Assyria and refused to pay him tribute. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 18:7)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This revolt led to the invasion by Sennacherib, initially Hezekiah tried to ‘pay off’ Sennacherib but this apparently wasn’t enough and he set a siege about Jerusalem. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 18:14-16)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; He sent a nasty man by the name of Rabshakeh to undermine the confidence of the Jews by telling them not to be so stupid in trusting Yahweh and Hezekiah because no god of any nation had been able to withstand the might and power of Assyria and if they didn’t surrender they would all be wiped out. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 18:17-35)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;During the siege Hezekiah became very sick and Isaiah visited him and told him to get his house in order because he was going to die. Now the kingdom was in danger because Hezekiah had no heir, his son Manasseh was born 3 years later – so his death would end his dynasty and he prayed desperately to God and he wept bitterly over this situation. God immediately spoke to Isaiah who went straight back to Hezekiah and told him that God heard his prayer and was going to give him another 15 years of life. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 20:1-11; 2 Chron 32:24-26)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Hezekiah went to the Temple to pray to the Lord to act on their behalf, he was the first king of Judah to do such a thing since the time of Solomon! He actually spread open the letters sent to him by Sennacherib before the Lord in the Temple and prayed that God would deliver Jerusalem for this fierce enemy. Isaiah the prophet prophesied that Sennacherib would never again attack the Holy City and what’s more, the entire Assyrian army was destroyed in one night by ‘Angel of the Lord’. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 19; 2 Chron 32:9-22)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; God proved Himself to be absolutely trustworthy and what’s more, Isaiah his prophet was proven to be a real prophet unlike the plethora of false prophets who were repeatedly wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Hezekiah’s victory made him famous and elevated him very quickly among the surrounding nations who proceeded to bring him presents. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Chron 32:23)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; One of the visiting nations was Babylon, in fact they had heard that Hezekiah had been miraculously healed and this visit was ostensibly to see if the reports of healing and wealth in the nation were in fact true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Unfortunately, Hezekiah was probably feeling a bit puffed up and proud after coming through the siege and certain death unscathed. He unwisely showed all Israel’s wealth and power to the Babylonian ambassador and for this Isaiah promptly and severely rebuked him because Hezekiah’s actions demonstrated his trust in his wealth and military might which of course was misplaced, his faith was to be in God alone. To his credit, Hezekiah repented immediately. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 20:12-19)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, the one sad thing about this episode is Hezekiah’s attitude to the judgement that would come upon his children as a result of his pride...he didn’t seem at all perturbed about what his heirs would experience, he was just relieved that he wouldn’t live to experience it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin-left: 8px; float: right;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/_dsc0168.jpg&quot; height=&quot;470&quot; width=&quot;312&quot; /&gt;Hezekiah did however build an incredible water tunnels hewn through solid rock to ensure there would always be a supply of fresh water to the city and the people. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Chron 32:30)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These tunnels are positively enormous and were constructed with several teams of workers who began the work at either end of the tunnels digging until the each met in the middle!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Manasseh his son became king after Hezekiah died, he was only 12 when he took the throne...unfortunately, Manasseh was a very wicked king and I can’t help but wonder if God’s initial plan to allow Hezekiah to die 15 years earlier might have spared Judah one of their worst ever kings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Sometimes when God allows or disallows things in our lives we think God is being unfair but in fact God knows what is best for us. If Hezekiah had died when he first fell sick, his wicked son would never have been born and thus he wouldn’t have been a wicked king who led the people back into sin and depravity. Perhaps a relative of Hezekiah would have come to the throne and been a really godly man. Not only that, Hezekiah wouldn’t have fallen into terrible pride by showed off all the wealth and power of his kingdom to the Babylonians who later on invaded them to get their hands on it. This would have spared his family line of future judgement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Who knows?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The disturbing thing about Hezekiah at the end of his life is not that he turned away from the Lord, because he didn’t, unfortunately his attitude toward his descendants was quite blasé; when Isaiah informed him that his pride and arrogance would result in judgement upon his son, he seemed completely non-plussed about it. Since he himself was going to be spared the judgement it didn’t worry him what would befall his son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Hezekiah was one of the best kings Judah ever had and among the Rabbi’s he is revered because he brought revival to his nation and he honoured God and restored proper reverent worship and service to the Temple, but the lesson we can learn from Hezekiah is to take the legacy we leave to our own children and grandchildren seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There are broken families and broken family relationships all around us and as parents we must recognise that from the moment we become married, our attitude should no longer be ‘I’ but ‘WE’. When we become parents, our attitude is now supposed to be about ‘WE’ and ‘THEM’ and the choices we make must be first and foremost about considering what is good, right and profitable for the well-being and betterment of our children as well as each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God entrusts our children to us for a few short years, our decisions and choices can and should be of great benefit to them and their security, but wrong and selfish decisions they can be catastrophic to them. I want my legacy to my children and grandchildren be that of great blessing, security and stability, I’m sure you feel the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Father: &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This is reflected in God the Father&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Bride&lt;strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/strong&gt;This is reflected in the church; the Bride of Christ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The elements that make up the Ancient Jewish Wedding are:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Ketubah (Betrothal/Wedding Contract)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When a young man wanted to marry a young woman, he would prepare a covenant which he would present to the young woman and her father in the young woman’s home. The covenant itself would present the groom’s willingness to provide for and protect the young woman and it would present the price he was willing to pay for her. It was very much like a purchase of sorts. While socially, males were considered more valuable in ancient times because they were physically more capable of working hard to earn a living with hard labour and farming etc; however - while the bride price was a compensation for the woman’s family for the cost of raising her, it was so much more than that, it was very much an indication of just how valuable she was to the prospective groom. The young man would present his covenant to the young woman and her father for acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yeshua&lt;/em&gt;, the heavenly Bridegroom, came to the home of His intended Bride and presented His marriage covenant. The ‘New Covenant’ as we know it, contained all the benefits that would provide for His Bride. He would provide her a mansion, He would provide her every need, He would see all her sins washed away, He would sanctify and purify her, He would glorify her with a new body and eternal security, He would honour her and bless her with every spiritual blessing, and the price He would be willing to pay to secure her as His own Bride was His very life, which He would willingly offer to be tortured and crucified in order to secure His Bride for Himself.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Jer 31:31; Luke 22:20; Heb 9:15; 12:24)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin-left: 8px; float: right;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/532498_10150963399857099_1629701558_n.jpg&quot; height=&quot;184&quot; width=&quot;330&quot; /&gt;The Acceptance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If the bride price was acceptable to the father of the bride – meaning the price was commensurate with her value - the young man would pour a glass of wine for the bride and if she willing drank it, it would indicate her acceptance of the proposal. It was at this point that the young couple were considered betrothed. This betrothal was a legally binding agreement. Today, if a couple become engaged, they can easily break up if they choose, but betrothal in ancient Jewish culture was considered to be as strong as the marriage relationship itself, the only difference being that physical union had not taken place.&amp;nbsp;If separation was desired at some point, a legal divorce was required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yeshua&lt;/em&gt;, poured a cup of wine for the Bride to drink to seal the marriage contract in the same way He poured wine for His disciples to drink. His words described the significance of the cup as the bride price; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘Then He took the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them, say, “Drink from it, all of you. This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. I tell you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father’s kingdom.”’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The disciples drank of the cup, thus accepting the contract. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;(Matt 26:28-29)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;This cup will be drunk during the Marriage Supper of the Lamb! &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Rev 19:1-21; John 14:2-3; Matt 22:1-14, 25:1-46)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin-right: 8px; float: left;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/575887_10150963400182099_1520226475_n.jpg&quot; height=&quot;191&quot; width=&quot;338&quot; /&gt;The Gifts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The bridegroom would then present gifts to the bride and their purpose was to show his appreciation of the bride and they also were intended to help her remember him during the imminent betrothal period when they wouldn’t see each other &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;at all&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yeshua&lt;/em&gt; has given gifts to His betrothed also. He promised the gift of the Holy Spirit which would remind us of our Groom and all that He taught. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(1 John 4:13)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Yeshua described this gift in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;John 14:26: ‘But the Counsellor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send&amp;nbsp; in My name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you. Peace I leave with you; My peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled, and do not be afraid.’ &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;He has given us His Word which is the instrument of transformation, purification and preparation, readying us for His imminent return for us. He has given us spiritual gifts to use during our preparation time to learn how to be His bride and the fruit of the Spirit that grows in us is demonstration of our preparedness. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Rom 12; 1 Cor 12; Eph 4; Gal 5)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;The Separation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The typical betrothal period was between 1 and 2 years and during this time the bride and bridegroom wouldn’t see each other, they would in fact be in preparations for their marriage. The groom would be in his father’s home making and preparing a home for himself and his bride to dwell in once they were married, and fitting the home out with all that they would need for their life together. The bride would be making preparations for her big day and also for the things she would need to be a good wife upon her marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yeshua&lt;/em&gt; also said He would go away and prepare a place for His Bride in His Father’s home. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“In My Father’s house are many dwelling places; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you. If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself, that where I am, there you may be also.” (John 14:2-3)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;During this betrothal separation period, the bride was also required to partake of a &lt;em&gt;Mikveh&lt;/em&gt;, or a ritual cleansing bath. The word ‘mikveh’ is the same word used for baptism and to this day in Conservative Judaism, a bride cannot marry unless she enters the water of the Mikveh.&amp;nbsp;The Mikveh is a ceremonial demonstration of a person transitioning from unclean to clean, defiled to purified, old to new, death to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin-left: 8px; float: right;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/548178_10150962562372099_1477957677_n.jpg&quot; height=&quot;209&quot; width=&quot;372&quot; /&gt;Yeshua also provided for His Bride to participate in baptism of both water and the Holy Spirit. Water baptism takes place in many places in the New Testament; after His ascension He gave this command, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift My Father promised, which you have heard Me speak about. For John baptised with water, but in a few days you will be baptised with the Holy Spirit.” (Acts 1:4, 11:16) (Acts 2:38, 41, 8:12, 36-38, 9:18, 10:47-48, 16:15, 33, 18:8, 19:5, 22:16; Rom 6:3; Gal 3:27)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It was during the betrothal separation period that the groom was also preparing the bridal chamber, which had to be a beautiful place to bring his bride. The groom had to build it to the father’s specifications and the young groom could only go for his bride when his father had approved all that he had done. If the bridegroom was asked when the wedding was to take place, he would probably respond by saying, &lt;em&gt;“it’s not for me to know, only my father knows.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;As mentioned, our own Bridegroom promised to go away and prepare a place for His Bride in His Father’s house and the preparations continue to this very day. We wonder when His return for us will be, and when His disciples asked Him when He would return, Yeshua responded by saying, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. Be on guard! Be alert! You do not know when that time will come.” (Mark 13:32-33) &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;While the bridegroom was making preparations, the bride was considered to be consecrated, set apart or &lt;em&gt;‘bought with a price’&lt;/em&gt;. If she went out, she would wear a veil so that others would know she was betrothed, and promised to another. She had probably saved money all her life in anticipation for this momentous time. She would obtain cosmetics and learn to apply them as a means of beautifying herself for her bridegroom. She would get her wedding gown, all her clothing and possessions prepared and ready at all times because the arrival of her bridegroom was a secret. Typically, the bridegroom would come in the middle of the night to &lt;em&gt;‘steal her away’&lt;/em&gt; or...to come like a &lt;em&gt;‘thief in the night’&lt;/em&gt;. The bride’s attendants would also be prepared, watching and waiting in anticipation, keeping their lamps filled and trimmed in order to be ready at all times for the imminent night festivities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin-right: 8px; float: left;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/403869_10150984719188183_703958637_n.jpg&quot; height=&quot;231&quot; width=&quot;345&quot; /&gt;Yeshua’s Bride has been consecrated and set apart, saved by faith and declared justified. We are waiting the return of our Bridegroom and our time here is to be spent in preparing ourselves for Him. It was the parable of the Ten Virgins that Yeshua used to inform us that we needed to be ready and watching at all times, keeping our lamps filled and trimmed, remaining alert and watchful in order to be ready when He returned at whatever time that might be. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Matt 25:1-13)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rev 19:7, ‘Let us rejoice and be glad and give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come and His bride has made herself ready.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eph 5:25-29, ‘Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her, so that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the Word, that He might present to Himself the church in all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that she would be holy and blameless. So husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself; for no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also does the church.’ &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It is no coincidence that Yeshua uses the marriage relationship between men and women to describe His relationship to the church!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;The Surprise Arrival&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When the bridegroom’s father deemed that all was ready, he would tell his son to go and get his bride. The bridegroom would abduct his bride secretly, like a thief in the night and take her to the wedding chamber. As he approached the bride’s house, he would shout out loud and blow the shofar (rams horn) so that she would have at least some small warning to gather her prepared belongings to take with her. The bridegroom and his friends would come into the bride’s house and get the bride and her attendants.&amp;nbsp; In the same way, &lt;em&gt;Yeshua&lt;/em&gt; our Bridegroom, will come for us at a time not of our knowing, but He will come like a thief in the night, He will &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“...descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we shall always be with the Lord.”&amp;nbsp; (1 Thess 4:16-17) &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;The Huppah and Seven Days of Celebration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Once the groom receives his bride, the now much bigger bridal party make their way to the father’s house where the wedding guests have assembled and are awaiting the arrival of the happy couple. Shortly after arriving, the bride and groom are escorted by their attendants to the wedding chamber, also known as the Huppah and during all the proceedings up to this point, the bride is veiled so that no one can see her face. While the attendants remain outside, the bride and groom enter the Huppah alone and in the privacy of this place, they consummate their marriage with physical union, the ultimate sealing of the marriage covenant that was entered into 1 or 2 years earlier. Once consummation has taken place, this is announced by the groom to his attendants, upon which the happy news is relayed to the guests who then begin their celebrations which will last 7 days and during this week, the bride and groom remain hidden away together. When the 7 days are complete, the groom emerges from the Huppah to present his wife, introducing her to the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yeshua&lt;/em&gt;, our Bridegroom, will also keep His Bride secreted away during a seven year time of testing on the earth, such as has never been seen before. During this time of great trouble and distress, the righteous will be protected because they will be in the wedding chamber with the Bridegroom. After this time of testing, Yeshua will emerge and will return with His Bride to earth at His second coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin-left: 8px; float: right;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/3053_10150984720388183_1589630242_n.jpg&quot; height=&quot;311&quot; width=&quot;467&quot; /&gt;There are several things of great significance for me personally, after I learned about the ancient Jewish wedding. Firstly, my confidence in God’s Word increased exponentially and it’s made me realise just how important ancient Jewish culture is if I want to have a clearer understanding of Scripture and its relevance to me and my relationship with Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Secondly, I have a greater awareness of the prophetic implications of ancient Jewish culture and how these have previously and continue to unfold in the plan of God for human history. It’s as though God is telling us in advance in a myriad of ways what He’s going to do and how He’s going to do it. If we don’t see it one way, we can see it in another and each way confirms the other...always remembering that the Word of God is supreme in all things. Jewish tradition never trumps Scripture, rather ancient Jewish traditions should mirror what is laid out in the Scripture not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Thirdly, it’s a confirmation to me that God is not only the author of the Bible, He is also the orchestrator of all of human history and He is ensuring that all things unfold according to His design and prophetic plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Fourthly, I wish I had learned of the significance and importance of ancient Jewish culture and customs much earlier in my Christian walk so that I could have had a far greater understanding of the Word of God and God’s prophetic plan and timetable. I could have avoided a lot of error and misapplication of the Word had the foundations of Jewish culture and practices been explained. The lack of understanding and appreciation of the Jewishness of the Bible has robbed the church of so much richness and understanding which is a great shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;At least we have the opportunity to learn it now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

6765,Home Group Notes - Athaliah &amp; Joash,"&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin-right: 8px; float: left;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/1058605_60297588 small.jpg&quot; height=&quot;215&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;Athaliah (Ath-al-ya)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There are several complexities in coming to a correct understanding of this name, it’s made up of two parts, the first of which doesn’t occur in the Hebrew Bible and the Jones Dictionary of Old Testament Proper Names takes the meaning of this name from an Arabian root meaning ‘to handle violently’ and reads as ‘Taken Away of the Lord’. Other theological dictionaries don’t try to translate her name but propose its roots in an Assyrian verb that means to ‘Grow Great’ or ‘Great Exalted’. Others however believe this name means ‘Yahweh Is Exalted.’ This could possibly be true because Ahab gave his other children names that were honourable to Yahweh even though he himself was a pagan and dishonoured God in every aspect and action of his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Athaliah’s story can be read in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 Kings 8, 9 &amp;amp; 11, and 2 Chronicles 21 &amp;amp; 22&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Athaliah (Ath-al-ya) was Ahab and Jezebel’s daughter, she was raised in an incredibly wicked environment where she saw rampant paganism, wanton murder of innocent men who were faithful to Yahweh, the One True God and the deliberate murder of an innocent man – Naboth the Jezreelite - so that her father could take possession of his property to grow a veg patch! Athaliah was heavily influenced by her parents, most especially by her mother Jezebel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;A few weeks ago we looked at the life of King Jehoshaphat who was king of Judah, the Southern Kingdom. He was a very godly king but unwise in his alliances with the wicked kings of Israel, the Northern Kingdom. One of the dreadful mistakes that Jehoshaphat made was to make a political alliance with Israel by marrying his son Jehoram (also called Joram) to Athaliah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;After Jehoshaphat died, Jehoram became king of Judah and he was a wicked king who walked in the ways of his father-in-law Ahab, mainly because of the wicked influence of his wife Athaliah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 Kings 8:18, ‘He walked in the way of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had done, for the daughter of Ahab became his wife; and he did evil in the sight of the Lord.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It was Athaliah’s influence that turned Jehoram away from the godly example of his father Jehoshaphat to follow the reprobate example of his in-laws. It is a lesson for all women...though we are considered the weaker sex (physically) we actually have incredible power to influence our men and those around us, and we need to make sure that any influence we do have is godly and righteous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;After Jehoram died, his son Ahaziah (akh-az-ya) became king and he was also a wicked king. Ahaziah was Athaliah’s son, and a man named Jehu killed Ahaziah and this opened the door for Athaliah to declare herself Queen of Judah and using her dominating influence, she reigned exactly like her mother in that she fostered the worship of Ba’al throughout Judah temporarily pushing the worship of Yahweh into the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When Athaliah seized the throne she immediately murdered every child who was an heir to the throne - she murdered her own grandchildren – all except for one; Joash (Yeh-ho-arsh) who was one year old. His sister and his nurse hid him to save his life, and he was secreted away to the Temple where he was protected and raised (along with his nurse) by Jehoiada the priest. For six years they lived inside the Temple proper, living in secret daily and under the threat of death. If his existence had been discovered by Athaliah or any of her co-horts, not only would Joash’s life been forfeit, so would all who had participated in his rescue as well as those who were maintaining the secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 Kings 11:1-3, ‘When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she rose and destroyed all the royal offspring. But Jehosheba, the daughter of King Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah and stole him from among the king’s son’s who were being put to death, and placed him and his nurse in the bedroom. So they hid him from Athaliah, and he was not put to death&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; So he was hidden with her in the house of the Lord six years while Athaliah was reigning over the land.’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Athaliah reigned in Judah for six years after which Jehoiada the priest in conjunction with the army and the temple guards brought the young prince out into the public and proceeded with a coronation making Joash the rightful king of Judah. Athaliah tore her clothes and screamed &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Treason! Treason!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Jehoiada the priest then directed the captains of the army to seize her and remove her from the House of the Lord and took her to the entrance of the king’s house and executed her there. The people then went to the house of Ba’al and tore it down along with his images and altars and killed Mattan the priest of Ba’al.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The young king Joash who was then seven years old, was led to his throne and the people of Judah rejoiced because they were finally free of wicked false Queen Athaliah and their rightful, lawful king was now on the throne. Young king Joash was mentored through his life by the priest Jehoiada who was a very godly man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Joash (Yeh’ho’arsh)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It was quite hard to find the meaning of this name, however a little extra digging revealed the meaning to be ‘Whom Jehovah gave’ or ‘Given by Jehovah’. I could find no history or background to this name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We’ve just learned that Joash is the grandson of Athaliah and Jehoram. It’s unknown if or how many wives his father Ahaziah had, but it’s safe to say &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“all the royal offspring”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; meant that Joash had quite a few siblings who were each in line for the throne of Judah after their father. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Kings 11:1-3)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Ahaziah wasn’t a particularly good king because his parents – Jehoram and Athaliah – were both very wicked Ba’al worshippers. Jehoram died leaving the throne to Ahaziah who also died, opening the way for Athaliah to seize the throne for herself. Before Joash could be murdered with the rest of his siblings, his sister and nurse along with Jehoiada the priest raised him in secret in the Temple. At the ripe old age of seven, Joash underwent his coronation and his grandmother Athaliah was executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Joash’s story can be read in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 Kings 11, 12&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;and &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 Chronicles 22, 24&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Jehoiada (Yeh-ho-ya’da) the priest became the personal tutor/guardian to you Joash and he guided the young king to re-establish the rightful worship of Yahweh, unfortunately, he didn’t remove the ‘high places’ that had been used for pagan worship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;One of the first things Joash did was to repair the Temple which had been defiled by Athaliah and her other children who had used Temple articles in the worship of Ba’al, all the people contributed to the funding of this project, it took a long time because the priests couldn’t get their act together, but by the time Joash was 23, the Temple once again became a place of great veneration of Yahweh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;You would think that being personally mentored by such a godly man as Jehoiada the priest, Joash would have learned a great deal about being a man of integrity, about the importance of obeying and trusting God, and that idolatry was pure wickedness that God would never turn a blind eye to. All his siblings were murdered because of the paganistic heart of his own grandmother, he himself would have fallen victim to her evil intentions had it not been for his righteous and godly sister, nurse and Jehoiada the priest. One would think that he of all people would understand the dangers of idolatry and paganism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;But it turned out that Joash was actually very weak in character because he very quickly turned away from all he’d been taught by Jehoiada after the old priest died. Without the godly influence of this man, Joash was easily influence by evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;2 Chron 24:17, ‘But after the death of Jehoiada the officials of Judah came and bowed down to the king, and the king listened to them.’&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Jew’s interpret this to mean that Joash actually allowed the princes of Judah to worship him and this is because the word ‘bowed’ means to prostrate oneself, to give homage to as before a false god. This led the people right back into paganism. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verse 18, ‘They abandoned the house of the Lord, the God of their fathers, and served the Asherim and the idols; so wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their guilt.’ &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God sent prophets to Joash to warn him to return to the Lord but he refused to listen, and then Jehoiada’s son Zechariah – also a prophet and priest, stood up and confronted the king and the people for their sin and Joash and his men conspired against Zechariah and stoned him to death in the court of the Temple. The son of the priest who saved his life as a baby, who mentored him throughout his life and taught him the ways of the Lord; Joash stoned his him to death. That was the level of Joash’s ingratitude toward Jehoiada and the extent of his own delusion in believing himself to be divine because he foolishly allowed his own princes to worship him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In Rabbinical literature, Joash is believed to be one of four men who pretended to be ‘gods’, his princes persuaded him to believe he was divine and apparently said to him, &lt;em&gt;“Wert thou not a god thou couldst not come out alive from the Holy of Holies”. &lt;/em&gt;It would appear that at some point in his reign after Jehoiada died, that Joash must have entered the Holy of Holies and wasn’t struck dead. (What was the king doing in the Holy of Holies? Only the High Priest once per year was allowed into the Holy of Holies...Joash was assuming authority that he didn’t have).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;During a battle with the Arameans, Joash discovered he wasn’t really a god at all, he was very sick from serious wounds he received from the fight and while he was recovering in his bed, two of his servants conspired against him and killed him because he had murdered Zechariah, Jehoiada’s son. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Chron 24:25) &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Rabbinical literature says that the two servants who killed Joash were an Ammonite and a Moabite, chosen by God to deliver judgement on him saying, “Let the descendants of the two ungrateful families chastise the ungrateful Joash.” (Rabbinical literature)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We as parents raise our children to know and love the Lord, we teach them right from wrong and how important it is to know the Saviour, and can be totally flabbergasted by the choices and lifestyles they choose to lead once they leave the nest and even sometimes even before they leave the nest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The truth is that every human being is answerable to God for the choices and decisions they make. Children from Christian homes sometimes become reprobate denying what they know to be true and children from very ungodly homes can become the most righteous and godly people who come to faith in Christ and go on to represent the Lord well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;At the end of the day, God is the only One who can reach into a human heart no matter what their background or upbringing, and He alone has the power to save them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If you don’t know Christ as Saviour, this is what Peter said on the day the church was born...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acts 2:38-39, ‘...Repent and each of you be baptised in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For the promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off, as many as the Lord our God will call to Himself.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The purity of the Gospel is simply this, Christ died in our place for our sins, He was buried and three days later He rose from the dead. He was seen alive by more than 500 eye witnesses. Because of our sin, we live under a death sentence, and God is a righteous judge who must judge sin. If He doesn’t judge, He’s not just. But because Christ paid our debt and offers us salvation freely, we can be free from that death sentence and made righteous before God by accepting Christ’s payment for us. It’s really very simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Our response is to be &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;repentance&lt;/span&gt; – turning away from our sin in heart and mind and turning to Christ – and putting our &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;faith&lt;/span&gt; in Him alone for what He did on our behalf. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;REPENTANCE &amp;amp; FAITH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;That’s the power and simplicity of the Gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If your heart is responding to the Gospel of Christ you don’t need any special prayer or ritual, just find a quiet place to do business with the Father. You simply need to come humbly and respectfully before God, confess your sins and repent (turn away from), ask Him to forgive you and put your faith in Christ alone. Talk with God from your own heart and be honest with Him; God knows the truth anyway, and you can’t keep secrets from Him. God seeks a genuine heart of repentance and faith in His Son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Please contact us if you have responded to the Gospel as we would be honoured to assist you in your new relationship with Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If you do know Christ, this is God’s Word to you;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hebrews 12:28-29, ‘Therefore, since we receive a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us show gratitude, by which we may offer to God an acceptable service with reverence and awe; for our God is a consuming fire.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We didn’t choose God – God chose us. It’s incumbent upon us to live lives of gratitude and not think more highly of ourselves than we should. In other words, stop believing our own press and believe God’s Word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Don’t be like Joash who thought he was vastly more than he really was. Don’t ever forget the price that was paid to provide you (us) with salvation, but live a life that exemplifies gratitude and devotion to the ONE who sacrificed all on your (our) behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

6702,Home Group Notes - Jezebel,"&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin-right: 10px; float: left;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/724407_24295926 small.jpg&quot; height=&quot;198&quot; width=&quot;264&quot; /&gt;Jezebel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Pronounced ‘Ee-zev-el’; this name is synonymous with absolute malevolent evil. It’s not particularly easy to find an exact meaning for this name; the first part of her name in Hebrew is ‘ay’, it’s also in Ahab’s name, it means ‘jackal’ and possibly other things as well - it’s not definitive. The last part of her name, ‘zabal’ may mean a place designated to honour its occupant. This word is used in Scripture five times in this context:- for God’s Temple, for the heavens and for an earthly mansion. Both parts of her name put together however are believed to mean ‘un-exalted’ or ‘un-husbanded or unmarried’ or possibly ‘without cohabitation’. There are some who believe her name means ‘where is the exalted one or prince?’, and others believe that the root words from which this name is derived mean ‘there is no husband or prince’ suggesting lack of character and morals and implying immorality, someone who goes with many men, and not faithful to one husband.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Jezebel was the daughter of the King of Phoenicia (Fon-eesha) – Ethbaal (Et’ba’al) – his capital being Tyre. Ethbaal was a priest of Ashtaroth (also known as Astarte’) who murdered Philetes (Fy-leet-as), king of Tyre and then assumed the throne. ‘Ba’al’ means lord or husband in Hebrew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Ahab (A’hav) married Jezebel not necessarily for love; he married her for the benefits that came to the Northern Kingdom through access to open trade routes via Phoenicia’s sea ports. It was a politically motivated marriage though he certainly wasn’t forced to marry her; he may very well have been attracted to her because she was so much like himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Jezebel obviously learned the despicable art of wickedness, betrayal, murder, manipulation, slander and thievery from her father and she was maniacally devoted to her own religion of Ba’al worship. One of the first things she did when she became queen of Israel was to aggressively target anyone and everyone who remained faithful to Yahweh. She specifically made a point of slaughtering loyal Hebrew prophets of Jehovah, and the prophet Obadiah (who amazingly served in the kings court, but for safety reasons probably kept his loyalty to Yahweh a secret) frantically tried to save some of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Serving in the royal court provided Obadiah with inside knowledge into the actions Jezebel was taking and he used this knowledge well to save as many godly prophets as he could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 Kings 18:3-4, ‘Ahab called Obadiah who was over the household. (Now Obadiah feared the Lord greatly; for when Jezebel destroyed the prophets of the Lord, Obadiah took a hundred prophets and hid them by fifties in a cave, and provided them with bread and water.)’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Jezebel also imported prophets of Ba’al and she and Ahab established what we would call a ‘state sanctioned religion’; they did everything they could to stamp out any residual worship of Yahweh, and imposed the worship of Ba’al instead. Jezebel was not satisfied to simply allow the religious coexistence of Yahweh and Ba’al worship; she insisted that the worship of Ba’al replace the worship of Yahweh in its absolute entirety. Unlike our own society that allows for freedom of religion, Jezebel had zero tolerance for any religion other than her own, people were not afforded the right to choose whom they would worship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This rise in pagan worship and idolatry (which was already rampant in the Northern Kingdom because of the apostasy from all the previous wicked kings) brought about God’s judgement. He closed up the heavens and Israel was ravaged by drought. No matter how much wealth and prosperity came through the international trade agreements with their pagan neighbours, if the people couldn’t grow food, they couldn’t survive. God proved to them all, especially Ahab and Jezebel that He was the One True God with real power, not Ba’al...who couldn’t make a drop of water fall from the sky. God spoke through Elijah and said no rain would fall for three and a half years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We learned last week that this eventually lead to the confrontation on Mt Carmel between Elijah and the prophets of Ba’al, resulting in God really showing off His unparalleled power and climaxing when Elijah slaughtered the false prophets of the false god Ba’al.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What is really surprising is Elijah’s reaction to Jezebel’s response. Elijah didn’t seem to be afraid so much of Ahab, but he was petrified of Jezebel. It appears in Scripture that as wicked as Ahab was he could at least be reasoned with somewhat, but Jezebel was a different entity altogether. She had no conscience at all. She was determined to get her way no matter the cost and no matter who stood in her way. She had zero qualms about taking another human life if it got her what she wanted. For all intents and purposes, Jezebel was totally and utterly devoid of any moral compass or ethical rationale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When Jezebel heard that her pagan prophets had been slaughtered (just like she had slaughtered the prophets of Yahweh) she was inconsolably livid with rage and she sent a message to Elijah to say that before the sun set he was going to be in exactly the same state as they were. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;(1 Kings 19:1-4)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Elijah fled and was so scared he begged God to kill him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It can sometimes be hard to understand how Elijah could have been so overcome by fear at one threat from this woman, he had personally seen God’s mighty power demonstrated on Mt Carmel, but there was something so malevolent about Jezebel that everyone appeared to be in sheer terror of her. She really was a most evil woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Fortunately, Jezebel wasn’t able to find Elijah, but she set about replacing her false prophets and she got on with her wicked life...but she and Ahab did something a little later in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 Kings 21&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that has chilling similarities to historical events that took place during a particular period of church history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Last week we talked about King Ahab having a major dummy spit over the fact that his neighbour, Naboth (Na’voth) the Jezreelite, wouldn’t sell him his property to allow him to grow a vege patch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Naboth’s neighbouring property was the ancient inheritance of his family line promised by God and it was the inheritance for his own continuing family line. Ahab ranted around his palace and eventually went to bed, wouldn’t talk to anyone and refused to eat; behaving like a toddler throwing a paddy in the supermarket because his mother wouldn’t buy him an ice cream. Ahab didn’t try to steal it, he offered to pay Naboth for it and even to replace it with a better vineyard, but Naboth understood the laws of inheritance and land allotment and Ahab – who had zero regard for the laws of God and the laws of the land – wasn’t used to not getting his own way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Enter Jezebel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;She asked Ahab what he was sulking about and why he would eat, and he told her his unhappy story about not being able to grow a vege patch because of Naboth, his unco-operative neighbour. So Jezebel reminds him that he is the king after all! In other words, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;because you’re the king, you can do whatever you like! Rules don’t apply to you. Get up, have some lunch and chill out...I’ll take care of it! &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Can you see any similarities in what Jezebel did next that remind you of events from church history?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jezebel wrote letter’s in Ahab’s name and sealed them with his seal (that is, the authority of the king himself)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They were addressed to the elders and nobles of Naboth’s community instructing them to proclaim a fast and to ensure that Naboth was the reason for this gathering. This was not a celebration to pretend to honour Naboth, rather it was very much like a public trial. It was a serious event that was tantamount to a legal proceeding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This trial was to be held in public, with the community leaders presiding and Naboth was in the hot seat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jezebel further instructed the elders that two false witnesses (men without conscience) be brought forward to state before everyone present that they heard Naboth blaspheme both God and the king. In other words, charges were to be brought against Naboth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jezebel’s instructions were explicit, the charges had to be such that the result would require the death penalty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Jezebel knew exactly how to manipulate the laws of Israel; she knew that the charge of blasphemy held a death sentence and it could only be upheld with a minimum of two corroborating witnesses. The elders and nobles were obviously terrified of Jezebel, they themselves may have been Ba’al worshippers but what is clear, is that these instructions from Jezebel in Ahab’s name were very obviously false. The charges were clearly trumped up and they knew that Naboth was an innocent man. But just like Elijah, these community leaders were absolutely terrified of Jezebel and didn’t even consider once saying no to her orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Once the trial had taken place and judgement had been handed down, Naboth and his sons were taken out and stoned to death and their bodies left unburied. They were ultimately eaten by wild dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Killing Naboth’s sons meant there could be no legal claims to the property. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;2 Kings 9:26&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;As soon as Naboth’s murder was reported to Jezebel, she went straight to Ahab to tell him the good news that Naboth was dead and he could go and claim the property for himself. Ahab was so pleased he went down straight away to gloat over his new acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;So in short.....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ahab wanted Naboth’s property but had no legal means of obtaining it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In order to get Naboth’s property, Jezebel arranged for a mock trial, complete with false witnesses to &amp;nbsp;ensure Naboth’s condemnation and subsequent execution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Naboth’s property was seized and became the property of the king.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Naboth’s rightful heirs were also executed, being implicated in their father’s so-called crimes to prevent their rightful, lawful claim on that property.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This sequence of events is shockingly mirrored in the inquisitions of medieval church history which spanned a period of approximately 1000 years during what is appropriately termed the ‘Dark Ages’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The state sanctioned church of that day – which was predominantly made up of unbelievers who simply sought personal church leadership positions to gain personal power and wealth – became reprehensibly rich through the implementation of what we know as the ‘Inquisitions’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Property and wealth from those who wouldn’t conform was easily obtained. All that was required was the mere hint of an accusation against someone for the crime of heresy. Such accusations could be levelled by anyone for any reason, and accusers would often be rewarded by the church leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;One neighbour who had a fight or grudge against another neighbour could make an accusation of criticism against the church or church teaching and the accused would be dragged before their religious court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Trials were conducted and false witnesses brought forward with their rehearsed testimonies. (Read that as ’bribery’, their false testimonies were ‘bought &amp;amp; paid’ for). Often the innocent victim was tortured mercilessly until a confession was finally given and then they were publicly executed where their so-called crimes were announced, their so-called admissions were proclaimed and their so-called ‘lawful’ executions were implemented. All property was then ceded to the church with no redress available to the rightful heirs of the executed party. Sometimes whole families were executed together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There is nothing that the human heart can devise that hasn’t already been anticipated in God’s Word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The question can then be asked...”Why is it that the wicked always seem to prosper in their wickedness, while the righteous seem to struggle and suffer wrongfully?” “How can this be God’s way?” It’s easy to look at those who live wickedly and wonder why they appear to not only get away with their wickedness, but they prosperous from it. David wrote about this in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Psalm 73&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;But the God tells us in His Word that He will absolutely deal with the wicked who remain unrepentant, but He will deal with them in His time and in His way and it’s entirely His business how and when He does that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Psalm 37:7-10, ‘Rest in the Lord and wait patiently for Him; do not fret because of him who prospers in his way, because of the man who carries out wicked schemes. Cease from anger and forsake wrath; do not fret; it leads only to evildoing. For evildoers will be cut off, but those who wait for the Lord, they will inherit the land. Yet a little while and the wicked man will be no more; and you will look carefully for his place and he will not be there.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The day of recompense for the wicked will come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What was Jezebel’s end? After the debacle with Naboth’s vineyard, good ol’ Elijah was sent to give Ahab a message of judgement at the exact time that Ahab was inspecting his newly acquired property - standing on the very ground he had just stolen from innocent Naboth. Elijah’s words would have been quite a shock to Ahab because the entire set up was secret...it was a complete contrivance to ‘look like’ a legitimate trial. Ahab came face to face with the fact that he has no secrets from God. Yahweh sees and knows everything, and doom was pronounced on Ahab and his family line, judgement that was virtually identical to the judgement declared on Jeroboam. Indeed, Ahab and Jezebel would reap what they had sown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Because Naboth and his sons were left to be eaten by dogs, so would Jezebel be eaten by dogs. She was greatly feared by everyone, but she was also greatly hated by everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;After Ahab died in battle, a man by the name of Jehu approached the place where Jezebel was staying, he called out to others who were in the building with her, calling for them to throw her from the high window she was standing in. They did. She died on impact and Jehu proceeded to trample her body under the hooves of his horse and then left it there to go inside and have something to eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Once he’d finished his lunch he decided to bury her because despite her unbelievable wickedness, she was after all, still royalty!!! However, when he went outside dogs had eaten or dragged her remains away leaving nothing but her skull, feet and the palms of her hands behind. A very gruesome end to a particularly evil woman. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;(2 Kings 9:29-37)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;This was fulfilled prophecy because there was to be no memorial or place where she would be buried, remembered or honoured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;No matter how successful the wicked may appear to be, we should never envy their seeming success and prosperity; their lives and their wealth are short lived and eternity lasts a long, long, long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;James 4:14&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;describes the duration of a human lifespan as a vapour;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;‘Yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow. You are just a vapour that appears for a little while and then vanishes away.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The following proverb describes Ahab and Jezebel to a ‘T’....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proverbs 21:6-7, ‘The acquisition of treasures by a lying tongue is a fleeting vapour, the pursuit of death. The violence of the wicked will drag them away, because they refuse to act with justice.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It’s better to enter eternity with a righteous and uncompromising heart, knowing that your eternal salvation is in God’s hands, rather than to enter eternity under the judgement and wrath of God all for the sake of gaining material wealth and comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Ahab and Jezebel knew who the One True God was, they had seen with their own eyes His power and glory, but they were too foolish, too selfish and too arrogant to reverently fear Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Don’t be like them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ecclesiastes 12:13-14, ‘The conclusion, when all has been heard is: fear God and keep His commandments, because this applies to every person. For God will bring every act to judgement, everything which is hidden, whether it is good or evil.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

6630,Home Group Notes - Ahab,"&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin-right: 8px; float: left;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/575231_55762839 small.jpg&quot; height=&quot;263&quot; width=&quot;346&quot; /&gt;King Ahab (Akh-av)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Ahab’s name is made up of two elements, ‘ah’ &amp;amp; ‘ab’. ‘Ah’ holds a surface meaning of ‘brother’ and ‘Ab’ holds the meaning of ‘father’ from which we know the Hebrew word ‘Aba’. Therefore, the commonly held meaning of Ahab is ‘the Father is my brother’ which in turn is believed to mean ‘God is my close relative’. Knowing the life history of Ahab, we know that this is entirely untrue for him personally; he was a wicked king who hated God. There is however, another possible meaning; the ancient Hebrew word for brother has an identical spelling to the word used for an exclamation of grief as well as for the word used for jackal; though it has a slightly different pronunciation. So while the name Ahab is commonly believed to mean ‘the Father is my brother’, what is more akin to his personality is that he was a jackal, he brought immense grief to his people because of his wickedness and corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The history of Ahab can be read in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 Kings 16&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;right through to 1 Kings 22; 2 Chron 18.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Ahab was the son of Omri and he ruled Israel (Northern Kingdom), who was the first king of Israel to successfully establish a stable political government, none of his predecessors had been able to achieve this. Ahab reigned from 841-814 BC and he was fortunate in that he was able to simply continue to rule the nation upon stability inherited from his father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;He was a very wicked king. In fact, Ahab was considered to be the most wicked of all Israel’s kings up to that time. He was married to a woman named Jezebel who was a princess from Phoenicia which was situated along the Mediterranean coast north of Israel, in Lebanon. Tyre was the capital of Phoenicia. Ahab’s marriage was a political alliance that had to do with peace agreements and trade, it was not a marriage borne of love by any means, but Ahab and Jezebel got along very, very well because they were of the same heart and mind; they were both incredibly wicked and corrupt. Theirs was a match made in heaven...or more appropriately ‘hell’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Israel’s first king, Jeroboam, established places of pagan worship to prevent the people feeling the need to travel to the Temple in Jerusalem, he basically convinced the people that they were worshipping Yahweh, just in idol form, but Ahab went even further than that by setting up ‘Ba’al’ as being equal to Yahweh. Just as Solomon allowed his foreign wives to practice their own particular brands of pagan worship, Ahab allowed Jezebel to introduce the worship of ‘Ba’al-Melqart’ who was the chief god of Tyre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Ahab knew who the One True God was and he even gave names to his children that were expressions of Yahweh’s attributes. He held a superficial adherence to or connection to Yahweh because of his Hebrew roots, but he indulged and encouraged rabid paganism and its associated rites and practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;One of the most notable things that came to Israel during Ahab’s reign was monetary success for the people because of the foreign trade agreements he forged with the Phoenicians and others. In fact, Ahab had a palace that was build out of ivory – this man lacked for nothing, he denied himself nothing and indulged himself with everything. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never mistake monetary or material wealth for the blessing and/or approval of God – one does not necessarily equate to the other. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There are three main things that Ahab is most known for;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His evil wife Jezebel whom we will look at next week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His excessive encouragement of paganism and idolatry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His shocking treatment of Naboth his close neighbour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Ahab had an intense hatred for true God-fearing prophets. He surrounded himself with false prophets who supposedly spoke the words of Yahweh, but in fact spoke only what they knew Ahab wanted them to say. This is clear in the story of King Jehoshaphat who aligned himself with Ahab to fight against the Syrians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 Chron 18:6-22, ‘But Jehoshaphat said, “Is there not yet a prophet of the Lord here that we may inquire of him?” The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the Lord, but I hate him, for he never prophesies good concerning me but always evil. He is Micaiah, son of Imla.” But Jehoshaphat said, “Let not the king say so.” Then the king of Israel called an officer and said, “Bring quickly Micaiah, Imla’s son.” Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, and they were sitting at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them. Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made horns of iron for himself and said, “Thus says the Lord, ‘With these you shall gore the Arameans until they are consumed.’ All the prophets were prophesying thus, saying, “Go up to Ramoth-Gilead and succeed, for the Lord will give it into the hand of the king.” Then the messenger who went to summon Micaiah spoke to him saying, “Behold, the words of the prophets are uniformly favourable to the king. So please let your word be like one of them and speak favourably.” But Micaiah said, “As the Lord lives, what my God says, that will I speak.” When he came to the king, the king said to him, “Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-Gilead to battle or shall I refrain?” He said, “Go up and succeed, for they will be given into your hand.” Then the king said to him, “How many times must I adjure you to speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of the Lord?” So he said, “I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, like sheep which have no shepherd; and the Lord said, ‘These have no master. Let each of them return to his house in peace.’” Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me but evil?” Micaiah said, “Therefore, hear the word of the Lord. I saw the Lord sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing on His right and on His left. The Lord said, ‘Who will entice Ahab king of Israel to go up and fall at Ramoth-Gilead?’ And one said this while another said that. Then a spirit came forward and stood before the Lord and said, ‘I will entice him.’ And the Lord said to him, ‘How?’ He said, ‘I will go and be a deceiving spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’ Then He said, ‘You are to entice him and prevail also. Go and do so.’ Now therefore, behold, the Lord has put a deceiving spirit in the mouth of these your prophets, for the Lord has proclaimed disaster against you.’”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s an important word of caution to every believer in every generation to listen to the &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Word of God&lt;/span&gt; which is the sanctioned, canonised, proven, trustworthy and dependable Word of God; everything within the Bible, from Genesis to Revelation is &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;sufficient&lt;/span&gt; for every believer. We are not to live by the words of those who claim to be speaking special the words from God. Men fail...in fact men always fail, but God’s Word remains true and faithful. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The bizarre thing about this is that Ahab knew that Micaiah wasn’t prophesying according to the word of God when he gave the same initial speech as all his false prophets. He was angry with Micaiah for not being truthful to start with, and then got angry with him when he in fact did prophesy the truth to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sinful human beings know within their own heart what is true and what is false...and to justify themselves and their behaviour, they surround themselves with people who will indulge them and tell them what they want to hear. But if a real man or woman from God happens to be there, they expect and demand nothing but the truth, otherwise, they consider them frauds and hypocrites. They recognise immediately when a godly person doesn’t tell them the truth, even if it’s the same information they’ve received from their ‘yes men’, but when a godly person does speak truth, they hate them for it. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There was a particular prophet who was especially frustrating to Ahab and his name was Elijah. We’ll look at Elijah another time, but Elijah had the unenviable job of issuing Ahab many prophetic words of rebuke and judgement because of the wickedness he promoted and indulged in. Elijah spent a great deal of time hiding from Ahab because this prophet was such a thorn in his side. Every time Ahab would do something, Elijah would turn up without notice and pour cold water all over it by declaring God’s anger at him and of the impending judgement that was going to unfold as a result of his wickedness. Before he could be captured, Elijah would disappear again – it was Ahab’s greatest frustration that he could never capture or silence this most persistent prophet of God – his nemesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Ahab called Elijah a ‘troubler of Israel’ because at Elijah’s word, the heavens closed and Israel had no rain for three years. However Elijah stunned Ahab by declaring his face he was the cause of all Israel’s troubles because of his wickedness, paganism and idolatry, and it was this exchange the lead to the challenge by Elijah to all the prophets of Ba’al on Mt Carmel. Ahab was silent during that contest but he saw dramatically and powerfully that Ba’al was a fake, impotent god and Yahweh was the One and only True God. In fact, after this contest, Elijah gave immediate instructions to Ahab about what he was to do and where he was to go, promising that the drought was about to break, demonstrating the power of God yet again, and he – Ahab – obeyed them exactly, and sure enough God sent rain upon the land at Elijah’s word. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(1 Kings 18)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Ahab was without excuse; he had every reason to believe in Yahweh and to repent, he had no reason whatsoever to continue with the paganism that he had allowed to rampantly overrun his nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;One of the most unattractive attributes of Ahab is that he was a prize sook. He was incredibly childish. After an incident with Ben-hadad in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 Kings 20&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, one of the prophets delivered a message of rebuke to him for letting that wicked Aramean king escape when God had deemed he be destroyed. (remember King Saul and the Amalekites) Because Ahab got a message that didn’t appeal to him, he went home all sullen and moody. This is exactly how he behaved when he tried to get the property of his next door neighbour – Naboth. (Na-voth)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God gave very clear instructions about land ownership to Moses; family land and tribal land allotments were to be maintained. Even if a family or community fell on hard times, they would at least always have land on which they could live and grow food. If times were especially hard, they could lease their land to others, but every Jubilee year, the land was to revert to its original owner. All debts were cancelled and all ‘slaves’ or bond-servants were to be released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Ahab wanted the land next door to make a herb or vegetable garden...because being the king he needed to grow his own veges! (sarcasm!!!) Naboth informed the king respectfully that he couldn’t sell him his land because it was the inheritance he had received from his father’s (generations of fathers going back to the original land allotments when Israel took Canaan). Naboth owned a vineyard, it was his livelihood and it was the inheritance he would in turn hand on to his own sons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What was Ahab’s response? He had a royal ‘sook attack’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 Kings 21:4, ‘So Ahab came into his house sullen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #333333;&quot;&gt;(sook)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;and vexed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #333333;&quot;&gt;(ranted and raved)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him; for he said, “I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.” And he lay down on his bed and turned his face and ate no food.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;He threw a tantrum like a small child who doesn’t get his own way. It’s as though he laid down and held his breath until he turned blue just so others would give in to him. What he needed was a good swift kick on his royal behind!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What happened next we’ll take a look at next week when we learn more about Jezebel, but what we can look at now, is that after this horrendous situation with Naboth, Elijah tracked Ahab down and gave him a stinging judgement over what he had just done. A judgemental word from God – whom Ahab KNEW was real because he had seen His power numerous times, not least during the challenge on Mt Carmel – was enough to instil Ahab with great fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Ahab tore his clothes (a sign of grief) and put on sackcloth and ashes (a sign of repentance) and he fasted as well. He became very despondent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Having sin exposed and experiencing the conviction of God is not a bad thing even though it’s unpleasant to experience. In fact, it’s a very good thing if it leads us to be regretful for our sin and to repentance. The very fact that God immediately spoke to Elijah after seeing Ahab in this contrite manner, said He wouldn’t bring evil upon Ahab in his lifetime, but rather in his son’s lifetime who turned out to be as wicked as his father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We don’t see any long-term change of heart or deep repentance from Ahab, we see him as a rebel right to the very end. It appears that his short-lived repentance was motivated by little more than his sorrow at being caught out, rather than sorrow over his sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;What we do see from this however, is the extreme and even exorbitant grace that God shows to those who will repent of their sin. Often people read the Old Testament (Tenach) and deduce that God is bloodthirsty and tyrannical, demanding the deaths of millions of innocents. What people fail to realise is that God isn’t willing that any should perish...Jew or Gentile...and that He sent warning after warning after warning over hundreds and hundreds of years and demonstrated His deity and power through stunning miracles to prove to everyone that He would indeed bring judgement if they didn’t repent of their sin. Since every human being is sinful, there is no such thing as an innocent human being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God gave them multiplied centuries to turn to Him and they refused...both Jew and Gentile. So when God eventually sent judgement it wasn’t because He was bloodthirsty and cruel, it was because He is a just judge who must deal with unrighteousness, in exactly the same way earthly judges bring down the full weight of the law on human beings who break the laws of the land. If God doesn’t judge, He’s not just or righteous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Romans 2:2-6, ‘And we know that the judgement of God rightly falls upon those who practice such things. But do you suppose this, O man, when you pass judgement on those who practice such things and do the same yourself, that you will escape the judgement of God? &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Or do you think lightly of the riches of His kindness and tolerance and patience, not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance?&lt;/span&gt; But because of your stubbornness and unrepentant heart you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgement of God, who will render to each person according to his deeds.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The lesson of Ahab, king of Israel is not simply to know that God is the One True God, it is to humble ourselves and repent so that we can be made right with God. Repentance over sorrow for sin, not sorrow over being caught out in sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It’s the difference between genuine repentance for sin as opposed to opportunistic repentance to avoid judgement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

6578,Home Group Notes - Jehoshaphat,"&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin-right: 10px; float: left;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/567311_74756230 small.jpg&quot; height=&quot;212&quot; width=&quot;282&quot; /&gt;Jehoshaphat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The elements that make up his name are ‘Jah’ or ‘Jehu’ which are abbreviated forms of Yahweh, the name of the Lord, and ‘shapat’ which means judgement in a penal sense being understood as justice, ordinance, custom, manner. Ultimately being a reference to God ushering in His judgement day. So Jehoshaphat means ‘Yahweh has Judged’ or ‘The Lord Judges.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The prophet Joel lived after the rule of Jehoshaphat and he prophesied in Joel 3:2 that God would gather the nations into the Valley of Jehoshaphat to judge them for what they have done to His people Israel and for dividing up His land. It's no coincidence that the 'valley' is named Jehoshaphat becuse it's a valley of the Lord's judgement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There are three men and one valley named Jehoshaphat in the Bible, we are looking at King Jehoshaphat who was the fourth king of Judah. He ruled at the same time that Ahab, Ahaziah and Jehoram were kings in Israel, the Northern Kingdom. It was during his reign that the prophets Elijah and Elisha also lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Generally, Jehoshaphat is considered to be a good king, one of only 8 good kings from the Southern Kingdom of Judah. The northern kingdom of Israel had no good kings at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;His father Asa was a good king and Jehoshaphat followed after his father and his great, great, great grandfather David, in that he didn’t worship the baal’s, but rather sought to follow the Word of God and the commands laid out in it. He was a strong leader and kept his kingdom under solid control with his people bringing him tribute and this brought him both great wealth and honour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There were many good things that he did, in the first years of his rule he earnestly sought to honour God but didn’t begin removing the places of pagan worship until later in his reign where he became more aggressive about it, and while he did remove a lot he didn’t remove them all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;His father Asa was very wise in ensuring Judah was militarily capable of defending itself against any possible sign of aggression from Israel to the north and Jehoshaphat followed in the same vein by placing his army in all the fenced cities of Judah, he set garrisons throughout the land and in the cities of Ephraim which his father had fought Israel for and won back. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Chron 17:1-2)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The greatest thing Jehoshaphat did to strengthen Judah was in his obedience to the Law of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 Chron 17:7-10 ‘Then in the third year of his reign he sent his officials, Ben-hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah; and with them the Levites, Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah and Tobadonijah, the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests. They taught in Judah, having the book of the law of the Lord with them; and they went throughout all the cities of Judah and taught among the people. Now the dread of the Lord was on all the kingdoms of the lands which were around Judah, so that they did not make war against Jehoshaphat.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;By restoring reverence and a priority to the Word of God, Jehoshaphat placed his nation under the incredible protection of God. The dread of the Lord settled on all the surrounding nations who were historically their sworn enemies. In fact, their most vitriolic enemies – the Philistines – brought gifts of silver to Jehoshaphat, the Arabians brought him flocks of rams and male goats – 7,700 of each! 15,400 animals meant extraordinary wealth in those days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;With this increase of wealth Jehoshaphat went on to build more fortresses and storage cities where he kept large supplies along with his army and non-military men who were valiant and patriotic. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Chron 17)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;It's also interesting to note that he used that wealth for the benefit and security of his people rather than lining his own pockets.&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In most cases, the kings of Judah and Israel were not friendly with one another, rather they were enemies, however Jehoshaphat wanted to make peace with Israel knowing that they were in fact brothers. He knew he could make peace with Israel because of the security measures he had taken to ensure the safety of Judah’s borders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This was Jehoshaphat’s biggest flaw; he should never have tried to align himself and his nation with wicked, godless kings. One of the worst being Ahab and his wife Jezebel who happened to be at war with Syria, he was also incredibly foolish in allowing his son to marry Ahab and Jezebel’s daughter Athaliah and we’ll find out her in coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;With his alliance in play, Jehoshaphat travelled north and king Ahab asked him if he would join him in battle against the Syrians, being a godly man, Jehoshaphat said he would but on condition they heard from God through a prophet. The short story is that the false prophets told Ahab exactly what he wanted to hear....that God wanted him to fight against the Syrians and God would guarantee him a glorious victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It must have been very obvious that these were false prophets because Jehoshaphat asked if there was any other prophet around whom they could ask for direction from God. Ahab said there was, his name is Micaiah but he hated him because he never gave him the answers he wanted. Jehoshaphat was horrified that king Ahab would be so disrespectful toward a man of God, but Ahab called for him to satisfy Jehoshaphat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;A tense conversation took place between the prophet and Ahab but the end result was that Ahab went to battle and convinced Jehoshaphat to go with him. Jehoshaphat should have been suspicious when Ahab told him to dress like the king while he, the king of Israel, would dress like a normal member of the army.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Of course, an enemy commander is going to target the leader of the enemy forces because if you kill the leader you conquer the followers quickly and easily. Jehoshaphat should have realised he was being set up to be the target while Ahab was protecting his own wicked hide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The battle went badly for Israel but Jehoshaphat called on the Lord who saved him from being killed and when he got home, he was rebuked by the prophet Jehu who told him that God was angry with him for trying to help and assist those who hated God. He repented and refocused his efforts to steer the nation in righteousness and kept well away from the Northern Kingdom of Israel. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(1 Kings 22:29-33)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;His lesson was short lived however, and twice more he foolishly tried to align himself with Israel in an attempt to make ships that would go all the way to Tarshish. God sent word to him to say that because he had joined with the wicked king Ahaziah of Israel, God would break the ships and that’s exactly what happened. Jehoshaphat had to give that project away. The next foolish operation he joined with Israel for was a war against Moab; it was a military success but the prophet Elisha rebuked him and told him to mind his own business and look after his own nation. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Chron 20:35-37 &amp;amp;&amp;nbsp; 2 Kings 3:11-14)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;One of the things he did very well however was seen during the time that the Moabites, Ammonites and some of the Meunites and Edomites from Mt Seir, collectively came together to make war against Jehoshaphat. When he was told of this vast multitude coming together against him he knew that his own army wasn’t big enough to counter them. Together they were just too much. The Ammonites and Moabites were the descendants of Lot (Abraham’s nephew), the result of his incestuous relationships with his daughters. The Meunites were an Arab tribe that lived on the border of Judah; probably a small tribe or clan from among the Arabians, believed to be the descendants of Abraham and his second wife Keturah whom he married after Sarah had died and the Edomites were the descendants of Esau. All these people were the immediate relatives of the Israelites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Jehoshaphat gave his full attention to the Lord, he called a nationwide fast and stood among the people in Jerusalem, in the Temple and prayed with all his heart to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 Chron 20:6-12, ‘and he said, “O Lord, the God of our fathers, are You not God in the heavens? And are You not ruler over all the kingdoms of the nations? Power and might are in Your hand so that no one can stand against You. Did You not, O our God, drive out the inhabitants of this land before Your people Israel and give it to the descendants of Abraham Your friend forever? They have lived in it, and have built You a sanctuary there for Your name, saying, &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;‘Should evil come upon us, the sword, or judgement, or pestilence, or famine, we will stand before this house and before You (for Your name is in this house) and cry to You in our distress, and You will hear and deliver us.’&lt;/span&gt; Now behold, the sons of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir, whom You did not let Israel invade when they came out of the land of Egypt (they turned aside from them and did not destroy them), see how they are rewarding us by coming to drive us out from Your possession which You have given us as an inheritance. O our God, will You not judge them?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;For we are powerless before this great multitude who are coming against us; nor do we know what to do, but our eyes are on You.”’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The text goes on to say that all Judah was standing before the Lord including all the wives, infants and children; they were all desperate to hear from God that He would deliver them. Then Jahaziel, a Levite who ministered in the Temple prophesied to the king and all the people gathered there; God spoke and reassured them all that they didn’t need to be fearful or dismayed because God was going to fight this battle for them. God told them which way their enemies were going to approach them and He said they were to go down to meet them, but He emphasised again that they wouldn’t be required to fight, all they were required to do was position themselves in the right place, then stand and see the salvation of the Lord on their behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Jehoshaphat’s response to this word was immediate. He didn’t even once flinch or question or doubt. He bowed his head and prostrated himself on the ground and the people immediately followed suit and they worshipped the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;I think it’s very important to note here that Jehoshaphat proved to be a godly leader in the darkest time of his reign. He demonstrated exceptional leadership and humility by acknowledging that even though he was the king, he didn’t have the answers or the resources to deal with their dilemma, he needed God to see them through this emergency. He quickly believed God and appropriately led his nation in humble acceptance of God’s Word and appropriately led the people to reverently worship God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When times were less dangerous, he showed some serious lack of wisdom but not from a malicious or greedy heart, it may very well have been that Jehoshaphat was grieved over the division within the entire nation of Israel proper and had a genuine desire to see both the northern and southern kingdoms at least reunited as friends even if they couldn’t be one single nation again. He wanted to ensure peace for Judah, and possibly his altruistic motives were misplaced because God didn’t want him to align with the rampant wickedness that was embraced so willingly in the north.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;But Jehoshaphat’s real deep love for God came to the fore when these combined armies marched against him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;With Jehoshaphat in the lead, the people rose early in the morning and went to the place God instructed them, then he said to the people, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Listen to me, O Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem, put your trust in the Lord your God and you will be established. Put your trust in His prophets and succeed.” (2 Chron 20:20)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The next thing he did was very important, he consulted with the people – he got their input, the agreement and their heart; he appointed the Levites, those whose role it was to maintain worship around the clock in the Temple (this was established by King David); these worshipping priests from the tribe of Levi went ahead of the army singing, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Give thanks to the Lord, for His lovingkindness is everlasting”. (2 Chron 20:21)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;They were not at the battle field yet, they hadn’t even laid eyes on their enemies at this point, they were at the place where God said to congregate and they began their march &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the battle front with the Levites out front leading the people with praise. As soon as the singing began, the text says that &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;the Lord set ambushes against the sons of Ammon, Moab and Mt Seir and they were utterly routed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; – Ammon and Moab attacked the Edomites and when they’d destroyed them, they proceeded to attack each other. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Chron 20:22-23)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When Judah finally came to the lookout of the wilderness, they looked toward the multitude...and there were bodies all over the ground....NOT ONE escaped the carnage and Judah didn’t raise a sword to make it happen. They didn’t even see the battle. It was over before they got there. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Chron 20:24)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It took Judah 3 days to collect the spoils of a battle they had no part in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;These high’s and low’s in the life of Jehoshaphat are not chronological, but what is really interesting to learn from his life, is that when he tried to align himself with Israel in the north, he always failed; yet when he trusted in the Lord whole-heartedly, he saw great success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The thing I marvel at most of all however, is that the people themselves, having seen God miraculously deliver them from these sworn enemies, continued to worship false gods after Jehoshaphat had died. What’s even more shocking is that his own son, Jehoram who acceded the throne after his father was a very wicked king, and he had seen firsthand, up close and personal so to speak, how his father failed when he sinned and succeeded when he trusted God, as well as seeing the power of God in a most remarkable way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It’s is human nature to call on God when you’re scared and when things improve, we quickly forget Him. This was seen very clearly after September 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The lesson of Jehoshaphat is to trust in God alone, never in men and alliances that we think will bring security. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

6406,Home Group Notes - Jeroboam,"&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin-right: 12px; margin-bottom: 10px; float: left;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.vision.org.au/images/blog_images/1058605_60297588 small.jpg&quot; height=&quot;252&quot; width=&quot;352&quot; /&gt;Jeroboam&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The name consists of two elements very similar to Rehoboam: The last part, ‘am’ means a people ranging from mankind to a specific nation, even to a population of a town or community, it can also mean kinsmen as in a family, clan or tribe. The first part is ‘rahab’ but with a slightly different meaning due to the verb roots; this time meaning ‘much to contain, increase in multitude’. So Jeroboam could mean ‘May the people increase’, ‘Whose people are countless’ OR, ‘The people contendeth’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This is very interesting because Jeroboam became the leader of the Northern Kingdom, the Northern Kingdom is also called 'Israel' and 'Ephraim' interchangeably in the OT - gaining rulership over the ten northern tribes after the people contended with Rehoboam, son of Solomon. Because Jeroboam was from the tribe of Ephraim, it's as though his own tribe really did increase to include ten whole tribes of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Jeroboam’s story can be found in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 Kings chapters 11–14; 2 Chronicles chapters 10 – 13; the book of Amos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and he is mentioned numerous times throughout &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; Kings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in conjunction with other kings after him because they did evil in the sight of the Lord following the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Jeroboam was of the tribe of Ephraim (Ephraim and Manasseh were the sons of Joseph) and Jeroboam was originally faithful to Solomon who established him as the overseer of the forced labour of the house of Joseph. So his job was to oppress his own tribe. However one day when Jeroboam was heading to Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah met him on the road; the prophet was wearing a new cloak and like many Biblical prophets, he did something physical to represent some event or circumstance that would take place. He took off his cloak and tore it into twelve pieces. Then he told Jeroboam to select ten pieces for himself and then Ahijah said in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;1 Kings 11:31-40, ‘“Take for yourself ten pieces; for thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, ‘Behold, I will tear the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon and give you ten tribes, but He will have one tribe for the sake of My servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel, because they have forsaken Me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the sons of Ammon; and they have not walked in My ways, doing what is right in My sight and observing My statutes and My ordinances as his father David did. Nevertheless I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand but I will make him ruler all the days of his life, for the sake of My servant David whom I chose, who observed My commandments and My statutes; but I will take the kingdom from his son’s hand and give it to you, even ten tribes. But to his son I will give one tribe, that My servant David may have a lamp always before Me in Jerusalem, the city where I have chosen to Myself to My name. I will take you, and you shall reign over whatever you desire, and you shall be king over Israel. Then it will be, that if you listen to all that I command you and walk in My ways, and do what is right in My sight by observing My statutes and My commandments, as My servant David did, then I will be with you and build you an enduring house as I built for David, and I will give Israel to you. Thus I will afflict the descendants of David for this, but not always.” (somehow Solomon found out about this encounter)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;Solomon sought therefore to put Jeroboam to death; but Jerobaom arose and fled to Egypt to Shishak king of Egypt, and he was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When Rehoboam, Solomon's son, was about to ascend the throne, Jeroboam comes back to Israel to champion the rights of the people (the ones he used to oppress) but his motivation for doing so was not for the betterment of the people, but rather to see the nation split with him inheriting the ten northern tribes and himself sitting on a throne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God made an enormous promise to Jeroboam if Jeroboam would be faithful to God’s Word and ways (remember that Jeroboam had zero claim to royalty, he was merely a privileged commoner);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He would be king&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His family line would become an enduring house&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He would rule over whatever he desired&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This promise wasn’t a rejection of David’s line or the covenant God made with David to bring forth Messiah, but this was a promise to Jeroboam and his family line if he would lead the ten northern tribes righteously and lead them out of the idolatry that Solomon had allowed and endorsed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;So when the northern tribes broke from the southern, the Jewish people became two separate nations geographically (not ethnically) with Israel to the north and Judah to the south.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Jeroboam knew that even though the people were entrenched in idol worship, they still held to the traditions of travelling to Jerusalem for feasts, festivals and sacrificial offerings at the Temple. To Jeroboam this was unacceptable because it might cause many of the people to want to rejoin to the house of David and see the nation reunited once again and, they might kill him for being a usurper to the throne, then he would have no throne at all. So to prevent this from happening, he first selected Shechem to be his capital and then he established two separate places for the people to visit to perform their religious sacrifices and rituals. Beth-el in the south and Dan in the north; in each place he erected a golden calf. He said to the people, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem; behold your gods, O Israel, that brought you up from the land of Egypt”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;1 Kings 12:28-33.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;These are the same words spoken in the wilderness when Aaron made the original golden calf. Do you know what they called that calf? Elohim. The same name for God in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gen 1:1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. The One True Living God. By erecting idols and naming them by the name of God Himself, the people could delude themselves into believing that they were worshipping God (Elohim) after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This also speaks to universalism today...all the world’s different religions do not worship the same God who simply goes by a different look or name, there is only one God and He will not share His glory with another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Jeroboam also established high places of pagan worship, he established a priesthood from all the tribes not just from the Levites, he established feasts for the people to follow on the same dates as the feasts being followed by their brethren in the south, but they were to pagan gods, and he simply made up the feasts from his own imagination. He essentially devised a religious program of worship that was focused on pagan deities but mimicked the ordinances that God had specified. He even took it upon himself to perform ceremonial acts that were restricted to the priests alone. &amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 Kings 12:28-33.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In fact, a man of God (prophet) from Judah travelled to Beth-el and called out against the pagan sacrifices being done there and Jeroboam stretched out his hand demanding that the prophet be seized and God made his hand shrivel up and he couldn’t withdraw it. The altar also split apart as the prophet had said would happen and Jeroboam asked him to pray to God for his healing...and God healed him! &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(1 Kings 13:1-6)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Jeroboam’s wickedness was extreme, but it’s even more so because he had been privileged to have real encounters with God. The prophet Ahijah gave him a direct promise from God Himself; he knew God was real and when he knew his life was in danger from Solomon, he fled to Egypt to wait. What God said would happen, actually did happen in exquisite detail. All he had to do was obey God’s instructions – which he was well aware of – and God would have blessed him and his family line for generations to come. Jeroboam knew God was real when God crippled his hand publicly and then healed it just as publicly. He could have immediately repented, removed the golden calf idols and the high places of pagan worship. The nation would have prospered and the people would have come out of their idolatry and the house of David would have endured the judgement of God and been disciplined for Solomon’s rebellion and for leading the people to sin and at the right time, the nation would have been either reunited or at least been allies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Instead of trusting God whose Word and promise came true before his very eyes, he set in place an apostate, state sanctioned pagan religious system of his own devising and led the people that God had entrusted to him into deeper and even worse idolatry than Solomon had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Instead of having his family line established for generations to come, God promised to cut off every male descendant and make a clean sweep of his entire house as one sweeps away dung until it’s all gone. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(1 Kings 14:10)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; God also promised that everyone of his descendants would never be buried; anyone from his line that died in the city was to be eaten by dogs and anyone of his descendants who died in a field would be eaten by birds. Only one child named Abijah, Jeroboam’s son would be buried because God said there was some good in him, and God took him at an early age. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(1 Kings 14:1-12)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Jeroboam established the worst kind of paganism in Israel and it set the tone for all the kings who followed after him. In fact, every king who ascended the throne of the northern kingdom was evil, there was not one godly, righteous king who ever sat on that throne. The Northern Kingdom lasted approximately 212 years, from 934 to 722 BC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This was not the case for the southern kingdom, they had mostly evil kings but a number of them were godly and righteous. The Southern Kingdom lasted approximately 348 years, from 934 to 586 BC, 136 years longer than her northern brethren. It’s amazing what a difference even a handful of righteous leaders will do for a nation’s future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;All men are without excuse when it comes to being accountable to God. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Romans 1:20 says, ‘For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If God holds all men accountable simply by the creation alone, then Jeroboam who had heard the Word of God, had been directly spoken to by God through the prophet Ahijah, had seen God’s Word come to pass, been crippled by God and subsequently healed by God is most definitely without excuse for rejecting God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We, who have multiple copies of God’s Word, who have heard God’s Word directly declared and proclaimed, who can look back through history and see that every Word of God has come to pass in incredible detail are even more accountable before God to obey Him. Remember that everyone and everything in the Bible is for our learning, so by looking at the life of Jeroboam, we can clearly see his sins and wickedness and how seriously God takes such things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We have godly examples too and we can compare the Jeroboam’s of the Bible with the Daniel’s and Joseph’s and Paul’s of the Bible and see very clearly what and who God honours and what and who God condemns and judges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

6360,Home Group Notes - Rehoboam,"&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Rehoboam&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The name Rehoboam is a compilation of two elements; ‘rahab’ which means to be wide to indicate the dimensions of land or an object; ‘am’ meaning ‘a people’. So Rehoboam means ‘Enlarges The People’ or ‘The people are enlarged’. Ironically, his aggressive and self-indulgent behaviour had the opposite effect on the nation he ascended the throne to rule over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Rehoboam was the son of Solomon and his wife Naamah who was an Ammonitess. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(1 Kings 14:21)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It’s a curious thing that out of all his wives Solomon’s successor was the son of an Ammonite, who were the ancestors of Lot, (Abraham’s nephew) so they were distant relatives. Solomon’s favourite wife was an Egyptian, daughter of Pharaoh but, it’s unlikely his royal court or the people would have approved having an Egyptian sit upon their throne considering their past history of slavery and oppression at the hand of the Egyptians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;To understand what situation Rehoboam inherited, we need to take a quick look back at Solomon; Solomon began well but became very impressed with himself and despite the gift of wisdom granted to him by God, he ignored God’s instructions to the future kings of Israel and he acquired wealth, political power and wives for himself. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Deuteronomy 17:14-17)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The latter (1000 of them) did not love and believe in Yahweh, instead they continued to worship their own false gods and Solomon permitted it and eventually joined them in their pagan worship and practices. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(1 Kings 11)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;God told Solomon in 1 King’s 11:9-13, ‘Now the Lord was angry with Solomon because his heart was turned away from the Lord, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice, and had commanded him concerned this thing, that he should not go after other gods; but he did not observe what the Lord had commanded. So the Lord said to Solomon, “Because you have done this, and you have not kept My covenant and My statutes, which I have commanded you, I will surely tear the kingdom from you and will give it to your servant. Nevertheless, I will not do it in your days for the sake of your father David, but I will tear it out of the hand of your son. However, I will not tear away all the kingdom but I will give one tribe to your son for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem which I have chosen.”’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Even when God is committed to disciplining His people when they rebelled, God STILL remains committed to His promises to His Word.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Solomon had not only polluted the land with foreign pagan gods and idolatrous practices, but his ambition for building a magnificent capital and grand building projects led him to implement exorbitant taxes and levies which were a heavy burden on the people as well as enforcing forced labour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It’s amazing that when men reject God, they quickly embrace the attitude that human beings are little more than a commodity to be used for selfish aggrandisement and are expendable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When Solomon dies, Rehoboam is called to his coronation in the city of Shechem which was situated within the territory of the ten tribes outside the district of Judah and Benjamin where Jerusalem was situated. In this the majority of the tribes in the government of the nation believed they would have a good opportunity to be heard by the new king and have their concerns taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Most think that Rehoboam was just a teenager or in his early 20’s when he came to the throne because he favoured the counsel of the young men he had grown up with. He was in fact 41 years of age and he should have had some inkling that there was unrest among the people because of the incredibly high taxation and servitude they lived under.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Jereboam who had fled to Egypt during the reign of Solomon, came back when he heard Rehoboam was about to receive the throne and he became the mouthpiece for the majority of the people. The people’s request was a simple one....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 Kings 12:4-5, ‘“Your father made our yoke hard; now therefore lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke which he put on us and we will serve you.” Then he said to them, “Depart for three days, then return to me.” So the people departed.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Like all good monarch’s Rehoboam sought the counsel of the court elders who had served Solomon and they said to him in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;verse 7, “If you will be a servant to this people today, and will serve them and grant them their petition, and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In all history, no king of any nation or people group has ever ruled as a servant for the betterment of the people except for Yeshua, the true King of Israel. This is the kind of servant leadership we who love Him are supposed to emulate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;But Rehoboam was raised, along with his cosseted friends, in a pampered and luxurious manner for which Solomon was world famous. If Rehoboam reduced the tax burden on the people, he would have to temper his lavish lifestyle – and so would his friends because his royal revenues would be much smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The advice given to Rehoboam by his friends went like this in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;verse 10, ‘The young men who grew up with him spoke to him saying, “Thus you shall say to this people who spoke to you saying, “Your father made our yoke heavy, now you make it lighter for us!” But you shall speak to them, “My little finger is thicker than my father’s loins! Whereas my father loaded you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke; my father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions.”’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;A good leader needs to be strong and firm, but abuse, threats and intimidation are not qualities that endear the faithfulness of those who are expected to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The result was that Jeroboam led a revolt, the people followed him when he said in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;verse 16, “What portion do we have in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse; to your tents O Israel! Now look after your own house David!” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This was a knee-jerk reaction against the royal line because of what Solomon had established during his rule, it wasn’t an indication of hatred toward King David because the nation had experienced the golden era under David’s leadership, flawed as he was personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Only the men of Judah who were of the same tribe as the house of David remained under Rehoboam and this actually incorporated the tribe of Benjamin as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This sparked the separation of the nation of Israel. The Northern Kingdom retained the name Israel, which was made up of the other ten tribes and was ruled by Jeroboam who we’ll look at next week. The Southern Kingdom took the name of Judah because that was the primary tribe that remained true to the house of David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Rehoboam did try to keep the nation from breaking apart, but when he sent Adoram, who was in charge of all those under forced labour, they stoned him to death and Rehoboam fled to Jerusalem and lost the unified nation from that time on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Rehoboam then amassed an army of 180,000 men in a bid to crush the revolt, but God sent the prophet Shemaiah who told him not to go to war against his brethren, because it was God Himself who had ordained the separation of the nation – God had already told Solomon this punishment would come upon his son – and as a result, the proud, haughty and arrogant young man was humbled and subdued. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(1 Kings 12)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It’s from this time that the nation of Israel remained separated until the north was destroyed by the Assyrians, and later the south was destroyed and taken into captivity by the Babylonians...but the nation of Israel never again ruled as one sovereign nation until May 14, 1948 when the modern State of Israel was born, fulfilling many, many prophecies and proving God’s Word to be absolutely true and proving that God is committed to keeping His promises to national Israel. Not because they deserve it, but because &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;God is faithful to His own Word.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Israel is a mere 64 years old and is stark evidence that God is real and His Word is perfectly true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God’s promised judgement to tear the nation from Solomon because of his wilful disobedience and implementing pagan worship within the nation itself was assured and again, God’s Word proved true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 Kings 12:15 says, ‘So the king did not listen to the people; for it was &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;a turn of events from the Lord, that He might establish His word,&lt;/span&gt; which the Lord spoke through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Every man is accountable for his deeds and actions as was Rehoboam; he knew that the taxes and work load of forced labour on his own people was wrong, and God was completely right to ensure that Rehoboam would refuse to listen to them so that He could initiate punishment on Solomon’s line for his rebellion against God’s laws. God is sovereign and He is always right and just.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God knows the hearts of all individuals and what their behaviour’s and responses will be, therefore God determines where and when each individual will be born and this ensures that every Word He says comes to pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The assuring and comforting thing for us to recognise again is that what God has said He will do, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;He will absolutely do. He will never compromise His Word and He will never break His promises, no matter who He made them to. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shalom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

6078,Home Group Notes - Solomon,"&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Solomon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: The name Solomon comes from the root word ‘shalem’ and is a derivative of the word ‘shalom’. Shalem means ‘complete and sound’ and the word shalom means peace in its broadest sense. So the combination of shalem and shalom means ‘Recompense, or fair penalty’.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;When Solomon was born, his father David named him Jedidiah after the prophet Nathan had came to him and told him that this child (Solomon) was loved by God, and the name Jedidiah means ‘Beloved of Yahweh’ or ‘Beloved of the Lord’. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(2 Samuel 12:25)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; No reason is given for why the name Jedidiah wasn’t used or why the name Solomon was used instead.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Looking at Solomon’s life from his attaining the throne with regard to his ability to dispense justice, he was unbelievably wise and dispensed justice in such a way that it stunned the masses and his fame spread throughout the then known world.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Solomon was the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; son to David and Bathsheba, almost everything we know about Solomon comes from the Biblical record. What’s really stunning is that archaeology confirms the Biblical record confirming its accuracy and trustworthiness.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There are 5 things about Solomon that he is famous or infamous for.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;His wives and concubines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;His wisdom beyond human capacity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;His wealth and power beyond measure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;The building of the Holy Temple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;His apostasy in his elder years &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;You can read about the life of Solomon in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 Kings and 2 Chronicles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;His ascent to the throne was pretty shaky, David had promised Bathsheba that Solomon would succeed him, but before David died of old age, his son Adonijah declared himself king. Adonijah was David’s 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; son and he claimed to be the rightful heir to the throne. When news was brought to David that Adonijah was usurping him and making a public declaration of taking the throne and declaring himself king, David ordered the priests to anoint Solomon as king at the Gihon Spring thus making Solomon the ruling monarch of Israel. Not the usual practice...usually, a king had to be dead before the successor was crowned. By making this move, David himself was declaring publicly and before God with the blessing of the priests that Solomon – not Adonijah – was the heir to the throne.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Once king, Solomon still had some opposition from within the military and the priesthood and from Adonijah himself, there was some subterfuge which Solomon very quickly put down. He also dealt with 2 long time enemies of king David.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The first – Joab – who had been very loyal to David, but wrongfully killed two men (Abner &amp;amp; Amasa) out of his own vengeful heart, he also killed David’s son Absalom after David repeatedly said he was to be kept alive, and he also sided with Adonijah’s bid for the throne...you see if Adonijah had became king and then died, Joab would have apparently been his successor. Joab didn’t know that David had already decided that Solomon would succeed to the throne after him.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The second – Shimei – the forefather of Mordecai whom we learned about last week. David’s mercy upon Shimei meant that Mordecai was born and was therefore in the right place with Esther to ensure that the Jews were saved when their annihilation order was set in motion under Haman during the rule of the Persian Empire. Shimei’s treason was eventually dealt with.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Abiather the priest also sided with Adonijah and Solomon had him banished. This meant that with these potential enemies gone, Solomon was able to ensure that his reign would be smooth and without internal attempts to either dethrone or murder him.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Solomon was very young at the beginning of his rule, and in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 Kings 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, he had a dream in which God Himself spoke to Solomon and said, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Ask what you wish Me to give you.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Can you imagine God asking any man that question? What would most men ask for? Solomon’s response was firstly to acknowledge that God had shown great kindness to his father David, and that God had been gracious to David by giving him a son to rule after him. This wasn’t an ego trip, because Solomon went on to say, I’m the son You gave to David but I’m like a little child in comparison. I don’t know anything about ruling a nation. All I really want is for You to give me an understanding heart to rule the people well and to be able to discern between good and evil.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God was so pleased with Solomon for seeking wisdom and righteous judgement from God instead of wealth, health, long life, possessions....that God said He would give all these to Solomon anyway...along with great wisdom and discernment.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Let’s look at the main things Solomon was known for....&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wives and concubines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;For all Solomon’s wisdom, he showed a major flaw in his character and in his trust of God. Solomon was undoubtedly a womaniser, but most of his wives were for political expediency. He made a habit of marrying foreign wives in order to bring about political alliances with nations that might otherwise become enemies and Solomon didn’t want war with anyone.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;So instead of trusting God for the security of his nation, Solomon sought peace through marriage. But these marriages were in direct opposition to God’s instructions. We learned last week that in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;Deuteronomy 17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, God said that future kings were not to accumulate wives. God was also very explicit that His people were not to marry foreign wives...why? Because foreign wives would entice them into idolatry, worshipping foreign gods.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Solomon accumulated 700 wives and 300 concubines. If he had dinner with a different wife every night, he would have only seen each of them once every 2 years and 7 months!!!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wisdom beyond human capacity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There are many examples in the Scripture to demonstrate Solomon’s wisdom; one of the most extreme is the story of the 2 prostitutes who came to Solomon regarding the legal status of a baby boy. They had both had a baby each and in the night one mother rolled on top of her baby and killed it. She got up and swapped the babies over. When the other woman woke up, she realised that the baby in her bed was dead but also that it wasn’t hers.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;With no DNA testing in the time of Solomon, how could the king give a righteous judgement. He shocked them and the entire court by asking for a sword...he was going to cut the baby in two and give each of the woman half. The false mother was ok with this, while the real mother, who couldn’t bear for her child to die, wept and said she would willingly surrender her baby just so long as he wasn’t killed. The heart of a real mother would sacrifice herself and her rights to protect her child and Solomon knew exactly which woman was the rightful mother of the baby boy. The news of this spread throughout the nation.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Solomon composed over 3000 proverbs and 1005 songs. He wrote the books of Song of Solomon, Proverbs and Ecclesiastes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;His wisdom was so famous that the Queen of Sheba travelled from the southern region of Arabia. Arabia was rich in gold, frankincense and myrrh, among many other things that Solomon wanted to obtain, and the Queen of Sheba needed Solomon’s co-operation in marketing her country’s goods. She brought him many gifts and quizzed him with many questions and riddles and was astounded by his answers and responses.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wealth and power beyond measure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Solomon’s national borders extended from the Euphrates River in the north to Egypt in the south. This means that in the days of Solomon, Israel’s borders reached into what is today southern Turkey, most of Syria &amp;nbsp;and about a 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; of Iraq and probably most of what we know as modern Jordan and down into the northern part of Saudi Arabia.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;He owned 12,000 horses plus the horsemen who rode them and 1400 chariots. The ruins of Solomon’s famed stables are in Tel Megiddo and the stalls could house 450 horses. I’ve walked through them. (Again, accumulating horses is something &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deuteronomy 17&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; also prohibited) He established Israelite colonies around his provinces to look after military, administrative and commercial interests and he divided the nation into 12 districts with Judah constituting its own political unit with certain additional privileges.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The building of the Holy Temple&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;To build the Holy Temple Solomon began with a humungous amount of gold, silver and other materials that he’d inherited from his father. He got wood (cedar) from Lebanon, and had stone cut from quarries and once the cutting and carving was complete it was covered with pure gold.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;History tells us that the temple was so magnificent that when people first saw it, it would take their breath away. When the sun rose and set, the sun would reflect off the structure and it would look like it was on fire because of the shine upon the gold.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;He was also renown for other buildings as well. He spent 13 years building his own palace, the city wall, the citadel which was called the Millo, a palace for the daughter of Pharaoh who was one of his wives, obviously a favourite wife and many facilities for foreign traders. He built cities for chariots and horsemen and he build enormous storage cities. He extended Jerusalem to the north and fortified cities near the mountains of Judea and Jerusalem as well.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He became apostate and didn’t live according to his own wisdom and the truth of God&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The saddest part of Solomon’s story is that he became apostate at the end. It hardly seems possible considering the gift of wisdom and discernment given to him by God in such great measure. In his latter years, after he had built magnificent structures, indulged his physical senses with every pleasure known to man, ate only the choicest foods and denied himself absolutely nothing, he was utterly dissatisfied. In Ecclesiastes he goes into great detail to list everything he ever did, every indulgence he granted himself and at the end of it all, he claimed it was nothing but vanity.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The real undoing of Solomon however was because of his many wives. It becomes seriously apparent why God says one wife and not a foreign wife. Without a constant loving family relationship with just one wife, each of his wives - hundreds of wives were left neglected, lonely, unloved, feeling they were nothing more than a convenience for political purposes – which is exactly what they were – feelings of jealousy between the favourites and the convenient ones, - they hardly ever saw him and it’s little wonder they wanted to continue in their pagan religions. With so many whinging wives, it’s no wonder Solomon capitulated and allowed them to establish pagan altars and shrines and places to practice their idolatry in public and when they invited him to participate with them, he willingly did so and the Bible says that it was his many foreign wives who turned the heart of Solomon to apostasy.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;This is a critically important lesson in why we are not to be unequally yolked or joined together...one will always pull the other away. If you’re already married to an unbeliever, pray and seek God for your spouse and be vigilant to keep your heart close to God through the power of God the Holy Spirit and the wisdom and guidance and power of the Word.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Solomon - such a wise man – it is easily seen how a sinful human heart can be so easily corrupted. In order to gain more wealth, he imposed heavy taxes on his own people, he had the civilian population work as soldiers, officers and commanders of his chariots and cavalry. He granted special privileges to the tribe of Judah which alienated the remaining tribes and he never appears to repent in Scripture.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;For all intents and purposes, Solomon knew who the True and Living God was, he wanted God’s assistance and He acknowledged God’s faithfulness to his father David, he wanted to be a good ruler who was just but absolute power corrupts absolutely. He sought the benefits and the help and assistance from God, but never sought to love and know God as his father David had. That’s the difference. Solomon knew God was good to have around...David highest goal was to know and love and worship God.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Solomon was a sensual man who lived to indulge his every whim. He denied himself nothing and in order to gain even more than he had. He eventually gave his heart to idolatry and the punishment came when his son came to the throne after him and followed in his father’s footsteps and lost the nation completely. It split in two and all his son was left with was Judah and Benjamin ruling from Jerusalem.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It just goes to show that the human heart can never be trusted no matter what gifts or blessings God gives.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jeremiah 17:9 says, ‘The heart is more deceitful than all else and is desperately sick; who can understand it?’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genesis 6:5 says, ‘Then the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark 7:21-23, Jesus said,&amp;nbsp; ‘For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries, deeds of coveting and wickedness, as well as deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride and foolishness. All these evil things proceed from within and defile the man.’ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;So the lesson we learn from Solomon’s life is that blessing from God doesn’t mean relationship with God. Gifts from God don’t equal a relationship with God.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Here in our culture, we equate blessing, wealth, health, material possessions as being in good standing with God but it doesn’t mean that at all. In fact, having all these things can actually be a curse because they become the focus of our love and attention and desires and actually turn our heart away from God...they distract us and God becomes obsolete.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem is with the heart of man&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, we are utterly corrupt and it takes nothing less than the Spirit of God to transform us from being evil and unregenerate to being righteous and a brand new creature. When that supernatural event takes place when a person comes to a true and saving faith in Christ through repentance and faith, then the regeneration of the heart takes place and the transforming process commences.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Those who turn away – even if they appeared gifted and blessed and said and did all the right things – were never truly saved to begin with. It’s possible for people to be actively committed to a Christian ethos and church community and never really know Christ.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 Corinthians 13:5, Paul said, ‘Test yourselves to see if you are in the faith; examine yourselves! Or do you not recognise this about yourselves; that Jesus Christ is in you, unless indeed you fail the test.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;A sobering end to Home Group today but so very important that we do as Paul instructed and examine ourselves to see what the condition of our heart is really like. What are our desires? What do we love? Who do we live to please? What are our goals?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Don’t measure your relationship with God by how blessed or gifted or how popular or clever you are or how busy and active you are in your local church family; Solomon was all those things and more and he failed the test. I would suggest that we measure our own lives by the life of Paul who was the greatest Christian, the greatest preacher/teacher and the greatest evangelist who ever lived...remember he even told Timothy to imitate him in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 Timothy 3:10-12&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There is too much at stake to simply assume that our relationship with God is hunky-dory because after all...we’re under grace...it’s all under the blood. Remember, the heart is ‘deceitful’ and it will lie to you. Measure your life against the Word of God and what it says a true believer looks, thinks, talks and behaves like, not what other people tell us a believer looks, thinks, talks and behaves like.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Shalom&lt;/div&gt;

6021,Home Group Notes - David Pt 2,"&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;David Pt 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;: Over the last couple of weeks we’ve been looking at the first half of King David’s life...that is, his life before he came to the throne. This week we’ll look at David’s life after he claimed the throne.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;David’s story can be found in &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;1 Samuel 16 to the end of 1 Samuel, all of 2 Samuel, the first 2 chapters of 1 Kings and 1 Chronicles 2, 10-29.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Last week we concluded with David living in the wilderness with his personal army; he did very good things for his people and defended and protected them well. Even when he was living with the Philistines pretending to be an enemy of Israel who had defected, he never undermined his own people.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;When he heard the news that Saul and Jonathan were dead, he mourned for them greatly and never once did David bad-mouth or criticise Saul.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Initially, David became king of Judah (King of his own tribe) and Hebron becomes his capital for 7½ years and then David conquered Jerusalem and was publically anointed king over all Israel.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;There are far too many instances in David’s life to mention in our brief time for Home Group but we can look at a couple of very significant things about David’s life.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;He had too many wives.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;In &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;Deuteronomy 17:14-17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Moses prophesied to the people that when they entered the Promised Land they would demand a king to be like the other nations. God stipulated that all future kings were not allowed to accumulate horses for themselves (power) or gold and silver (personal wealth) or wives (immorality and compromise).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;David had 8 named wives in the Scripture: Michal, Ahinoam, Abigail, Maachah, Haggith, Abital, Eglah, Bathsheba. It’s believed that there were more who were not named, but we know for certain he had 8 wives.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;David had 5 children by Bathsheba, the first died. He had 16 children born from his other wives and concubines.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This penchant for women set a seriously dangerous precedent as we’ll see when we look at Solomon, and it was in direct contrast to God’s Word. David loved God...so why did God allow David to have multiple wives?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;We human beings are always ready to point the finger at God and accuse Him of being a dictator, or a kill-joy, or of wanting to control and manipulate people; that He’s so restrictive and says everything we want to do will lead to sin, but we never think it will happen t us!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;God said not to accumulate wives or wealth...how would we know what the consequences are if no one ever accumulated wives and wealth. God sets the standard and then allows men to make their decisions and then we can see that God was right all the time. His standards and rules are good and are in place for our benefit. When we ignore God, there are consequences and we can’t say that God is unfair for allowing these things to happen...He has already warned us what is right and wrong. If He doesn’t allow us to choose what we want to do, men call Him a dictator...if He does allow us to choose, men call Him unloving because He didn’t stop disaster from taking place.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;David was a man who loved God right down to the very depths of his heart and look at the turmoil that came into his life because of his desire for women...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Too many siblings and too many wives breeds competition...who is the favourite wife and who are the favourite children. (Rachel and Leah are also good examples of this and then of course Joseph was Jacob’s favourite son by Rachel and look what happened to him)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Then there was incest and rape between his son Amnon against his half-sister Tamar. Then his son Absalom plotted against and murdered his half brother Amnon for raping his sister Tamar and then had to live in exile. After he was allowed back to the city, he then plotted the overthrow of his own father’s throne. When David was close to death, his Adonijah tried to take the throne also despite the fact that David had already declared Solomon would be his successor.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;His adultery with Bathsheba lead to the death of his first child with her, not to mention that he contrived to make her husband Uriah think the child she was carrying was his and when that doesn’t work (because Uriah was more faithful than David), rather than confess his sin David arranged for Uriah’s murder.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;David did accumulate wealth but admittedly, he donated humungous amounts toward the building and construction costs of the Temple that Solomon would build. But he had enormous wealth left over for his heirs.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;David did many good things and in most ways, he was a very good man and a good king, but he also did many wicked and self-indulgent things. When you compare David to Saul, you see two very different men.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;It appears that Saul had one wife and one concubine. He had 6 children with his wife and 3 children with his concubine. While he gathered the most skilled men around him, it doesn’t appear that he went out of his way to accumulate wealth.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The real difference between Saul and David however, was that while David appeared to be a bigger sinner than Saul, David’s heart was quick to be contrite, he was always quick to admit and confess his sin, he always felt remorse and sorrow for his sin.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Even when Nathan the prophet told him the story of the poor man and the rich man who took his only sheep from him so he didn’t have to kill any of his own many sheep, David was incensed at the injustice of it and was immediately remorseful when Nathan said to him &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;“You are the man!” (2 Samuel 12:7)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, he was in fact talking about him and his sin with Bathsheba and the murder of Uriah.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;There is another important incident that happened in David’s life and emphasises the principle of ‘consequences’.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Not only did David’s sin bring shocking and painful consequences into his own family, but there are good consequences from some of David’s choices as well.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;For example, in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 Samuel 16&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, when Absalom attempted to overthrow David and take the throne for himself, David and his entire court – with the exception of a few to maintain things in the palace – left Jerusalem to find security and on the way they encountered a man named Shimei and Shimei came out cursing David, calling him names. Shimei was a descendant of Saul.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;When the security men around David heard these insults against their king, they wanted to kill Shimei for his treasonous behaviour but David wouldn’t let them. David noted the sovereignty of God in all situations and extended mercy to Shimei.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Do you know who was a descendent of Shimei? None other than Mordechai, the cousin of Queen Esther. How important was Mordechai to the unfolding events in Ancient Persia when Esther was made Queen and their people were about to be slaughtered because of evil Haman? We mentioned when we talked about King Saul’s disobedience in not killing king Agag of the Amalekites and the fact that it resulted in the birth of Haman.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;If Saul had been obedient, Haman would never have been born. But if David hadn’t been merciful, Mordechai would never have been born. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The two most important things I’ve learned from David’s life (and there are vastly more than 2) is that every action has a consequence and those consequences can have far reaching effects on many, many people. David’s sins of immorality impacted his family tragically and they never recovered. Also, in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 Samuel 24&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, when David numbered the people, the consequence was a pestilence that killed 70,000 people throughout the land.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;In contrast, David’s abundant and enthusiastic worship and adoration of God publically brought great blessing and favour on David, the people and the land as well as incredible success against his enemies because of God’s Spirit being with him.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;David’s mercy and faithfulness to Saul, despite being constantly on the run and living under constant threat of death, brought about the enduring line of David eventuating with Messiah.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;David’s mercy toward Shimei resulted in the birth of Mordechai who along with Esther, brought deliverance of the Jewish people in Ancient Persia when they were threatened with annihilation.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The second really important lesson of King David’s life is that he was ALWAYS quick to confess his sin, admit his guilt and repent. Unlike Saul who constantly tried to squirm out of taking responsibility or blaming others for his sin, David would immediately confess and fall on the mercy of God.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;David was far from perfect, in fact David was a very great sinner, and yet David’s rule is known as the Golden Age of Ancient Israel...this is stunning when you consider the depravity within David’s own household and the anarchy that impacted the throne and the royal court.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;But because David’s heart was always to please God despite his own failings and failures, God promised again and again that David’s line would endure for all time, and that through David’s line, the Messiah of the whole world would come from him.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;In a nutshell, to be like David – a man with a heart after God’s own heart – we need to pursue the following attributes:-&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be quick to confess and admit our sin and repent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be quick to extend mercy, grace and forgiveness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be slow to dish out vengeance and retribution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember that every single action we take has a consequence for both good and bad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultivate a heart that desires to please God above all else.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shalom&lt;/p&gt;

5862,Home Group Notes - David Pt 1,"&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;David Pt 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: In all the Bible, there is only one person who goes by the name David and the meaning of this word is quite long and complex because its Hebrew roots are complex. It can mean ‘beloved’ or ‘uncle’, and a derivative also means infirmity, sick or unclean, although these last meanings are somewhat unfounded and not part of the original meanings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;David was known as Israel’s ‘beloved’ king, which would validate the initial meaning of this name, but his life was consistently marred with grief and drama. He personally was vilified, accused of treason, was hunted like an animal and had his life threatened numerous times. Because of his sin his family was tainted with immorality, murder, incest and rape, treason and betrayal. So beloved and sick or unclean are both very good adjectives that apply to David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;We’ll look at David’s life next week as well but this week we’ll look at his life prior to becoming king, and look at only a few situations. To get the full picture of David’s life, what he did and who he interacted will you can read his story beginning in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 Samuel 16 to the end of 1 Samuel, all of 2 Samuel, the first 2 chapters of 1 Kings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;and 1 Chronicles 2, 10-29.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In short, David began his life as a humble, faithful and unassuming young man. He was the youngest of 8 sons, he was a good looking young guy but being the youngest he had no social standing or influence. He was not the heir to his father’s estate and therefore, he was not wealthy. He was a young shepherd boy who spent his time out in the fields looking after the flocks of his father Jesse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Samuel came to town one day and is directed by God to the house of Jesse and promptly tells this man that God has chosen one of his sons to be the next king of Israel. Jesse presents his eldest son to Samuel...and subsequently each of his other sons from eldest to youngest...however, David was of such insignificant position within the family that he wasn’t even mentioned. It’s as if he didn’t exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Samuel is puzzled, he knows God has told him to anoint one of Jesse’s sons, they’re strong, powerfully built, having all the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Picking up from last week where we learned that in the very first early years of Saul’s monarchy he wasn’t so bad, he wasn’t great but he wasn’t full of himself...yet. His fall from reality and humility came pretty quickly however...after his first victory over the Amorites his decline was quite quick and steep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;First battle against the Philistines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 Samuel 13&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; we read about the Philistines gathering for battle against Israel and many of the Israelites were terrified of this formidable foe. The Philistines were particularly barbaric and cruel and Israel had no real weaponry for defence and a host of Jews fled and hid themselves. The Philistines had 30,000 chariots, 6,000 horsemen and soldiers in number like the sand on the seashore...to an unarmed people they were terrifying. Saul and his son Jonathan however managed to gather 3000 men to fight with them and Saul was feeling the pressure of leading this tiny band of men into battle against impossible odds...he needed to hear from God. He had contacted Samuel and received word back to wait for the Prophet’s arrival which would be in 7 days time, at which point Samuel would offer the burnt offering and then receive instruction from God as to how they were to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verses 8-11 says, ‘Now he waited seven days, according to the appointed time set by Samuel, but Samuel did not come to Gilgal; and the people were scattering from him. So Saul said, “Bring to me the burnt offering and the peace offerings.” And he offered the burnt offering. As soon as he finished offering the burnt offering behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him and to greet him. But Samuel said, “What have you done?”.....’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;God’s rules for the monarchy and the priesthood and for prophets were very different and the role of priest and king were not allowed to cross over. Kings were not allowed to perform the rituals of priests and priests were not allowed to assume&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Saul&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; The Hebrew pronunciation is Sha'ul and comes from the verb sha’el which means to ask, inquire, borrow or beg. Many godly men throughout the Scriptures ‘inquired’ of the Lord, but Saul showed his weak and shallow character when he tried to contact the Prophet Samuel after the prophets death, through the witch of Endor, begging Samuel to give him guidance because God was against him and gave him no direction at all. Most Bible helps believe the name Saul simply means ‘prayed for’ or ‘asked for’ however there is a little more depth to this name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;For all intents and purposes, Saul wasn’t such a bad guy in his early years and there’s a lot in the Bible about him that we can learn. This week we're looking at the first half and we'll look at the second half of Saul’s life next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The life story of Saul begins in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 Samuel 9&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and goes through to &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;chapter 31&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Samuel speaks to the people and in essense says, ok, you want a king over you to be like the rest of the nations....he gives them a rebuking lecture about the fact that they already have a KING...God is their king...and they’re rejecting God in preference to a human king and God was actually very angry about it. In fact, God was so angry, that in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;13:16-18&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at Samuel’s word, God sent thunder and rain – totally out of season - to show how angry He was and the people were really frightened. The people responded with repentance and God said they could still have their human king but that they were to remain faithful to Him and God would continue to lead them through a human king so long as they and their king served Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 Sam 9&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, we first learn about Saul. He was of the tribe of Benjamin, his father’s name was Kish – who was reasonably wealthy...he had servants and livestock which equated to wealth and substance in those days - and Kish sent Saul and his&lt;/p&gt;
